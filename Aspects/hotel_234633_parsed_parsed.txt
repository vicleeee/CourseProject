<Content>Bang for the Buck! We found this hotel through tripadvisor. In our slang, no horse run. This place offers the best value for money. If you are looking to pay for things you do not need, then it's better you look across the street for another hotel.We were greeted by the staff at the reception, one of them Jean-Louis (hope i spelt it correctly). I did not manage to get the name of the other staff. They were most friendly and helpful. Jean-Louis even took the effort to orientate us to Paris, informing us on the what not to miss. He even drew the paths on the maps, mapping out the areas and the routes. As he noticed i brought along my young daughter, he quickly put the hotel's name card in her pocket, just in case she got lost. The service here is definitely top notch.Now for the room. Nothing fanciful, just a comfortable bed and a newly refurbished shower. And the room+shower was very clean. To us, this was what was necessary, as we would not be spending 24 hrs in the room. The free wifi was definitely a big plus as well. I have no idea why some hotels still do not provide this for their customers. Perhaps this is what separates the wheat from the chaff.Location wise, this is situated near to both porte malliot metro and rec, which is most convenient. As you can get around Paris via metro and rer, it is vital you stay around them.As the title states, this cosy hotel definitely provides bang for the buck!

<Content>Great Staff  I just spent 3 nights in Hotel residence Foch  I must say I was pleasently surprised. The staff were excellent- very friendly  could not have been more attentive,recommending excellent restaurants nearby etc. The hotel itself is located on a quiet side street where a number of Embassies are located. 2 metro stops are within a 3 minute walk. The rooms are typical of most european boutique hotels - being on the smaller side, however they were well equipped with safe, minibar etc. when I return to Paris, I will definitely return to the Residence Foch where I know the staff look after their guests rather than in some impersonal hotel chain.

<Content>If you want clean, comfortable rooms for an affordable price in Paris then you should book this nice little family hotel. With three stars, you should not expect the most luxurious or spacious room in Paris, but a nice, clean room at an affordable price. This hotel is located in the upscale 16 th district, very close to the Parisian subway (Porte Maillot) and walking distance to the Arc de Triomphe and even the Tour Eiffel (25 mins). If any American still wants to use the adage the French are rude,  he ought to stay at this hotel. The people are extremely helpful and very friendly; Nelly (the owner) and her staff will accommodate any of your needs and desires in whatever language you speak (they're fluent in English, Spanish and even French!). It is rare that I have encountered a similar experience in the US. So, if you're heading to Paris, look into residence Foch, if you want to enjoy the city more than your hotel room.

<Content>Welcoming Hotel I booked three nights at Hotel Residence Foch due to the positive reviews on here. My friend and I were not disappointed. As soon as we arrived, we were warmly greeted. Our room was comfortable and very clean.The hotel is very close to Ave Foch, a beautiful avenue with very presigious residences and lined with chesnut trees which leads up to the Arc de Triomphe. We used the Port Dauphine metro to get where we wanted, which was only a few minutes walk.The staff at the hotel were friendly and welcoming. They were extremely helpful when my friend had her wallet stolen on the RER. They helped us to find the police and even offered to translate for us. They spoke excellent English.

<Content>Superb Staff Make This Hotel One Of The Best Discovered this hotel via trip adviser and was impressed by its reviews. In reality it matched up to all that was said in its favour. We arrived to discover our room had been upgraded to a suite free of charge and to find that the truly charming staff were completely geared to ensuring our stay was great. Their charming, patient response to my very rusty, cobwebbed use of the French language was absolutely delightful. Centrally located the hotel has much to offer. Despite its close proximity to the Champs Elysees and Arc de Triomphe, it was incredibly quiet with no traffic noise and guests encouraged to respect the request for quietness after 10p.m.This was a truly wonderful trip and the hotel an amazing find - chiefly because of its attentive, yet not intrusive, lovely staff.Thank you all. We'll most certainly be back.

<Author>a visitor from ireland
<Content>friendly quaint hotel Friendly and helpful staff are the real selling point of this hotel! The rooms are pretty, very clean and comfortable and were lovely and cosy during the cold weather. It is set in a great location within easy walk of either Porte Maillot or Porte Dauphine metro stations, both with frequent trains to the centre. The surrounding area is nice and quiet with a selection of good restaurants nearby. Breakfast was fine with a better selection than most European private hotels. Serving staff were so efficient and offered more tea/coffee regularly while trying to accomodate other guests needs. Yet again, the reviewers on Trip Advisor got it right. Great choice for visiting Paris. For good food: Try La Griottine, rue de Sfax (a la carte or menu option of 鈧?7 for 3 courses, excellent food, 10 mins walk from hotel). We also ate in Del Papa (Italian - tasty) and Bistro Saint Ferdinand on recommendation of the hotel and both were excellent.

<Content>A friendly, comfortable hotel in a great location Hotel Foch really contributed to an amazing stay in Paris and we would definitely recommend it to both business and personal travellers alike.- Charming rooms, comfortable and well-equipped- Good location in the western part of town - close to the tube and Arc de Triomph/La Defense business district, in pleasant residential street- All of the staff we met were extremely helpful and personable - the service being the best we have encountered in all of Europe- Breakfasts were pleasant and enjoyable in comfortable surroundings Note, the hotel is located within an old, character building so it is not very sound-proof and very light sleepers should be aware that noise from other guests is audible within rooms.Look forward to returning as soon as we can!

<Author>Welltravelled4
<Content>one night stay We decided to visit our beloved Paris for one Saturday night as a birthday treat for my husband. Travelled Easyjet from Bristol which is always (in our experience) very good.As, unfortunately, we could only manage one night, we decided to stay near the 'Air France' coach drop off at the Arc du Triumphe. The Hotel Residence Foch is actually a 20 - 25 minute walk so not quite as near as we thought. We sifted through the Tripadvisor reports and selected this hotel as it looked lovely and we were not wrong. We requested double room no. 62 as had seen photos of this on a previous review - lovely room with large balcony overlooking the street but very quiet as so high up. The bathroom was also very nice with good shower with closing doors (no bath).The breakfast was just ok in my opinion, and when we asked for more coffee we were only brought enough for one person. There could have been a larger selection of breads and pastries. But anyway, the breakfast area was pleasant enough  with the classical music playing it made it quite relaxing.Don't think we'd stay here next time, prefer the Opera Quarter.....

<Content>Stay here it's great for a short break Stayed here for 3 nights. Spotlessly clean, warm, quiet, nicely decorated. Friendly and knowledgable staff.Room quite spacious for Paris.Good residential area 5 mins from the metro which is the line covering most of the main attractions,Louvre,Tuilerie gardens,Champs - Elysees, Arc de Triomph etc.Saw recommendation on trip advisor and not disappointed.The only slight drawback was the awkward shower screen above the small bath which made access a bit difficult. Would have been better to get rid of the bath.

<Content>Great hotel, excellent service Unfortunately only got to spend one night at the Hotel Residence Foch , our last night after a months holiday in Europe. Great service we were warmly welcomed. Shade gave us great advice on last minute shopping spots and restaurants with live music for our last night in Paris. We were upgraded to a suite and the suite was spacious and spotlessly clean. Definitely recommend it as a place to stay.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel My wife and I stayed at Residence Foch for 6 nights and everything was perfect. In a great location, quiet neighborhood (very safe),within walking distance to Eiffel Tower, Champs de Elysee and easy access to the Metro and the RER stations (to go to Versailles for example). The room was very clean and had everything we needed. The bathroom was spotless too. It was a non-smooking room on the 2nd floor, with a small balcony.Breakfast was very good. The service was excellent and the staff (so many thanks Chedi and Nelly) were warm and always happy to help.We can highly recommend this Hotel!!!Thanks for our perfect saty in Paris.Rodrigo and Isabela (Brazil)

<Content>Family Hotel, Residence Hotel Foch Paris We stayed here on our way back to UK for 3 nights and were impressed with the friendly and quite 'close' ambience. No winding step staircase to an upper room here - but a proper lift! And a waiter who 'runs' around the tables at breakfast and obviously enjoys having you in his dining room. A word of caution about the local directions - if getting off the metro at Port Mailleau, make sure you have your bearings on the way in - we came out after a night at Moulon Rouge and got hopelessly lost finally getting a cab 400m home! Head to St Germaine - shops cafes markets fantastic!

<Content>Perfect hotel Just returned from 3 night stay in Paris and my second visit to Residence Foch. If you want to stay in a smaller type, privately owned hotel, then this is the one. For a capital city prices are fair and the location is ideal, situated in a quiet residential area only 5 minutes walk from Porte Maillot or Argentine metro stations, or a 10 minute walk to Arc de Triomphe and 15 mins walk to Eiffel Tower. Staff are so helpful and all speak good english. Rooms are big enough and spotlessly clean. Continental buffet breakfast is very good and available until 10.30 a.m. Only slightly adverse comment is that some floorboards creak and you can occasionaly hear people walking about in upstairs room or walking up the stairs if you have a room by them. I would definately recommend Residence Foch and will stay there again.Harry, Leeds, UK

<Content>The essens of lovely Paris We where four people staying at the Hotel Foch at the end of october, and let me just say it was perfect. The hotel and its exclusive neighborhood made our trip something special. There are very easy to get aroud the city from here and the Champs-脡lys茅es are just a few minutes away from the lovely hotel entrance. At the Hotel Foch u stay in a central and quiet with among other a real prince as youre neighbor. But its not the hotel or the neighborhood that makes this the perfect hotel experience...its the staff. We have lived at hotels in Paris with the double rate of the Hotel Foch, but the service and the homey feeling wheren麓t close to what Nelly and her excellent staff gave us 24/7. A state of the art example for other hotels. This is our home in Paris!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! My husband and I were so impressed with our stay at Hotel Residence Foch! The concierge and staff were so friendly and helpful. The location was great, next to Le Bois de Boulogne which was a good option for morning runs. Close to Metro/Train station, and walking distance to Arc du Triomphe and Champs-Elys茅es. It's in a quiet area, not the bustle of the Latin Quarter. The room was small but clean, with a nice-sized bathroom. Highly recommended, and we would be happy to stay there again.

<Content>Wow. This hotel , perfectly placed in Paris for any sight seeing worth seeing is just perfect in every way, clean spacious rooms, polite and respectful staff and English speaking if your language skills are typically British like mine.Great places to eat nearby and a great place to stay do that you are close to the parisian nightlife.Recommended.

<Content>Genuinely Recommended This was my first visit to Paris and I was therefore keen to choose a hotel that had been highly recommended - the Hotel Foch has certainly been that on Trip Advisor and now I can see why.It is located in a quiet, seemingly high class district of Paris that is convenient for both the Metro and the RER.The best thing about the place however is the staff who are both friendly and appear genuinely keen to help and/or offer any advice required.Having selected a standard room, it was understandably small being a city centre location, it was however clean and included a bath too.Overall the Hotel Foch represented good value (拢133 a night for two people in a double room) for what is unquestionably an expensive city to stay in

<Content>Home From Home We can highly recommend this Hotel. In a great, quiet location, within easy access to the Metro and the RER stations. A real home from home experience. From the minute we arrived we received an excellent, friendly and most helpful service.The room was relatively small yet perfectly adequate. It was extremely clean, (I鈥檓 fussy about clean!) comfortable with air con if required and very pleasantly decorated. A bright, modern en-suite bathroom with complimentary toiletries was cleaned daily to perfection by the housekeeping staff.Reception could not do enough to ensure you were equipped with all the necessary information to ensure you made the most of your time in Paris from supplying detailed mapping of the area and travel routes to a host of recommended restaurants three of which we sampled within very close proximity to the hotel and were not disappointed with.A lovely continental buffet breakfast awaited you every morning until 10.30am, great if you鈥檙e not the earliest of risers! This part of the hotel was also beautifully presented, a lovely little area, pleasantly decorated with very attentive but not intrusive staff. Everyone was so polite and 鈥榓t your service鈥? All in all a lovely part of our stay in Paris! We鈥檇 have no hesitation in booking Hotel Residence Foch should we find ourselves looking at a trip to Paris in the future.

<Content>Lovely hotel After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor we decided to try the Residence Foch for a weekend in Paris and we were not dissappointed. Extremely attentive and helpful staff and a lovely room (a bit on the small side, but quite sufficient). We thought the location might be a bit far off but it was very good actually. Several Metro and RER stations close by and walking distance to the Champs Elysee. The neighbourhood is very pretty and the streets silent at night, which is seldom the case in Paris.For those who bring their running shoes on their holiday; the Bois de Boulogne is the perfect choice for your morning jog.

<Content>lovely hotel and staff We stayed at this hotel 3rd to 8th september and it was really lovely. The hotel staff were all so helpfull and friendly and happy. A special thank you to the reception staff who were really lovely. The hotel is very nice ,very clean and nicely kept .Its very conveniently placed for most of the main attraction and the area is very safe and theres numerous cafes and restaurants which are very good Del Pappa is Italian and theres another one which is also very good but we cant remember its name,its in a road called Avenue Malakoff , but you will fined all you need. Theres also some very good boulangeries in the area if you fancy some good cakes etc. We will definitely return to this hotel, and would recommend it, you should book early if you go though as its very popular .

The welcome we received was very warm  very helpful. The twin room we had was more than adequate and very clean. The hotel is in a quiet residential area within a 10 minute walk of Champs Elysee. The reception recommended a fantastic restaurant only 5 minute walk from the hotel which was great value for money.

<Content>Delightful! A good location close to the Champs de Elyse and within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower. In a quiet neighborhood, the rooms are nice and the hotel is charming and quiet. The best part of the stay is the wonderful man at the front desk who has the best tips for visiting Paris. He is delightful!

<Content>Lovely hotel and lovely people Stayed for 4 nights from the 3rd August, with my girlfriend. Our room was lovely with a large bathroom which was spotless. The neighbourhood was very quiet and our short walk to the Champs-elysees every morning was great to get to all the sights. The service was excellent and the people were warm and always happy to help. Thanks for making our perfect stay in Paris very comfortable!

<Content>Wonderful little hotel with an exceptional staff. We stayed in a family suite (quad room) in July 2008. The room was about the size of two regular European hotel rooms with one bathroom. It had one king bed (two twins pushed together actually) and two other separate beds - a cot and a day bed. It really was perfect for us - a family of 4 with kids ages 8, 11. The location is OK - a 5 to 10 minute walk to the metro station with restaurants and grocery markets close by. The Arc de Triumph is a 10 minute walk and the Eiffel Tour 20 minutes. We had to take the metro to the Louvre and Notre Dame areas.  The breakfast, although is an additional cost, was very good - your typical European breakfast with breads, pastries, yogurt, cereal, meat, cheese, dried fruit, and boiled eggs. The service at this hotel is perhaps the best service I have received in any hotel including many 5 star hotels I have stayed at. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly and I can't say enough good things about every single employee I encountered.  In summary, there might be places to stay that are a bit closer to the main attractions, but the price (180 Euros for a family of 4 in high season) and more important, the staff, make this hotel highly recommended by our family!

<Content>Cozy and Cute Hotel My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Foch and absolutely loved it. The hotel is cozy and comfortable and our room was great. The room and the bathroom were both clean and comfortable. The breakfast was also great. The staff is very friendly and extremely helpful with answering all of our questions. The hotel is within 10 minutes walking distance of two metro stops and is located in a quiet safe neighborhood.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel!!!! This hotel is wonderful! Located in a quiet up-scale Paris neighborhood, this charming boutique hotel is conveniently located close to the Metro and a variety of shops and restaurants. The rooms are spacious, beautifully decorated, and well appointed. The staff was friendly and could not have been more helpful. We will definitely plan on a return stay the next time we are in Paris.

<Content>Friendly, and all the basics done very well. The first thing I noticed when checking in was a large sign on the reception desk saying if you like this hotel, please write a review on tripadvisor.com. Well, it's pretty obvious that lots of people like this hotel, and after 3 days there I can see why.Although this hotel is not flash, and there's nothing fancy here, the basics are done very well. Every staff member I encountered was extremely polite and helpful, and there really was service with a smile - a real genuine smile, and not a forced have a nice day type smile. My room was adequately sized, larger than other rooms I've had when paying the same price in Paris. The room was spotlessly clean, and well decorated. The bed was comfortable, the TV and air conditioning worked, there were tea making facilities in the room, and a separate chair. The bathroom was well equipped decently sized, and the shower powerful.Breakfast was of a good quality - the coffee and fresh fruit salad were particularly good, as were the freshly baked croissants. There wasn't a lot of choice, but that wasn't necessary, because what was there was great.All in all, this is a great hotel, and in my opinion by far the the best of comparably priced Paris hotels.

<Content>Best Bet in Paris!! We've been to Paris many, many times and know its hotel scene quite well. We found the Hotel Residence Foch five years ago and have made a special trip here every year since. This small boutique hotel has everything: very well appointed and extremely comfortable air conditioned rooms, excellent quality, and a staff that goes beyond the limit in providing outstanding service. Hotel Foch is well located and quite convenient to the Paris subway. The staff has pointed us towards two outstanding restaurants nearby (and several economical, but good quality bistros). The owner keeps this Hotel modern adding new amenities each year. As a retired business executive who is currently a professor at a major university in the USA, I feel qualified to commend Isabell for her exceptional skills in Hotel Management. My only regret is having not previously written a note to Trip Advisor on this great hotel value in Paris!H. T. Smith Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida

<Content>Best Hotel For Me In Paris! I have stayed in Paris several times and this hotel was hands down my favourite. It was much better than the 4 star hotel in the Latin Quarter where I have stayed previously . I stayed in a twin room for three nights with my daughter. When you walk in, you know you are in Paris, it radiates charm. Every staff member was friendly, polite and ready to assist you in anyway possible. Our room was cozy and beautiful with a lovely French window. The first thing I did when I walked into the room was get my camera out. It was that beautiful. The room was spotlessly clean, the maid service was excellent. I had breakfast there each day, the breakfast room was very lovely and I enjoyed the company of fellow travellers from many different coutries, including France. I also enjoyed the lovely service and the variety of breakfast items available.We enjoyed the quiet neighbourhood. If you walk two streets over the area has shops, restaurants, bakeries, groceries etc... There are two Metro stops close by, no more than a 5 minute walk. The area has a local feel to it which I really enjoyed.We arrived on the Air France Coach and found the hotel within a 5-10 minute walk. There was no need for a taxi or a metro. The roundtrip Air France shuttle was 22 euros. We took it back to the airport from the same stop without incident.

<Content>cosy little hotel We had a short break in Paris in January and this hotel was recommended by a few of my colleagues. We were not disappointed. The staff are very friendly and helpful, the rooms were comfy, cosy and clean with a lovely bathroom. The tea and coffee making facilities in the room were very welcome at the end of a long day walking and sightseeing. The area was very quiet at night but at no time did we feel unsafe. There were plenty of restaurants in the vicinity (although some of them were on the expensive side but this is Paris!!) The breakfast was lovely, just enough to set you up for the day. We were within walking distance of the metro and train station (and the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysee) and it was easy to get to our shuttle bus for Beauvais from there too. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay- all the Christmas lights were still up- quite romantic -and even the weather was kind to us. Would go back.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel for the Price I stayed here June 17-19 based on reviews I read here and for the price the experience was way above my expectations. From the airport I took the RER B line then switched to the RER C (at St MIchel Notre Dame) which has a Foche Ave stop. Its a five minute walk to the hotel from the exit (the exit is also right beside the Port Daphine metro station) and the hotel is in a beatiful neighbourhood. I arrived way too early for check in but I think they see this all the time as the staff told me I can leave my bags and go exploring. The staff are extra friendly and were more than happy to answer any questions. I must have asked them everything from directions, to restaurant recommendation to how to say phrases in french. I was travelling alone and the room was a bit small but it was perfect for me. It had all the amenities including a/c, iron with board, mini bar, tv etc..plus my room (#22) had a french balcony overlooking the street which was a nice touch. Bathroom was modern and everything was very clean and crisp. TV had about 20 channels everything from sports to movies to sit coms - but of course you're in paris so I don't know how much TV watching you should be doing. They also have a laundry service but there are dry cleaners in the neighbourhood. There is also a butcher, grocery store, bakery all within 5 minute walking distance of the hotel. There is a computer in the lobby with internet which is free to use to check your email or surf the net.The hotel is near Foche and Ave de la Grande Armee both of which lead to the Arc de Triomph. The walk is about 10 minutes to the Arc and from there you can walk (or take the metro but really you should walk..) down Champ Elysees, maybe cut across Montaigne (as far as I can tell this is where all the high fashion stores are), across the Seine to the Eifell Tower and then along the Seine to anything else you want to see....The hotel has breakfast which I had one day. In most cafes you can get breakfast for about 5-6 euros maybe a little more and this will include a hot drink, a croissant, juice, half a baguette, butter and jam. The hotel breakfast is more expensive but you have a wider choice of jams, honey, nutella, cereal, different pastries and so on. I think if you're in a rush it might be worth it otherwie stop by any one of the 1,000,000 cafes :)I only got one name, Isabella, who was working the front desk the days I stayed there. I also met the owner who was in with her newly born baby. Just to give you an idea of the type of service - I was going to the opera in the evening and needed a shirt dry cleaned. The local dry cleaner couldn't turn it around by the time I needed it but the owner said she would take care of it. When I returned to my hotel room that evening there was my shirt, nicely dry cleaned waiting for me.

<Content>Charming Parisian Hotel I booked this hotel because of the reviews I read on this site, and was pleasantly surpsied during our stay there. First, the hotel is in a nice, quiet location off the usual tourist track. Some find this a disadvantage, but we found that great restuarants packed with locals were only a few blocks away. This was a great break from the countless brasseries near Champs-Elysee that seemed to all have a similar offering. We also took the metro a few times, which was only about a 10 minute walk away.The rooms were small, but our bathroom was actually quite large. Another group in our party actually had a nice balcony with a table! It was perfect for gathering at the end of a day to talk over a good bottle of wine. There was also a garden terrace in the back of the hotel that all guests could use. All of the rooms were incredibly charming!The hotel staff was also very nice, and helped us with any requests.Overall, this hotel was a great value and I really did like the location. I've been to Paris before and stayed on Rue di Rivoli, which is quite busy. I actually preferred the Foch's quiet location off the beaten track.

<Content>Return visit to Hotel Residence Foch as good as the last time Well, I was as good as my word from my last review of this hotel, I went back to this hotel as I knew it would be good. I'm sure the standard of hotels can change over time but I can assure you that the standards are still as impeccably high as they were on my last visit to Hotel Residence Foch. Not much has changed: the staff are superb, the breakfast is very good even if it is a little pricey at 鈧?2. The 16th arrondissement is an exclusive and expensive part of the city but the hotel is only 5 minutes walk from Porte Maillot and 10 minutes from Porte Dauphine so finding somewhere for a cheaper petit dejeuner shouldn't be too difficult. The room we had this time was a twin with the beds pushed together and this was fine. The bedroom and bathroom were clean and bright and made for a comfortable stay. TV reception was poor, but then my French isn't that great anyway. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to return for a third visit.

<Content>Loved this hotel Review is late since we stayed early May 2007 - but I wanted to write how much we enjoyed this hotel. We arrived early in the morning and our room was not ready. The staff allowed us to leave all our bags (there were a lot of them) at the hotel until the room was ready. The room was small (it is Paris), but was extremely clean and comfortable. The staff were excellent in advising how to get around and where to go. It is close to the Metro, and close to the shuttle to the airport but not the closest to the main attractions of the city - if you are planning to walk. A good 20-30 minute walk (though it was a great way to end the day for us) back to the hotel. It is on a side street so it is quiet at night - though at the same time if you are alone could be a little eery. Morning breakfast buffet was great. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great little hotel My wife and I stayed in this hotel from Thursday 22nd May 2008 till Sunday 25th May 2008. We have no complaints whatsovever. We were delighted with the hotel and would go back there again. Location was great, near the metro, near good restaurants, away from the tourist areas yet with in walking distance of the Champs Eleyses.Staff were excellent, booked trips for us and recommended restaurants which were first class and good price.one of the best holidays we have had.

<Content>J'adore Hotel Residence Foch I just returned from my trip in Paris and Hotel Residence Foch was a wonderful place for me to stay. The hotel is located very close to the Porte Maillot station and walkable to Champs Elysee and the rest of France. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It's such a quaint bed and breakfast. My room faced the little courtyard. I have never felt so welcomed. The staff was very knowledgeable and made my first time in Paris such a joy. I'll definitely be returning to Paris and to Hotel Residence Foch.

<Content>Clean and Friendly The hotel is small and on a side street. It is about a 5 minute car ride to the Arc of the Triumph. The elevator is the smallest elevator I have ever been in. Four people fit inside tight with no luggage. It was maintaned clean. The front desk attendant helped take our luggage up. The bathrooms were clean and I did not see anything gross. The room had a flat panel tv. I stayed in a four person room with 2 twin beds and one queen bed. The beds were comfortable. We had a view of the interior courtyard...nothing specatcular, but that was fine. There was airconditioning in the room which we did need to use.My only complaint would be the parking. If you bring your own car, which we did as we rented a car, the parking is very bad. It was very difficult pulling the car over to unload our luggage as there is no space. The side street that the hotel is located on is a one way street with cars parked on both sides of the street and only space for 1 car traffic in the middle. There was no where to stop except for the garage driveway of the home next door. We stopped there temporarily to unload our baggage and the homeowner came out and started to scream at us in French that we could not park their although all we were doing was unloading our luggage. Then when we went to park the car, we had to go about 5 blocks away to finally find a parking area. We had to walk back to the hotel through the isolated streets at night. We had no way of knowing if it was safe, but we did not encounter anyone on our walk back to the hotel so everything worked out.In conclusion, if you drive your own car, this hotel is not the most ideal one for you, if not, then it's a great hotel for the money considering the prices in Paris and its ideal location.

<Content>Who says the French aren't friendly? No doubt there are many lovely little hotels in Paris but the Residence Foch is not only all that, but has that important element that makes a nice hotel a great one. Of course you can spend hundreds of euros to get 5 star luxury, but for a price affordable to the average traveller, Residence Foch delivers a 5star service with the friendliest French you have ever met. They make you feel so very welcome, with the bouncy ever smiling Jean Louis, helpful Al, and Nelly, the gorgeous young owner (baby due any time now!), solicitous and making sure all is in order. Restaurant tips, ticket information, transport, opening times. etc... no problems. You are never made to feel uncomfortable asking. Rooms are lovely, decorated in cheerful provencal yellow, with fresh bedding, and bathrooms immaculate and modern. Of course they are not large but perfectly adequate. There are thoughtful touches not usually available in european hotels such as , kettle for making tea/coffee, iron/ironing board and a safe as well as the usual mini bar. There is also free broadband and computer to check email. Breakfast is a substantial buffet. cook your own poached/boiled eggs, breads, cereals, fruits, ham/cheese, etc.. served in a delightful cosy breakfast room.We were always so happy to return to our little corner of Paris at the end of the day and be greeted by Nelly and her staff. What more can I say?

<Content>Great hotel in 16th in Paris We have just returned from our first trip to Paris, where we stayed at the Residence Foch for 5 nights. Everything was great, absolutely no complaints. The staff were warm and friendly, and really went out of their way to help. They spoke excellent English, which is great if your French isn't so good, and provide good recommendations for meals, tours and getting around. The 16th is a quiet - and nearly boring - part of the city, but public transport easily accessible and cheap to get anywhere else. We paid 160Euro per night, were very happy with value for money this represented, and happily recommend to anyone else.

It is a little out of the way but still the rest of Paris is quite accessible with two metro stops about 5 minutes away. Because it is in a residential area, night time is very quiet so you can sleep nicely. If you want hustle and bustle then this is not the place for you. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Charming Parisian hotel Our second stay and as good as the first visit, the hotel is charming and warm in atmosphere and comfort. Nelly and her staff are absolutely fantastic, always friendly, helpful and greet every time with a big smile. The hotel is in an excellent upmarket location in a quiet side street but close to all public transport and easy to walk to Eiffel tower and other main sights of Paris. The rooms are tastefully decorated and beds very comfortable.

<Content>Fabulous Foch We stayed in room 11 for three nights and concur with the previous reviewers that the hotel is a great place to stay. The staff generally makes or breaks a hotel and the staff here definitely added so much to our stay. They are all cheerful and endeavour to help in whatever way they can.The hotel is not large and has the feel of a family run business. The bedrooms also aren't large but are well equiped and the bed comfortable.You pay extra for breakfast - 12 euros at present - which seems a lot but isn't when compared with what else you could get elsewhere.The hotel is not central but the metro Daphine and Porte Maillot are 10mins easy walk away. With the metro being so cheap (1 euro 50) then this is not an issue.Eating out is expensive and probably more so in this area than in the centre. But there are plenty of eating places within 10mins walk which the hotel can advise you of.All in all the hotel is excellent value and friendly.

<Content>Wonderful little hotel in Paris There are few places one goes where people truly care about you and your well being. Hotel Residence Foch is one of those places. Not only do staff go out of their way the ensure your stay in comfortable, but they also proactively offer you advice on how to make your trip as memorable as possible. The location is very central being a walking distance to many of the sights, and has two main metro stations very nearby. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Paris. =]

<Content>Fabulous Foch It's all been said before but this hotel in Paris is excellent for location, value, comfort and helpful, friendly staff. I find it hard to believe that anyone could give it a poor review and thanks to all the previous travellers who helped us to choose this hotel. If in Paris again we would return.

<Content>Loved the hotel We stayed at the hotel for one night in mid December. With Paris the choice of hotels is vast but this was a great choice. the location is perfect and everything is easily walkable from this hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and we had the top room with a terrace which was fantastic. Id totally recommend this small hotel for a weekend break in Paris.

<Content>A Most Enjoyable Experience Chris and MargaretGold Coast AustraliaWe have visited Paris on many occassions, staying in 3 and 4 Star Hotels. They were usually clean and comfortable, properly operated and located among many other similar hotels. Nothing really to complain about, but nothing exceptional either.Then we stayed at Hotel Residence Foch, to be honest the room was very clean and tidy, typical French decor, with a typical French outlook. What we expected. Not many hotels in the locality, more apartments for the locals and not too many typical tourists. We actually felt like we were in Paris not in an international locality competing with other tourists. Quite inspiring. Yet located in a nice part of town not far, walking distance in fact, from the Arc De TriompheWhat we didn't expect was the ambiance, warmth and friendliness that you experienced within moments of entering. Nothing was a problem, directions, restaurants, places of interest, no matter what we seeked assistance for they delivered, without exception, and with a smile. You actually felt comfortable not foreign, which we value particularly when your stay is usually for only a few days.Breakfast was enjoyable, everything fresh and French.The cost was comparable to many other hotels in this range, very reasonable for the style and location.If your looking for a hotel where people care about you, and try their best to make your stay pleasant and a very memorable experience, then try Hotel Reidence Foch, we did and we will most certainly again.By the way, and my wife would vouch for this, I am not easily pleased.

<Content>Great hotel Stayed for 3 nights (7,8,9 March). Accomodation beautifully decorated and clean. Staff very friendly and extremely helpful. Buffet breakfast with an extensive selection to choose from. Hotel is in easy reach of two metro stations which take you to direct to major sites. We would have no hesitation in recommending to friends. Plenty of restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel, make sure you follow recommendations from the hotel staff otherwise it can be very expensive.

<Content>Wonderful stay in Paris I had spent many months reviewing a variety of Hotels when planning our trip to Paris. I even booked several! Then I was fortunate I found Hotel Residence Foch it sounded just right. And I was! Our stay was truly fantastic the reception staff made us very welcome! Nothing was ever too much trouble. Our room was beautiful and of a high standard for a three star hotel particularly in Paris, yes the room was small but from previous experience that is the norm. The other benefit to staying in this area was the choice of restaurants, and the underground was only a 10minute walk, we recommend this hotel and would happily stay there again.

<Content>Lovely Hotel I have stayed at the Hotel Foch on many occasions and would not consider staying anywhere else in Paris. The hotel is small but the staff are very friendly, are very patient with those that wish to pratice their not so good French (they all speak good English) and are very keen for their guests to get the best out of their trip to Paris. The hotel is beautifully decorated although I would agree with a previous review that said you need to take full advantage of what's on offer at breakfast to get you money's worth. I was very suprised to read in a very negative review that the Hotel was not near the metro or restaurants - this is simply not the case. Perhaps the lady did not know the area very well but there are two metro lines with stations within a five minute walk which between them can get you to any part of Paris or out to Versaille (well worth a visit, but get your ticket from the tourist information bureau opposite the entrance and down the road a bit and avoid queing for a couple of hours - it costs no more!). There are also a good selection of restaurants - also within a five minute walk. Ask the staff to recommend places to eat and you will find some gems.

<Content>Lovely and cosy hotel for a romantic week-end or a business trip. We staid at Residence Foch for 2 nights in February.The week-end was a Christmas present from my Darling who stays at Residence Foch each time he goes to Paris for his job.You feel already welcome when you arrive and before you even open the door. Very nice from outside and I loved the red and white flowers.Very nice welcome, very helpul and very nice staff. A special mention for Jean-Louis, he is the one I've seen the most.A very nice and happy person.We had a very lovely and cosy suite.My friend who has staid in different rooms says they are all very nice.This charming hotel is located in a quite and smart area, conveniently close to metro, the Palais des Congres (where we went to see the fantastic indian musical Bharati).There are good restaurants nearby to please anyone.Don't miss the delicious breakfast buffet for a good start for a busy day in Paris.The first night we took a walk to the arch of triumph, about 15 minutes away.I highly reccomend Residence Foch.

<Content>Fantastic Cosy Parisian Hotel Me and my partner stayed here for 3 nights over the Valentines weekend. I thought this hotel was great. The hotel itself is located in a nice neighbour hood were you do feel very safe. Its in a quiet location, close enough to reach the sites, ie Arce De Triomphe, Eiffel Tower etc, but is not bustling with tourists.The staff in the hotel were extremely pleasant and were always willing to help.The hotel room itself was big enough for two. The bathroom was of very good size. We didn't sample the breakfast.I would have no hesitations to reccomend this hotel to anyone, I will be back to hopefully!Many thanks.

<Content>This really is a nice friendly hotel in a quiet location We booked on the strength of the other reviews and because I was working in the 16th Arondissement. The room was small but OK, good size bathroom and it's true, the staff are wonderful.Other reviewers had said they thought that the breakfast at 鈧?2 was expensive. if you just want a coffee and a croissant it is, but if you want cereal, juice, boiled egg, ham and pain au chocolate then it is good value.Only downside was that on our second night a room on the floor below got flooded and the noise of renovation the next day started at 8am and went through to 5pm. The staff were very apologetic and I know some guests were very angry. To me, these things happen.Close to metro and some good restaurants nearby.

<Content>Terrible Stay at Hotel Foch My husband and I stayed in Hotel Foch for three nights this January, 2008. The location of the hotel was about a mile from the Metro, with not a lot of restaurants or cafe's nearby. The room was very small, with just enough room to get in the bed on each side. We had originally picked the hotel because of the reasonable price, and positive reviews but again and again we were disappointed. The first night we realized we could hear every sound outside of our door, and coincedentally they happened to be doing construction in the very next room. Electric drills, hammers, the works. We asked to change rooms but there was nothing available, but we were assured the construction would stop soon. Around 7PM it ended. We went to take a shower, and to our dismay there was NO hot water. Not only that the shower head was bursting bouts of dirt all over the bathtub. We were very disappointed at this point to the point of wanting to check out and when we expressed our concerns the plumber of the hotel came up to our room and started SCREAMING at my husband saying my husband did not know what hot water was (because there isn't a difference between freezing and warm in his mind apparently). We ended up staying at the hotel because we had already paid and were given attitude for the rest of our stay. Also, we found out that the hot water heater had broken the night before from the receptionist. Instead of being honest about their problem, they lied straight to our faces and tried to deny any problem at all. We would never stay at hotel Foch again, or suggest it to anyone we know.

<Content>Lovely Experience My husband and i took our 4 children (3 of them are teenagers) to Paris on New Years Day for 4 nights and we booked this hotel based on Tripadvisors recommendations. They could not have been more correct! We had a super stay in the Residence Foch. The staff are so nice and very welcoming, the location within walking distance of such beautiful sights as the Arc De Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower, the comfort and warmth of the hotel and the very fine breakfast all contributed to a great parisien experience. My children had a very spacious room for 4 to themselves and were most content with it. Lovely city and lovely people! We definately will be back!

<Content>Good Experience for the Most Part After spending most of a recent trip to Paris in business type hotels outside the center of the city, we finished our trip at the Hotel Residence Foch to experience a more boutique-type hotel. Since our other hotels were a completely different style I can't really say how this hotel compares with others similar to it, but I will try to explain the facts for my experience. First off, although there are three different metro/train options nearby, none are particularly close and after a long day of sightseeing (i.e. walking and standing in line) it would have been nicer to get back to the room a little quicker. The area is safe, quiet, and mostly residential, but does have some cafes and a small grocery market (which comes in handy if you don't want to spend a fortune on food) within easy walking distance. The Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees were within a mile or two of flat terrain walking so the location has some plusses and minuses. The hotel staff was very friendly and English was spoken by all. The room we had was tiny (#60) and was located next to the elevator so sleeping in much was difficult. The view was similar to the pictures shown, but the room was in need of some updating and/or basic touch-ups. Nothing horrible, but seemed easily fixable. The breakfast buffet was very refreshing, but should have come with the room based on my reservation and our credit card seems to suggest otherwise. Just check with the front desk before you assume your reservation with free breakfast is noted. All in all, not the best, but certainly not terrible. A solid price, but considering the streets of Paris are littered with boutique hotels, I think I would have rather spent a little more to be in a more central location with a slightly nicer standard of room for my boutique experience.

<Content>Lovely little gem From 29 December 2007 until 1 January 2008 we stayed with our three teen-age daughters in this very homelike hotel.We got a very warm welcome by the receptionist and received the keys within 5 minutes. We were given room 52 and 53 on the fifth floor on the streetside. The no-smoking rooms were very recent completely renovated and very tasteful decorated, very clean, warm, comfortable and well equipted with flatscreen (the signal was not so good unfortunately), minibar, tea/coffeemaking facilities,airco, a safe working on your creditcard and a very well equipted and new bathroom.The breakfast is being served on the groundfloor in a little cosy room with 12 chairs. The atmosphere there is very relaxing and informal and the staff will do everything to satisfy you and to feel comfortable. There are several sorts of fresh! bread, croissants, muesli, cheese, ham, marmelade, Nutella, honey, juices, fresh fruit, eggs, milk, yoghurt and much more. We used breakfast every day and it was really lovely and for us very complete.The hotel is standing in a Residentiel (a lot of Ambassies), quiet and safe neighbourhood. There are 2 Metrostations and several Velib(bikes))-points nearby. The Eiffeltower and the Arc-de-Triomph are within walking-distance. There are indeed enough good restaurants in the neighbourhood.When you really want to sleep quiet and not be waked up at 7.00a.m. every morning by the garbagetruck ask for a room on the backside of the hotel. The airco was not working so we slept with open windows. So every sound was live.There is free internet access in the lobby which is very great.Our compliments to the always smiling staff. They were all just great, very helpful, friendly, nice, very good English speaking, and really interested in their guests. Isabelle is a very nice lady and she will do everything to make you feel at home. When you read it Isabelle: Thanks for everything (p.s. our daughters liked your clothes very much!).We highly recommend this cosy place and will certainly come back in future. It's a lovely place for a very reasonable price (certainly in a town like Paris) and the staff is wonderful.

<Content>In a really nice area We have stayed in Paris on 2 previous occasions and were not impressed with the standard of hotel. In fact the first time we stayed there, we moved hotel after 15mins. We moved to the nice but completely overpriced Hotel Ambassador on Boulevard Haussmann. I cannot remember the name of the hotel we stayed in the second time that we were in Paris but the room was so small that we had trouble even walking around the bed.This time we used Trip Advisor to find a hotel. We came across Hotel Foch and liked the reviews. Some of the reviews mentioned Nelly and yes she is as good as they all say. She makes you feel so welcome. She wasn't there when we arrived on 23rd of December but the gentleman who greeted us was excellent. They have this lovely habit of coming out in front of the desk to talk to you when you walk in the door. We had our 11 month old son with us and Nelly just loved him.We were given the only room on the top (7th floor). The room was nice. It was very clean but looked a little shabby in places(e.g. worn carpet). The lift only went to the 6th floor so carrying baby and buggy up the 3 flights of stairs from there to get to our room was getting a bit tiresome after a few days. We brought our computer with us and really appreciated the free wifi access. We had a big deep bath and it was lovely to soak in after a long day of walking around Paris. It is a 10 min walk to the L'arc de triomph and 20mins to Eiffel Tour. The area around the hotel is very quiet and feels very safe to walk in.The hotel booked a restaurant for us to eat at on Christmas night and it was spectacular! In fact there were lots of restaurants nearby and almost all looked really good. We ate breakfast in the hotel one morning and while it was nice, we felt it was completely overpriced at 12euro per person. The other mornings we went to nearby cafes and ate plenty for a lot less money.When we go to Paris next time, we will stay here again. It's not perfect and at 鈧?60 per night for room only, it's not cheap. However having experienced other hotels in Paris, this one is as good as you'll get for the money!! To get a really nice hotel in the centre of Paris, one would have to pay far more.Again, nicer staff you will not find anywhere in France or beyond!!

<Content>Superb! I spent some time searching for the right hotel in Paris having heard of so many bad experiences. I found Hotel Residence Foch on the Tripadvisor website and having looked at the reviews and the hotel website I took the plunge and booked directly through the hotel website. Confirmation was received immediately by email. I arrived at the hotel with my wife and daughter aged 12 to a very warm and friendly welcome. The room was excellent, warm and clean as was the rest of the hotel. Breakfast was superb. Throughout our stay the level of service was extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location away from the hustle and bustle but within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower, Arc de'Triomphe and the Champs Elysee and with easy access to the Metro. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel, when I return to Paris I wouldn't look any further than the Hotel Residence Foch.

<Content>excellent, all the positive reveiws are true! I'll be brief with the reveiw as so much has been written before about how good this hotel is. I booked this hotel 6 months in advance of staying here (in August) for our first leg of our honeymoon, and was told that there was only 2 rooms left(!!!), so to avoid disappointment at peak seasons do as I did book well in advance.I chose this hotel purely from the reviews here on Tripadvisor, and liked the fact that Nellie even put a response on here to an unhappy reveiw, this to me shows that this hotel prides itself in listening to its customers, and hopefully feeling proud of what's being said. We were on the top floor of the hotel in a deluxe room with a balcony from which we could see the top of The Eiffel Tower. Unfortunately the weather wasn't great for our three days there, as we would've taken up the opportunity to eat breakfast on the balcony.Nellie, if you are reading this thanks again for welcoming us to your hotel and we look forward to seeing you again in the future!

<Content>Lovely staff. We selected this hotel based on the rave reviews. Yes - It's a lovely hotel in a lovely neighborhood. The pros about this hotel: the staff is wonderful, the rooms are clean, and it offers good rates. The cons: location is fine if you don't mind walking a bit to the metro, sights, etc., also the rooms are a bit dated and could use remodeling  renovation.

<Content>Very good hotel and great staff I highly recommend this hotel. The staff are excellent and very helpful. They are all terrific hosts and make you feel like they really appreciate your business. Helped us decide which sights to see and recommended very good (and reasonably priced) restaurants. Gave us a complimentary upgrade to our room and are first class. Also had free internet access in the lobby. Our room was very well appointed. Beware that the bed was rock hard.About the only complaint I would have is that the proximity to the Metro stations seemed a bit farther than advertised on the web. But, that's a minor point.We never ate breakfast in the hotel. We found a local bakery for coffee and croissant a bit more economical.

<Content>The Super Helpful and Fiendly Foch From the moment we walked through the door, the staff at the hotel were superb. We were swiftly checked in, and bearing in mind we arrived at the hotel by 11am, the room was quickly sorted out for us, 15mins, and we came back down to go out exploring!! Before we did though, Nelly gave us an in depth brief about the transport system and the best ways to get about and how much things cost!! The map was free along with the advice and stood us in good stead for the 5 days we were there.On returning to our room, it was warm, comfortable and homely. The bathroom was clean with one hell of a power shower which was piping hot!! Our trip was made all the more enjoyable by the advice and recommendations given to us by Nelly and co. Local restaurants that we visited were great and not too expensive. And the evening meal cruise on the Bateaux Parisiens is a must!! We paid slightly more for the Select instead of the standard but I have to say that sitting anywhere would have been special enough. We did have a window seat towards the front of the boat that is the Premier area, but the food, entertainment and wine were all first class - simply pick your budget and you will have a fab time!!We did the usual tourist attractions, and were flabagasted by the queues for the Eiffel Tower during the day. We did however, return at 9pm that same night to find no queues so went straight up the lift to the top. Brilliant!!!Back to the hotel though! Nothing was too much trouble and we were always greeted with a smile and an inquiry as to where we were going, or where we had been, and given some beneficial advice which was extremely useful.If we had any complaints though, and I feel that word is too strong, I think feedback would be better, it would be that on a couple of occasions there was no where to sit at breakfast. Once again though, we would be reassured and not have to wait long for a table to be cleared and reset. Breakfasts were fantastic by the way!!!The final thing is that both of us came away with a couple of bites on arms and legs, which is strange as the hotel was really clean so c'est la vie!!!We really cannot fault the Residence Foch. The location is great, (25 min walk from the Eiffel Tower and 10 mins from the Arc de Triomphe!!) Loads of places to sit and eat/drink. Metro stations close by. We will definitely stay there again on our return to Paris.Last tip. Paris Shuttles taxi company were great. From the CDG Airport direct to the hotel door for 19 euros per person each way!! We booked them for our return trip to the airport and they arrived 10 mins early getting us to the airport in plenty of time.

<Content>Wonderful experience My wife and I travel whenever we have the opportunity. This was our first trip to Paris. Each neighborhood, restaurant, flea market, bistro, shop and museum exceeded our every expectation. The people we met were warm, helpful and friendly.And, all of this can be said about Hotel Residence Foch.After an overnight flight from Denver, we arrived at the hotel early in the morning to find our room clean, ready and waiting. Nelly, Isabelle, John Lui and everyone at Hotel Foch treated us, not simply as visitors to their hotel, but rather as guests in their home. Located on the west side of Paris, near the Arc de Triomphe, and within walking distance to the Eiffel Tower, Hotel Residence Foch sets in a wonderful neighborhood and is close to each of the Paris Metro Lines.Every day was something new and exciting for us in Paris and, at the end of the evening, we could always look forward to returning to the warmth and comfort of Hotel Residence Foch.

<Content>Loved Paris Stayed with my family of 5 at Residence Foch. Me my wife and 3 boys (6,8,11). We really enjoyed our stay,this hotel is in a great location next to neighborhood bistros, bakeries and grocery stores. It is not in a touristy area.But it is within walking distance to the Arc de Triomph, Bois Boulogne and the metro.The service at hotel was great especially Nellie and Jean Louis. There are some great restaurants on Pergoulese (which runs by hotel)We had a family room with 5 beds and we were very happy with it. We had enough space for all of us.They are kid friendly at the hotel. We definitely would stay there again.

<Content>Nicey Nice Hotel I stayed here with my family for four days. The hotel is located about a 10minutes stroll from the Porte Malliot metro station.The train trip (Airport CDG-Chatelet-Porte Malliot) takes about an hour and costs about 7eur.The hotel is quaint. The lift holds three and each floor has about three rooms. The breakfast room has about 5 close tables. The staff at reception are incredibly helpful and they will recommend some decent places to eat. I found one of the staff members overly fussy. He made breakfast uncomfortable and very rushed, when everyone else was relaxing.The rooms are paris size (small but alright). They have flatscreen tvs with BBC Prime (so no missing eastenders) and the bathrooms are modern enough with a decent spray on the shower.Aircon is cool, but a bit noisey (not overly)The hotel would be well suited for older couples. It is in a quiet area, but not too far from the main areas.I booked the hotel directly and it costs 150eur per room per night. B'fast was 12per person. It was limited. Bread, egg, yoghurt and fruit. In small supply.you can walk to the arch de triomphe in about 25minutes or you could fly there in the metro.Go here if your main consideration is noise at nightime, and polite reception staff. Its probably a good hotel, by paris standards (for the price). Beware, everything is even more expensive than you think. Thats saying something coming from someone from Dublin.

<Content>Felt At Home From the moment we arrived we felt warmly welcomed. The staff was pleasant and accomodating. Everyone spoke fluent english. Rooms were small yet tastefully decorated and breakfast was a treat. Very close to Metro and RER. The front desk personel were always so helpful in navigating us through this wonderful city. While located on the right bank the area is quite and residential in character. There are any number of excellent (and resonable) restaraunts within a short walking distance. We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Loved the Hotel Residence Foch I was at the Hotel Residence Foch for my birthday and was lodged in a very pretty room. Nellie is the key to this hotel's success and popularity. She helps with everything, including recommending a brasserie for my birthday and surprising me with a complimentary dessert and glass of champagne for me and my friend at dinner. What a surprise that was! The next day though, I was sick and amazingly enough she arranged for a doctor to make a housecall to the hotel. He prescribed medication and I was up and about the next day. Having to spend an entire day in a hotel room in Paris wasn't what I had planned, but luckily the flat screen tv and comfortable bed made it easy. Thank you Nellie for making my birthday in Paris so special!Leslie

<Content>A great Paris hotel Two Australian couples had a great stay at Hotel Residence Foch a month ago. The location is great, quiet and safe, but close to many sights by walking or the nearby Metro.The friendliness and helpfullness of Nellie and her staff is quite unbelievable and they make staying in Paris so easy and comfortable.There are great retaurants and food shops nearby, and it a not - to- touristy neighbouhood.Highly recommended and we would stay there again

<Content>A Taste of Paris My family of 4 (2 adults, 13 year old and 10 year old) spent 4 wonderful nights at Hotel Residence Foch. On arriving by train at a metro stop in close proximity to the hotel, we had no difficulties finding Hotel Residence Foch which is situated in a very quiet and safe neighbourhood within walking distance from the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower. On the first night, Nellie spent time highlighting major sites to visit and helped us to prepare a comprehensive itinerary for the duration of our stay. Whilst I had spent time preparing an itinerary prior to leaving Australia, it was most helpful to have input from a resident. Nellie and her staff are friendly and very accommodating. I required a doctor on arrival and the reception staff promptly organised for the doctor to visit. Afterwards, we explored the area near the Hotel and also headed to the Eiffel Tower to view the lights on dusk - spectacular. Our spacious room was very suitable for our family. It consisted of two rooms partitioned by a heavy curtain with a very clean large bathroom. The decor was very tasteful. After busy days, visiting museums, riding on Hop On Hop Off buses and eating in exquisite French restaurants, it was wonderful to arrive back to Residence Foch to rest and be restored for the next day.We all enjoyed the breakfast buffet. We also purchased cold meats from the local butcher, French cheeses from the Deli and delectable treats from the pastry shop which we ate in the foyer of Residence Foch.The free internet was also great - my two children had the opportunity to communicate with their friends in Australia.Hotel Residence Foch is definately a safe and suitable place to stay with a family. Thank you, Nellie and the Team

<Content>Charming, comfortable  Contrary to some other reviewers, my wife and I found this to be a charming little hotel, full of character, in an excellent location in a quiet back street close to the Metro, Arc de Triomphe and many good bars and restaurants. Nellie and her staff were extremely friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. The breakfasts were certainly to our liking, though may not suit the American taste. Our only reservation was that our room was small (but the bathroom large). If you are thinking of an extended stay, or have a lot of luggage, this may not be for you.

<Content>Beware! Reservations nightmare... We booked a double room at Hotel Residence Foch via Tripadvisor 鈥淐heck Rates鈥? to celebrate our anniversary. My credit card was charged and I was given a reservation confirmation that was printed. After 14 hours of traveling and no sleep for nearly 30 hours we finally arrived at Hotel Residence Foch. We presented our reservation confirmation to the front desk and were told that the hotel was fully booked and despite us already having paid for the room and having our confirmation with us, the receptionist refused to give us a room. We were then told that Paris was booked solid due to a business convention and that it would be nearly impossible to get a room anywhere.Hotel Residence Foch has a contract with the third party booking site that we used, as well as other on-line hotel booking companies that sell rooms on behalf of Hotel Residence Foch. These rooms are sold for a commission paid by the hotel. However, our reservation was denied by the hotel even though we had written and paid confirmation. We were told by the receptionist that there was nothing she could do about it and she was about to send us out on the street, luggage and all. It is my understanding that if a hotel overbooks, the hotel is obligated to find alternate arrangement and cover the difference in cost.This did not happen. We pleaded that she find us alternate accommodation, and after more than an hour waiting in the lobby she finally found us a room...on the other side of town right next to a busy train station.My greatest concern is that the receptionist admitted that the exact same thing occurred twice earlier in the day and again all week long. It seems to be a re-occurring event. My advice is to you fellow Tripadvisor user is; Never book your room through a third party when traveling overseas. (IE clicking on that that yellow tab that says 鈥淐heck Rates鈥?. Instead, book directly with the hotel. And call to confirm many times! During low demand and lower rates the hotel feeds off the third-party services. However, when demand goes up, the hotel can charge much higher rates than the discounted rates through their suppliers and will only honor the highest paid prices, leaving you鈥n the street to fend for yourself in a foreign country. We booked the room for almost half of the listed hotel website price and this could have been a factor. I would gladly have paid more than double the price, but when the website gives you a price and a room confirmation, it should be honored. Period. There is no control over bookings and hotel policies at boutique hotels vs. major chain hotels. So Beware!I must add though, that the receptionist was apologetic, and in the end, did find us accommodation. She also followed up by calling us at the new hotel to see that we were taken care of. I am not going to knock the rating of this hotel by giving it a 1 out of 5 so it will remain neutral. I would stay here in the future, were it not for this disaster. But out of principle, won鈥檛. And that is a shame. It seems like it could be a nice hotel and the location is great. But the hotel management needs to seriously look into their third party booking contracts so as to not completely ruin people鈥檚 vacations. On this principle alone, I could never recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Location, Excellent Staff Stayed at the Residence Foch on a recent saturday night during a layover in Paris. Had a great experience!The hotel is in a very nice neighborhood near the Arc De Triomphe (10 min) and the Eiffel Tower (20 min). There's a train (metro) stop about 5 minutes away. The staff was very accomodating and friendly and gave us a good recommendation for dinner. Both front desk folks we dealt with went out of their way to make us feel welcome.The hotel is more quaint than fancy but was very clean and quiet. I would absolutely stay here again. For the price, I suspect this is one of the best values in Paris.

<Content>We'd go back in a flash Travelling with another couple, my wife and I spent 5 wonderful days in Paris at the Hotel Residence Foch. We chose this hotel based on the great reviews on this site. The hotel is indeed in a great location quite close to two Metro stations. There are scores of great restaurants nearby, and if you are adventuresome, you can register and use Paris' nearly free bicycle rental system with a bike kiosk about two blocks away. The rooms and the breakfasts were great and the staff very helpful. They now have a laptop parked in the lobby that can be used to check e-mail and museum schedules, etc. If you are looking for a small hotel that reasonaly priced and well-located, this fits the bill. Next time we're in Paris, we'll be back there..

<Content>Basic, Charming Hotel, Out of the Way Location A basic but almost charming hotel. Has plenty of character but the location and breakfast lets it down.This hotel is clealry aimed at North American visitors. The hotel is clean and well maintained but the decor is stereotypically chintzy and the style is dated. That said, it gives it character often lacking in chain hotels.The staff are friendly and eager to please when dealing with run of the mill queries but can be a little patronising and unwilling to help with more complicated requests.The location, whilst very quiet, is far from central. The nearest Metro station is a 20 minute walk and it's then a 15 minute ride to the centre of Paris.Whilst there's a restaurant next to the nearest Metro station, a dearth of any other decent bars, cafes or restaurants means not only do you have to travel some distance for the sights you must do the same for eats and drinks, too. (The hotel bar isn't inviting).We stayed in a superior room which was very comfortable and a good size with plenty of storage space. It was let down, however by the cramped layout of the ensuite bathroom. There was free wifi in the room (and thoughout the hotel).Breakfast was reasonable value (for Paris) at 鈧?2 each but the quality and variety was disappointing. There was a 'boil-your-own-egg' machine with no timer, the orange juice was from concentrate (not fresh) and the pastries were few in number, small and dry. Restaurant staff were very friendly, however.Leaving the hotel at 6:30 am on a Monday, the hotel were unwilling to serve us breakfast before we left, even in the room, which seemed to be a casualty of the place being a small, family run business.That said, the hotel was good value and the staff were more freindly and helpful than not. All in, if this hotel was more central, I would definitely stay here again. As it is, I think it's too far from the action for a repeat stay.

<Content>What a find! I was arriving from the Amsterdam leg of my trip and my good friend had reserved a room at the IBIS. Little did I know that I was in for a terrible shock... but this review is about Hotel Residence Foch.I went on tripadvisor, found this lovely hotel and booked online for 110 euros for 2 doubles a night (w/ air conditionning) on a last minute special on their website.What a find! Great little hotel, very clean, flatscreen TV, renovated bathrooms, nice windows, comfy beds and very friendly staff! The locations is awesome since you are near the subway, the Eiffel tower and you are in the 18th arronsidissement which is where you need to be , a walk away from many sites. The neighborhood is safe and pretty much upscale (embassies are next door).For this quality in Paris, it's a steal! I highly recommend. Of course, don't expect extreme luxury at this price, but it was absolutlely fabulous for this girl that likes to stay at  Leadings hotels of the world when the office is paying!Enjoy!

<Content>The Trip Advisor reviews are spot on. Fabulous Hotel We picked this hotel based on the excellent reviews and werent disappointed. It was without a doubt the friendliest little hotel I have ever stayed at. The front desk staff were so helpful and friendly giving advice on using the metro. The rooms were small but what you would expect from a boutique hotel. More impotantly they had everything you would need and were clean and comfortable. We had a nice breakfast with a good selection, in the breakfst room. Wouldnt hesitate to use it again when I go back to Paris. Its a shame more hotels dont follow their lead. Sincere  Considerate Customer Service is everything. Well done Hotel Residence Foch.

<Content>Hotel with loads of Parisian character My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a week from 13th August. We had a very comfortable room at the front of the hotel on the first floor. The hotel is very welcoming and the service unobtrusive making it an ideal place to relax and see the sights of Paris. Residence Foch is convenient for the Air France airport shuttle to Charles de Gaulle and also for the RER and Metro. The 2 day hop on hop off green and yellow bus was well worth the money and helps you get your bearings in Paris. It stops at the Arc de Triomphe which is easy walking distance from the hotel. The Batobus was also fun for a day as you can also get on and off as well as seeing the sights from the river. We did use the Metro towards the end of our stay, but generally walked everywhere and recommend visitors take a good pair of walking shoes! We can thoroughly recommend this hotel which is spotless and well situated in a quiet area of the city. The staff are exceptionally helpful and cheerful which undoubtedly adds to its charm. We would love to return to Residence Foch and visit all the attractions we missed first time around.

<Content>Very friendly hotel, great location It started with a nice Welcome e-mail after we made our reservation. I should have responded by asking directions, since we walked from the Arch de Triumph instead of from Port de Meioux. Arrived at 9 but didn't expect room to be ready, so Nellie, the owner, had us leave our bags, freshen up, and suggested a lovely walk and cafe. Lovely 15 minute walk to Trocadero. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We found the location to be very convient although not in the center of things. We are not high maintainence and found the hotel delightful. We only had 2 days so a big Paris suggestion is to buy tickets to the Yellow bus tour. There are 4 routes and you can switch from one to the other. See [--] enjoy.

<Content>It's all true! Fantastico! This was one of the very best experiences we've had in a hotel (of any star rating) in ages. It truly is about the PEOPLE here. It's amazing what an impact the idea of good service can have on an estabishment and, by proxy, its guests. I'm not going to say that our room was palacial. If you're staying in your room for more than sleeping-- and other romantic endeavors ;) you're wasting your time in Paris. In fact, our room (#60) was right next to the adorable little elevator which operated constantly... but that is literally our ONLY critique. The rate for this lovely home in Paris was very reasonable and it's ideally located on a very quiet, safe street adjacent to the German embassy. NELLY is an amazing owner who always has time to help no matter how small or giant the request. To give you an example, they helped us get acclimated to the city, gave us routes and suggestions on par with any guide book and were always excited to hear about our adventures at the end of each day. They even took the time to book an additional room night for us in a nearby hotel with the very same rate when we decided to extend our stay. Nelly and her staff made us feel special and that's what everyone wants. In a world of impersonal box stores and internet anonimity, the Residence Foch is a refreshing and affordable escape.

<Content>Great hotel - even better service! My partner and I chose this hotel for our 4 night stay in Paris after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. The reviews are not wrong: The hotel is lovely (room was small but perfectly formed), the breakfast was good, location was central and the service was 5 star.I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay again if we return to Paris.

<Content>Perfect Location, great experience!!! We stayed in Residence Foch in July as a surprise Birthday getaway and what can I say - we simply had great experience and fantastic memories. It has been 7 years since I last visited Paris and to tell you the truth I had very mixed feelings when my husband told me that he had organized a week-end in Paris for my Birthday, I thought that I would much prefer a trip to Barcelona, but how wrong was I. We flew from Shannon to Paris with Ryanair and what was suppose to be 1h30min flight became 1h10min thanks to great flying conditions. From Beauvais airport there is a bus to Port Maillot and from there it is a very short walk to the Hotel. From the minute you step out from the bus and take first breath of Paris air you know that you are somewhere different and magical :)Although it was nearly 11pm by the time we made it to the hotel we were greated by a very nice receptionist, check in was very fast and smooth. We were given our key and shown to the elevator as our room was on the 4th floor. Hotel itself is very small, with narrow staircase and tiny elevator, but myself and 6'3 husband and suitcase didn't have any problem to fit in:) As my husband told me that he got exellent price from hotel's web site I didn't expect much from it, but I was wrong again:)Yes, room is on the small side but it has everything you need and bathroom is quiet big. In the room there are huge windows so you can open them in the morning and smell fresh bread and croissants:), there is flat screen TV, air conditioner and ironing board and what I liked the most - room has Paris character, you know straight away that this room could be only in Paris and nowhere else in the world. In the morning we had breakfast in the dinning room downstairs, it is continental but we definitely didn't leave the room hungry:) What I liked the most about this hotel - it's location, it is close enough to all tourist sites, only 2 min walk to the Arc de Triomphe, but far enough to be able to blend in with locals and it is located in a very quiet district as well. Also there are alot of great restaurants near by, the best we tried was a sea food restaurant (sorry can't remember the name) at the end of rue de Malakoff, 2 min walk from hotel towards Port Maillot with a great price of 鈧?7 for 5 course set menu (including oysters and foie-gras!!!) Staying in this hotel gave us such a great energy every morning and high spirit to go out and enjoy every minute of our trip and coming back in the evening felt like coming home:) It's been nearly 3 weeks since we came back but myself and my husband still raving about it and I am sure all our friends are tired to listen about it :) and we plan to come back in a very near future. When visiting Paris again we will only stay in this hotel, unless we won a lotto and could afford to stay in George V, I would love to try it out:) My only advise to anyone visiting Paris - take it easy, start your exploring of the city by just sitting outside one of numerous cafes with a cup of coffee or a beer, breathing Paris air and absorbing this fantastic atmosphere around you, watching people passing by and loving every minute that you spend in this fabulous city.

<Content>Great hotel I stayed in Residence Foch for valentines day in Feb 07 - location was perfect, staff were great. Room was very small but was perfect for us, it had all we needed including a minibar and a very nice bathroom. We stayed for three nights in total, it may be a bit small for people on a longer stay (1 week).As mentioned in other reviews, it have a more of a BB feel than a hotel feel so if you are looking for somewhere more like a hotel then I would look elsewhere. Would definetely recommend Residence Foch, the area was perfect, literally max ten mins walk from the Arc de Troimph, lovely safe area.

<Content>Delightful experience! Stayed at the Hotel Residence Foch during our trip to Paris in March of 2007. Everything about the hotel was to our liking. The room for 2 -- comfortable and quiet; the staff -- extremely friendly and helpful; the location -- a safe neighborhood, close to the Metro. At first I thought the breakfast was a bit pricy but soon changed my mind after we ate breakfast elsewhere one morning. The food at the Residence Foch was plentiful and good -- it kept us going for several hours each day. We booked a private van to and from the airport and that helped ease the anxiety of getting to the hotel and back to the airport in a city unfamiliar to us. I would stay here again and recommend this hotel to others who are looking for a reasonably priced, quiet, safe and friendly environment in Paris.

<Content>Top marks! This was booked by my now Fiance as a surprise and he used trip advisor. We were really pleased with the hotel.Staff were super helpful and friendly and always took time for a chat. The room was lovely and had a little balcony where we could stand out and see the Eiffel Tower. Breakfast was great and it was all just laid back.Note: rooms and lifts to floors in hotels in Paris are compact - that's the way of life there!

<Content>Charming and friendly hotel My husband and I had never been to Paris. We couldn't have found a better hotel. All staff were very friendly and helpful. Because of the reviews on Trip Advisor i had a good idea of what to expect and wasn't disappointed. We were on the 6th floor and our room was very comfortable with a lovely small balcony. The shower room was compact but more importantly it had a lovely strong shower not one of those horrible ones that just dribble out.. We enjoyed the breakfast which set us up for the day. Paris was beautiful nad Residence Foch was the perfect base for sightseeing and eating out. Thank You everyone, who wrote such good reviews, we were certainly not disappointed.

<Content>Lovely. My husband and I stayed at this lovely neighborhood hotel for 5 nights. We loved it. Everyone there was so helpful and friendly. Nellie was wonderful. You felt like a guest in her home. Her staff gave us great suggestions for where to eat...my favorite meal in Paris was at Bistro Saint Ferdinand just down the street. Go there! We really loved the location of the hotel; in a quiet neighborhood, but so close to the Arc de Triomphe and Tour Eiffel and easy access to the Metro. If I had any complaint, it would be that our room...71...didn't have a stand up shower, just a tub with a hand held shower head. That being said, I wouldn't hesitate to return to this hotel.

<Content>Hotel Residence Foch: Great staff, great stay Hotel Residence Foch: Paris made simple thanks to the kind and helpful staff at this charming small hotel. Many thanks to the tripadvisor travelers who recommended this hotel and who were spot on with their compliments. We asked the staff to make restaurant reservations for us by email before we arrived and they performed beautifully, emailiing us confirmation of our request and confirming again when we arrived. No question was too silly and no entry or exit passed without an interested and pleasant greeting. Rooms are small but well-appointed (this is Paris, rooms are always small!!) and location is fine with the exception that you have to walk a bit to the great streets filled with great people watching cafes and there is nothing right around the corner, so to speak. The advantage of this is that you are in a quiet block, walking distance to two metros, and not far from other pleasant attractions. Good breakfast too!

<Content>Like home away from home We stayed at the Hotel Foch for 8 nights in May and had a most pleasing wonderful stay . Nelly and Isabelle were attentive and accomodating . We stayed in a family room which was spacious , clean, nicely decorated and comfortable. We always felt that we needed anything , it would be no problem , and this is a great feeling to have when you are in another country and language can be an issue. Close by is everything ( Shopi , Restaurants , Park , Metro , RER , Cafe , Money Exchange , Champs Elysees ) and the area is very nice and safe .Breakfast is nice , especially because if you feel like it it can be delivered up to your room . This is an intimate hotel , warm like a home .

<Content>More than you could ask for For our honeymoon, we decided on Paris and Tuscany. For our hotel in Paris, we went through about 250 reviews on this website and decided for the value, location and based on past reviews, the Residence Foch was our best bet. We were not disappointed. We walked from the bus stop to the hotel in a few minutes and were immediately impressed. The front desk staff greeted us in English (does it show?) and while we tried our best to stumble along in French, we were soon both flitting back and forth in two languages. We had a terrific room and the washroom was the biggest we'd seen in Europe! The breakfast alone is worth the price of admission. It rained the first day of our journey, so we took the opportunity to battle jet lag. One of the nicest sleeps I've had. Loved the lift. It fit me and my outsized suitcase. Loved the bar. They make a mean martini if you ask them. Loved the location. You can walk to the Eiffel tower, Arc de Triomphe and the Bois de Boulogne. As has been said many times on this forum, the staff are what makes this a special little hotel. They are wonderfully helpful and can recommend the finest restaurants and the best way to see the city. They also arranged a great trip to Versailles and Giverny that was outstanding.We booked through Otel.com, as we always do, and got a far better rate than any of the other websites or my travel agent could give me.

<Content>Great hotel Arrived at the hotel on 26th May with our 7 year old to find that Expedia had messed up the reservation and had booked a room for two instead of three. The hotel bailed us out of a potentially difficult situation and we had a fantastic stay despite the abnormally bad weather. The breakfast is very good, the area is safe, there are convenient restaurants/Bistros of various types and prices, the metro and RER trains are close (you can get from either airport with a couple of changes, and travel easily to any of the bustling areas of paris if you wish). What really makes this hotel stand out though is the owner Nelly, and her staff. She/they promote both the hotel and paris, and whilst I find staff in small French hotels generally very friendly, I can say that here they are the most helpful and friendly we have come across in many trips to France and will add value to your stay. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel (except on the week when I want to go there next). Finally, thanks to the others who left reviews and helped me choose this hotel.PS. for those who don't speak French, they speak very good English

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Stayed at the Hotel Residence FOCH for a week in May for my Partner's 40th birthday. Booked on-line which was very straight forward, although we did have alittle trouble finding the Hotel when we first arrived (my fault for not printing out the little map - just get off at the exit for Avenue de Malokoff) and it's a 2 minute walk. Our room (50) was fine not enormous but quite sufficient space for us plus it had the added bonus of it's own terrace, through the bathroom. (I had picked this up from Trip Advisor -my partner thought it was a cupboard so got a pleasant surprise).We visited the Musee De L'Orangerie to see Monet's Waterlily paintings (just off the Place de la Concorde) and they were stunning and I would highly recommend a visit.RER service to Versailles from Porte Maillot station, very easy just change trains at Champ Des Mars - Tour Eiffel and catch any train with a name beginning with V. Versailles Palace very beautiful, we did a costly but excellent guided tour, very knowledgable French lady, learnt alot.Staff at this hotel are all brilliant and were always pleasant at all times, they were very helpful. Nelly recommended a fabulous restaurant (Le Petit Bisto - I think). Special Birthday meal and well worth the money with the very special touch of a glass of champagne from the hotel. Our meal cost about 拢100 but was one of the nicest steaks I've ever tasted.We will certainly return to this hotel but will perhaps try to get a superior room next time (not because the other rooms are not good but just for the extra space and perhaps a front facing balcony.One last thing, do climb the Arc De Triomphe at night (284 steps) it's well worth it for the view....oh yes if you visit the Pantheon there is a little bistro just down the road (1st one you come to) that did a fantastic Ceasar salad for 8 euros each.Thanks again to Nelly and staff, we had a wonderful stay.

<Content>What a great experience I booked twelve rooms at this hotel for some 23 Rotarians to celebrate a couple of 60th birthdays in May. Booking directly was very simple - Isobelle will usually deal with this. She and the other staff could not have been more welcoming or hospitable. In the end we had to give up one of the rooms as two could not travel, but again cancellation was easy. The superior rooms were very spacious, but perhaps the ordinary rooms were by comparison rather small. That did not detract from the hotel in any way. It was convenient to the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees. The Metro was a two minute walk and the area was quiet and relaxed - just like the hotel. First class boutique hotel, with first class no fuss staff. We'll definitely go there again when next in Paris. Thanks Isobelle!

<Content>Excellent hotel in the embassy quarter of Paris Great hotel, great staff, great welcome and the owners and staff helped us very well to find our way around Paris. The hotel is located in the chic embassy quarter of Paris. Some very good restaurants nearby (also for a Parisian breakfast: coffee and croissant). We had one of the family rooms at the back. Clean, nice room, very quiet. Booked this hotel to find out later that it is one of the top ten Tripadvisor hotels in Paris! And rightfully so. Although - as we were told - not all guests seem to understand Tripadvisor's concept of price/value and peer review rating and treat the staff of the hotel as if they are staying in one of the other (5-star) hotels in the top ten list. 'Can you bring up my luggage to my room?' is just not one of the services offered by this small 3-star hotel. However, the great thing is, that when I was there and a guy asked for it, even so, they still obliged! Now, if you go there, do not misuse this knowledge!

<Content>Outstanding small hotel Nelly Rolland runs a wonderful small hotel that is perfect for couples and single travelers. Our stay from May 5-12 was absolutely delightful and mirrors so many of the other reviews. Nelly, Isabelle and the rest of the staff are gracious and helpful. Our room (41) faced the courtyard and was adequate in size with a nice bathroom. Closet space is limited, but we don't pack huge amounts so it wasn't an issue.A few notes on the area. There is a small market called Shopi just a short distance away near the corner of Rue Pergolese and Avenue de Malakoff good for a bottle of water or wine and some snacks. A larger (very upscale) market can be found in the lower level of the Galerie Commerciale L'Atrium du Palais des Congres (just across from the Le Meridien hotel where the Air France bus stops). Very nice takeaway food. Even better is the market across from Bon Marche at the Sevres metro stop.We had dinner out at Le Petit Retro, a bistro recommended by Nelly, just off Place Victor Hugo; also at La Villa Corse, a Corsican restaurant on Avenue Malakoff (across from the Shopi market). We found both to be excellent; Villa Corse ended up being around 270 Euro for two, Le Petit Retro was half that.Porte Maillot metro station is large but less crowded than many and is also an RER stop. We found it easier to purchase our carnets (10 tickets for the metro) in the afternoon. The ticket windows were more crowded in the morning.For the Louvre, exit at the Palais Royal Musee du Louvre and follow the signs to the museum. You can connect directly to the lower level of the museum where the ticket kiosks are and avoid the lines outside (we bought our tickets in advance via the web and avoided the ticket queue as well).

<Content>Perfect!!! Residence Foch is in a perfect part of Paris. Its safe, close to the Metro and surrounded by traditional bakeries and patisseries. The staff are what makes this place so great though. The moment we stepped in they were directing us to the sights and hidden secrets around Paris.Thanks so much for making us feel at home in your hotel. We'll be back!

<Content>Well, it says 3 star, and it is 3 star, but the staff do make a difference ! Well, it describes itself as a 3 star hotel, and I for one wouldn't argue with that ! Certainly it is convenient for flights into, and out of, Beauvois airport, the airport bus transfer (13 euro single)making a one stop trip to Port Maillot which is about a 15 to 20 minute stroll to, or from, the hotel. The staff, Nellie et al, are all very welcoming and helpful to a fault. The hotel itself is located in a nice quiet residential street with a few embassies nearby and it's about a 15 minute stroll to Argentine metro which connects with just about anywhere you want to go. We arrived early so the room was not yet available and it was suggested we leave our baggage in the little reception area while we sauntered off for a while. This was also the case when we checked out at 12 noon with a whole day to kill before our flight home. While nothing happened to our baggage in the interim, I was, to say the least, most uncomfortable at having to leave it in such an exposed position where, frankly, just about anybody could have come in and wheeched it away. Something I had sussed from between the lines on Tripadvisor reviews was that the breakfast was not of particularily good value. I was spot on in this respect as at 12 euro per person (拢17 or $34 for two persons) it was the absolutely worst value I've ever seen in any European hotel (Riga to Rome via lots of places) for such a meagre offering. Nellie, despite what others may have said on this site, you are definitely not giving value for money as far as breakfast is concerned. We were fortunate in being allocated room 50 which had a small terrace attached so we we bought in all our breakfast provisions from local stores and boulangeries for a fraction of what we otherwise could have paid. Apart from that it was also more pleasant doing it al fresco than breakfasting downstairs in a small area off reception which had no ambience whatsoever. Regards the bedroom, yes it was small, so small that there was no designated area for luggage, only a small single wardrobe for hanging clothes, the hangers were of a design that immediately collapsed when you hung anything on them. Yes, Nellie was informed and produced some traditional style hangers but I doubt we were the first to experience this. The only other storage was two very shallow drawers in a small table supporting the TV suitable only for stashing knickers (either gender) and socks. I've given what I believe to be an honest review and if I was ever to return to Paris, which I won't, overrated and poor value, then I would certainly give this hotel consideration amongst many others. Incidentally, if you want to experience how vile food can be, yes in Paris, go to au sergent recruteur, rue st louis, i'lle st louis I can honestly say it was complete merde to give it the full local venacular. Or in Eurovision terms null point.One last note of caution. I booked this hotel via Expedia falsely confident in the knowledge that, like every booking I'd previously made with Expedia, the cost was deducted from my credit card there and then. Not so ! On this occasion it transpired that my credit card was only being used to guarantee my arrival ! I was presented with the entire bill on my check-out. Not the fault of the hotel but it has put a fair dent in my faith re Expedia. If I hadn't a credit card with me I was in shtuck ! The MacLeods of MacLeods of Harris, Lewis, Raasay, Skye and everywhere in between. Viva Alex Salmond, the SNP and the future Scottish Republic !

<Content>Simply the Best! Hotel Residence Foch has it all: a quiet setting in a high-class residential neighborhood; a perfect location within walking distance of the Arc de Triomphe, the Eiffel Tower, the Metro, and tour buses; artful French decor in the well-appointed rooms; and a generous breakfast buffet to provide fuel for your day. But most of all, there is the staff. Nellie and her desk staff could not be nicer or more helpful, and someone is there 24/7 to take care of every need. They truly make you feel like family. My wife marveled at the bed (which was very comfortable) being made within an inch of its life every day. The smaller single and double rooms we saw are adequately sized, especially for the price, while the 鈥渇amily鈥?rooms (suites) are more spacious -- some even with 5th or 6th-floor terraces overlooking adjacent courtyards. Our room (40) was one of the biggest and had plenty of space. I鈥檝e been to 5-star hotels from Rome to Chicago and if you need that level of amenities (gym, restaurant, etc.), this isn鈥檛 for you. But if you鈥檙e looking for unending charm, the warmth of a home away from home, peace and quiet, and incredible value, the Hotel Residence Foch cannot be beat.

<Content>Hotel Residence Foch It takes a lot to impress this middle aged English couple who now live in Spain!The Hotel Residence Foch has managed to do just that.I won't repeat what so many have said. But in brief, the quality of the rooms, genuine friendliness of the staff and quiet location in a smart area more than make up for any shortcomings this hotel has because of its small size.If you go to Paris and appreciate quality, service and an unusual degree of tranquility for this city, I suggest you stay at this charming hotel.

<Content>A jewel of a hotel in Paris. We stayed for 2 nights on 24th April and the hotel was as good as the weather. From the warm welcome you get as you come through the door to the advice on departure the staff could not do enough for you. The room was small (but hey your out seeing the sights all day) but was spotliness clean. Air conditioning was good due to the heat and towels changed every day. Just off the underground at Porte Mallot the directions given on the website were easily followed and took the worry about finding the place away. Breakfast is 11 euros but worth it when you consider the prices for coffee,danishes etc in some local bars.We would definetly recommend this hotel to any visitors to Paris and if we are back then we will be staying at this hotel.

<Content>Friendly and cosy hotel We stayed here in March 2007 and despite the weather being either very cold or absolutely tipping it down with rain the warmth and friendliness of the hotel seemed to lift our sprits. Nellie and her staff were so helpful in recommending restaurants for us to eat at, especially as when we arrived on Sunday there were not many places nearby that were open. Myself and my partner are fussy eaters as well, so this eliminated us being disappointed if we had had a look for places to eat ourselves. This way we had a fantastic and reasonably priced meal each evening.Our only complaint would be the size of our room. We stayed in room 52 on the fifth floor and while we did hear some of the other guests next door and opposite and in their bathrooms it wasn't too intrusive. The room overlooked the street so we would hear the rubbish being collected in the morning, other than that the traffic noise was minimal. We did struggle to fit our suitcase somewhere in the room and there wasn't much space to hang our clothes. However, the room was clean and the bed was comfy which is practically unheard of in some hotels! The other minor complaint was that the curtains didn;t meet in the middle, which we should have really mentioned ,but as everyone was so nice we didn't want to be the fussy english people that moaned! It never once spoilt our enjoyment.We would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again. Breakfast ok, it was included in the cost of our room otherwise we may have chosen to have had something hot, rather than continental.Great location, great staff and great atmosphere - worth a visit.

<Content>Nice locations, overall a good stay, with some issues I read a few good things about this hotel, I stayed in room 20 on the second floor. We had a lot of noise from the room above in the evening, luckly they only came back at 10.30pm but it could have been worse. The room was very clean and a great size, the beds were great and very comfortable. Breakfast in the morning was fine, and what I would have expected from a 3 star hotel. The staff are very helpful and friendly they do try hard to make sure everything is ok. Location is good we walked it to a few places from there. I would stay here again but maybe ask for a top floor room so there is no one staying in the room above, as the noice is quite loud.

<Content>Super little hotel There are lots of comments about this hotel on Tripadvisor  if like me you use these comments to book your hotels you take the majority view. This hotel gets into the top 10 in Paris because of the staff, location  just general good feeling it leaves you with. The hotel is small, I counted 25 rooms on 6 floors. We had a small room but the fact it had a wonderful terrace (rm 50) easily compensated for this - Ok the weather was hot - great for breakfast in the morning or a glass of wine at night - might not have been so good if raining. Location is great. 10 mins walk to Arc De T  20 mins walk max to Effiel Tower - best way to view it. Sorry but if you can't find the Metro from the hotel stay at home! It is v easy  v convenient for Louve etc on Yellow line  Sacre C on bue line. The area is clean  you feel safe. Some nice restaurants  bars in the area plus a nice deli  supermarket around the corner for cheap pastries  wine.A great little find this - fully justifies top 10 - Nellie  her staff only too pleased to help. Will definately stay again.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel - Charming Staff My family (husband, daughter and I) stayed at Hotel Foch during the first week of April for two nights. We had come over from London on the Eurostar. We only had a limited time in Paris so we are so pleased that it was such a wonderful time. Our room was clean and very comfortable. It was not huge, but this is Paris, not the US. The beds were comfortable, clean and warm. I am not sure what some other posters are complaining about. The hotel is so charming and spotless. The staff is incredibly nice and they really went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They gave us suggestions on things to do and tips on making our stay easier. We travel a lot all over the world and we all agree that Hotel Foch is now one of our favorite hotels! I will never forget our trip to Paris, nor our stay at Hotel Foch! We are already planning our next trip....

<Content>By far the best hotel in Paris!!! My family and I just returned from a week at the Hotel Residence Foch. I must say this is by far the best hotel I have stayed at in Paris. ( I have been to Paris 4 times). We stayed in the family room and were completely pleased. The breakfast was good and most of all the hotel staff were extremely friendly and kind.The room and the hotel itself was clean. They made my 6yr old child feel welcomed and comfortable. On our last day there she threw her arms around the one of the front desk employees and told him she would miss them all very much. The hotel is close to the #1 and #2 Metro lines, the RER train and the Air France bus to the airport. It is very easy to get around from there.We will definately stay here again and recommend it to anyone who needs a hotel in Paris.

<Content>A little of a let down, but still a good hotel My Family and I stayed at the Hotel Foch for one night on 3/16. The room was very nice; we had a family room on the first floor. The room was a big room, but I have two complaints. The first one is that the room was by the stairs, so anytime someone was going up or down you would hear them in the room. The second was that anytime anyone walked on the room directly upstairs from our room, we could hear it. The staff is very friendly and helpful; they gave me maps and told me what metro lines to use in order to get to site seeing locations in Paris. The only staff complaint that I have was that when we arrived on Friday morning at noon, the lady told me that the room was not quite ready and that they would put our luggage in our room. When we came back Friday night around 10:10 our luggage was still in the same place I had left it. Which made me upset because I left some valuables in the luggage and anyone could have taken it. Also good luck finding the metro, the staff will tell you that all you have to do is make two rights and you will run into the metro. I found that this is not the case. I picked this hotel because of the reviews I read previously; I have to say that I am a little bit disappointed especially since this is the 2nd best hotel in Paris according to Tripadvisor. I expected a little better.

<Content>completely over-rated I really don;t know what all the fuss is all about and can only assume the manager has lots of friends who keep topping up the ratings. OK the staff were friendly and that is fairly rare in Paris, but our family room was long and narrow, the bathroom was basic, and the radiators were turned off. The hotels does not look as if it has had any more attention than a coat of paint in the last twenty years. The location is OK but not great. For a hotel which is in the Top 10, I would expect much better.

<Content>Perfect for a weekend in Paris This hotel gave us a friendly welcome and were always on hand to answer any questions, even when we attempted them in French. Everything was of good but not excessive quality and bathroom and room were very clean. The owners obviously choose their staff carefully because everyone from breakfast to night porter were great. We had a room by the lift and were concerned about noise but there was none. Our room was neither too small or too spaced out and had a surprise balcony through the bathroom (Rm 50). So we enjoyed a cosy three night stay in a well to do location in Paris, with breakfast on the balcony and dinner in some superb local restaurants. From the Residence Foch you can walk to the Arc D'Triomphe, the Eiffel Tower and the local Metro took us to the centre and to Versailles (via RER) no problems. Would recommend  would go back.

<Content>Absolute Rave After studying Trip Advisor in depth, my wife and I chose Hotel Residence Foch for our stay in Paris March 14-19. I cannot over-emphasize how pleased we were with the hotel (and with Trip Advisor for cluing us to it). We travel extensively and I can honestly say that we have never met a friendlier or more helpful staff than the one Nelly has assembled. From the moment Isobel welcomed us to the hotel to the moment Bao waved goodbye to our taxi from the sidewalk, the experience was a real joy. Everything is as advertised and as others have described -- a great bargain, a lovely little breakfast arrangement, quiet location in a residential neighborhood. This last may seem a negative to some -- but get a Metro pass (the hotel's a five minute walk from both Metro and RER) and take the #1 train to the heart of Paris, minutes away. We thought staying in the 16th had its own pleasures anyway, and the hotel staff will direct you to local restaurants if you want to stay in the area for dinner. Our room (#14) was small but immaculate, and perfectly quiet except for some brief vendor noise (the linen delivery truck) one night. We will think of this small hotel as our home-away-from-home in Paris from now on -- such was the degree to which we were made to feel welcome and at ease, setting the stage for a delightful stay overall. Congrats to Nelly and company, and thanks again to Trip Advisor and previous reviewers.

<Content>Over priced, over praised. We booked this hotel as it was #1 on Tripadvisor, and we got a quote through the Venere.com link.On arriving, we were told we were given the best superior room, but it was a tiny, cramped room, nothing akin to the website. We understood that paying the extra money would mean we'd have a comfortable room with a bath in the bathroom. The bathroom was the smallest space I had every seen a sink, toilet and shower fitted into.On pointing out our disappointment the Reception staff just strugged his shoulder. We then found out that breakfast was not included, and we were charged 180 euro per night for the pleasure of a hard bed and absolutely no space. We were nearly dressing in our suitcases!When we had a question or asked advice, the staff were very friendly - but gave wrong or inaccurate information on each occassion.So no, we will not be returning to this establishment, and we will be very careful about choosing based on tripadvisors comments.

<Content>The Most Friendly Hotel in Paris Booked 2 rooms via this hotels own website for a long weekend break, I had been to Paris twice before and had not been very pleased with the Hotels chosen, so this time I read a lot of reviews on Trip Advisor and selected Hotel Residence Foch because of its high rating. We were not dissapointed, in fact we were delighted with the very cheerfull and helpfull staff who made our stay a most enjoyable one. The facilities are great and the rooms although quite small are very well furnished with very good quality linen, ironing board and iron, hairdryer, lcd tv, mini bar, room safe and tea/coffee making facilities. The Bathroom was large and bright well supplied with shampoo, soap etc and also lovely towels. Next time we will book the larger rooms which cost about an extra 20euros per night but after seeing them it would be well worth it. ( Room numbers ending in 20 are the larger ones). It is in a good location for the metro and also in a very quite district, so if you want a good nights sleep this would be a great choice.Thank you Trip Advisor and Hotel Residence Foch

<Content>Excellent service We stayed at the Residence Foch on March 15th 2007 for three nights. The Foch is very close to the Arc De Triomphe and Porte Maillot. It's not in the centre of town but being on the Metro yellow route was great for visiting all the places of interest. I wouldn't take a car there. Watching people try to park was a very interesting experience. The Foch is a lovely old hotel and the service is excellent. We had a family room which was great, even for two tall teenage boys. I would say the accommodation is right at three stars but the service is far superior. Breakfast was lovely- especially the chocolate bits. It didn't feel like a hotel- much more homely and warm. Also good restaurants nearby.

<Content>Very Nice and would recommend, but I would not rate in the Top 10 I would definitely recommend this hotel. I am surprised that it is consisently rated in the Top 5, as much about the hotel was good but I wouldn't say it was spectacular.PlusVery friendly and helpful staffGood valueQuiet, residential area (couple of embassies nearby)Convenient location (see below)ComfortableQuaintConUninspiring lobbySmall room (considering upgraded to a better room)Basic roomsLocation: the hotel is in the 16th and., which is not really near any of the sights (though we could see the Eiffel Tower from our balcony!). However, it is about a 10 minute walk to the metro (Porte Maillot) which is on a key metro line; also, given how good the Paris metro is, it is easy to get just about anywhere.Restaurant: Strongly recommend La Petit Pergolese (no. 38 rue Pergolese....don't confuse with Pergolese which is right next door....this one is good and has a Michelin star, but quite expensive); excellent food, atmosphere and good value.Breakfast: rather than the breakfast, we went around the corner to a nice Boulangiere and had coffee and croissants.....8 euros for two vs. 30 at the hotel.Airport Transportation: The best way to get from CdG airport is via the Air France bus (20 euros roundtrip); it drops you off at Porte Maillot and it is an easy walk to the hotel (if you don't have much luggage.....but if you do, walk across the street to the Meridian hotel and get a taxi to the hotel)

<Content>Solid stay at a great price Just want to reinforce the good press in these reviews. Stayed there in June 2005. Early check in was a bit of a problem (got there about 10:30am) for me and for some other guests, but the receptionist invited us to leave our things under his care in the lobby. Rooms were ready in under an hour. Chose a standard room if I remember correctly, tight but clean and comfortable. Good a/c. Bathroom was spotless.Very friendly staff and the older gent who does reception in the morning on the weekends is a character. Wireless internet worked well in the lobby, don't remember any issues in the room.Location is ok, its a quiet area and there are a number of decent restaurants in the immediate area. Little bit of a hike (10 min or so) from the nearest metro station at Porte Maillot ('specially when lugging luggage). There are no escalators to the metro exit if you take the most direct route out, but if you are willing to add some time, there are some escalators up into the nearby mall/convention center. Yes, you can get to the Champs Elysee quickly, but it is a long walk to the real section of the Champs Elysee from the Arc de Triomphe down to the river. Take the metro and get off at Etoille Charles de Gualle.

<Content>Superb, friendly hotel My husband and I stayed at this lovely hotel on a 'Valentine Special' and would highly recommend it. Nelly and her staff are very friendly and helpful and go out of their way to make sure their guests are happy. We will be telling our friends and will definitely stay here again. Thank you Nelly!

<Content>Deserve all the praise they get! We have suffered surly service, poor plumbing and some awful hotels in Paris over the years. These guys have really got it right. The reception staff are charming, the rooms outstanding for the price and the hotel is also in a great position. There are lots of small touches which made this such a positive experience. We will certainly return!

<Content>Below expectations Having seen the very good reviews on Tripadvisor and having experienced a really terrible Hotel in Paris 3 years ago we decided Residence Foch was the answer to our prayers.Problem was that our expectations were probably too high. Hotel very nice, staff very friendly, breakfast also very good. The downside was that our room, room 12, was very small. Could only walk around the bed (twin beds immediately alongside one another looking like a large double). Certainly could not pass one another in the room had to wait for one another. Although ceiling is high the room felt claustrophobic. Could see from the plan of the other floors that on each floor there was a similar small room. The other rooms on each floor appeared, from the plans, to be much larger. However our beds were comfotable, the decor nice and the bathroom good with shower over a small bath, toilet, bidet and basin.The hotel was, by Paris standards, very nice and good value since we had 3 nights for the price of 2. It was a little disappointing that this related to accomodation only and breakfast on the 3rd day would cost 11euros each. However we took the opportunity to have breakfast in a nice cafe nearby.The area is very nice, walking distance of the Arc de Triomphe and at the end of the Metro line so good for getting around Paris. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance to avoid a metro journey late at night. We must have seen 30 - 40 restaurants in the nearby area. Top tip is go to the top of the Arc de Triomphe at night - wonderful views and there is a lift if you can't face the 200 plus steps.Certainly would return to the hotel but would ask not to have room 12 or a similar sized room.

<Content>Couldn't have stayed anywhere better! I've just returned from a 2 night stay at the Hotel Residence Foch. I picked the hotel based on the reviews from other guests and I am so glad I did! This hotel absolutely deserves the raves it gets. My boyfriend and I were on a short trip to Paris and staying in the Foch was the icing on the cake. The staff is wonderful...WONDERFUL...and the hotel is quaint and excellently located. It is on a quiet residential street but we were only about 200 meters from 2 Metro lines and within walking distance to the Arc de Triomphe. When we arrived we were greeted almost like family! We were quickly checked in and when we came back downstairs we were given a map of the area and metro lines and given suggestions about where to go...when certain places were open...the location of a flea market...so much useful information given by the amazing reception personnel. Breakfast was standard European (which I love)...croissants, cheese, ham, coffee, tea, eggs, fruit, etc. All very good. I will be visiting Paris again soon and I will absolutely stay at Hotel Residence Foch. I wouldn't stay anywhere else!

<Content>Clean, friendly and a great breakfast Our family of four stayed for five days prior to Christmas. We walked from the hotel to Arc de Triumph about 30 minutes- children are slow walkers! Its in a great part of town and everything was interesting- even the corner shop and the butcher shop window. We thought the rooms were good but breakfast was the highlight- juice, yoghurt, croissants, bread, butter and jam,pastries, boiled eggs, ham, cheese, and the BEST coffee outside Australia. Its a real continental breakfast- not the soft sweet bread, nor the huge heavy Danish or muffins and watery coffee served in the US. Well worth 11 euros- kept us going until afternoon tea time.

<Content>Our Best Stay Yet in Paris My wife and I just returned from a five-night stay and had a wonderful time. It鈥檚 hard to believe the writer of 鈥淩eality Check鈥?stayed at the Hotel Residence Foch during the same time period; we had a completely different experience. The room was very quiet, owing to its location in a very nice residential section of Paris and to the lack of traffic on rue Garbeau. On the nights we stayed out late, we easily slept as long as we wanted (sometimes until noon). Our water temperature was always consistent, and we heard no more than muted conversations from guests or staff (perhaps) in the hallway. We skipped the hotel breakfasts, drank the free coffee in the room and simply bought Pain au chocolat at the Pastry Shop a couple of blocks away.If you want to stay at a boutique hotel where you experience true hospitality in a unique residential setting, then this is the place to stay. However, if you desire a hotel with a closer proximity to the action of Paris, this may not be for you.Our experiences with Nelly and Isabelle at the front desk were always friendly and helpful. They would ask if everything was okay and if there was anything they could do for us. The night of our anniversary we wanted to eat at a memorable restaurant, and at their suggestion we ate at Le Pergolese around the corner from the hotel. It was truly an amazing experience, but do be prepared to pay extra if you go. (During our dessert the waiter brought us two glasses of champagne, compliments of Isabelle from the hotel.) We will certainly stay at this hotel again!

<Content>Reality check ! Just back from 4 nights at the Foch. Booked it based on the glowing reviews here - taking my girlfriend for her birthday (and to propose). On a positive note, it's true the staff are very friendly and helpful, and the general ambience and location of the hotel are good. The breakfast was okay, but you do pay (12eur p.p.) extra for it.On the downside, the hotel was really noisy internally. One could hear everything in the room from other guests conversations, to the staff going about their work to, most worryingly, bathroom 'activity' in the adjoining rooms. Really wouldn't recommend it if you plan on sleeping much / beyond 7am (that's 6am UK time) in the morning. The room itself was okay but quite small. There was a serious lack of hot water for showers and in our room the shower head was propelled out of it's holder when the water was turned off - a major and painful shock on day 1.All in all, I've stayed in worse but given the price this was a disappointment and I wish I'd booked somewhere else for this special occasion (though luckily she said yes despite the hotel).

<Content>Fantastic Hotel This hotel deserves it's #1 rating. It lives up to all its great reviews - charming, elegenat, well located, wonderful, friendly and informative staff. We stayed in a family room and were amazed by its spaciousness and the bathrooms and its lovely decor. The breakfast was also fantastic. Highly recommend staying at this hotel - and have already passed the details on to other Australians travelling to Paris.

<Content>Absolutely Excellent! Excellent value for your money. Great Location, just 10 mins. walk away from the Champs Elysees. Staff are incredible and it was truly a pleasure to stay there. Rooms very nice, breakfast good. All in all a little gem!

<Content>Lives up to expectations Most of the reviews say it all so I'll try not to repeat everything.We visited Paris over New Year so we were looking for a reasonably priced hotel as we knew prices would be higher than normal. We booked this one and would recommend it to anyone.The location is excellent. Safe area, close to the bus stop for the airport shuttle, the nearest Metro and the Arc de Triomphe.It was great for New Year's eve as we were easily able to walk home from the Eiffel Tower area.The staff are really friendly and helpful.The room was on the second floor and although small, was very clean.Overall well deserved of its excellent reputation.

<Content>Unbelievable! This is my second stay in Paris on business and the first stay at this hotel. I've definitely found a keeper! The rooms are wonderfully comfortable, the amenities are great for a hotel of this size/rating, and the staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. After a stressful day of business meetings, it's so nice to walk into the lobby and be greeted by name!

<Content>A nice stay, but.... Just back from a 3 night stay that I booked after reading all of the reviews here. First things first- the staff is great. They are extremely cheerful (but not overly...), helpful, and well informed regarding the City of Paris and the surrounding neighborhood. The breakfast is very good- the egg boiler is a nice touch, and someone is always available to refill your coffee cup when needed.However, I am unable to rate this hotel higher than average because when I booked this hotel, I booked a double room- even confirmed that by email a few weeks before arriving. When I was shown to my room, I was surprised to not only see an extremely small (even more so than typical Paris standard) room, but also two twin beds pushed together. Now this may be a pet peeve of mine, but two twins pushed together is not a double, no matter how hard the staff tried to reason. When I asked if I could be moved to the double room I had booked and confirmed, I was told the hotel was full, and not offered any compensation to help soothe the oversight. Although I would not stay here again, some may like it, but the room snafu left me with a bit sour taste. Also- beware not to accept one of the rooms ending in #2 (12, 22, 32, etc...), they are the smallest rooms in the hotel, and are very uncomfortable...

<Content>Best Place in Paris, bar none My wife and I revisited Paris after many years of being away. It was Christmas and we wanted a very special place to stay. We read reviews on Trip Advisor and couldn't bebleive a boutique hotel could have that many good reviews. We took and chance and are we ever glad we did! Our stay at Hotel Residence Foch was a dream! the staff was exceptional, the accomodations perfect, the breakfast awesome, the friendliness above reproach. It was nice to get back to Paris after so many years and staying at the Hotel Residence Foch was the higlight of the trip.You cannot go wrong staying here.Hinkle, Austin, Texas

<Content>most welcoming staff We just returned from 3 nights at this hotel. We were an odd group of travelers - 2 adults and 6 children ages 4-11. We had two family rooms, one on top of the other. The hotel is very welcoming and homey. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, although not terribly modern. The most extraordinary thing about this hotel though is the staff. Nelly, the owner, and Isabelle, who works reception, couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. They made every moment of our stay there lovely - and accepted our noisy kids with open arms. They made sure we always knew where we were going, had enough chocolate chaud, and truly seemed to care about our experience.

<Content>The best Paris hotel I cannot fault this lovely hotel, Nelly and her charming staff made us most welcome and are obviously very proud and enthusiastic about the hotel. It is a little way out but very close to two metro stations and in a very nice, safe neighbourhood. There was a very nice laid back atmosphere and the breakfast was great. The only complaint is that our travel agent only booked certain rooms, ours was OK but next time we will book direct with the hotel and upgrade to a larger room with a balcony. Hugely recommended!

<Content>Little gem in a great area of Paris This hotel is in an ideal location for the Arc De Triomphe in a quiet location. You would not think you were in the centre of Paris. The area feels safe and is close to the metro and the airport bus stop.On arrival at the hotel we were met by the delightful Nelly who has to be one of the most helpful hoteliers we have met. very jovial with a good understanding of English. We stopped in a deluxe room on the top floor which is highy recommended. The room was not large but had everything you needed including a corskcrew and glasses should you wish to have a bottle of wine on the balcony with a view of the top of the Eifel Tower.Breakfast was excellent.A gem of a hotel we would highly recomend it

<Content>Very nice although a little pricey I booked and stayed one night at this hotel after reading the trip advisor reviews. The non-smoking room was very large by Paris standards, clean, comfortable and well appointed. Staff at reception were friendly and helpful.Location is good to walk to the Eiffel tower, Arc de Triomphe, Champs 脡lys茅s and central tourist attractions; access to the m茅tro is a short walk.Overall a very nice hotel in a quiet upscale residential arondissement of Paris.On the downside I found the price a little expensive, particularly the breakfast that, at 11 euros, is very basic. Also the floors creak and my upstairs neighbour reminded me of his/her presence a few times during the night.This being said it remains a very nice and welcoming hotel that would likely offer better value for money for families and groups or more than one or two to a room.Ian Davies

<Content>Lovely clean hotel, suited a family with 3 small kids, good location We have just come back from a stay in this hotel for 2 nights. The hotel is in a quiet street in paris. It is 20 minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower. and 10 minutes to the Arc de Triomphe. The hotel is one of the few in Paris that I could find that fitted our family of five in one room. We arrived a little early and the receptionist checked us in and let us put our bags in the room which was still being cleaned. The best thing about this hotel is the staff who are very helpful with directions and maps whether sightseeing our travelling elsewhere. Breakfast is very good. Not the cheapest hotel in Paris but I doubt anyone will not be satisfied by the rooms or the staff! The room we stayed in was quite big with a double bed (queen), two singles and the cot. Would recommend to anyone.

<Content>Even better the second time! I've just returned from my second stay at Hotel Residence Foch, and once again I have nothing but wonderful things to say. The hotel is lovely, quiet, and close to the metro for easy access to all of the city's sights. With its warm, friendly staff and beautiful residential location my husband and I felt as if we were staying not at a hotel, but at the Paris apartment of good friends. While there are certainly many beautiful places to stay in paris, Residence Foch allows you to feel like a part of the city for just a little while...rather that simply a visitor. Thank you Nelly...we'll definitely be back again!

<Content>perfect My husband and i stayed in this lovely hotel from OCtober 6th to October 9th for our first anniversary. My husband was already in Europe on business and I chose to meet him in Paris for the last leg of his trip. The staff at the hotel could not have been more helpful or speak better English. We had a standard double room with a large bathroom that even included ample counter space. In Europe, bathroom counter space is few and far between. The bed was more like a queen than a double and was incredibly comfortable. We had the breakfast which was 11 euros/person but was well worth it for the convenience and the fact it was buffet. The location of the hotel is a quiet residential area but we were no more than a 5-10 minute walk to any metro stop, the Arc du Triumphe, and the Champs-Elysses. Hopefully, you'll have the opportunity to meet Nelly the owner. She's just wonderful and deserves all the good reviews that are found on this website. We can't wait to return to Paris and this wonderful hotel.

<Content>Highly recommended My wife and I stayed 4 nights from 24 September. This hotel lives up to all the positive reviews here. It is conveniently located in a quiet street in a classy residential area, about 15 minutes stroll from the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elys茅es, and about 5 minutes walk from the Porte Maillot stop of the Air France airport shuttle bus, which is about 30 minutes from the airport. The staff at the Residence Foch are delightful.

<Content>Lovely I stayed at the residence foch for two nights from the 6th until the 8th of October. To book I鈥檝e used the hotel鈥檚 website and everything went wonderfully smooth.Upon arrival the atmosphere was intimate and relaxed, we鈥檝e received a great welcome from the owner, and he made sure that what was on his system was matching what we required.The room was very spacious (I booked a familiar room for my partner and I, which I really suggest in the end of the day its only 200 euros a night what can you get for that price in Paris just a few minutes walk from the arc de triomphe?) there was a small living room with a sofa, coffee table, a desk, the mini bar, and the kettle with coffee and tea (complimentary). Then there was a very good size bedroom with a king size bed (made of two large single bed together) a wardrobe a table and chair, chest drawers, a small TV, and a closet with an iron board, iron, safe, and more space for clothes and an extra pillow.People please remember it is a three star hotel don鈥檛 go mad and think it鈥檚 the top of luxurious decorations but this is the beauty of this place and for what you鈥檒l be paying it is worth more.The staff at the front desk could have not been more helpful, everything I needed was done and every information I asked was true, honest and incredibly helpful.What else can I say鈥?I am a platinum member of starwood hotels and I鈥檝e never felt so relaxed in any of the luxurious hotels I鈥檝e been like at the residence Foch. I really don鈥檛 see how any other hotel can offer a better service still giving you that warm feeling of no pressure like if you are in your own home.Thank you to all of you at the residence foch and see you soon

<Content>Small quiet and friendly Stayed here for 4 nights late September and were given a larger room with juliette balcony - rooms not large by American standards but good for Paris, they also have suites suitable if you have a family. Comfortable beds and air conditioning and unusually for European hotels a kettle with tea bags in the room and an iron and ironing board. I wish all hotels would do this. Excellent friendly welcome (good English spoken) breakfast with cereals, boiled eggs, pastries and good coffee and juice in small dining room. We particularly liked the quiet street without the traffice noise normally found in Paris.Small food shops just round the corner and not far to restaurants or metro but be prepared to do a lot of walking taxis are not that easy to get, take comfortable footwear!

<Content>Staying at Residence Foch? Read this..... Lovely hotel...no 'city' noise at night ! We stayed at Residence Foch after reading review in the Daily Mail and Tripadvisor and booked as birthday treat for my partner. Hotel Lobby is lovely and the greeting was genuine and very warm...not what you expect in a large city! We stayed in room 10, which is very small but beautifully decorated.. A little more storage would have been nice...if you are travelling with more than one average size case you might struggle ! Bed lovely and comfy..for us as we like them firm...thought the two champagne flutes were a nice touch..iron  ironing board, air con, safe and hospitality tray. The bathroom was large in comparison and with good facilities...great shower, hairdryer, new sink area  lovley big miror etc..if I was going to be picky (which I am) the old tan tiles were dated though. It would have been good to have a little more info on checkin...no prices in the room for the goodies in the mini bar...but it did come in useful for storing some fab pate  cheese that we snacked on ! We booked breakfast - despite some negatives in the reviews...we thought it was fine..good coffee, breads, preserves, croissant, cereal, yoghurts, fruit, cheese and ham...you can boil your own eggs if you like! Not bad for 11 euros in comparison to cafe prices! Thanks to Isabelle for the tip on the restaurant nearby 'Bistro Saint Ferdinand'...33euro menu, 3 good courses inc good wine and coffee..try this one for sure..the Creme Brulee was amazing! The hotel stairways and stained glass windows on each floor are lovely...any other critisisms...well, minor ones...might have been nice if they had recognised my partners birthday as they knew it was a special occassion (the restaurant even managed to put a candle on his dessert and we only mentioned it in passing to a waiter !) getting ice was a a bit of a task...we couldnt have an ice bucket but was given a glass..but we had to bring it straight back and you are between two metro stations...take comfy shoes ! Other than that we would stay again... On Paris...take time out to have a beer or two at a pavement cafe and 'people watch'.. dont do the top floor of the Eiffel tower...massive q's up AND back down to 2nd floor and view not that much better..we did it thursday afternoon and we waited over 45 mins at the top! in fact 2nd floor is open and you get better pictures with Paris in the background...DO go back and see the tower at night! Do research on what you want to see at the Louvre and go EARLY...masses of tour groups make it a bit of a 'scrum' at times...there is SO much to see, trust us, make a plan before hand or you'll get fed up trying to find things! We bought the 5 euro headset tour...not worth it as so much not listed. NotreDame...amazing from outside...dingy and we felt a bit dissapointing inside...be brave and do the metro, get a 'Mobilis' ticket for the day (zone 1  2 under 6 euros). Enjoy!

<Content>A WEE GEM IN PARIS We ( 2 adults and 2 young children aged 4 and 8) stayed here from 22nd to 24th September 2006. Arrived very late at night as the flight was delayed. Found the hotel very easily. If you are using the Ryanair Beauvais flight the bus drops you 2 minutes away. Safe easy crossing of roads with kids as all had controlled pedestrian crossings. Night staff at hotel were first class. Just handed over the room keys and we were in. No complicated check-in, no fuss. Kids loved the tiny elevator to our family room on the 3rd floor. room was great, if a little dated. It was spotless, beds very comfy and bathroom was spotlessly clean, with bath and shower, loads of toiletries and mountains of soft white towels. Apart from the decor looking a wee bit twee, the room was perfect.This in no way should suggest that the room needed re-decorating however as it really was in first class condition. Interior of the hotel in general is very nice, no complaints at all. Very clean, fresh and well maintained and no lack of that French chic you're looking for. Overall, very stylish. Breakfast is served in the small dining room and staff on duty in the mornings were as friendly as you could get. None of the problems we were warned about for families arriving in France who speak very little French. Everyone at the hotel spoke perfect English and tolerated very well our pathetic attempts at speaking French. During our stay, it appeared that the guests were mainly Scottish and English, with a few French. This hotel really is as good as the reviews which led us to book it. The staff will happily recommend a local bar or restaurant and can advise you on everything from Metro times to the weather forecast. Kids did not find the hotel too formal or stuffy, in fact they were in love with the place from the start. The winding staircase to the rooms is classic French, adds charm to the hotel and is easier to manage if you have kids than the tiny elevator. Outside the Hotel you will find youself in a lovely narrow street, with tall buildings on either side with balconies bursting with colour from hanging baskets and window boxes full of red pelargoniums. Very nice and atmospheric. The Avenue de Malakoff is at the end of the street and there you have the Port Maillot Metro station which is your gateway to all of the sights in Paris. We were able to reach The Troccadero ( station nearest the Eiffel Tower) in a few minutes. The Metro is very safe and clean. It is constantly patrolled by Police and security staff but the feeling is far from oppressive, it's very relaxed. In fact the whole city centre feels the same way, safe and relaxed. No crowds of youngsters intimidating visitors here. Stepping out of the station onto the street, you turn a corner and the Eiffel Tower is there in front of you. You first view it from an elevated position and you will want to join the hundreds of others taking photo's. Take time to stand and stare. Spectacular. Forget those who say anything negative about this. It is stunning, especially at night when it is illuminated. Don't go at weekends during the day or you'll queue for hours. Of course you can take the stairs but how many kids want to walk up an open air staircase to the hieght of a high rise flat? Instead, try what we did. We got up early on Sunday morning and got to the tower for opening time at 9 AM. ( just a few stops on the Metro) We got straight onto the lifts, and enjoyed a much more leisurely trip, no crushing crowds to scare the kids. Level 2 was high enough for them and saved waiting on a lift to the top. Antther highly reccomended sightseeing trip is the Batobus (a riverboat/bus) which you get from the Eiffel Tower. Costs only a few Euro's and is well worth it.The journey is worth it by itself and is another chance to rest up without stopping. Glass covered, the boats are ideal in all weather. We were lucky with hot sunshine so the creww opened up the roof for ventilation. take a camera!!! There are other similar boats run by other companies but they are generally much larger and a bit pretentious. The Batobus is fine. You can hop on and off at any or all of the 8 stops on the Seinne. Given that these include Notre Dame and the Louvre you will want to get off and explore. Take time to sit in one of the many outdoor cafe's and have a drink or a spot of lunch. It will give you a chance to recharge you batteries.Our 2 loved the freshly made crepes with chocolate, messy but a lot of fun!! All of the cafe's we went to welcomed kids and without exception the French people were warm,friendly and helpful. Kids weren't bored at all as there was plenty going on for everyone. Street shows of music/dancing/ rollerblading etc kept them amused while we took in the sights. The kids were as sad to leave as we were. Back to the Hotel, for a shower and a change of clothes we relaxed in the small bar with a drink. Kids were welcome there too with none of the dissaproving frowns you can get from staff at some Hotels. Checkout is fast and efficient and you'll walk out of the door onto Rue Marbeau with a sigh, vowing to return soon. This place is that good. Are there better hotels,of course there are but the beauty of this place is that it has a value greater than can be measured by the wee ticked boxes of facilities. The whole experience of staying at this hotel is that you are an individual. Stay at the Hilton if you like and you'll be just another number. Stay at the Residence Foch and you will feel at home, among friendly staff in very nice surroundings. Book it now!!

<Content>Great Hotel  Booked 2 rooms for 5 nights. Greeting upon arrival by Nelly who took the time to direct us to local restaurants (YUM!) and suggest the best places to visit in Paris and cheapest modes of transport. Rooms, airconditioned, whilst smallish were very comfortable as were beds. Breakfast, extra, were always excellent. Highly recommend this hotel. Will stay there next time in Paris.

<Content>super hotel I have booked this hotel for a customer visiting us in Paris who needed a convenient location near the business district with free wireless access and a good price quality ratio. I was very happy with the overall service (yes, nelly is great), rooms are very quiet, cosy and quite comfortable and I will book again for my other customers.

<Content>Lovely hotel with friendly staff We stayed at the Hotel Residence foch for 3 nights in Aug 2006. We had a brilliant time in pairs. The staff were welcoming and friendly telling us where the local RER and Metro stations were and how to get the various attractions around paris.The rooms were well kept and very clean. The bathrooms were spacious.The breakfasts were simple but lovely.Overall I recommend this hotel. I have stayed in Paris a few times and this was great value for money. We booked through a website that was offering 3 nights for the price of two! excellent!!!

<Content>Beware! Buyer beware! We had contacted the hotel directly via email - exchanged several very nice emails. Very friendly. When we went to check in, they did not have our reservations. When they finally checked their email records, they found it, and admitted that we did have reservations. They just could not understand why they didn't have the reservation, and they were full. They called around and found us another hotel. Much further away, not as nice, and a big disappointment. No offer of a free night some other time, or to pay for our room at the other hotel. When the receptionist was looking for our reservations, it became clear that they had a very archaic system for tracking reservations. If you're coming from far away for a once-in-a-lifetime stay in Paris, you might want to pass on this hotel.

<Content>Loved this hotel I can not say enough good things about Residence Foch, the staff and especially the owner, Nelly. I used the reviews on travel advisor to book our hotels throughout Europe and am so so pleased with the choices we made. Residence Foch is a fantastic hotel for those who prefer a small intimate hotel compared to the large institutional hotels. The hotel is very very clean, which is extremely important to me, and the rooms were just right. Nelly and her staff went out of their way to help us plan our days in Paris which included things that as tourists (who don't speak French) we would never have known about. Thank you so so much for everything. My two childern, ages 16 and 17 just loved it too especially since Nelly has a free laptop to use in the lobby. This is a great benefit as you can check email from home etc. Thanks again and I hope to see you again in Paris.

<Content>Great find! What a wonderful find! After many hours of research on Trip Advisor we settled on this charming hotel in Paris. Nelly and all her staff are wonderful. Everyone is so welcoming and made us feel completely at home. We had a family room with a queen size bed and a separate area divided by a curtain that had 2 twin beds. The decor was charming and we had ample room for 2 adults and 2 teenagers (not easy to find in Paris!). The hotel is in a quiet area, but very close to the Metro and Champs d'Elysees. Would love to return to Paris and would definitely stay here again. Nelly and Jean Paul are perfect for the hotel business, nothing is too much trouble and they have many tips and advice to help you enjoy your stay. This hotel was great value. In spite of the rainy weather we had, Paris was wonderful!

<Content>Magical Hotel 鈥?Don鈥檛 Miss This hotel is truly magical. However, don鈥檛 expect to stroll in and be stunned by a grand entrance or gloriously appointed rooms. That is not why the hotel is ranked so highly, a ranking it absolutely deserves. This hotel is very comfortable and radiates a welcome; like you just arrived home from a long time away. I believe the Residence Foch has such great reviews because they have the most fabulous staff that you may ever encounter at a hotel. Nelly the owner is wonderful, she makes you feel like family, old friends. We began our Europe trip in Paris, here at this hotel, and returned two weeks later. Our twins who are eight, while we were riding the train through Switzerland on our way back to Paris asked where we were staying in Paris, I said 鈥渨ith Nelly鈥?they beamed a smile that said it all. A lot about business and life can be learned from a stay here.

<Content>"KEEP THIS HUSH , HUSH, DON'T TELL ANYONE" Our experience at this hotel was excellent. Nelly and the staff are the best (friendly, warm and professional). The Foch鈥檚 location is in a nice quite neighborhood close to transportation. The hotel is very clean with good facilities (especially the A/C, it was hot hot, hot when we stayed in Paris). The breakfast was perfect (all fresh) and reasonably priced. We spoke very little French but did not have any problem communicating with the hotel staff who spoke fluent English. Anytime we needed help with directions or ordering food the Parisians went out of their way to assist us. Everyone was very friendly, warm and polite. We only had a couple of days to spend in Paris (not enough to see all the sights) but will definitely return soon. We hope to be able to stay at Hotel Residence Foch for our extended stay. Therefore, hush, hush and keep this review quite or we will not be able to return to THE FOCH. The 鈥渢rip advisor鈥?was a huge help in picking out accommodations that fit into our budgetary needs.Ps: It is still hotter in Florida

<Content>Absolutely the Best! Paris was the last leg of a 17 day France trip for my husband and me. What a fantastic way to end our trip with a stay at The Residence Foch. I discovered this hotel on Trip Advisor and all the reviews I read were right on the money. Nelly, hotel owner, and her staff, Jean Louis, Hedi and Slim were so friendly and helpful with everything from restaurant recommendations to booking tours, etc. The moment we walked into the hotel and Jean Louis greeted us we knew we were going to have a great stay. We have traveled the world several times and have never met a more accommodating group of people. The breakfast was fresh and wonderful. While there is no restaurant in the hotel it was not a problem if we didn't want to travel out to eat after a day of sightseeing. There are over 30 very good restaurant menus available for delivery to your room. Hedi assisted us with an order of Indian food that was fantastic. The hotel is close to the Arc and the Metro in a very safe neighborhood. A return visit to The Residence Foch is definitely in our travel plans.Rochelle Thuener

<Content>Nelly is the best We just returned from a three night stay at the Hotel Residence Foch. I chose the hotel based on the reviews posted on TripAdvisor. The best thing about the hotel is Nelly, the owner. She was warm, gracious and extremely helpful. She made getting around the city easy by providing detailed directions and maps and making suggestions for lunch and dinner. The hotel is more bed and breakfast with the warmth, comfort and familiarity of a rooming house. We stayed in a Family room (#40) which had a queen bed in one room and two twin beds in the other room which could be closed off by a curtain. We were able to open the large windows and enjoy the Parisian way of life. The rooms were well lite and there were plenty of mirrors. My children loved the size and decor of the rooms. The bathroom was large with a tub/shower combination. There was mildew above one wall above the shower. Also, after noticing that our sheets had not be changed, I left housekeeping a note requesting that the sheets be changed daily. You might also have to request washcloths. Nelly says they do use them in Paris.

<Content>A great little find Once again, thank you tripadvisor members for taking the time to write about places that make your trips memorable. The Hotel Residence Foch did not disappoint. The staff is friendly, and welcoming. The rooms are clean and quaint, and the hotel is in a safe and great location, close to the metro and a short walk to the Arc de Triomphe. We had a family room, which had a queen bed and two twin beds, separated by a curtain, should you choose to close it. It was very hot in Paris and the airconditioning was a welcome relief. This hotel can be described as more of a bed and breakfast, as a boutique hotel might conjure up thoughts of upscale and designer. This little gem is just that. A quiet, charming, and cozy place to hang your beret while in beautiful Paris.

<Content>Better than expected!! Thank you tripadvisor.com!! Nelly and her staff at the Hotel Residence Foch put forth their best effort to ensure that your stay in Paris is a memorable one. The Foch has many worthy attributes.1. Well-located - The area in which the Foch is located is safe, quiet, and walking-friendly. It is close to two metro/RER stations and is less than a 20 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe and Eiffel Tower.2. Excellent staff - Nelly et al are awesome!! They are super friendly and extremely helpful. It is this alone that makes the Foch an absolute must.3. Decor - The rooms are cute, the bathrooms are of excellent quality (Westerners will appreciate the shower/bath), and the furniture is very comfortable. Our room (#10) at times was a little musty-smelling (my only complaint) but this was hardly an inconvenience.4. Breakfast - If not included in your deal, it may be worthwhile including for at least a day, as it is truly Paris, sitting in a small area, eating croissants and drinking coffee with steamed milkers.I cannot say enough, but I will end by saying that the Foch was everything I expected it would be and more. I would definitely stay here again upon my next, eagerly awaited return to Paris. Congrats on being #1 on tripadvisor.com.

<Content>wonderful place to stay Location is terrific - lots of good restaurants - two metro lines - and you can walk to the Arc d'Triumph. Our room was on the top floor with a balcony and all the amenities were good. What makes this hotel special however, is Nelly- who greets you with a smile and is always ready to accommodate your needs. If you are coming to or from the airport, ask her about the shuttle service which was 36 euros (for two) and took us door to door.

<Content>Lovely Hotel I have just returned from a 3 night stay in the Hotel Residence Foch. I found the hotel to be ideally located, with the metro and RER stations close by. The hotel was clean and suited our needs perfectly. The staff spoke excellent english and dealt with any problems quick and efficiently. Upon my arrival there was a mix up with rooms but this was sorted very quickly and pain free.Overall i would recommend this hotel and if i go back to Paris i would return to this hotel without a doubt.

<Content>Lovely  We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Residence Foch. We prefer smaller, boutique type hotels over large resort types. Lovely room overlooking a courtyard garden. New bedding, quiet, comfortable. It is located on a quiet block in an area with embassies. Convenient to 2 metro stops. Arc de Triomphe is within walking distance. Owner was extremely friendly, helpful with directions, maps and dinner recommendations. Nice breakfast with soft boiled eggs guests can prepare. A great start to our 2 week Paris/Italy vacation. My only regret is not staying here on the last leg of our trip. We had booked another hotel in another area and were disappointed. If we get the chance to return to Paris we will definitely stay here.

<Content>Charming Parisian getaway My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Residence Foch, based on TripAdvisor reviews, from July 18-21. We had a wonderful time! This small hotel is truly a little gem. It's clean, quaint, well priced, and conveniently located close to two metro stations, as well as within walking distance to the Champs Elysees. Our room had everything we needed: good shower room/water pressure, safe, minibar, AC (essential if you're staying in Paris in the middle of a heat wave!), toiletries and a Juliet balcony with a lovely view over the quiet Rue Marbeau. But the best part was the hospitality and wonderful disposition of Nelly (manager), Isabelle, and the rest of the hotel staff. We wholeheartedly recommend the Residence Foch to anyone looking for a charming Parisian getaway. **Note: If you're looking for luxury or a mega-resort with all the trimmings, this hotel may not be for you.

<Content>A Fantastic Hotel I have just returned from a city break in Paris where my girlfriend and i stayed at the Hotel Residence Foch on Rue Marbeau. This hotel is by far one of the nicest establishments i have stayed in. A lovely boutique hotel easily accessible ( 10 minutes walk from the beauvais airport shuttle stop) situated in a quiet peaceful area of paris. The hotel is situated a few minutes walk away from many of the famous sites of paris while the rest are easily accessible via the close proximity of the metro station. The hotel itself is spotlessly clean, quiet and comfortable. The room we stayed in was perfect it had floor to roof windows which opened out to a coutyard ,an expansive bathroom, air conditioning and a mini bar etc. The breakfast is well worth the 11.00 euro charged offering a wide variety of fresh produce. The jewel on this hotels crown was the EXCELLENT service offered by its staff who were extremely friendly and approachable. All in all i would not hessitate in recommending this lovely hotel for the perfect break in Paris.

<Content>The Best Hotel in Paris! Hotel Residence Foch is superb! The hotel is clean, charming, quaint and in a wonderfully elegant and quiet neighborhood. Nelly and her staff are warm, efficient and helpful--impeccable hosts! They made our stay delightful. I've been to Paris several times, and have stayed in other boutique hotels and larger hotels, but this one is a true gem. The best part is, it is removed from all of the noise of the tourist areas, yet close enough to get to those areas in no time at all. Simply the best!!

<Content>Perfect, Pleasant, Paris! The Hotel Residence Foch in Paris was by far one of the best hotel stays of my life! Nelly, the director of the Hotel Residence Foch and her staff were so very helpful and courteous in helping us plan our days. Nelly and Isabelle showed interest in making our stay in Paris the best that it could possibly be. The entire staff at the Hotel Residence Foch was exceptional. The rates were also affordable considering the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar to the Euro. Our room was comfortable, quiet, and had absolutely beautiful views of Paris. My Fiancee and I were able to relax and enjoy Paris right from our room. The exterior  interior decor of the hotel was beautiful, chic, and authentic French Country style. The hotel is situated in an absolutely safe and charming neighborhood. The hotel is conviniently located to just about everything (i.e. Metro, Arch de Triomphe, Champs Elysees, Shopping, Local's restaurants, Cafes). My fiancee who has traveled and stayed in four-star hotels (e.g. The Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton) mentioned that the professionalism at the Hotel Residence Foch in Paris was just as great if not better! We couldn't have found a better hotel to stay in other than the Hotel Residence Foch. We will defiinetely be returning to Paris and to the Hotel Residence Foch in Spring! Also, there isn't a better place in the world to get ENGAGED in than in Paris! Sending my many thanks to Nelly and Isabelle for making my visit in Paris the best and most memorable vacation of my life! Merci Beaucoup!

<Content>great experience My wife and I just returned from paris. We spent a week at the residence foch at marbeau. The location was great. It is within walking distance of the metro, RERc, and porte moillot...which is key because the air france shuttle drops you off a 10 minute walk from the hotel..and will save you $$$. We stayed in room 51..which was not the best room they offer but fully exceeded expectations. yes the rooms are small but very user friendly. My wife and I are used to staying in larger rooms at spa type places...Residence Foch is our favorite hotel. The owner nelly is completely hands on and speaks perfect english. She's a charming individual. Issabelle is an equal delight and is so committed to making your stay outstanding. The negatives...really none..small elevator..who cares..By the way the rooms are impeccably clean. We had an interesting experience with frances' 2 victories in football the week we were there....The champs elysses was crazy...just a 10 minute walk from the hotel....but quiet at the hotel. In summary,1. stay at residence foch..you won't regret it..despite age, needs or interests...in my opinion.2. use carnet of 10 for the metro3. trip to versialle..21 euro including RER and full level pass to the castle.. buy at rer train station.4. museum pass..yes5. use rick steves book.Thats what we did and we had the time of our lives.arizona

<Content>Charming My husband and I loved this place. Nelly, the owner, is a delight to work with and extremely helpful. Our room, the blue one on the top floor, was darling. There was a lovely antique dresser, great fixtures in the bathrooms and we had a small/private balcony. Very clean and comfortable. The room was small by American standards, but just fine for the two of us and our many bags. I would definitely suggest this room, however note that the elevator will not take you all the way up and you will have to carry your bags up the last flight of stairs.Great location, great place!!

<Content>best hotel manager i've ever met My girfriend and i spent a wonderful 3 days in paris this april and were fortunate enough to stumble across this fantastic little hotel. As soon as we arrived, after flights from ireland and long bus journey from bouvais airport, the charm and warmth of the place washed over us. I swear it felt like walking in to somewhere you've known your entire life and the staff treat you just the same. The receptionists were constantly smiling and friendly, homouring my stumbling secondary school french, even though they all had impecable english. The hotel manager really did all that was humanly possible to make our stay an enjoyable one, god bless that little guy. If i owned a hotel i'd fly to paris and throw money at the man to come work for me. If flying with ryanair this is really your first choice because of its proximity to the bouvais airport bus stop.I defy anyone to go to paris and not fall in love with Residence Foch, cest magnifique!!p.s. the breakfast at an extra 鈧?1 is well worth it.

<Content>fantastic, friendly little hotel we booked this hotel for a weekend break based on the recommendations found on this site and we were not disappointed. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, pointing us in the direction of restaurants serving good food at sensible prices and advising us on where to go and how best to get there. The area where the hotel is situated is lovely, clean and quite and 5 mins from the metro. We loved this little hotel and will certainly return. Suggest upgrade if you are bothered about the size of the room, but was adequate and typically french.

<Content>Incredible Hotel This is a lovely hotel with great facilities but the best part is the services of their people. All the staff was incredible they help us with everything that we asked.Even though is a perfect hotel for honeymoon or a romantic getawy we went with our 2 years old and was perfect for a family too.The hotel is clean and have all the services that you are used to have in the US. The room was excelent and big for the Paris standard.The location is perfect with a walking distance from the Champs Elyses, two metro station really close and Porte Mailot in the corner with bus to the airports and trains.The price is actually a bargaing for what you get and because the location.We will come back there in our next time in Paris and will recommend to all our friends

<Content>Wonderful hotel, owner and staff I just returned from my first trip to Paris where I stayed at the Hotel Residence Foch. The owner, Nelly, and her staff make staying at Residence Foch an absolute pleasure. Considering the good location the hotel was much less expensive than I expected. I had a terrific balcony over looking an inner court yard. The bathroom was very roomy. The bedroom just a bit small but that included a nice desk, bed, closet and night stand. Whenever I had questions about Paris, getting around or just questions in general, Nelly and her staff were always very helpful. They create a very friendly personable atmosphere that makes you feel comfortable from the very start. My entire Paris experience was enjoyable, fun and positive in every respect and part of the credit for that goes to the Hotel Residence Foch owner and staff. When I return to Paris I'll stay there again.

<Content>A lovely hotel This is a very nice hotel, and the service is remarkable. The staff will do almost anything to make sure your stay is pleasant. The hotel is in a real neighborhood, with plenty of shops and restaurants frequented by locals, with the Metro and RER trains only about 5 minutes away. Rooms are a bit small, but are quite comfortable, and are decorated nicely, and ours had a balcony. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Going the extra mile I highly recommend the Hotel Residence Foch in Paris. My wife and I have stayed at this fine and well managed hotel on two occasions---the last being in April of 2006. We were so impressed by the friendly service, economical rates, clean rooms, comfortable surroundings and superb location during our first stay that we decided to reccommend Residence Foch as the primary Hotel to all our guests attending our daughter's wedding 2 years later. I believe we filled 80% to 90% of all their rooms. There were last minute changes and requests through out our stay. Nelly Rolland and her entire staff performed flawlessy during the entire time. Several times I found myself requesting services well above and beyond what would be considered as standard practice for hotel personnel, and they all performed to perfection. My wife and I do not speak French but we found it very easy to understand and communicate with the hotel staff. Nelly Rolland and her assistants Isabel and Jean Louis all had what I call servants hearts showing a rare, friendly and up beat attitude at all times. If anyone is looking for a reasonably priced and well located, small to medium sized hotel I highly recommend Hotel Residence Foch.

<Content>What a sensational little hotel My girlfriend and I spent a wonderful long weekend at the Hotel Residence Foch in February. As I was taking her to Paris for her birthday, I wanted to select a hotel that had character and not just part of a chain. Happily this hotel has character and charm in spades. The staff are helpful and very happy to make reservations in restaurants. While our room (52) was a bit small, it was more than adequate for 2 people, with a charming clean bathroom.There's a short walk to the metro and on Sat morning there's a small fruit and veg market around the corner.All in all a wonderful birthday present for my lovely girlfriend. She was delighted and so was I.

<Content>Best find ever Recently travelled to Paris to propose to my girlfriend. I had read about this hotel in the news paper in the UK some months before and it was supposed to be a great find. Well this hotel was everything I hoped for and expected. The owner Nelly and her staff really helped at making our stay perfect and even going as far to help recommend restaurants and make reservations. I have travelled all over europe and this hotel was amazing. The staff were so friendly and helpful and it was located perfectly. I would recommend this hotel to absolutley anyone travelling to Paris especially if you want more for your money. 5 star service without the prices to go with it.

<Content>Loved Residence Foch! My partner and I spent 8 nights in a room overlooking the small courtyard at the Hotel Residence Foch March 11 through 18, 2006. Two of our friends shared the streetside room across the hall. This hotel is truly excellent due to it's wonderful staff. Nelly Rolland, the owner, has put her heart and soul into this lovely hotel and it shows in every way. Example: While we were at the hotel another American traveller accidentally threw away her passport (!) Nelly noticed that the city garbage trucks were just arriving in the street outside Residence Foch. She ran out, told the driver to leave her bin, then WENT THROUGH THE GARBAGE BIN to find the lady's passport. Would you EVER have service of this type in a large hotel chain? No!It would be nice if the common areas were smoke free, but this is Paris, after all, and smoking is permitted pretty much anywhere, so smoking is allowed in the lobby/lounge area (one shared space). The location is very quiet, the rooms are lovely and comfortable, though, of course, not American hotel chain large. Internet access allowed me to keep in touch via email while I was there. Breakfast was generous (buffet) and tasty! I'd stay at Nelly's great hotel again anytime. Thank you Nelly and staff for an unforgettable Paris stay. You are the best!

<Content>We'll visit again! We followed the recommendations on these pages and spent the last few days of 2005 at this charming hotel. Nelly is just a delight and her staff, particularly the older gentleman who works in the mornings, was so helpful and friendly. They really went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.The hotel is located on a quiet residential street. The location is a bit out of the way but it's close to a number of nice restaurants, the Metro and the airport bus stop at Port Malliot. We'd choose it again over locations closer to the action. Our room was small but well decorated; the bath had a tub with shower and the expected shampoo, etc. We had to walk up a few stairs once we were off the elevator - if steps are a problem you may want to mention it when reserving. The windows overlooked the street but noise was not a problem even on New Year's Eve. We were never up early enough to check out the breakfast but the room was pleasant, just off the reception. In the afternoon we saw people using their laptops there. Looking forward to visiting Hotel Residence Foch again.

<Content>Definitely worth the rating! Booked a stay here after reading previous recommendations, and wasn't disappointed. Nelly was unbelievably helpful (definitely go to her restaurant recommendations), so were the rest of the staff. Only disappointed that we stayed for such a short stay. Very conveniently situated, and very near two metro/RER stations. Came as a family of 4 and the rooms were very generous. Will definitely be back!!!!

<Content>Good value and friendly staff This hotel is not in heart of Paris however this was not important for our visit.It is located in a quiet safe location but it is good value for money and the staff could not be more helpful- the cliche about rude Parisians does not apply here.... We stayed in room 50 which was small and simple but with a good sized bathroom and a lovely terrace overlooking an inner courtyard.The only problem we had was getting lost on the short walk from the St Dauphine Metro station on our arrival - this was entirely our fault as we had a very basic map !

<Content>I second the family value aspect Very quiet place to stay. Friendly staff and rooms were clean. We paid 220Euro for a family of 4 (room #14) with a view of a small courtyard. We had a queen bed and 2 singles seperated by a curtain. Side street which hotel is located on is clean and well kept. We found breakfast simple for 9 Euro each, so we elected to get our own breakfast from the bakery each a.m. and make coffee/tea in the room (average cost 2 Euro each!). Also due to colder temps we could keep a small container of orange juice on the ledge outside our bedroom window for the a.m. We loved the fact that the Air France stop from CDG was Port Malliot and only a 10 min walk away as was the Eurocar spot we rented from. We were off the main line metro so what others have said about that convenience is truly a benefit. Only downfall was the bathroom needed some renovation as it was in a bit of a timewarp from the 70s but overall it was clean and we had enough towels and toiletries that our family needed.

<Content>Great value Hotel... especially for families Myself, my wife and two children stayed at this great Hotel for a weekend break and we were very happy during our stay. It was an extremely hot spell and we were thankful for the room's air conditioning. I had problems finding rooms in other Paris hotels that could accomodate a family of 4 so this hotel was just what we wanted.The staff were very friendly and helpful.... great !The rooms are typically french, so don't expect ultra modern, unused furnishings. The wooden furnishings do not all match and show some signs of wear. Also, the room didn't look as fresh and colour co-ordinated as the website photos ...there was some unusual blue glass lighting decoration and blue wall decoration which looked a little tacky for my liking.I think this room needs re-decoration soon to bring it up to the standard advertised.However, we all agreed that we would sooner stay in the typical french surroundings than some characterless modern hotel which could be anywhere in the world !The room was clean, tidy,quiet and roomy. There was a mini-bar, bath with shower,hairdrier, kettle and free electronic safe/TV provided in the room. One gripe was that every day there were very few sachets of tea/coffee and no cartons of milk provided and because of this I had to make multiple journeys down to the reception to get supplies! Our room only looked out over the back yard .. so the view wasn't great. The continental breakfast was great. plenty of tea/coffee/hot hot chocolate choice of cereals, pastries (pain au chocolat for the kids !!).Overall, a great value, friendly hotel which is very close to the metro and the heart of Paris. I would love to stay there again.

<Content>Lovely Parisienne Hotel Very nice hotel tres parisienne!.In a non tourist area but nestled within a number of foreign embassies and other attractive buildings. Very nice part of Paris.Within reasonable distance of Paris center either via Port Maillot underground or RER or Port Dauphine depending on where you want to go.Deluxe room very nice not huge but more than adequate in comparison to other European or US cities. Credit card safes unusual but quite smart touch.All Staff extremely helpful,accomodating and cheerful.Couldn't fault it.Enjoy

<Content>Am I going mad!? We have just returned from 3 nights at this hotel and hate to be one of the first people to not find it so fantastic! We knew that we were staying in a cheapish (for Paris) hotel so didn't have great expectations initally, but after reading all the tripadvisor reviews which we always do before booking, we were expecting better.When we arrived we were shown to a suite (which we had booked over the phone). We were told on the phone that it was the one that was shown on the internet (creamy/brown colours) and it was a double. Our room couldn't have been more different - it was basic, tired and had 2 very small twin beds. When we queried this with the receptionist we were told that we had been lucky and had been upgraded (which wasn't in fact true as we were charged for a suite at the end of our stay!!) Also we were told we were not able to move as the hotel was full.The room was gloomy (at the back of the hotel) with little natural light and the beds were rock hard!! We were also surprised one night when we went to the bar for a night cap - no white wine, which is a bit odd being in France! Anyway, the positives. The hotel is in a very nice area of Paris although a little way out from the main attractions. The rooms were spotlessly clean (although the net curtains were grimey) and the staff were very pleasant.

<Content>Value for money. Hotel Residence Foch is a small quaint hotel, it has Parisian character  very friendly front desk staff. I stayed there for two nights, the room was not very big but it was managable, the bathroom was quite large and the shower pressure was good. I have no complaints with cleanliness, the hotel is immaculate. The rooms were well serviced etc each day. The location is slightly out of the city centre, however the Paris metro really makes it irrelevant where you stay as you can be in the centre in a matter of minutes, there is a metro station called Port Maillot about 10 mins walk from the hotel, this is the main metro line in Paris so you dont have to change trains and you will be in city centre in a matter of minutes. My only complaint was in the morning's, starting at about 8am the housekeeping staff, which conisists of mainly men, can make a lot of noise, running up and down stairs  banging cupboard doors. The old style hotel's do not always make for good sound proofing, its the trade off of staying somewhere with some character. I had a Do Not Disturb on my door however they still knocked on two occasions with a roar of Bonjour! A cupboard door right outside our room sounded like it was being banged of its hinges. We had a late night from the night before, but if your an early riser than this wont be a problem for you.Overall I would recommend this hotel as good value for money when compared to other Paris hotels I have used and I would stay there again.

<Content>3 star hotel with 5 star service Nelly and her staff were absolutely wonderful and friendly. They were very inviting and gave us lots of great advice on places to eat and see. The location was perfect, conveniently located near the metro, many great restaurants, and self-laundry service. The rooms were clean and very well maintained. I will definitely stay there again!

<Content>Fantastic Fantastic Fantastic We stayed at Hotel Residence Foch for 4 nights in september and just had to write a review because it was an excellent hotel.The room was perfect and we managed to check in early due to the fact that our room had already been serviced. We had a room that was perfect in size with working air conditioning, a safe, tv, minibar and a large bathroom.Everything was spotless and the room was fresh with large windows.The location is great because it is in the small side streets in a safe area (there are various embassies about) and close enough to the major streets and metro stations that you can get into the heart of the city by riding a few stops on the metro.The staff were extremely helpful and spoke excellent english and recommended a nice restaurant for us to eat in on our first night.All in all, if you are going to stay in Paris, I would completely recommend this hotel.First Class!

<Content>Nice Hotel We are stayed in the deluxe room on the top floor although the real room different from the website but still not too bad. Room bright  clean. Bathroom big.Hotel area very peaceful and near the local apartment, no noise at all in the evening. Only 30 mins from CDG Airport if no traffic use Air French Bus, if busy took 1 hrs so compare other area not too bad at all. Nice restaurants only 5 mins from the hotel.

<Content>Friendly, Service Oriented Paris Hotel My husband and I spent a few days at the Hotel Residence Foch with my parents and our 2 year old child. This was one of the best hotels we stayed at during our 6 weeks in Europe, and was definantely the friendliest hotel with the best service. This 19th century hotel is in a quiet neigborhood in the 16th near a number of embassies with good access to RER train lines, Air France Airport Bus, and the Yellow Metro Line (Line 1-main tourist sites-I think). Nearby are bakeries, cheese shops, restaurants, mini-marts, banks etc., and a Shopi drug/grocery store. The rooms were clean, spacious and quiet (our room faced the garden). Our room accomodated all five of our party comfortably; our sitting area was converted to a bedroom. As an added bonus, the hotel is fully air conditioned, something that was welcome during our stay in Paris. The staff was helpful and friendly. In fact, if the staff did not know the answer to a question or the equivalent word in English/French, they were more than willing to try to find the answer. The staff was able to suggest neighborhood restuarants that were friendly to 2 year olds and pleased picky senior's taste buds. The hotel's location near the Bois de Boulogne park which contains a children's playground, garden, amusement park etc. called Jardin d'Acclimatation (entrance fee and fees for some activies) was ideal for our 2 year old. These areas for children were, in my opinion, perfectly safe and we did not see any of the nasty things that the Bois is known for. If you have been to Paris and are tired of the loud, touristy areas or you are simply looking for a well run hotel, the Hotel Residence Foch is it.

<Content>Lovely hotel I agree with amost all of what's been said. It's in a quiet, very smart, area a bit away from the main sights but with easy access via the metro. There are also some shops nearby including a small 'open all hours' (except Mondays!) store in the adjoining road. The hotel, partly because of the neighbourhood, felt very 'parisien'. The rooms are quite small but very prettily decorated with air-conditioning and nice bathrooms. The breakfast is good, though maybe a bit pricey if you're not geting it as part of a package. Staff are charming and helpful. I'd definitely go back.

<Content>Excellent hotel This is an excellent hotel, and well deserving of the good reviews already written.The location is quiet, but being near to metro lines 1 and 2 direct access to the centre of Paris is quick and convenient. In addition there are a number of good restauarnts / bistros directly beside the hotel/ or even greater variety on Ave CDG (Neuilly) on the other side of port Maillot The hotel is impecably clean, and there are small added touchs that add directly to your stay (complimentary slippers were very welcome after the long hours spent walking) The staff are always on hand to answer any queries, and I even found the local people friendly and offered me directions when I was staring blankly at my map on the first day.Our room (deluxe) was Bright and spacious, and excellent value Would highly recommend this hotel for overall value and the enthousiastic welcome from the manager, and all the staff, who made a point of remembering your name / room number etc
