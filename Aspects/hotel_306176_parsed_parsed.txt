<Content>Singapore Airlines Stopover We booked this hotel through Singapore Airlines Stopover Holiday programme. We stayed here two nights before flying to Australia and this hotel had all one can need for relaxing city stay. The room was very clean and tidy, there was good amenities like bath rope, slippers, hairdryer, minibar, comfy bed and so on. All the basic luxuries one needs for hotel stay.However the only minus was a small room. There is enough room for two, but still for Singapore it was small one. And we had a view to the street above main entrance, and there was a dark gray building right opposite of us as Coleman street is narrow. So no view. However the room was quiet.Staff was very helpful and polite, pool area was nice, also breakfast was good. Location was great for sightseeing, bars, restaurants, shops and so on. Also lobby bar prices were not that high as I expected. Highly recommendable for short, relaxing stopover/ stay.

<Content>Nice hotel Spent 2 nights there to celebrate the New Years Eve in S'pore. Charming hotel in the very strategic location with proximity to the MRT and many interesting places. The room size is fair with a big double bed and nice touch of decoration, tough I found that the half/half curtain is rather weird considering the function. The bath room size is pretty small but nice tough need some improvement on the layout, it has very limited space to put your toiletries.The staff are courteous and helpfull. The breakfast was great, the food tastes nice, the cafe location and interior is charming. Good value and alternative for hotel other than those lining the Orchard and Marina area(which are getting more expensive nowadays) .

<Content>Good hotel, complicated internet access I booked this hotel based on reviews from TripAdvisor, 4stars classification and price. We spent the New Year night in the hotel too with the hotel organised party in the main hallways and club/bar (except the countdown when we went to see the Singapore Marina fireworks). The overall impression was quite good, very good location - close to everything in Singapore and the MRT, very comfortable bed and good quality linen and the fees/ prices are reasonable good value for money given the overall Singapore prices... The cleaning ladies are good and smiling, the dealings with most of the front desk personnel reasonable. I had two issues during our stay: the main one is the Internet access. It is incredible that in 2008 there is such a problem to connect to Internet in this 4 stars hotel! The normal fee is AUD 28 (approx USD24) per 24 hours (!!!) or AUD120 for 7 days (!!!). This is a wall / network connection with a short cable, hence no way to browse from the bed. During our stay we bought a new laptop and when trying to access Internet with the new laptop the connection was not working. After quite a few of phone calls to the front desk and a visit from quite a nice gentleman (service manager) we managed to fix it - initially I was told that the connection cannot be transfered from one machine to another?!?. Overall we wasted about 6 hours of our precious holiday time (and probably used the Internet in total 3....4 hours at the most over the 7 days) . We wanted Internet just for brief access times when buying stuff (for reviews and specs) but it became an expensive ($120) , time consuming and source of frustration exercise (and a lot of explaining to the big boss / wife). The other (minor) thing was after the countdown / new year at the hotel party - all was very well until 1AM when just when the guests were really enjoying themselves with most old and young dancing the floor, the band / organiser got tired or bored (who knows) and decided to suddenly close it off !!! , even if initially when asked, the hotel personnel said that the party will go on until 2AM or later if the guests are enjoying.

<Content>A Grand Time at the Park Stayed at the Hotel for three wonderful nights and enjoyed every minute of it. We availed of the hotel's weekend promo and was even upgraded to a de luxe room. The hotel is currently undergoing renovation though disturbance is kept to the minimum. Food was excellent and we love their breakfast. The staff were great and provided us with much help when needed. We also love the location its less than 5 mins away from the sub-way station and nearest shopping area. You can also walk to nearby tourist spot like the Singapore flyer, Esplanade and Merlion park. Will definitely stay here again. Though this hotel is not for the budget conscious, but you'll get your money's worth once you try it.

<Content>Grand Plaza Park Hotel City Hall Rooms not overly spacious  bathroom very small, although adequate  very clean. A la carte breakfast menu limited and nothing special although staff attentive  eager to please. Concierge  door staff very helpful.Average value for money, but probably reasonable for Singapore where accommodation seems to have got quite expensive over the last couple of years.Conveniently located near MRT station (10 minute walk), shopping plazas, convention centre (20 minute walk)  away from the frantic pace of Orchard Road.

<Content>Good hotel but ageing  The Grand Plaza is located very well with very easy access to Orchard Road.The reception is efficient, the staff very helpful indeed. As other reviewers have noted, they try very hard to please.The rooms are adequate. Nothing very special, decent bed, decent TV  Internet access.However, possibly my fault as I booked the same week I stayed there - I found it VERY expensive for what was on offer. I paid SG$ 450++ for an Executive Floor room.The Executive Floor lounge is small  the breakfast is limited to say the least. The bedroom I was in was fine  relatively modern but the bathroom was old fashioned  the shower was older than me!All in all, fine hotel, great service but way over priced for what you get in my case.

<Content>Enjoyed the Grand Plaza Park We stayed in the Grand Plaza Park Hotel for 2 nights on a stopover in Singapore. On arrival the reception attendant was extremely polite and helpful and this set the tone for the rest of our short but enjoyable stay. The room was clean and big enough for the two of us. The breakfast buffet had everything you could want. On the second evening we had a drink in the bar while we listened to the live music. All in all we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Top Hotel Booked this hotel as part of the Singapore Airlines stopover. Was given a free upgrade to the 7th floor. The room was large and very clean. Service in the hotel could not be faulted. No matter what we asked for it was no trouble at all. The lady that did the room of a mornig was very helpful when asked for additional tea and milk. Each day when we returned there was additional tea and milk left for us. On the day of departure the hotel gave us a late checkout to 4.30pm. I would have no hesitation in staying here again and would recommend to anyone. Location brilliant, staff and food first class.

<Content>Fantastic location Good value booking via ba.com. This hotel offered us everything we expected. I'm suprised to find others suggest that the rooms were shabby or dark. Maybe we were lucky as our room was freshly painted and well lit. The furnishings were modern (including an excellent full size desk) and the only thing that possibly needed replacing was the slightly worn carpet.Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was fantastic and plentiful. Pool, although not large, was refreshing. All in all a great stay and we will be returning on our way back to the UK next year.The clincher is the location. Easy walking distance of all that you might want to see in the city and only 200m from the metro if you want to explore further. Unless you have heaps of luggage (we did but left it in storage at the airport) you can easily get here on the metro without breaking sweat - well maybe a bit :-)

<Content>Solid, but not grand This is a perfectly respectable hotel, but you might expect better. The location is nice -- justa few blocks from the raffles hotel and shopping center; easy access to the riverwalk and to the subway. My room was well-maintained and fairly comfortable, but it was small and the window faced a wall. The front desk is efficient, but theconcierge desk was pretty usefull-- they could give out brochures and make bookings, but were not knowledgable.

<Content>service through gritted teath! On arrival we were delighted to be told that we had been upgraded to a club floor room. The room itself was small, the bathroom tiny and the decor and lighting were poor. Internet access was available for a reasonable fee. After a long flight we were hoping for a lie in, sadly this was not to be as despite having the do not disturb sign on the maid ricocheted through the door armed with a vacum cleaner at 8am claiming not to have seen the do not distueb sign. A call to receiption failed to get an apology for this so they were not off to a good start. That evening we though we would check out the club lounge only to find out that as ''upgrades'' we would be charged for everything in the lounge - I mean that is like getting an airline upgrade to business class and being served economy class food. Bearing in mind we had not asked for the upgrade and it probably only occured becuase the hotel had oversold its standard rooms that came as yet another dissapointment.The service was extreamly average for Singapore, food was pretty much ok and in terms of location then the hotel is well placed for all the major shopping and entertainment areas.

<Content>Fading quality We stayed there for two nights in early August. There was a time when the Grand Plaza Park Hotel City Hall was truly a great luxury hotel, but these days are gone: the furniture in the rooms urgently needs upgrading, the rooms and bathrooms are comparably small.For the breakfast in the room, our order got mixed up, and the food was not exactly fresh. There is no complementary mineral water in the rooms.The only redeeming features were the location (GREAT) and the offer to use the pool/shower even after check-out to freshen up for an overnight flight. For that money, there are places with better service and quality features in Singapore, provided you shop around.

<Content>great hotel, best service ever We had a one night stopover on our way back from Europe and from the moment we arrived to our departure, we experienced excellent service from every staff member. The check-in was fast and efficient and we were given a room straight away despite arriving mid morning. The room was very good with a view of Singapore and every time we walked in or out there was someone ready to help us. Everyone was so charming, smiling and helpful. We wished we had stayed another night. Highly recommend this hotel because of it's service, location.Coud not fault in at all.chantal

<Content>Perfect For Our Needs I flew out to meet my teenage daughter who was arriving from Cairns, we wanted a centrally located hotel which didn't cost the earth and this hotel certainly fitted the bill. We caught the MRT to City Hall and the hotel was just around the corner, easy even with luggage! The room was fine twin beds, mini bar with fridge space for our own drinks! I have to say the only criticism was that the shower was never really piping hot. There is a swimming pool and well equipped gym on the third floor, very relaxing in the late afternoon. A nice touch is that you check out at noon, the hotel store your luggage and you can use the gym shower to freshen up before your evening flight. Raffles City Shopping Centre is two minutes away, there are several mini markets close by and the Quays are within easy walking distance, quicker than taking a taxi! We paid 拢95 per night for the room including tax and service, which seemed good value to us by Singapore standards. Never used the restaurant or bar so can't comment. Staff very friendly and helpful. Would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Will visit again As said in other posts, great location and good old fashioned customer service. Rooms were nice and clean and good value for the price. Beds were really comfortable.A big plus for us was checking out and then going out to shop etc but returning and able to use the pool and pool showers before setting out for the airport.Stayed both ends of our trip to Australia and will definitely be staying there again.

<Content>Great location Our check-in was slow, but led to a room upgrade which was an unexpected and pleasant bonus. The room was large and very well furnished in a modern Asian style. However, the foyer, particularly the soft furnishing, was a bit tired and could do with an upgrade.On first morning we were still in the room when the staff came to service the room at 9.30am. When we returned at 2.30pm it still hadnt been done, which was disappointing. They eventually arrived at 2.45.The hotel is in a great location for shopping, sightseeing and the MRT.

<Content>A modern, classy hotel Slightly on the expensive side but then you will struggle to find cheap accomodation in Sinagpore. The hotel has a fantastic feeling to it, modern but not tacky  just feels like quality. Live music  a popular restaurant add to the atmosphere. The rooms are spacious, modern, clean  classy, lacking only a view. Overall an excellent stay with great service.

<Content>Heaven or . . . . This is a saga of my stay in Singapore which began like a perfect stopover after a long journey back home after 5 weeks touring Turkey. I'd experienced every sort of accommodation  now Singapore was to be my 5 star experience.And it was, to start with. We arrived well before check in  they kindly gave us a beautiful room immediately. The reception is decked out in granite, the staff were polite, efficient  delivered us to our room in an orderly, friendly manner. We had a 3 day stay, breakfast was an extra charge but we took advantage of the Singapore Airlines stopover discounts  received 50% reduction on our charge for breakfast. The porters, concierge always greeted us as did the restaurant staff. There are about 6 lifts, its fully airconditioned, beautifully appointed with white towelling robes. The continental breakfast buffet was well worth it at S$15. We had a late check out  use of gym, pool  shower to freshen up before our late flight. Of all the hotels we had stayed at over our 5 weeks travelling - this was to be THE best. One unfortunate encounter left a sour taste  I hope it won't happen to anyone else. The bar has a happy hour which we also took advantage of  enjoyed a drink, noticing that the staff were a little pushy about removing unfinished drinks  eager to serve more. A little unsettling. Later that night, I sat outside the bar waiting for my husband (listening to the music)  a young bar female staff member rudely asked me leave the area, why? because I was not drinking. I reported this comment to the manager the next morning who apologised  said they were trainee staff  gave me a free drink voucher. However, the damage had been done. It had put a cloud over my stay. The moral here is 'stand your ground'  if a member of staff gives you a hard time ask for the manager immediately. I felt that this behaviour was unacceptable in any form. To his credit, the manager repeatedly asked if there was anything further he could do for us  was most embarrassed by what had transpired.

<Content>Where to stay in Spore Stayed at Grand Plaza Hotel, Singapore for 3 nights. Good location and very clean room. Receptionist was excellant. Arrived at 7 am after a long flight and it was pouring rain outside. It was understandable that I needed to wait for someone to checked out before I can have the room so I waited about 40 mins. I had a good rest before I started my day fresh. The room is a bit small good enough for 2 people and the set back is the swimming pool and gym is another block away. It would be nice to use the facilities. The housekeeping staff were warm too. Plus side the MRT is 5 mins away and plenty of eateries. Would stay there again.

<Content>Excellent Value for money and outstanding service. I must say that on my stay at Grand Plaza Park Hotel City Hall I was a bit apprehensive that it would not really be up to standard and after checkin it seemed my fears where about to come true.To be fair I had checked in about 5 hours early, though this did not seem to be a problem - I was then given a room and to my dismay it had not been cleaned from the last guest. I went to reception and complained and within seconds they were on the phone to housekeeping and giving them the riot act. They also upgraded my straight away and where very apologetic and the reception manager had also become involved.I was then given a room of which my security card did not work and after trying for about 10mins decided to return to reception yet again. I actually found this quite amusing with reception looking very worried - they where ever so helpful in getting the problem sorted and also gave me free drink vouchers in their cafe/bar.Once finally in my room - large, comfortable and clean though nothing outstanding I had no further problems with my stay, well except for falling asleep in the Spa having a massage after a long flight and 36 hours with no sleep.This place seems well frequented by regular business travellers and the bar and resturant downstairs where also quite popular with locals as well, always a good sign. The resturant is nothing to write home about, though the food was nice and fresh.I would happly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good, clean hotel with outstanding service. Better than a lot of 4/5* places I've stayed at. Cant wait to see what the place would look like with a bit of a renovation and update of rooms.I'll be staying here next time on my way through - excellent value for money.rgdsB.Cleaver

<Content>Great Hotel We loved our stay at the Grand Plaza Park Hotel. We were on a stopover of 2 nights each way to and from New Zealand.On our first stopover we booked a Club Room (floor 9) and were so impressed we upgraded for our return visit and we were given a room on floor 10 which was even better.After a tiring day of sightseeing etc it was lovely to be able to relax around the pool area. I have never been in a hot pool that was so hot! Staff were very friendly and efficient. Could not fault the hotel at all. The location was spot on. Easy to walk to the Boat Quay and Clarks Quay. Walked to Chinatown, but due to the heat we had to get a taxi back! Close to all other areas and the MRT is just round the corner, which is clean, efficient and cheap.Loved Singapore and will definately be back.

The other reivews have covered the basics., the hotel is well placed for access to transport, the concierge is excellent and the staff in general are helpful and efficient. The hotel is well priced for what it is and the pool was delightful. The beds however were another story, they had to be the hardest I have experienced in a very long time, so hard that sleeping was very uncomfortable and in future would put me off staying here. SInce my stay I have been told that this is typical of hotels in Asian countries howver this is not my experience and the marriott in Singapore,, which I stayed at on a previous trip and although substantially more $ to me would have been a better buy for the better sleep. Sorry guys., your hotel is great, but your beds suck, I hope you can do something about them.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Staff We stayed two nights at this hotel prior to and after a cruise originating in Singapore. We chose the hotel based on reviews from TripAdvisor travellers and after reviewing comments on the original hotel selected by our travel agent. Upon our arrival at the hotel, we were surprised to learn that it was the same one we stayed in 7 years ago, albeit with a somewhat different name. The front office staff were both welcoming and professional - they also upgraded us to a Club floor! The room was large and well-appointed with a mini-bar fridge and coffee/tea-making facilities. It was also non-smoking and contained the queen-sized bed requested by our travel agent..The hotel is clean and well-maintained and beautifully appointed throughout all of its public rooms. Staff at all levels were friendly and efficient, especially the concierge and front desks. Our booking also included an American breakfast which did not disappoint and which contained both Asian and Western fare.We used the lovely outdoors roof-top pool which is surrounded by lush shrubbery and fountains.The hotel's location and Coleman Street is ideal for walking tours of Singapore and is only 10 minutes walk from Clarke Quay.A good choice of hotel at a reasonable rate and it will be, once again, our home-from-home on our next visit to exciting Singapore.

<Content>Average Hotel but Above average Service The Grand Plaza Park Hotel is in a very good location if you're in Singapore for shopping because it is just outside the Funan IT Mall, very near the Suntec Mall and Marina Square and is across the City Hall MRT station -- where you can get on the MRT and in ten minutes you're in Orchard Road for more shopping. Also, it's just a hop and a skip to the smaller Raffles City Mall where there's a great mix of brand name stores.Unfortunately, I can't bring myself to rave about the hotel facilities as I found the rooms and the amenities to be much less than what I had expected for the price they charged. The room was small and quite worn down (with a large and scary stain on the carpet). The furniture really needed to be changed and the beds were not too comfortable. The business facilities were much better. The function rooms were very nice, high ceiling, spacious and very conducive for meetings. Service though was very warm, attentive, efficient. All staff had a professional yet welcoming air. I was impressed with check in and check out service as it was conducted with great speed and courtesy. Doormen and bellhop service also very efficient and on the night I checked out, which was quite late, the doorman had to go out and secure a cab for me on the main road -- everything was done with great service. I was quite impressed.I give the hotel top marks for service but they do need a major renovation.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Booked this hotel for a stopover after reading tripadvisor reviews. We couldn't have been happier. Every staff member has been so helpful and friendly and effiicient - without being over the top. Nothing is too much trouble.We arrived at 5 am hoping for an early check in - the manager said as soon as housekeeping arrived they would get a room ready.We had breakfast while waiting and by 7 am we were in our room. A corner room with great view and huge bathroom. They even gave us a rollaway bed for our son even though we were expecting to share the king bed with him. Later we found out this was a deluxe room even though we had only booked a superior.The pool area is gorgeous - hardly anyone seemed to use it though. Absoutely spotless everywhere. Lot's of shops close by.We have rebooked for our stopover on the way home.

<Content>Good Hotel This is a good hotel in a great location. The hotel itself is fine, good rooms, all very clean and pleasant. Staff are friendly and efficient. The concierge was helpful in booking tours, providing a map etc. The restaurant (ground floor) has acceptable food, if a limited menu. The buffet is ok but you'd get tired of it pretty quickly. We didn't use the restaurant upstairs. However, it is not necessary to eat at the hotel as it is well-placed for several shopping malls with food halls and also the Riverside Walk (about 10 minutes stroDll away) with all of its dining choices. Several other hotels, including Raffles, are also within easy walking distance.Our only complaint would be the price of internet access. In the room it was 28 SD for 24 hours plug-in connection (over 10 sterling, 20 USD) and in the public area 12 SD (over 4 sterling, 8 US) for one hour, and this you have to purchase hour by hour - no avoiding the cutoff! Bearing in mind that 5 minutes walk away you can use an internet cafe for 3 SD an hour (uninterrrupted) the hotel charges feel like a rip-off.Overall I would definitely recommend Plaza Park, but avoid using the internet access until they drop the charges!

<Content>Good, Central location. We had a three night stay at this hotel which I booked direct through the hotel website after reading various reviews.The location is good, very central for visiting various places of interest and the City Hall MRT station is just around the corner for visits further afield.The check-in and luggage handling were very quick and efficient and our early morning check-out was good with the taxi waiting for us.The bedroom and bathroom were a good size and well stocked and the rooms were clean and tidy.The reception and dining area was very light and bright although the buffet area was a little on the dark side. The bar was close to the dining area and could be a bit lively and noisy at times.The staff were helpful and friendly and most had a smile and a cheerful greeting when you met.Overall a good place to stay, central and easy access to public transport.

<Content>Club rate not the best for business travellers I booked the Club rate for the Grand Plaza which provides dedicated rooms and services for business travellers. The advantages are free internet, use of dedicated club lounge, free breakfast, free cocktail hour, free 2 piece laundry per day, and personalised check-in service. The club staff are very helpful and friendly. The main disadvantages were: 1) the size of the room - a twin share is too small for colleagues to share. The only desk in the room is less than one foot from the end of the bed, which means either sitting on the bed to work, or sitting off to the side! It's hard to imagine how this could be presented as a workspace for business travellers. 2) Breakfast - the breakfast offering (in private club room) was appalling - barely warm eggs and bacon in a warming tray, cereal, sweaty cheese. 3) Internet access - free but slow and unreliable. I wouldn't recommend the club rate for people who intend to work in their rooms while on a business trip. The hotel would be a great option, however, for tourists because of its location.

<Content>Stock standard business hotel...good location We booked a base room here for 3 nights (Fri-Mon).Check in was quick  professional,we were upgraded to a Club floor room,just room no benefits.Room had a work desk  a view of the Excelsior across the road although to the right you could see Fort Canning Park.Decent size with king size bed which was great.Bathroom had a bath with shower  a separate shower???Had very little staff contact but concierge was cheerful  happy to help out with info.Cleaning staff were thorough  non intrusive.We never eat at hotels,especially in Singapore etc with great food everywhere so I cant comment about restaurants or breakfast ($24).Pool was small but clean  very quiet,didnt use the gym.Funan IT mall,City Hall MRT  Raffles SC are all 2 minutes away.Overall it was fine but I probably expected a little more for a hotel ranked so highly here.

<Content>Not worth the money... What an awful place. The rooms need major updating, I haven't seen a non-flat screen TV in a hotel room for ages. Tired-looking walls and hard, uncomfortable bed. Terrible service at breakfast - we were barked at by one of the staff that the buffet would be closing in 10 minutes. Slightly less efficient concierge than I would have liked. Will not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stopped over for two days in Singapore on our way to Australia and we were delighted that we chose this hotel to stay.It is very central to shopping, restaurants etc. The staff were particularly pleasant and could not do enough for us.The room was very large and well stocked.We somehow managed to join into the wedding party for the nightclub singer who was leaving to live in England and had a great night dancing, drinking and eating!I went to Singapore not expecting very much but came away very impressed with everything about the city and intend to go back again in the future.

<Content>Great Location and Great Hotel This is a great hotel. As soon as you walk in you are struck by how clean and frsh in appearance the hotel is. Check in was also very easy. The location is very close to the City Hall MRT making it very easy to get around. The area is quiet, the staff attentive and the breakfast (included in the price) is more than sufficient with a lot of choice The rooms maybe described as smallish compared to Australian standards but they are ok. The bathroom is also a bit small with only enough room for one person at a time but that to us was also fine. My wife and i do not share bathrooms space well anyway. Housekeeping do a great job cleaning the rooms and we had no problems or complaints.The pool area is clean and well maintained, the gym although small has enough treadmills, bikes and almost brand new weightlifting equipment to keep the most devoted happy. (Its all brand new Nautallis equipment).We stayed on the 10th floor which is the executive club level. Free tea, coffee and biscuitys throughout the day and from 6-7.30 at night free drinks and nibbles. The staff in the club room are once again very friendly, polite and proffesional.A very pleasant stay and well worth a high recommendation.CheersHowzat Perth WA

<Content>Enjoyed our stay I am a first time traveller overseas with my husband, therefore we are comparing to 5 star accomodation in Australia. We read the reviews on all the hotels in Singapore and decided this was the hotel for us. The hotel was very clean, although the furnishings are getting old and need updating in the rooms and eating areas. We found the staff very accomodating and the buffet breakfast and dinner meals changed all the time. The hotel was central for all our travelling. The only bad comment, we were on a non smoking floor, yet the wardrobes smelt smoky. There was a cross section of travellers. When we go back to Singapore, we would stay again as good value for the priceOver 50s from Adelaide

<Content>Great centrally located hotel This is a great hotel in a very central position - a short walk to the MRT station and within walking distance of lots of the main attractions. As we stayed for 6 nights, we were given an upgraded room which overlooked the pool; it was spacious with a separate business area and large bathroom. We were also given complementary breakfast as we were staying for 3 nights. Overall the hotel was great - a good buffet breakfast and helpful staff. The pool area was small, but well kept and not crowded. This hotel is not expensive and we felt that it was excellent value for money.

<Content>Fabulous stay ! We enjoyed our stay (22/01/08-27/01/08) with Grand Plaza Park Hotel City Hall (Singapore) very much. First, we would say that the service from the staff is exemplary. Without fail, everybody greeted us friendlily at every occasion and quickly assisted us where ever possible. The positive and relaxed feel that radiated from all the staff was really amazing which is a true asset to the hotel. The quality of all facilities (the pool, lobby and breakfast service) easily met and exceeded all expectations and the rooms and appliances were surely adequate. Transportation was made very easy through a constant stream of taxis always present and the central location and the MRT only 1 block away made getting around Singapore very easy. The Grand Plaza Park Hotel City Hall (Singapore) set itself an exceedingly high standard that others in the industry can only aspire to, which made our stay very good value for money indeed. As we expect to be travel to Singapore more often in the near future, we will most certainly stay with them again (we've stayed with Copthorn Orchid and Waterfront before .... they simply don't compare .... different league all together) and we have no hesitation to recommend Grand Plaza Park Hotel City Hall to family, friends and colleagues.

<Content>Successful stopover hotel We chose the Grand Plaza Park from the hotels on offer with the Singapore Airlines stopover package, after researching on Trip Advisor. Our stopover was on the return leg of our trip to Europe (flying back to Australia from Paris). We wanted a hotel that would provide a double and a twin room on a non-smoking floor(we are a family of 4), in a fairly central area (so we could walk to Chinatown, Little India, Clarke and Boat Quays etc), and with late check-out (as our flight out of Singapore was at 9.10 pm). We also wanted a hotel that would be pleasant enough to spend all weekend in, if we just wanted to hit the beds and stay there! (not knowing how tired we would be feeling after four weeks away and a number of flights). Our flight to Singapore got us in very early on a Saturday morning, so we were at the hotel at about 8.00am. The twin room was ready, and the staff were happy for us to move into it and wait for the double to be ready (suggesting that would be by 12.00 midday). Our teenage daughters went straight to bed, and my husband and I went for a walk to Chinatown. When we got back to the hotel at about 11.00, our room was ready. We found both rooms to be spacious, clean and well-presented, with very nice bathrooms. The beds were comfortable, and both rooms had pleasant views over the pool side of the hotel (we were on the 7th floor; the hotel is not too large with only 10 floors).We found all the staff at reception to be friendly and helpful, quick to offer assistance with luggage and with directions. Enjoyed the pool Saturday afternoon, after a walk to Little India and some hawker market food.After a really nice night out on the Saturday night (with a walk to Clarke Quay and dinner at Lotus Grill) we slept in til late on Sunday, checked out at 12.00, left our luggage in the reception area, went out for brunch at a sushi place nearby, then hung around the hotel for the afternoon. My husband and I had massages at the Spa attached to the hotel, leaving us time for happy hour drinks at the hotel bar before our transfer to the airport. This was a pretty idyllic stopover, and means that I will now never do a long haul flight again without breaking it up with some rest and relaxation!

<Content>Excellent upper mid class for business or pleasure Stayed for 4 nights on business January '08. At an average price per night of Sing $ 230, service and tax inclusive, this is excellent value. Perfectly located for business or pleasure, it offers great facilities, even if the rooms are smaller than previously experienced in comparable Singapore hotels. Rooms, however, very clean and bathroom huge in relation to the room, with both bath tub and walk in shower. Importantly (for me) in room iron provided as standard alongside the fully expected minibar, multichannel TV and high speed internet (fee liable but works!).Staff helpful and knowledgable, bars and restaurants good, although in Singapore, why stay in the hotel?A short walk to Clarke and Boat Quays gives a wonderful spectrum of eating and drinking opportunities.Would not hesitate to use again.

<Content>Hard to top this one! We stayed in the hotel during a stopover between the UK and Australia. After an exhausting flight we arrived to one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in!Reception staff were great, and the hotel is extremely well presented. Our room was spotless with a HUGE bed and wonderful bathroom. Location was central, great shops about and only a short walk to the MRT.On departure the Porters could not do enough to help us. As frequent travellers between the UK and Australia, we need look no further for our hotel of choice.

<Content>Fabulous in every way! The Grand Plaza was lovely! All the staff were very friendly, professional, and helpful.I was lucky to get an upgrade to a 9th floor room and to be able to check in early. The room was spotless, comfortable in size, with all the features you could want, including a control panel by the bed for lighting, air conditioning etc. The bathroom was lovely as well with moisturiser, toothbrush, ... The king size bed was huge and comfortable with lots of fluffy pillows and spotless sheets and quilts.I used the business centre and the internet access was fast, there are cheaper places around, but convenient to use the hotel.The location is excellent, only a few minutes walk from the City Hall MTR which is on the two main trainlines on the island (including the one to the airport). It is walking distance to many of the main attractions, unless there is monsoon-style rain happening!

<Content>A great place to stay on a Stopover We stayed here as part of a Singapore stopover from AUS to Europe and were impressed by the efficiency and convenience of this hotel. The staff are friendly and check in/check out was smooth and quick. The hotel is conveniently located close to shops and the MRT and the public areas are clean, attractive and bright. The rooms/bathrooms are of a good size, which is fine for two/three nights, whilst the breakfast buffet is well stocked with good Eastern/Western offerings. A good business/stopover hotel, I can definitely recommend this hotel as a base to explore Singapore.

<Content>An excellent hotel in a great location We stayed here as part of the Singapore Airlines Stopover Holidays enroute to Australia. We arrived quite early in the morning and so were prepared for a bit of a wait for the room. The reception staff were very apologetic that we had to wait about 30 minutes for our room to be ready - I was expecting a much longer wait! The room was nice and tastefully furnished and the bathroom had a separate bath and shower. The pool area isn't huge, but was never too busy.Overall, we were very happy with out choice of hotel, the staff were extremely helpful, and the location was very convenient.

<Content>Our first stay in Singapore After reading previous reviews, we were not sure of our stay here. From the moment we arrived in Reception, our stay was wonderful. Staff were helpful, our room was great, facilities good, location good, nothing negative at all to report. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at approx 8pm, we were given complimentary drinks  chips at the lounge bar while we waited, were told it would be 45 minutes, but in just 5 minutes we were given our key and told the room was ready. Rooms were not huge, but plenty big enough. Bathroom was a little small, but had everything necessary - usual toiletery items, etc; nice big fluffy towels; comfy king size bed, pillows were fine, curtains showed some sign of age, but perfectly adequate. Breakfast included was great, plenty of variety, attentive staff. Location was very handy to everything - we actually walked to Orchard Rd - took a while, but came back by cab, cost about $6. We only stayed two nights prior to our cruise on Superstar Virgo, but certainly would return to this hotel for future visits to Singapore.

<Content>Great Location Stayed at the Grand Plaza Park Hotel for 2 nights and really enjoyed my stay. The staff are really courteous and the rooms are clean, although from my room there wasn't much of a view.As I had arranged for a taxi to meet me at 5am, the Concierge knew I was coming and addressed me by name as I came into the lobby which was unexpected but appreciated.The location is great, right in the middle of the city and close to the subway. I thoroughly recommend staying at the Grand Plaza.

<Content>Good Hotel I spent 3 nights here on the way home to Australia from a European holiday. I chose the hotel largely on the basis of TripAdvisor reviews and because it is right in the middle of the city, close to train  bus routes, shops (mid-level  high-level) and cafes  food outlets- I was not disappointed. The front-of-house facilities  service were excellent, the cafe meals  breakfasts good and the room good. The gym  pool were excellent, better than most 3-4 star  some 5 star hotels I've stayed at. My only complaint is that housekeeping response to a request was slow, but the quality of their work was good.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Spent 10 nights at this wonderful hotel and it surpassed all expectations . Had seen some reviews here which were a mixture of opinions so not sure what it would be like. We arrived very early in the morning so did not expect to have a room straight away . However we were able to get into our room by midday which was absolute bliss after a 14hr flight from the UK. The room was spacious and spotlessly clean as was the rest of the place. Extremely luxurious given the price . Breakfast from the buffet ranged from traditional English to local specialities with plenty to choose from . We were very well looked after by very attentive and friendly staff. All in all I can highly recommend the Grand Plaza on Coleman street

<Content>OK hotel I stayed in this hotel during a conference and a few holidays. The location is not bad, close to Singapore river (walking distance of Boad  Clarke Quays) and City Hall subway station. The hotel is quite an average business-type hotel. Breakfast is very expensive if not included in the room rate (S$ 29). The room was OK, nothing special. Lots of mould in the bathroom though! Staff is very friendly and helpful.

<Content>First class location Cannot believe this Hotel is rated only 18th in Trip-advisor, the other 17 must be absolutely fantastic. My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights on a stop over to Australia and thought this Hotel was fantastic. The rooms, restaurant, reception and pool area, were excellent; but above all the staff were friendly, helpful and very professional. If possible have the breakfast included when booking as this will set you up for either a days site-seeing or shopping, depending on your preference. Singapore can best be described as a Botanical Garden where people live and work. The whole island is spotlessly clean and perfectly safe of a night. The hotel is located very close to the river where restaurants are bars are not in short supply. We liked this Hotel and as our daughter now lives in Australia I am sure we will be making this our stop over destination again, hopefully very soon.

<Content>Wonderful hotel We love Singapore!!! We did a lot - Sentosa, Orchard Rd, Bugis, Night Safari, Clarke Quay, Night clubs, etcWe are 2 fun nearly 30 girls from Perth WA. My friend and I had a 4 night stay in a twin room. We booked online.We loved the Grand Plaza Park. The hotel was lovely and well kept. Our rooms were very clean with very good facilities. The location was perfect. Close to everywhere via the MRT. It had a nice pool and a great gymnasium. We ate out so we cannot comment on the hotel food.We would definately stay at GPP again. The staff were very polite and check in easy.

<Content>Overpriced We stayed here for 4 nights on our way to the UK. First impressions of the Hotel are excellent. It has a very lavish Reception area and the staff are very good . The rooms are tiny considering the price you have to pay, and the beds are like concrete. Fortunately there were many pillows, and to ensure I had a reasonable sleep, I actually slept on the pillows!The bathroom was OK, but looked somewhat tired. No special touches like orchids in the bathroom that we have previously had in cheaper hotels. We would not stay here again. You do not get good value for the price you pay.

<Content>Very Helpful I stayed there with two children, I personally did not like the first room we were in and complained at reception, they then happily moved us to another deluxe room and gave us an extra bed free-of-charge. The room was spacious and had good T.V. with some good Tea and Coffee making facilities (7 different drinks!). The bathroom had a standing shower and bath with moisturizer, soap, bath foam, shampoo, etc.. Reception was very friendly and provided us with an extra chair and mug as well as the bed.The pool was lovely but slightly small, the jacuzzi was perfect, great for relaxing under the night sky after a day's exploring.The area was good and the nearby Funan - Digital Life Mall was a great place to go with children. Inside there is a Delifrance and a food court. It has hundreds of technology stores and in the basement there is a Cold Storage.All in all we greatly enjoyed our stay. We felt that the value was mediocre, but it would have been greatly increased with the addition of breakfast.

<Content>Great hotel but greedy I stayed at this hotel for two weeks. I found the room, staff and facilities to be excellent. The only issue is that after organising a corporate rate the hotel refused to honour it, even when there were rooms available. Tried to charge $400 a night instead of the corporate rate of $210.

<Content>Great location The Grand Plaza is now known as the Parkroyal on Coleman. It is a small, contemporary style hotel in the best location for food and shopping. I have stayed here a few times now and the rooms are a bit on the small side but for two people per room they are adequate. It is a 4 star property, extremely clean, well furnished, lovely little breakfast room with a large buffet selection. The hotel is adjacent to the best spa in Singapore - the St Gregory Spa. It is a very quick walk to Clarke and Boat Quay for meals, a few minutes from City Mall, Raffles Plaza and the Raffles Hotel (try the Long Bar for the Gin Sling). This is my preferred hotel for staying in Singapore. Its great value.

<Content>Good Central Hotel Stayed here for 4 nights after cruise on Star Virgo, nice rooms, very good buffet breakfast, good pool and gym which our 2 16 yr old boys enjoyed, nice central location for sightseeing, walking distance to many shopping centres  eatries, staff always courteous but not what I would call family orientated, more designed for business people but I think this is true of many hotels in singapore.

<Content>Nice facilities but poor staff Check-in staff wrote the wrong room number on the card. As a result, the key card didnt work in the lift. Had to return to reception three times to sort this out! All this hassle when you are really tired after a long flight and want to get into your room as quickly as possible.Facilites are fantastic though. The room was a suite with separate living room and bedroom with 29 inch LCD TV in each. Very spacious and nice bathroom too.If you check in, just dont give a debit card as a credit card imprint. I made this mistake and as a result, I got doubly charged when checking in and again when checking out.

<Content>Decent choice in Singapore I stayed at the Grand Park Royal for 2 weeks. I think the standard of hotels in Singapore is generally pretty good. The Grand Park Royal is no exception. It is just as you would expect from a nice SE Asian Business Hotel.The rooms are not very big, but well and efficiently furnished, the bathrooms nice and clean. The mattresses are a bit on the hard side, but I found my bed quite comfortable.The location of the hotel is excellent if you like to use the superb subway system.The breakfast buffet is a standard affair. You get your Asian breakfast, a good selection of breads and a few guys who cook your eggs to your liking.If, after 2 weeks, I had anything to complain about it would be the overly ambitious room service who will come to your room several times a day (some may like this) and the reception desk staff, who seem to never smile (but then, I don鈥檛 think anyone in Singapore ever smiles). The concierge staff was fairly friendly and welcoming, though.  All in all I was a bit disappointed with Singapore, but that was hardly the hotels fault.

<Content>Very bad service! We stayed at the Grand Plaza hotel for 3 days in November, as part of our sightseeing tour in Singapore. The location is good, as its entrally located and finding cabs or walking to the station is pretty easy. Rooms are clean and well appointed; however the service was really bad. When we reached they took a long time to check us in, citing a heavy rush for the delay. When they finally did get around to allocating us rooms, it took a lot of arguing to get rooms on the same floor, despite having booked 15 days in advace. But the icing on the cake was when we were checking out. We had requested a late check out and were informed that it would be accomodated. However on the day of the departure in the morning, the executives at the reception were downright rude and refused to accept that they had confirmed this the previous night. After finally agreeing to check out on time, we had the rudest shock when at 12 noon they asked us to vacate the rooms in half an hour! We had to scramble and vacate the rooms, and had to change our sightseeing plans for the whole day due to our luggage. We were totally disgusted with the attitude and behaviour of the staff, and would not recommend this place to anyone!! For the price, we definitely expect basic courtsey, if not fair treatment at the hotel we've booked..

<Content>liked the grand plaza Stayed at the Grand Plaza parkroyal for 5 nights in November 06.booked the hotel via Singapore Airlines stopover package.The hotel's lobby is nice, staff friendly, asked for a twin room, non smokeing. nice view. and that is what we got. the rooms are not luxery. but thet are clean  comfortable. beds and pillows comfortable. maid service is good. fridge in the room. and all the things you need for your stay. the corridor carpets are a bit tired, but overall we liked the hotel, 2 minutes from Singapore hop on bus, and 3 min walk to CITY HALL train station. very good central spot....if it's raining (Which it did every afternoon) make your way to CITY HALL train station, from there without getting on a train, you can walk to underground shops  Restaurants. all in all we enjoyed singapore  the hotel , and would return. if you go to Sentosa, don't waste your money on the butterfly park, waste of money, saw about 4 live butterfly's.happy travels !!!

<Content>Pretty good hotel We stayed at the Grand Plaza Park Royal in October, 2006 for 4 nights. The lobby is pretty fancy with polite concierge and hotel staff that call you sir or madam. The room we stayed in was pretty good except we got two single beds instead of one king size. They apologized and a woman came in to put them together for us. It was probably just as well they were seperate because it was really hot and humid. I really didn't mind although my partner did. The beds are not as hard as others claim. The hotel also has a bar where you can order drinks like cocktails and listen to live music. We ate there for breakfast every day, which was kind of cheaper because of the Singapore stop over discount. The food was pretty good although it is pretty much the same every day. We didn't eat there for lunch or dinner. It is cheaper to go elsewhere. The swimming pool was alright but a bit small and closed at 10pm which was kind of annoying but we only went in it once. There is supposed to be two pools. The lifts were operated using your room card. We had difficulty using our card sometimes. It worked on and off. Other people seemed to have similar problems. All in all the hotel was still pretty good and most of the staff spoke english well.

<Content>Great Hotel I have stayed at the GPP on 10 occasions over the last 10 months. As a business traveller I am after an easy check in, good businness or club floors and modern facilities in my room. It is the small things that make businnes travel easy, not having to ring for an iron and ironing bord, water, good TV and DVD etc. The GPP has it all. A great locaion, friendly staff (from the manger, Scott Butcher, to the doorman) and nice rooms. If you want to come to Singapore on a business visit, the GPP is the place to stay. Oh and by the way, Irene in the Orchard Lounge is one of the most attentive and outstanding staff members in a hotel I have ever met.

<Content>Great Hotel - only a few negatives Great hotel - stayed twice within 1 month. Once pre -cruise then for a week post cruise. On both occasions had great rooms but difficulties checking in on both occasions. We arrived each time at 5pm only to find rooms not ready. This seems to be fairly prevelent in Singapore as this is not the first time this has happened for us (with other Hotels including the Stamford), Staff very helpful. Restaurants a bit ion the pricey side but buffet breakfast is well worth the money. (even better if you can get the breakfast in your accomodation package) Pool terrific but closes too early - 9pm on weekends and 10pm Mon - Fri. Not ideal when all you fancy after a day and night out in the tropics is a swim.The doors are locked after this time so you cannot even gain access to the pool area. If these small points could be rectified then this hotel would be even better.
