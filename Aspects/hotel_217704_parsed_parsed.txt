<Content>The place to stay for a cruise Stayed for one night before our cruise. La Quinta Inn picked us up at the airport, and the next day drove us to our cruise ship for no cost. This service was great. The cost from the cruise ship back to the airport was $30.00. The hotel is a great savings. We had to order out for our dinnerm since the Hotel serves no lunch or dinner, but there a tables to eat at the hotel. There our a number of pizza restaurants that deliver. The next morning the Hotel gives a great breakfast for free. The Hotel is clean and the front desk is very helpful. Being close to the airport means you will hear planes, but was still able to get a good nights sleep. Hey, for the first time, after we were in our room for about a half hour, the front desk called, asked if our room was OK and that if we needed anything, just give them a call. They are there 24 hours a day. The rooms are plain and the bed was very good. I asked some other guests what they thought and all agreed that this is the place to stay for a night when you have a cruise the next day. NJ Ralph

<Content>Good airport stopover place Stayed here one night pre-flight. It's very near the airport, although located down a slightly out of the way road, possibly not the easiest hotel to find if you're driving. However, we're British and were driving around Miami for the first time - at night - and we managed it, so it can't be that difficult! I thought this was rather an nice place actually. Comparing it to a Comfort Inn, where we had stayed previously, this seemed more upmarket. The room was bigger and the bathroom was too. There was more choice at the breakfast buffet. I don't think anyone should stay here for an actual holiday, but this is designed as a stopover place, and I think it performs that role perfectly well. There's a big car park also.

<Content>Great place to stay pre cruise My wife and I along with ten other friends stayed here one night pre cruise. The hotel was clean the staff friendly and helpful.The restaurant next door had closed but there are at least four pizza places that deliver. The hotel desk clerk suggested that the best in the area was the Pizza Hut and Papa Johns. She was right. They let us use the breakfast area for our group pizza dinner.The free shuttle to the port for our cruise was comfortable and on time. What more could you ask for a one night pre cruise hotel at such a good price. Well I could ask for a real restaurant near by, but not much else :-)Larry

<Content>Would never go back. Me, my boyfriend, and two other couples stayed at this hotel before boarding a cruise ship the next day. The only good thing I have to say is that the breakfast was good. The front desk staff was rude. One of the only reasons we booked there was the free shuttle to the port, the front desk employee told us he couldn't guarantee we could get on the shuttle. There was barely anyone staying there! The rest of our trips to the desk we were treated rudely. The rooms were semi clean but outdated and we could hear people in the rooms around us. You definitely get what you pay for but I would not recommend this hotel!

<Content>Okay hotel before cruise, scary location My boyfriend and I stayed here before leaving on a cruise out of the port of Miami. The only reason we stayed at the La Quinta was because of the free shuttle to the port. I arrived before my boyfriend around 4:00pm. My taxi driver coming from the Ft. Lauderdale airport laughed when I told him where I was staying, as did the Miami businessman who was sharing the cab with me. They both warned me that the location was dangerous and the area was really run-down. Also, that there was NOTHING near the hotel. Needless to say, I was really nervous checking in, since my boyfriend would not be arriving until very late in the night. Check-in was smooth. The hotel is dated, and there was a boarded up restuarant in the front. There is also a boarded up Bennigans next door. Basically, the only near-by dining option was the restaurant inside the Embassy Suites which was a five minute walk away. Their restaurant was a little pricey with entrees starting at $20.00. I was not going to pay that to eat at a hotel restaurant the day before going on a cruise! I opted to have pizza delivered to my room (which was was awful!) Looking back on it, I would have requested the shuttle to take me back to the Miami airport to eat. My boyfriend arrived later, and also remarked about the run-down, scary location. We grabbed a quick bit to eat in the morning, then got on the shuttle to the port. I realize that anyway near an airport is probably going to be a little shady, but next time I would pay the extra money to stay somewhere nicer. It met the needs of a place to stay with the free shuttle...

<Content>Basic budget hotel Can't understand all the complaints about this hotel. It is a basic, budget hotel. Don't expect luxury, but it is a basic, good, clean place to shower and sleep. If that's all you want, as we did while waiting to fly out to Peru, then this place is fine. I wouldn't want to spend a week's vacation here, but as a stopover for an airport transfer, this place fits the bill. It's perfectly clean and safe, with not a lot of noise. We found the front desk staff to be friendly and helpful as well.

<Content>Sleep-shower-Leave We had to deliver our rental car at Dollar and after that fly from Miami Airport. This LQ-motel was closeby and had a very reasonable price ($95). It was also close to the rental-car-returns (8 minutes walk). That was the main reasons for us to book this hotel.In other reviews people are making remarks on the noise (staff, planes), but I did not notice that at all.As the most airport hotels: sleep, shower, leave. Nothing more, nothing less.The ladies behind the counter (one was called Evy) were extremely nice and friendly, just as the guy driving the shuttle-bus.

<Content>Look For A Better Option for Pre-Cruise Stay I picked this hotel because they offered a free shuttle to the Port of Miami and to/from MIA. I was told by the hotel staff that there was a restaurant within walking distance. When we arrived (I was traveling with a group of 8) we found a restaurant that was boarded up and was in the process of being demolished. There was a Bennigan's Restaurant, which was also closed. Please note I contacted the hotel directly on several occasions to ask about restaraunts that were within walking distance. i even contacted the hotel the night before our arrival and was told that there were several restaurants within walking distance. i later discovered that the restaurants they were referring to were the ones inside the Embassy Suites Hotel next door. Thank goodness that the Embassy Suites also had a rental car agency on site. We ended up renting a minivan to drive to another restaurant. Furthermore the air conditioner in one of the other couples' room was not working and they had to be relocated. The second couple was put on a floor where traveling passengers were allowed to have pets. These pets barked throughout the night and kept the couple awake. The hotel was booked to capacity and moving to another room was not an option. The on;ly good thing about this hotel was that the staff was friendly and the shuttle to the Port was free. I cruise quite often and i definitely will not stay here again. I have used LaQuinta before and I am shocked that they are allowing this older and discouraging hotel to be called a LaQuinta.

<Content>We will look for better options next time... We were flying out the next day and the La Quinta Miami Airport East is just good enough for that and nothing more. On our way back through Miami, we found another option at the same price that blows this place out of the water. The beds are ok and unless you don鈥檛 mind waking up a couple of times at night by people talking outside your window and door, I recommend staying on the second floor as the staff remains pretty active into the early hours of the morning and they don鈥檛 use their 鈥渋nside voices.鈥?The noise of planes taking off from the airport is also noticeable due to the thin walls. The morning breakfast provided by the hotel is a Running of the Bulls experience short on seating and food.

<Content>Ok for One Night Pre-Cruise We stayed here one night pre-cruise. This is a low budget hotel, don't expect more. Room basic, basic no toiltrees. Carpet worn and stained in places. When I entered the room I thought, please just let it be clean. When I entered the bathroom, I saw hairs in the tub. Thank goodness we only stayed one night, otherwise I would have checked out. Free breakfast consisted of make your own toast, waffles. Cereal, milk, yogurt, juice, coffee. The fruit was all gone when I arrived for breakfast and one lady proceeded to take all of the hard boiled eggs. Who eats 6 boiled eggs!!Pros -- Free shuttle transportation from the airport to the hotel and free shuttle from the hotel to the Port of Miami, included.Next door to Bennigans restuarant (great drinks).Cheapest hotel I could find for one night in Miami ($89.00) Most hotels wanted over $150.00. I guess you get what you pay for.Red Roof Inn was next door and Embassy Suites.....

<Content>for a stopover only The hotel was ok. Nothing more. The service was adequate, but the location was not good at all. There were several other hotels that would have been just as close with better room. I would not stay here again.

<Content>Serves its purpose for the night before a cruise. I had read other reviews about the great shuttle to and from the airport. We only needed it from the airport, and called upon our arrival in Miami. We were told to just stand outside by departures and the shuttle would be by. We asked about a specific place and they said just outside anywhere by departures. So we stood outside. FOR AND HOUR!!!! We saw the hilton shuttle 3 times, the marriott twice, the red roof inn twice and even the LaQuinta west once along with countless other hotels but no LaQuinta East. We called 3 times and were told it would be there shortly. It did finally show up. It was a crappy van, but we didn't care it was finally here. So we walked up, and were told sorry they were full, we'll be back in 30 minutes. I thought, Jeez!!!, forget this dumb shuttle. So we took a cab which ended only costing a flat rate of $10 for all 5 of us, and it only took 5 minutes to get there. Should have done that in the first place.Anyways the rest of the stay was great. Check in was a breeze, the hotel served its purpose as we were staying the night before our cruise the next morning. The room was nice and the beds comfortable. The shuttle to the cruise ship was great (By far the best feature). We went to the Marlins game that night, and cab was $50 each way. I would stay away from the Bennigan's next door. I eat at Bennigan's all the time, and love the restaurant, but this one was dirty and had very poor service. No internet at this hotel, we were told to go to the Red Roof Inn next door. We should have used there shuttle too.

<Content>Good for 1-2 nights near airport The hotel runs a huge promotion saying if you can't give us a 10, then let us know.....well, this place isn't a 10....but it is clean, affordable, and has free shuttle to the airport. I will say the front desk people were generally very helpful and friendly. We did have some minor problems with the room that need to be repaired (which we let the staff know about). The place is clean, usually has good rates for Miami, and has free airport shuttle (which was right on time). The free breakfast was average, and so crowded that there was no place to sit. Only 1 restaurant which is next door (Bennigans). But you end up with countless pizza menus shoved underneath your door all day long. One tip.....if you need to rent a car....EZ Rental is right next door inside the Embassy Suites....they are usually one of the cheaper places.....and since hardly any of the rental agencies are on airport grounds, you could take the hotel shuttle to the La Quinta and walk to the Embassy Suites (and return the car and walk back to hotel). Enterprise is across the street from the Embassy Suites also.

<Content>hhmm could be better Myself husband and 7 yo daughter stayed here for one night 2nd April 2008. We picked this hotel as we needed onenight near to airport as we arrived late evening and didnt want to drive to orlando until the next day. Room seemed tired shabby and not that clean it also had a smokey smell. Bfast was ok but nothing special , staff a bit off hand but we generally experienced rather off hand folk in Miami ! It suited our purpose for one night but its not a place we would return too.

<Content>Highly Recommended My daughter, granddaughter and I stayed at this hotel prior to a cruise out of Miami. I always read reviews on TripAdvisor website before I book a hotel, especially in Miami, because they vary widely, and trusted the positive reviews. We were just delighted with this hotel. The rooms were very nicely furnished and didn't seem like a budget hotel. We enjoyed the pool and the breakfast. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The best part was the price was very reasonable, hard to find in Miami. I would enthusiastically recommend this hotel.

<Content>great location but quite noisy we stayed at this hotels for two nights before the Bahama cruise . The reason I chose this hotel is its great location. we rent a car to visit Everglade nation park the day before the cruise. it is very close to many car rental companys, enterprise car rental office is within walking distance . we took the enterprise shuttle from the airport to rent the car upon arriving Miami at 10: 30pm . it only take 2 minute drive from enterprise office to the hotel. there is a good restaraunt right next door and its kitchen closed at 12am . if you arrive late in Miami and just want a one night stay . this hotel will be a good choice.We had a room on 4th floor for the first night. it was a horrible experience. The airplanes were flying over our room every 5 min from 6 am. we can hear the the thunderstorm very loud at night too.( I think the insulation under the roof is way too thin) I requested to switch to 2nd floor next morning. I had much better sleep the 2nd night but you can still hear the airplane noise though. the breakfast is quite good , waffle, bagle ,yogurt and boil eggs , juice coffee, milk cerel. the shuttle to the Miami port came right on time( 11; 15 am ). it is free and you have to register when you check in.

<Content>Just What I Needed My wife and I needed a place to stay overnight before we left on a cruise out of the Port of Miami. The room suited this purpose very comfortably. The room was clean and roomy. The continental breakfast had a machine that let you make your own malted waffles. There was free shuttle service from the airport to the hotel, and also from the hotel to the Port. There was a nice little restaurant in walking distance of the hotel, called Brettigan's (I'll write a separate review). I would recommend this place to anyone who needs a clean, inexpensive place to stay. I would stay here again under similar circumstances.

<Content>Perfect for a one nighter My husband and I needed a clean hotel for one night prior to taking a cruise out of the Port of Miami. We drove from Georgia and after reading reviews here we decided to go for it. We were pleased with our accommodations. It is a bit hard to find and tucked far from the road, so if you are driving, make sure to get directions before hand. We arrived around 8 pm to a nice clean room. We didn't use the pool or eat their breakfast in the morning - but it did look like it had a nice variety of items. The hotel provides you with a free transfer to the Port of Miami via a large bus. I think we left around 10am if memory serves. We felt very safe parking and leaving our car for 9 days (with no extra charge of course). When we returned our car was just as we left it. The only item that dropped the rating from Excellent to Above Average was the plane noise. I knew it was basically next to the airport so I was expecting this - but it was a bit noisier than I had imagined - I don't do much traveling by air. If you are wanting a nice hotel for pre/post cruise or flight, don't delay in booking at La Quinta.

<Content>Just what we needed... We had an overnight layover in Miami and needed a place to rest for a few hours. Based on the reviews of the other 'airport' hotels, this one seemed to have received the least amount of negative reviews for the price we were willing to pay.The room was basic, clean and spacious and served its purpose. We didn't take part in the free continental breakfast, but it too seemed pretty basic.Be warned that the airport shuttle stops service at 11pm, so any late arrivals will need to find an alternate route to the hotel. I believe our taxi cost around $15 or so after tip.If I had another layover in Miami, I would stay here again.

<Content>Much better than expected My wife and I flew into Miami en route to Key West. Knowing the onward car journey was likely to take three/four hours and our planned arrival time was 10.00 pm I started looking for a hotel close to the airport for the night. This was the closest I could find to the car rental depot, so I looked on Tripadvisor to check it out before booking.I have to admit that some of the comments posted had me slightly worried, but as it wasn't all bad and as it would only be for the one night I chanced it.In the event, we were delayed by over 5 hours, so we didn't arrive until 0400, tired and crabby after a 20 odd hour journey.Well folks, here's the good news. Reception was open and friendly. They were expecting us and had kept the room despite our lack of communication.The room itself was not large, but spotless, clearly recently renovated and much quieter than I had been led to believe by other comments.Overall an above average experience for an airport hotel, and I would be happy to go back so am writing this review to redress the balance a little.

<Content>Mixed Opinion We stayed here pre-cruise with 17 of our friends and family. I want to write how terrible our stay was, but after the initial awful experience waiting for the shuttle from the airport - which took 1.5 hours - and calling 6x - and being lied to each time about it being there within 15 minutes - needless to say by the time we got to the hotel we were ready to scream!But after checking in and seeing the nice accommodations, we relaxed a bit and enjoyed our stay. It was a really clean hotel, nice and neat. I think it was recently renovated because it all seemed nice and new. The free breakfast in the morning was quite good also.To La Quinta's credit - when we returned home, we wrote to complain of our issue with their staff and shuttle and they issued us a free nights stay at any La Quinta Hotel. So they really did try to make right our miserable beginning.

<Content>basic noisy place Hard to reach because off site constructions in the area surrounding it. Noisy and poor insulation and constant take off and landing of planes, which can make your sleep miserable if you are a light sleeper.Front desk service is very poor, with two exceptions, an afroamerican youg man and a cuban girl, Nora who were very helpful, the rest were very unpleasant, overworked or simply annoyed with the passenger requests. Rooms are OK. Breakfast area was small, crowded and totally inadequate for the amount of passengers.We also staid at La Quinta Inn at Miami Lakes, 15 minutes away, a totally different place, pleasant, good service, nice breakfast area, helpful front desk people who went out of their way to make things easy for you.If you need to stay close to the airport pick another place or if you choose La Quinta try renting a car and go to Miami Lakes, what a difference.

<Content>Good, basic hotel We were looking for a hotel to stay at the night before we began our cruise. We wanted a clean, safe hotel that provided free shuttle service from the airport and to the Port of Miami and didn't cost an arm and a leg. This hotel delivered.We arrived at the airport, called the hotel and was told the shuttle was on its way. It arrived less than 5 minutes later. Upon arrival we were asked what ship we were taking the next day, and we were placed on the shuttle list for that ship. The front desk staff were courteous and professional.Our room was fine. It was clean, the bed was comfortable and the room had a microwave and a fridge. The shower had nice water pressure and the bathroom wasn't small. I've read other reviews which indicated that the noise from the nearby airport was excessive. We did not have that experience. We opened our window the morning we checked out and heard the planes flying over about every 10 minutes, but with the window closed we didn't hear much airport noise.The continental breakfast was your typical hotel breakfast--cereal, hard-boiled eggs, bagels, pastries, milk, juice, coffee and a make-your-own waffle station. It was very busy and there weren't enough tables for everyone, but you could take the breakfast to your room and eat there. The shuttle arrived exactly at 11:30 as scheduled and took us to our cruise ship in 15 minutes, easy as could be.This hotel gives you exactly what it advertises and not a bit more. There's no hot tub, no fitness center, no computer work station and only 1 nearby restaurant (Bennigan's). You're pretty isolated from the rest of Miami unless you rent a cab or have a rental car. But we knew all that going in. Also, $145/night seems a little high for the basic kind of hotel this hotel is. But that is probably the going rate for hotels in Miami during January--other hotels in the city with more amenities had much higher nightly rates. What this hotel said it would do, it did. There's something to be said for doing just a few things, but doing them well. We would stay here again if we needed another 1-night stay with free shuttles to/from airport and to the port. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay here.

<Content>Great Price/Location I was in Orlando in familiar vacations but went to Miami for 2 days to a music concert in American Airlines Arena.Pros:1) Price/Location: excellent especially because the hotel is in a great location (close to Airport and to 836) and really looks like new. 2) Rooms: clean, nice, basic not a hotel in which you want to stay a lot of time in a room, is perfect to arrive to sleep.3) Free Breakfast.Cons:Didn鈥檛 findIn my opinion is hard to find good prices and clean hotels in Miami form $80 to $130 most of them have not so good opinions especially close to the airport or in South Beach. If you are in Miami for shopping, sports, concerts, going to South Beach in the night it is a great option, easily arrive to interest places and don鈥檛鈥?pay a lot of money but you need a car. In my opinion is a 2.5 or 3 stars hotel.Hope Helps

<Content>extremely convenient airport location I chose this hotel because of its proximity to airport and its Tripadvisor reviews. The hotel was fine- clean, decent breakfast, good customer service. The room seemed to have temperature control problems, but that could be because I had a fever! The shuttle was good and the ride to and from the airport is very quick.There is a Bennigan's right next door which served its purpose of getting us dinner, but service was slow.I'll be back in Miami in a few weeks for another layover, and I'm not sure if I'll stay there again.

<Content>Aweful and dishonest We are frequent travellers and this is our worst experience and unacceptable for a brand named hotel like this: LA QUINTA INN MIAMI AIRPORT EAST and ours is a prepaid rbooking through our travel agency before our trip.The service of the hotel is aweful and dishonest. She failed to fulfill the contract for room arrangement eventhough I had settled the full payment with the travel agent beforehand and obtained the reservation number on the voucher. When I and my friend arrived the hotel at 23:00 hours on 1st December 2007( one night before our cruise day), the receptionist refused to give us a room by making silly excuse. I have reason to believe the hotel was over-booked and my room was given to someone who arrived ealier. In fact, we had a terrible experience to look for alternative hotels but all the hotels in the vincinity were full.we were so disappointed and upset for all this unexpected experenice.Vincent Lai

<Content>an airport stle hotel Like most reviews state this hotel is great for a short stay eg. cruise out of Miami ( that's why I used it ) . Stayed here 12/21 and 12/28 2007 before and after our cruise . The staff are great and you get picked up and dropped off at the airport by the hotels free shuttle bus , you also can get a free shuttle to the Port of Miami if your going on a cruse but you cannot get picked up at the end of your cruise . Also many rental car locations are within walking distance to this hotel . So after your cruise ends take a rental companies shuttle back to the hotel area to rent a car . Also Bennigan's Grill  Tavern is next door so you really don't need to go far to get some fast food.and they also have the standard morning breakfast setup , toast , muffins , cereal etc. You also get wireless Internet free if you bring your laptop The only negative things I can say about this hotel are 1-lack of fridge in room 2- the beds we slept in were pretty uncomfortable for my wife and I . lumpy and no support . The other couples that were in our party and also stayed here had no problem with the beds so maybe it was just us???? 3- the rooms could use an update , the hotels website claims Newly renovated rooms . I didn't get one of them The room was booked using Expedia , the rate was 130 CDN a night .

<Content>Nice people, average hotel This hotel is lined up with the runway, so be aware. During the night there were hardly any planes but until 11pm and in the early morning you will hear big jets flying over the hotel. But then again: this is an airport hotel.The hotel lies in an odd neighbourhood. Because of all the road construction that is going on, it looks like a war zone. A restaurant in front of the hotel is closed so the entrance to the hotel gives you the creeps. Front desk is very helpfull and nice.The east side location makes this hotel an alternative for a hotel in downtown miami.Rooms are good. Beds are comfortable. Constantly papers with advertisements of restaurants being pushed under your door.

<Content>In Love with La Quninta This place was wonderful and more than I expected. The staff was very helpful, courtious and professionalThe room was clean, it smelled nice, the pool was clean, the shuttle (free) from the airport to the hotel was efficiant, and the driver was very pleasant. My husband and I had to go to Miami for a one night stay as we had a medical appointment. We are going back in December (2007) for a medical procedure and I will be staying there while my husband is in the hospital. I can't say enough nice things about this place. If you have to rely on a taxi like we did, there's not much around within walking distance, but a Bennigans. Even that was nice. For the time it took me to research hotels in Miami on Hotels dot com, I was very glad I booked this hotel. You will be too. Keep in mind, it's a standard hotel not a Hilton, so don't expect Five star ammenities. If you want a clean place to stay, this it the place. It should actually get a three or four star rating in my book.

<Content>Nice, economical, convenient, great staff This was great for our family of 4 arriving day prior to leaving on Cruise ship. Unbelievable value.... included was FREE transport from airport to hotel , FREE shuttle next day to port of Miami and FREE great continental breakfast in morning. ( the usual plus waffles, cold juices, bagels, coffee, all types of milk...skim, whole, chocolate etc) Please be patient with shuttle arriving because the roads around airport are under construction and it takes 10 minutes to get there 1 mile away. Call as soon as you get bags to reduce wait time for shuttle.Benigans restaurant is a 1 minute walk out front door.(Good food, 2 for 1 drinks on weekends).The hotel is older but very well maintained. Pool is relatively small but very usable and clean. You can watch the planes take off from pool.. Curiously, this is quiet hotel so close to airport. There was no problem with noise. Bilingual staff was courteous and helpful with minor issue we had. This not the 5 star hotel for your 25 th anniversary; however, for overnight prior to cruise, at very reasonable rate it is outstanding. my total bill for 4 adults , including tax was $ 88.00.

<Content>A standard airport hotel. Let's face it, you wouldn't choose this type of hotel for a vacation but you would if you wanted to catch a plane. Not a particularly goodpart of town with views of parking lots, highways and planes landing.However, we found the rooms to be clean, staff friendly, rates goods and Bennigans a good place to eat. Staff were more than happy to let us chill out at the pool after checking out before setting off for the airport.

<Content>Good Hotel for those going on a Cruise We stayed at the hotel for one night prior to our cruise. There is a shuttle bus that provides free transportation from Miami airport to the hotel. We called the hotel upon arrival and let them know our arrival gate and they picked us up in about 5-10 minutes. We arrived at the hotel around 6 and check in was very fast. Let them know that you will need transporation to the port and they will let you know what times they have available for pick up. The room was very basic, yet clean. No frills: two beds, tv, desk and bathroom. Of course, since the airport is nearby, there was some plane noise, but it seemed to ease up around 11 that night. Bennigan's Restaurant is within walking distance (basically in the hotel's parking lot) and we went there for dinner. There is a small dining area off from the lobby which offers for breakfast: breads, rolls, pastries, cereal, (make it yourself) waffles and various juices and coffee. Again, very basic, and just enough to get your day started.The transporation from the hotel to the port was on time and got us to the port in about 25 minutes. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay pre-cruise, in the event the hotels closer to the port are booked. We got the room for $115 - AAA rate and estimated we saved about $50 in transporation costs by using the hotel's free shuttle services from the airport and to the port. I had also looked at the Days Inn Airport and was quite frankly scared after reading the reviews from other Trip Advisors. Again, a good place for the pre-cruiser. If you have any questions, let me know, always happy to help.

<Content>Adequate We spent the night of 2/23 at the La Quinta prior to a RCCL cruise on 2/24. The hotel advertises airport pickups and they do so on the half hour. You call the desk and they tell you where to meet the shuttle.The hotel is quite generic. You would never know it was a La Quinta from the exterior. They have no signage at all. Check in was uneventful with the room available at 3:00pm. I thought the room was small and non-descript. Nothing bad and nothing particularily good. Airport hotels in Miami tend to be overpriced. This was a AARP rate of $143. Way too much for the room but seems in line with most of the others.They advertise a continental breakfast and they do. Cereals, rolls, toast muffins etc. Also have a waffle machine that worked well.If they don't ask at the desk ,let them know that you are going to the port, if in fact you are, and they will give you a ticket and assign a time. It was free and worked well. We left the hotel at 11:30 and reached the port just before 12:00.If your on foot and need to eat you are limited to a Bennigans. Appears to be nothing else in the area. The hotel is located right off a runway from the airport. Continual stream of planes going pretty much right over the hotel. The noise in the rooms isn't to bad ,but out by the pool it's powerful loud.All in all, an OK hotel but overpriced.

<Content>Clean and convenient Convenient loacation for getting to the aiport, watch out at the moment as finding it might be more difficult due to road works. Clean, reasonably priced. Watch out for the breakfast lady...don't arrive late (if looks could kill!)

<Content>Not what we were promised The whole reason we booked at this hotel was because they had a shuttle to the port, and let you leave your care there free while on the cruise. When we arrived in mid -afternoon we found that it was in an awful part of town AND the shuttles to the port the next day were full until 2:30PM. Since we are usually on board and enjoying the ship by noon, this would not have worked for us. We were also not crazy about leaving our car there because it was in a bad area of town.We did look at a room and it appeared to be very clean.....just an average LaQuinta room. The hotel clerk was very nice and helpful trying to get us on a shuttle, We decided to use Hotwire and go to another hotel. We actually ended up at an extremely nice hotel (Hotel Intercontinental) for less than the La Quinta. Of course, we ended up driving to the port and paying for parking so that was a bummer.In retrospect, I probably would have risked leaving my car there and just gotten a cab to the port. It's only about $20 bucks and a lot less than paying for parking.

<Content>Good location Stayed at La Quinta pre-cruise for one night.Our flight arrived in the evening at MIA, so we just needed somewhere to sleep for the night. Shuttle was nice, ate next door at Bennigan's.Room and bathroom was spacious, although it was next to elevator bank, we did not enounter any noise problems.Breakfast was okay for a continental breakfast.Not much for me to choose from, since I don't eat white flour.But plenty of pastries and cereals for others.Since we had a late arrival all of the early slots for shuttle to port were full and we were given a 1 pm time slot. We did not want to hang around the motel that long , so we just took a cab.Price was about $ 35 w/tip, only because my friend thought she left her prescription sunglasses in the room and we had to go back to the motel to look for them(they were not there, she thinks she left them at Bennigans).A nice place for one night, would stay here again.

<Content>A pleasant experience Staying at LQ inn airport turned out to be a good choice for us..a good morning breakfast,free shuttle to and from the airport, clean rooms and free wireless internet in all rooms.The only disadvantage is the distance from the beach and other places of attraction..But otherwise its definitely a good choice for stay.

<Content>Great Price, Free Breakfast and Shuttles We arrived in Miami on Friday night and stayed at the La Quinta Airport EAST on LeJuene Road. No problems with the hotel, great prices, free shuttle to the airport and port transfers and free continental breakfast. Only minor issue was the noise from the planes, but the rate, transfers and breakfast made up for this. As a note, when you arrive at the hotel and sign up for the port transfer, make sure they write down the number of travelers using the port transfer service. Family of 31 from Arizona had a minor issue, because the front desk only put down the room numbers and not the number of travelers, so this added to their port departure time and other airport pickups, but they made it in plenty of time.

<Content>What we expected from reading the reviews We stayed one night pre-cruise and one night post-cruise. We booked this hotel because we could park our car free during the cruise and they provided shuttle service to the port. The rooms were okay--a bit rough around the edges, e.g., dirty carpet, mold in the bathrooms, airport noise. The continental breakfast was adequate. The hotel staff was very helpful. Bennigan's next door was a plus. We felt safe leaving our car there for a week and encountered no problems upon our return. Look for the stay and go package on their website.

<Content>pre cruise stay Stayed one night prior to our cruise. Booked this hotel because of the shuttle to port and from airport, with a breakfast. The breakfast was average, standard waffles, pastries no fruit, small room. The pickup from the Hotel was awful, we waited an hour after the original call to hotel, had to call twice, lots of other shuttles passed us by two times before theirs showed up. Room was average but noisy.

<Content>Nice Hotel I liked this hotel because it seemed to be newly renovated and the rooms and bathroom were large and extremely clean. The complimentary breakfast offered a wide variety of choices and was pretty good. The best thing about this hotel though was its proximity to the Airport. Other than that it is pretty far away from everything else unless you have a car.Overall, this was a good two star hotel and I would definitely recommend staying here if you want to be close to the airport.
