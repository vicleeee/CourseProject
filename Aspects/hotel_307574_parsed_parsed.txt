<Content>A True Gem When I was planning our first Bali trip, I listened to my Indonesian friends and changed my reservation from Nusa Dua to Ubud and Jimbaran. What a pleasant surprise Maya Ubud was!Arriving at the hotel was a trip itself - Ubud is inland and far from the touristy areas of Kuta, Legian, etc, so arriving at night and going to Ubud means you get a taste of the local life - limited traffic, locals sitting out in the streets eating, chatting. Serveral roads had few street lamps and our taxi drivers even got lost when a religious procession blocked the main road, so we meandered through some rice fields, and finally arrived at our resort. It is set outside of the town of Ubud high on a hill between rice fields and river valley, completed with its own nature walk.There were many things we were impressed, so I must start slow - first - the whole property is designed with one word - Care. It is reflected in the infinity edge pools that overlook flowing river below, the affordable flower baths in room, the western and japanese breakfast buffet that is included in the room and virtually two buffet in one, the ever caring staff - just such a sweet and neat place. What a great first impression to bali! We enjoyed this place way more than the big Intercontinental in Jimbaran.The experience starts with the great breakfast the first thing in the day - although we almost missed half of it - the Japanese, or the Western portion is hidden behind a wall depends on where you were seated. They have all the juices you can think of in Bali - orange, mango, apple, Papaya, guava, even banana, They also given you Champagne for free to blend with the dazzling variety of juices to make your own mimosa mango mambo maga-sa-s that you want.Then, take the free hourly hotel shuttle and head to the Ubud palace and market. One word of caution. the shuttle will pick you up but usually at 15 after the hour, even though the printed hour is 20. Spend the afternoon at the nature walk down the slope, and then swim in the infinity edge pool that looks down to the river valley. You can also have the hotel car take you to a local Ubud spa for a cheap massage and scrub.At night, use the $12 well and make use of the in-room milk and flower bath all set up in your own room to relax and warm up. This feature is not availalble in the bigger resorts in Jimbaran and Nusa Dua, and if available, no less than $25 a pop i hear.HIring a car from an Ubud hotel is cheaper than the south island options. For the same 8 hour day, we paid about $75 USD and our friends in Jimbaran paid $150; Sure they had a Mercedes, but for the 35 MPH bumpy roads around the island, an airconditioned comfy roomy Toyota will do the same job. Our driver from Maya Ubud is Dewa Taman and he is so polite and sweet, and knowledgeable and told us everything from meaning of the dances to the time of the offerings to the volcano eruption stories. It was simply wonderful. The fleet of staff is ever-smiling and sweet, and genuinely interested in their guests' welfares, from exchanges to designing daily tour routes, they are caring, enthusiastic and real (unlike the Jimbaran smiles that disappears way too fast sometimes). The hotel bar was excellent, try the drink called Bodyheat, local drink with pinapple juice, or One for Two, the honeymooner's version of local twist on Cranberry Vodka. Afternoon tea is always free and everyone gets tea, coffee and three pieces of well-made dessert, usually a western style cake, a Japanese dessert, and somethng fresh. On the day we went the hazelnut cake of the day was excellent and melts on your tongue, and we had a really soft mochi ball and some fresh fruits. Overall, we loved this place and my husband said i could stay here a few more days! LOL. We honestly loved everything about this hotel. A recommended place for anyone visiting Bali and want to stay in Ubud for a day or two in order to order the art-central of Bali and the northern volcano and lake, and rice fields.

<Content>Heaven between rice terraces  Maya Ubud is located on a very large (10 hectares) area between rice terraces and River Petanu. The contour is very hilly but the place is designed very well with lush tropical gardens. You can hear sounds of the river down the valley, birds and crickets, see the birds, butterflies, and squirrels on the trees.There are 2 swimming pools: one at the lobby level, and the other is down the valley near the Spa, where you can see and hear the river. You can also enjoy the location from the River Cafe. There is a Nature Walk trail from the north down the valley past the old Balinese bath, a waterfall, going south to the Spa area.The resort is not far from central Ubud where you can find the Ubud Palace, Ubud market, galleries, shops, cafes and restaurants along the streets. There is a free shuttle bus from Maya Ubud every hour to central Ubud, or the resort can also help you if you prefer to rent a car or a motorbike.The resort provides activities such as trekking, cycling, yoga, and cooking class. It also has a library, and provides audio CDs  video DVDs which you can borrow at the Front Desk. There is free snacks and beverages everyday at tea time.We had a great stay there. The place was beautiful, our Garden Villa was nicely designed, and the staff were friendly and helpful. If you're looking for a relaxed, close-to-nature stay, I recommend this place.

<Content>Heavenly This is one of the most gorgeous places I've ever stayed. We were there for 3 days in April. The setting is amazing . We spent most of the time at the Infinity Pool, where they set you up with two plush towels and serve drinks and food at poolside. The roomswere very nice and airy; ours looked over a rice paddy. The staff was very helpful.The hotel runs a shuttle into town. Take it to Monkey Forest road, here you can shop for hours and get some ridiculously cheap items of all kinds. Be sure to bring an empty suitcase.

<Content>Its not hard to see why its won so many awards Having reviewed many of the top resorts in Bali for Yahoo!7 there is one outstanding resort which sets the standards for others to follow. The Maya Ubud is unique in so many ways it's not hard to see why its won almost every award in its category from Spa of the year award to the Trip Advisors Travellers Choice. Sometimes there is a gap between an award and the experience of staying there which is why i stayed a few days and didn鈥檛 just 'drop in'. I have to say that the Maya is in a class of its own. Located just a few minutes outside of Ubud, the long driveway takes you into another world...as you step across the candlelit water entrance and ascend onto a beautiful pavilion you know that this is no ordinary resort. The stress literally melts away as the beautifully dressed Balinese staff wrap you up in their warm hospitality and for the duration of your stay. The Maya blends contemporary design, tradition and luxury into an experience. If its a romantic getaway or honeymoon indulge yourself with a spa or garden villa with its Balinese grass roof, with plunge pools, day beds, DVD player and huge bathrooms. Waking up to the morning mist over the river valley and the smell of the forest is as unforgettable. If you prefer more formality the rooms in the hotel offer value for money but you would miss the best the Maya has to offer. I love the way the Maya embraces its majestic juxtaposition with nature. Every care has been taken to include the visitor to engage with the environment. A team of 35 gardeners attend to 10 hectares with knowledge and care. A 3:1 staff to guest ratio shows the attention to service. The botanic gardens are breathtaking. Just one of the free daily activities is a guided nature tour which takes you through a journey which descends many levels to river bed displaying the diversity of the environment. At secluded spots pavilions have been erected for yoga and meditation. Other daily complimentary activities include yoga to help kick start your 'new me' campaign. There are a number of restaurants to choose from and the cuisine is outstanding. The main restaurant is listed as one of the top 10 fine dining choices in Bali. Sourcing it鈥檚 ingredients from all over the world, including meat from Australia and fish from Tasmania. It even cures its salmon in-house. Many top resorts offer 'afternoon tea' as an attraction. But in essence its one cup of tea/coffee and a sponge cake if you are lucky. Not so the Maya. Afternoon tea is an event you manage your day around. A huge range of different teas, coffees and fruit juices are self service,. The buffet of finger sandwiches, cakes and savoury items is extensive and changed daily. Its a wonderful colonial tradition so often poorly provided by other resorts but the Maya does it in style.The spa is without doubt one of the best in the world. Its hard to lead in this category but the Maya has the magical combination which many lack...its environment. As you descend in an elevator through to just above the forest floor you step into another world. The spa is set atop the river bed. A private consultation leads you through a path to a wooden bridge over a black stone water pond to be greeted by a private spa pavilion. The doors open onto paradise with views on to the forest as swallows swoop and dive over the constant hum of the river below. The treatment is dreamlike. Soft music simply a backdrop to nature. Even the shower is run in advance not to interrupt any slumber like trance as the pewter bath is filled with frangipani flowers and a fruit plate is placed to compliment the senses. The Maya is an award winner in more ways than one.

<Content>Do yourself a favor... I spent most of my trip to Bali in Ubud at the Maya Ubud. It also happened to be my birthday. Not only was everything spectacular but I was greeted with lovely people singing and wishing me a happy birthday all day long. I don't know if it was just because it was a big birthday but they also had a cake and bouquet as well. I could not think of a better place to be. The people are so kind, pleasant and extremely accomodating in all ways. The place is beautiful and convenient to town. I went based on a recommendation from a friend's daughter but was thrilled to have it be better than anticipated. IMy only negative is that the drivers they supply who, I don't think, are hotel employees tend to be very aggressive about taking you to the shops even if you say you don't want to go. Overall, that is a problem at all times. Taking no for an answer is not in the make up of most of the hawkers. It gets very tiresome and one's politeness starts to waver. Tip. I enjoyed walking all over and found if you walk in the direction opposite to the traffic, it makes it more difficult for the motor bikes to come back for you. And don't make eye contact! You're doomed if you do. I ended up practically living in the spa anyway so it was all good (although I felt kind of guilty)

<Content>My favourite resort in Bali My husband and I recently spent 9 amazing days in Bali, staying at both Ubud and Seminyak. The trip was fabulous, the scenery breathtaking, the people so warm and friendly, the sights unbelievable................and the accomodation certainly made our stay even more memorable. We stayed at the Maya Ubud, set in the mountains.....................Fantastic place to get away if you want a more quiet remote feel..........and SO GREEN (the plant-life was beautiful and the setting simply stunning.) The staff at Ubud were fantastic! - helpful and friendly. On leaving Ubud, we felt a little cautious about heading to the coast at Seminyak(thinking nothing could be as good!!)....... However, from the moment we arrived at the Samaya, we didn't regret it for one moment!!! Absolutely sensational from the minute we were greeted at the lobby, by their friendly staff. The Samaya is truly an exotic resort with every facility on hand. It is set on the beach, and has a beautiful, relaxed tropical feel. Our villa was more exotic than I imagined - Just loved the jucuzzi/pool.......and bed SO COMFY!!! The Samaya's most outstanding feature, for us, was the fantastic staff and manager. They do a superb job of making you feel comfortable and always ready to assist you with anything!!! We felt very sad leaving the Samaya as we became very attached to the beautiful staff , and this beautiful part of the world. We had a most memorable holiday - A great Birthday present for me!!

<Content>Slightly disappointed We had stayed at the May in July 2005 and loved it. This time we came having stayed at the Uma for 5 nights and we do not know whether that was the reason we were disappointed. The weather last August was particularly bad and it rained for 3 days while we were at the Maya which of course did not help as we could not take advantage of the beautiful grounds, play tennis or go on the outings. ( However, the weather had been equally bad when we stayed at the Uma but we were not bored for one minute with lengthy, delicious meals, yoga, games, DVDs etc.) The hotel was full, which makes it quite different to two years ago when it was only 1/3 full. The client base seems to have shifted from Europeans (and Japanase) to Australians (and Japanese). We found the breakfast buffet less good than before. There was very little choice in cereals, fruits were not ripe. We ate in both restaurants and found quantities had been reduced. Whereas two years ago we would have a hearty breakfast and last until the evening meal, we had to eat at lunch time this year (as we had not had a satisfactory breakfast). Portions were small. If staying in Ubud, we would definitely choose the Uma over the Maya. Also, while the villas are nice (and expensive) the bedrooms are quite plain.

<Content>A great place to stay Spent a great Nyepi holiday here at the Maya Ubud. A nice relaxed check-in and buggy ride to our bungalow. We had a deluxe bungalow overlooking the rice terraces, a beautiful room with unique furnishings and a private terrace and garden. Beautiful gardens and walks, the grounds were huge and beautifully maintained! The swimming pool and spa areas were amazing and with stunning views. The quality of food and service everywhere in the hotel was 2nd to none! I cannot say enough good things about this hotel, WELL DONE!!!

<Content>A peaceful place to relax We stayed at Maya Ubud for 4 days during a honeymoon trip. We were in a superior room (no pool).Generally speaking we liked it a lot. The location of the hotel along the Petuna river (the whole domain is so wide!) is very nice and overall so peaceful! One remark however : we've been there in november, that is in the very low touristic season, the atmosphere may be much less quiet if all rooms are busy...Our room was very clean and, being a honeymoon trip, they prepared to us a flower bath and a honeymoon cake. The bath was amazingly large!!The lowest swimming pool is lovely since you have a fantastic view over the petuna valley!Morever, cocktails and food in general are good in the different restaurants (not to expensive). You also have a complimentary coffee/tea time at 4 pm.There is a free internet access all day long in a specific room (4 computers) : that's nice.As negative comments, we did not really appreciate that the staff tried to sell us an upgrade room with private swimming pool when we arrivied. He did not insist a lot but you do not expect such a behavior in that kind of hotel.Secondly, you have a free shuttle to go to Ubud center (5 min) but only till 5 pm. After you have to pay like 4 US$. Our advise : do not hesitate to go to Ubud for dinner as there are some lovely restarants (very good food and very cheap!)Finally we tried the spa center : the location is outstanding (you can hear the river!0 but it seemed to us a bit expensive (60 US$ for a 1-hour treatment)...As a conclusion, I would say that you can be disappointed if you expect a luxury hotel but Maya Ubud is nevertheless a good deal.

<Content>don't go to the maya ubud After 5 wonderful days at the Oberoi Bali, we had great expectations for the Maya Ubud...what a disappointment!!!After checking in, we were taken to our room by a staff member trying to sell us an upgrade at any cost, it was exactly as being harassed by a street hawker in Kuta! Only you don't expect this from a supposedly 5 star hotel staff.But the worst was yet to come. An outdated lift took us to our floor. The corridors were dark and uninviting, the kind you would expect to find in a hospital. But I guess it is an appropriate way to lead to the most filthy room I have ever encountered in an hotel of this caliber: hairs on the pillows, stains on the sheets etc and I pass you the worst details. After two long hours we were upgraded to a decent so-called villa that for me is just a standard 5 star hotel room...As for the bright spots, the setting is nice and the pools are superb.But that does make up for the negative parts. This is an overpriced 3 or 4 star hotels and there are plenty of much better hotels around.For your own sake don't come here!P.S. Look-out for my review of the Oberoi as you won't get disappionted by this hotel.

<Content>Great indulgence!!! I just came back yesterday from our honeymoon and had a great time at Maya Ubud. As arriving at the hotel in the evening, the lobby entrance was lid with many candles in the pond and it was simply fantastic! It was much better than the photos. They also brought a small cake for honeymoon gift! Next morning, I heard the roosters from the other side of the valley, which was refreshing. The breakfast was delicious with many selections. They provided nice afternoon tea everyday, and I was impressed by their great tea selection. It was good for us because we could taste some of the balinese snack/cakes as well. I think the quality of the restaurant is quite high. We tried both restaurant (maya sari and rivercafe), and food was sooooo delicious! And the restaurant staff was professional.Staff at Maya Ubud was very friendly, and we were surprised to receive a phone call on the second day and asked if everything is OK for us. I could feel that they cared about each guest and tried their best to make our stay memorable. All the staff including housekeeping and gardeners greeted us with smile when they pass by.As for the accomodation, we stayed at a pool villa facing the valley. There was a pulnge pool, which was just cozy for two! The interior was a mixture of Balinsese and modern design, not necessarily luxurious but natural which I like. Overall, Maya Ubud was comfortable place to stay and we felt home after staying 6 nights!! This place is perfect for honeymooners. The reception staff remembered us and we would definately come back to Maya Ubud.

<Content>4 out of 5 Stayed for 3 nights for first leg of our honeymoon.A very impressive resort if not a little too up-market.Villa - We stayed in a pool villa with rice paddy view. Lovely villa, huge bed, very nice flowers and plants. Downside - view wasn't that great and the outside felt a little cramped.Service - 5 star in every respectSpa - expensive for Indonesia, but the setting is spectacular. Set back in a valley, with it's own outdoor pool and heathly eating restaurant. A great place to truly sit back and relax for a morning or afternoon (no kids allowed).Activities - this I felt was a downfall, there is tennis and two hole golf practise course but you have to pay a lot for the priviledge. They also organise walks/trips but again expensive. And there is no gym. But Ubud very close by.Food - I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world, and the buffet breakfast here is second to none. Worth having a late breakfast (10.30-11.00) and then skipping lunch. An amazing mix of Western and Asian food. In the evening they have a very good buffet and entertainment which was fun.Location - only 5-10 mins from Ubud with a shuttle service (or just $4 in a taxi back from Ubud).MASSIVE Tip - if you fancy a 1-2 hour walk, turn LEFT out of the hotel, follow the road down and up a hill, and then as it swings around to the left you will enter into a small Indonesian Village smothered with temples and offerings, and if you keep going you hit rice fields. Didn't mean to focus on the negatives, this is a very impressive place.

<Content>Great Place to Destress..... Just returned from 3 nights at the Maya Ubud which was absolute heaven. We stayed in the superior garden villa - and the only sound to be heard was the birds and the occasional thwack of a tennis ball.The Spa is situated in a great location and the elevator ride down to reach the infinity pool and facilities is a great way to avoid the steps! We both had the 75 minute massages and it was so tranquil to only hear the sound of the river flowing below and the odd frog!The amenities around the hotel were excellent and we ate in most of the restaurants and found the service and food to be fantastic.We also did the nature walk with a guide and enjoyed going through the villages and walking through a rice paddy.All in all a great place to stay if you want to have peace and quiet but be close to main centre (5/8 minutes away)

<Content>Perfection Great location near Ubud. Architecture and setting were beautiful. Room was ideal: d茅cor, comfort, view - perfect. Staff extremely cordial and helpful. This was a good middle ground accommodation. There are far cheaper places but without the resort niceties and view. The much more expensive resorts do not seem worth the extra cost considering how great this was.

<Content>Serene Hotel and location This lovely hotel is set in a vast expanse of greenery and fields. It鈥檚 a bit of a walk from gate to the spa and pool complex 鈥?although there is a buggy service. We stayed in a 鈥渞egular鈥?room rather than a villa as we were only staying 2 days. I would recommend the villa鈥檚 they are lovely although there was nothing wrong with our room 鈥?and I think we actually got a bit more afternoon sunlight than them. Like another reviewer the sun at the pools is limited and you need to plan your day if you want to sun worship. It wasn鈥檛 an issue for us as going to Ubud is all about getting out and about 鈥?sightseeing and having treatments.The hotel is about a 20 min walk from the centre of Ubud but the hotel has a shuttle service and taxis are very easy to come by.Breakfast and dinner at the hotel was very good with a wide variety of food including western, Indonesian and Japanese. Breakfast is a buffet and had lots of fresh fruit and the usual suspects 鈥?for Japanese tourists were specifically catered for with wide range specialities. We had dinner one night at the hotel which was a choice between an Indonesian buffet or the a la carte. The hotel was extremely quite at night and we were the only ones in the bar after dinner 鈥?the hotel seems to cater to an early to bed/early risers crowd. There are lots of great places though in Ubud if you want buzz although Ubud is certainly not a 鈥減arty scene鈥?This is the perfect place to relax and enjoy the surroundings.

<Content>Stay here for the spa On the whole, it was a good place. Here's my list of the good and the bad:Good/Excellent- The Spa, the spa, the spa - this is the reason to come to this place!- Amazing views of the river area, nice pools- Nice villas- Ubud was fun- we saw a nice dance and eat great food (Lotus cafe and Mosiac, although don't go to mosiac unless you are ready for 7 course dinner of fancy food like you would find in New York or London)Annoyances-The food. We only ate breakfast and once at the river cafe. Breakfast was terrible. Really bad, both the in the choice, quality and service. The river cafe was decent but overpriced for what it was.- The set-up of the place. We found it very strange that there was straight path to walk to the pools/spa on the other side of the resort. We were constantly walking through the restaurant which got annoying because the service would also ask if wanted to eat something but we were just trying to get to the pool! I think this sounds silly, but the place was really not well laid out.

<Content>Very good Very nice hotel, albeit a bit stretched. Some guests might find the walk from one end of the complex to the spa/pool at the other end a bit far. Having said that, you can always call the bell boys to come and chauffeur you around in a buggy. I would recommend people to rent a garden villa at least, as I thought the normal hotel rooms did not properly convey the atmosphere of the place. We had a pool villa overlooking the valley which was very good, beware the sun only properly shines in the morning at that side of the hotel. This, by the way, was something I noticed for their two pools as well; (end) afternoon has little sunshine.Breakfast was very good with a wide variety of western/Indonesian and Japanese choices. Lot鈥檚 of fresh fruit and juices and the usual other bits. Dinner I can鈥檛 comment on as we had dinner in town every night (be sure to try Mozaic, my favorite restaurant in Asia so far worthy of 2 Michelin stars). The hotel seemed to be deserted at night (even though I was informed by front office that occupancy was very high due to the season) which did not entice me to use their FB facilities. I would rather have dinner in a slightly more 鈥渆xciting鈥?environment. This I must say was my only remark about the hotel, if you don鈥檛 like quit places you should look elsewhere, or go into town as we did every night and enjoy the relaxing surroundings of the hotel during the day!

<Content>Maya Still Wonderful This was our 5th stay at this hotel sinced it opened 5 years ago. we were feeling burned out from the Kuta/Seminyak and were in search of the real Bali again. Maya was the answer! Incredibly relaxing, romantic, lush, delicious food and of course, that wonderful Bali smiling service. Great value for money too. I could just sit in the inifity pool all day and look out over the gorge. It is that beautfiul. if you do stay here, I highly recommend just staying in the main building as it is more than enough to enjoy this magical place. Also, i would recommend going on a trek with their local guide Winana. He takes you on a two hour walk through rice fields, Balinese temples and even to his own home! Unforgettable...definitely a must see and stay hotel.

<Author>Driftergirl
<Content>simply the best A travel agent friend recommended this place. I had booked a cheap flight to Bali for a week and really hadn't considered staying in Ubud.....am so glad I was persuaded otherwise, as although I'd never stay in Kuta/Legian/Seminyak again, I would willingly come back to the Maya.I had a pool villa, although the resort was so quiet when I was there that I could have even stayed in the main building and had the pools to myself. I have never felt so spoilt in all my life - room with television and dvd/cd player, big bathtub, my own pool, and the only sound I could hear was the river running below. I found it hard to want to motivate myself to go into town (but guilt motivated me to at least try once - the hotel had a free service).I ate a couple of times at the riverside cafe, down by the spa - the food was fresh, healthy (I still remember the gazpacho with prawns very fondly!) - oh, and the menu was very inexpensive here (surprisingly so, given the cost of the hotel and nearby spa treatments). The main bar also had great service and I can highly recommend their local cocktails (I can't remember all the ingredients, but I had one with ginger, lemongrass and vodka that I can only describe as perfect).I did go into the spa for a massage - it's more expensive than in town, but the location was wonderful, and once I saw the view from the bathtub I was tempted to include a bath treatment too. I chatted with some of the staff - there are still things that they wanted to improve (one of the main ones was something to reduce the insects in the rooms........the only thing I can suggest might have been missing was a mossie net over the four poster bed, but then again, I liked sleeping with the door open too so am in part to blame for the number of visitors I received! Otherwise, rooms were sprayed regularly to reduce bugs).If, like me, you need the odd holiday where you need to slow down, this is the perfect spot. Oh, and the free internet in the library meant that I could easily send an email home to everyone to make them jealous too!

<Content>Elegant  My husband and I stayed at the Maya Ubud for 4 nights recently in one of the beautiful plunge pool villas. We were struck by the amazing service of their staff; they were all so gracious and genuinely nice. They cater to your every need; I asked if they had a candle to freshen up our room and they brought us an amazing incense set that we were able to bring home! Afternoon tea is a must, especially if you're lucky enough to catch it during a rainstorm. They also have a wonderful transport system, they are absolutely dependable when it comes to pick ups.

<Content>SImply brilliant This is an amazing hotel. Certainly not one for families but if you are in Bali for Culture, Romance or just a peaceful break, The Maya Ubud is an exceptional hotel. Could rant and rave about it for hours. Once you have a friendly driver, preferably one with A/c in his car, then its an ideal base to see the whole of Bali.Hotel is certainly worthy of Travellers Choice 2006 Best Hidden Gem - Congrats to whoever got them this accolaide.

<Content>Best Place Ever This is the best place I ever stayed in!!!!We had a plunge pool villa: a very tranquil and luxurious villa in every sense of the word. It has a living-room, a four-posted-bed, a dressing and a gorgeous spacious bathroom. Outside was our own private pool, app. 2,5m by 6m and a very private garden with views over the tropical forest that surrounds the hotel.In one of the gorges of the river, that flows nearby, a very tranquil health-spa is located. It also has a beautiful pool with private sitting areas. The massage and spa-treatments were superb!Near the main building of the hotel there is a panoramic pool, again with vieuws over the tropical forest and again with very private sitting areas.The food was exquisite! For breakfast, there is the traditional Indonesian breakfast, but also American breakfast and also a Japanese breakfast buffet. There is a panoramic bar with great cocktails and pre-dinner drinks.The diners we had there were also great, but we often went to Ubud for diner. One evening there was a traditional dance being performed in the hotel, which was great! About 40 or 50 dancers and musicians entertained us - all very professional and serene, though: very classy.The reception and the staff is very professional and discreet. They will do their utmost best to be as invisible as possible, yet alway delevering their best service!We felt being treated like royalty!If you're looking for peace and quiet, excellent service and beautifull surroundings, I would definately recommend this hotel!It comes very close to being paradise!!

<Content>Would definitely come here again! I'm very happy that I stayed at the Maya. The service was very gracious. Pretty much all of our needs were taken care of. We were here on our honeymoon -- they left us a honeymoon cake in our room when we arrived! I also loved their no-tip policy. I hate worrying about taking money with me when I go to the pool, etc. Our room overlooked the rice terraces. The view was outstanding!The restaurant in there was very good as well. While I'm usually leary of hotel restaurants, I would have to say that this restaurant was our second favorite (our first, being Mozaic). We had a beautiful table overlooking the jungle during lunch. During dinner, we opted to be inside. Both were fabulous experiences.The one thing I wasn't too crazy about was that one of the shuttle drivers tried to take us to a batik shop. He was probably going to get a commission, and said that we only could stay there for 10 minutes because he had to take the shuttle back. So he was definitely doing this behind the hotel's back. But one bad apple did not spoil the batch in this case.

<Content>high end From the first moment till the check out everything was as perfect as it could be in a hotel. Unique, exclusive hotel with stunning environment and pools. The garden is the best I've ever seen. The two infinity pools are gorgeusly situated in the lush tropical jungle. The staff is more than kind, the entire place is fantastic. Only the range of food was not so wide what you could expect, but the quality of the meals were excellent. The location is also astonishing: in the center of the jungle, on the river bank, but only 15 minutes walk from the center of the village. Broadband internet is free of charge. We booked a garden villa (413), I can recommend that one. Not far from the lobby, but absolutely secluded with a marvellous small own garden. The villa interior is fine, with a very nice bathroom. The rooms in the main building seemed a bit usual, I can imagine that in that building you wouldn't have the same feeling what you can experience in a villa. To sum up: absolutely top-notch hideaway resort in a marvellous environment in Bali, with excellent staff and service.

<Content>was ok but not as good as expected We stayed at Maya for 4 nights in one of their pool villas. Overall we had a nice stay and the room was specious but nothing too special for the price you are paying. The service during breakfast was not very good - to get a refil for your coffee (served in cups) was a stretch for the staff every morning. Even though there was a 90% occupancy rate (Xmas period) the hotel did not have a 'warm' feeling. The grounds are pretty and well maintained and we enjoyed using the golf and the tennis. Overall we enjoyed our stay but would not go back as there is better value to be had for the money we spend in other hotels in Ubud. They were ok with children but I did not like them not allowing the children in lower pool and restaurant while the hotel did not inform us about this during booking.

<Content>Great grounds, but expensive for what you get A wonderful cliff-side setting in a good location. Very nice pools and good tennis court. The normal block rooms were quite average (maybe the villas are better), as were the restaurants. Also, the hotel lacks a gym, which seems like a fairly basic requirement for a hotel of this caliber (and price). Overall, although the hotel was very nice, I thought it was expensive for what you got, and didn't quite click (in terms of service and facilities) in the way a more professionally managed place might.

<Content>We loved it!! we stayed at the Maya Ubud for 5 nights from the 25th September and we LOVED it!We have stayed at many top-quality hotels throughout the world, but we loved this hotel's mix of great staff, quiet relaxing location, lovely food, and comfortable well-designed rooms. Food at the hotel was more expensive than in Ubud, but was good quality, without rip-off prices.It takes about 20 minutes to walk into the centre from the hotel, and we made good use of the shuttle service. After 6.00 you can phone the hotel from your retaurant and they will send a taxi for you for IRP35k.Complimentary beginner's pilates class with Gina was good, and the complimentary afternoon tea and cakes was lovely.As we are both vegtarian, we were imporessed by the number of vegetarian choices, especially for dinner.We will definitely go back to Maya Ubud, and would recommend this strongly (Eg better than Datai Langkawi, Four seasons Chiang Mai etc etc)

<Content>Truly Outstanding! Just got back from a whirlwind trip around the world, and the Maya Ubud was perhaps the best hotel experience I encountered. The location is perfect, the grounds immaculate, and the staff is incomparable. Everyone working at the hotel was extremely friendly, and knew my name and treated me like I was a guest in their home. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Ubud, and even rate it higher than the Four Seasons (especially for the money), which I also visited during my trip. The Maya is a hidden gem that won't stay under the radar for long!

<Content>A Beautiful Experience, Beautiful Place What a wonderful experience... I can't say enough about Maya. We stayed for 6 days, 5 nights in a pool villa and it was simply lovely. Our room combined Balinese touches with modern beauty and it was a pleasure to be in it. We took advantage of the daily activities (yoga, nature walk) and enjoyed them. I also booked a bike tour with Winanna and it was one of the highlights of my trip.Another highlight was my spa treatment at the Maya... a massage, scrub and flower-petal bath overlooking a rushing ravine... truly three of the best hours of my life. It was that good.We found breakfast to be excellent and although the hotel restaurants were good, there are so many great places to eat in Ubud that we didn't spend too much of our time in them.Overall, an excellent experience. Go out of your way or out of your budget to stay at Maya, if that's what it takes. Highly recommended!
