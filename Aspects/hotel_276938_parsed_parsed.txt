<Content>would stay again My partner  I stayed at the hotel to see in Paris over the New Years. The location was perfect with good access to the metro, la Marais and other local amenities.The room was very clean, flat screen TV, our own balcony with ensuite.The staff were very friendly and they certainly made the stay very enjoyable.The rooms were cleaned to a high standard each day. The breakfast included in the price was fine, nothing too fancy but as Paris is so expensive (with the 拢  Euro being equal) it was a great opportunity to fill ourselves up!We would return again to the hotel and we would certainly recommend it.Bonne ann茅e!

<Content>Mixed experience... My partner and I booked this hotel after reading positive reviews on TripAdvisor. I would say the experience of staying was a mix of both good, so-so and bad points as follows:The good: as mentioned in previous reviews the staff are very friendly and very helpful. Comfortable beds and pillows. Great shower pressure. Flat screen TV. Close location to metro (Temple/Republic).The so-so: small room size (to be expected in Paris). Average breakfast (but included in room rate so not too much to complain about). Small bathroom and see through door! Small bedsize (double not queen so quite cozy for two tall people).The bad: the room noise! We had a front facing room (4th floor) with balcony and the traffic noise outside was unbearable as Rue de Turbigo is a through road from Republique. There was also considerable noise from the hallway due to other guests talking and coming/going + early morning cleaning by staff. Despite other reviews claiming double glazing, it wasn't our experience and we had to shift rooms due to a very sleepless night. The second room we had was better, but thin walls still meant that other guests were audible.Overall, I would say the the noise outweighed other benefits about the hotel and probably wouldn't stay again for that reason.

<Content>Warm staff and lovely breakfast The staff there including receptionists and cleaning staff was all very kind and warm. Espeacially Liinaa kindly gave us a detailed information about our questions. Thanks a mil!! Although our room was a little small, the bathroom was cute and the breakfast area was so fabulous!! Bread was incredibly delicious, too!!We could walk to the 2 Metoro stations - Temple and Republique - freely so it was very useful. The supermarket Monoprix was just in front of the hotel so it was convenient.Joyeux Noel,Aco Masuda

<Content>little comfort, pricey We stayed there for 3 nights (m70, f64), motivated by the high trip advisor ranking. the hotel is quite small, located in between other 6-story-houses near place de a republique and far from the marais centre. Not a very enjoyable neighbourhood. The hotel has six floors with one (1) staircase. Rooms are very small, beds are too small for 2 persons. Breakfast is horrible even for paris standards. the price for a double room (139 EUR without breakfast/ 10 EUR) is higher than what you pay for a three-star-hotel with more comfort and security in Paris. The staff is friendly and helpful.

<Content>Good location and cheap Just got back from a week's trip to Paris and enjoyed a lovely stay at this hotel. The location is very convenient with the Temple Metro literally a few paces from the front door of the hotel, and Republique station just up the road. The hotel room itself was quite small but more than adequate for a two star hotel. We had a room on the sixth floor which faced the main road. It can be quite noisy with the window open so I'd suggest a room on the upper floors. The lift is tiny, but very quaint! The biggest pull of this hotel is the staff, who were all very warm, welcoming, and charmingly friendly. We attempted our meagre French when speaking to them, and they all reverted to fluent English straight away when they noted we were struggling. They are certainly the biggest assets to the hotel.Location-wise, the walk into town is not as far as it appears on the map. A leisurely stroll gets you to the George Pompidou centre in no time, and before you know it, you've arrived at Notre Dame!! There are also plenty of Velib cycle renting stalls nearby so if you feel energetic, there's an option as well! Finally, breakfast was included as part of our stay. I wouldn't pay a tenner for it though had it not been included.

<Content>Le Relais du Marais is a great spot. In my recent trip to Paris, I stayed at H么tel le Relais du Marais for five nights and thoroughly enjoyed my accommodation. The hotel is clean and they change the towels and make bed daily. The location of the hotel is great, just 2 minutes walk from two metro station. The staff is most helpful and very friendly, happy to take the time to provide maps, directions, and advice on how to get where. It proved to be an excellent choice.

<Content>Great value, friendly staff, perfect location I stayed at Le Relais du Marais for 3 nights. My room was perfectly adequate for one, and the bathroom was really big by Paris hotel standards. My room was spotless, the bathroom was very clean - no complaints about the room. It was truly a value for the price.Most importantly, the staff couldn't have been nicer. Very friendly and helpful!!! The location is great - 2 metro lines within viewing distance of the front door, including the Place de Republique. All in all a wonderful stay and a true bargain for Paris. I'd stay there again for sure and would recommend it to others.

<Content>Great location, lovely staff We stayed at the Relais du Marais for a total of 6 nights in September over 2 stays. The location was great - very handy to 2 metro stations, but also good just to walk out from. Both rooms we stayed in were charming - one up on the 6th floor particularly so. Best of all the front desk staff were exceptionally helpful. When we arrived to check in the second time it felt like coming home. Highly recommended.

<Content>REALLY ENJOYED OUR STAY On arrival I was a bit disappointed with our room but only because I had seen photos of other rooms by other trip advisors. Our room was small, dated with marks on the walls and paint peeling off the walls.. The corridor was also very smoky. However as this was a 2 star hotel and we were not planning on spending too much time in our room anyway we were not worried. I must say however that the room was very clean, the bedding was spotless as was the bathroom and there was always plenty of hot water. The bed was comfy and we always had a good nights sleep. We also had a small balcony but unfortunately this only looked onto another building. The breakfast was fine as we were only there for 4 nights - yogurt/puree fruit,cheese,croissants,bread rolls,eggs and cereal. The situation of the hotel was brilliant as it was so close to 2 Metro stations, the area had a nice buzz to it with plenty of eating places and was within walking distance to most parts of the city. Would I stay here again?Absolutely - but I hope to get a more funky room next time.

<Content>Good but not great Polite staff, small but clean rooms, fine for a quick stay. But the biggest drawback is the location, which (despite the name of the hotel) is not really in the heart of Le Marais. You could certainly do worse, but in my opinion, the Hotel Caron de Beaumarchais -- comparably priced, much more charming, and right in the coolest part of the Marais on Rue Vielle du Temple -- is a much better choice.

<Author>Maryberry47
<Content>Excellent Choice My husband and i chose this hotel after reading lots of reviews about it on trip advisor. We were not disappointed. The hotel was extremely clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful to us. Our room wasnt very big , but efficient. We requested a balcony (smokers!), the views were brilliant. They were of the main street at the front of the hotel. The bathroom was very clean and lots of clean towels , soap , toilet roll. Our bed sheets were changed very day. (These things may seem like someting that is expected, but from reading LOTS of reviews for different hotels in paris, not all of them even provided the basics).The breakfast was coffee, cereal, crossiants , bread rolls, fruit, eggs, orange juice. It was perfectly fine. it was included with our hotel deal (alpha rooms.com).The location was good. We walked to the seine on the first day and it took us 20 mins. There are good restaurants in the republique area.Paris is expensive, so dont come thinking you wont spend a fortune, because you probably will. Average meal for two is aprox 50 euros. But if you go the latin quarter beside notre dame, there is alot of choice and cheaper about 30.EXTRA INFORMATION - ( which you may find useful, i know i would have!)We flew into CDG. We took RER B train to La Gard du Nord station and then Metro line 5 to the Republique Station. the hotel was a 5 minute walk away. We bought a paris viste pass (47 euro each) expensive enough, but that takes you to and from the airport, and around all the city as many times as you want. you will need transport for some of the attactions. there are different options though. check out:http://parisbytrain.com/charles-de-gaulle-airport-cdg-to-paris-by-train/

<Content>Small and Sweet The hotel had an excellent location, a stone's throw from one of Paris's metro stations and a long (but not too straining) walk from some of the city's major attractions, including the ile de la cite and the place des vosges.The rooms that me and my relatives stayed in, as well as being spotlessly clean, were individualised with their own colour schemes and quirky features (nifty bathroom doors and peacock feather cushions in mine) and the balcony view was a complete stunner of the Place de la Republique. Although, if I'm being picky, the smell of cigarette smoke was, on occassions, a bit too pervasive for my liking.The breakfast buffet was pretty good but could nonetheless have done with a little more variety in terms of food offered (eggs only patchily available). But nonetheless, the little breakfast room was splendidly decorated, cheerful and pleasant.Staff always friendly and accomodating, many with good English for those of us with patchy French. A perfect embellishment on a lovely holiday.

<Content>Great Hotel I booked a weekend through Airmiles with my daughter and son for a bit of sightseeing. We stayed three nights and was delighted with the hotel. It was so clean and comfortable that it made our stay an extremely pleasant one. The staff couldn't do enough, the location was great, very safe and central to all the locations we wanted to go to. I would thoroughly recommend it.

<Content>Great Hotel close to everything I just spent 3 days at the hotel and like other reviews I found the staff exceptionally friendly and very helpful..nothing was too much trouble for them. The hotel is right next to Temple station and 3min walk from Republic metro, so you can get everywhere in Paris . There are lots of shops, cafes, a supermarket and great bakery only a street away. 10min walk is the main Maris area with all the sidewalk cafes and bars. The hotel was very modern and clean with a trendy breakfast room which has an outside balcony. I had a top floor room (ok size for one but maybe a bit small for two...but on par with other hotels in Paris) with a window overlooking the street and it was great to look out over Paris and watch all the happenings in the street below. The lift is very tiny and slow moving. The breakfast was ok but for 10euro its worth trying one of the outdoor cafes. I can highly recommend this hotel and will be staying there again when I return to Paris.

<Content>Small, friendly, clean  We have just returned home from a 5-night stay in Paris at this hotel. From the moment we arrived until we checked out, every single member of the staff was incredibly helpful. Yes, the rooms are on the small side, but they are scrupulously clean and the beds are comfortable - and the A/C was very welcome at night.Great location, too - 2 Metro stations within a couple of minutes walk - although it is fair to say that it is on the Northern corner of the Marais, not in its centre.Overall, we were very happy to stay here, and are sure the staff will make you welcome too.

<Content>It was GREAT to be back Last year I visited Paris and stayed in this hotel. I enjoyed my stay so much I came back hoping to get a similar welcome. If possible I would say it was even better!!!I loveed staying at Le Relais du Marais. Thank you all staff.The room was not big but all I do there is sleep... Why pay more for space you don't need? Clean  tidy room  bathroom.By the way, ask the reception for good places to eat. Great recommendations!!!

<Content>A gem We stayed 2 nights the weekend of 18 July. We were delighted. Compared to other 2 stars hotel in Paris, this one is worth a very good 3 stars at least. Refurbishment of the common areas was completed in March and the rooms only 3 weeks ago. Rooms are tastefully decorated. Yes the rooms are small, but who spend their weekend in their room? We liked the light going on/off automatically in the corridors as you walk. Really like the outdoor patio of the breakfast room, especially when you escape the London rain and find yourself sitting outside enjoying the gorgeous croissant and pain au chocolat. The staff are well trained and are courteous and helpful: they do make this hotel a special place. The hotel location is great. you are within 15mn off all the main sites: Champs Elys茅es, Pont de l'Alma and its delightful Bateaux-Mouche, Eiffel Tower, Montmartre, etc. Will definitely stay there should we need a hotel in Paris.

<Content>Absolutely Perfect This hotel was lovely ... it was in the perfect location as it was not too far out but also not in a very busy area. There are 2 metro stations very close. If you go to the repubique station you can get the metro to most attractions you wish to see. The staff in the hotel were fantastic very friendly and go out of your way to help! The rooms are cleaned daily and fresh towels and bed linen is put in. The view out of the windows is lovely ... nice to see the classic french buildings. And if you are staying in a room at the front of the building ... look out to the left of your window at night ... can see the top of the eiffel tower! Those who arent staying bed and breakfast there is a supermarket around the corner which does great pastries. There are lots of restaurants quite close by, if you walk up the street to the first junction and then left there are some great places, if you keep going you will come to Notre Dame. Only down side is they like you to leave the key with them ... though we did not have any problems with this.All in all this hotel was just what we wanted, had the perfect 21st birthday.

<Content>Lovely little hotel which makes an effort I stayed at Le Relais du Marais for 4 nights by myself (I'm a 20 something female). Room was small - would have felt more so with 2 people and larger luggage but for me was fine - my little case fitted in the wardrobe - but perfectly formed. I had a lovely view across the street and was on the 4th floor. Double glazing must have been good as noise didn't disturb my sleep at all (though city noise tends not to bother me). I was there midweek and pretty sure nobody was in the adjoining room so no problems there - though if I'd had inconsiderate neighbours there may have been an issue. Room was spotlessly cleaned every day. Breakfast room has cool decor and food was perfectly nice. All staff were really friendly. I speak French but I heard them speak good English to other guests. I knew Paris well already (having lived there before) and have absolutely no problem with the area. Ignore the review about not taking lines 3 and 11 at night - I'd take care anywhere in a big city at night but these lines are fine. I'd recommend it to anyone who's on a budget but still wants to stay somewhere very decent. I booked through Turquoise Tours online - one night free!

<Content>Great hotel for a good price The hotel was great. Room recently renovated, both room and bathroom spotless and cleaners did a great job every day. The breakfast was great - cereals, tea/coffe, fresh croissants, yoghurt, cheeses, bread, etc. Staff at the desk were always friendly and very helpful. Less than two minutes walk to a metro station and a few minutes to MonoPrix a large supermarket. The only downside is the room was small...but then a lot are in Europe. For the price it is a great hotel and I would recommend staying here.

<Content>Friendly staff Few days ago me and my wife went to Paris for the weekend, i.e. thursday to sunday. Paris was great! and the friendly staff at the hotel was a part of it.At arrival, late on thursday evening, we weren't sure if the breakfast was included so we asked and was told that it was. But it wasn't!, the man in the reception probably misread it. At checkout we were then told that it was NOT included BUT we didn't have to pay for it anyway. Sometimes when people make mistakes like theese they tend to get a bit arrogant but the lady in the reception was just more kind then ever. Leaving you with happy thoughts in stead of making you feel guilt.As in many hotels in Paris, the corridors are small and the elevator only for 3 persons max (or one guy from Texas). Everything was clean, no bugs, everything just shiny.The WiFi Internet access worked fine. Bathroom shiny and plenty of water from the shower.Comfortable bed and extra blankets in the closet for colder nights. Air conditioning loudless and good.Overall just a nice pleasent stay. I will defenitely use this hotel again on my next visit.Kind regards,Gunnar 脼贸r, Iceland.

<Content>Excellent 2 star hotel in Paris. I booked this nice hotel through Airmiles ( flight too). It is a very nice hotel. My room was recently refurbished in a modern way, with warm terracotta themed curtains and furnishings. It was very cheerful and pleasant to sleep in. th bathroom is sufficient and very modern. The water pressure excellent, and the bath fills up a treat!The hotel is seconds from the Temple metro stop, which makes it very easy to get around. La Republique ( the place and the Metro stop) is just up the road a few minutes away, and that metro is a main hub. Get a Paris visite card from the Metro machines, it's easy and cheaper that way. 1,3,5 day cards available.The staff are very friendly and helpful. Lots of tourist brochures, and it has a nice breakfast bar. It does cost a fair bit to eat there, but it is nice food. There are lots of cheaper places to eat around the area by the way. So why not vary each day, but show a little loyalty to the hotel too! There is a Monoprix supermarket just around the corner from the hotel. It's Tesco prices not Netto though. But who cares, the food on sale is french and excellent!There are no irons or ironing boards available, or room safe ( mine didn't have one) or tea making facilities, or minibar. But this is a top end 2 star, and believe me it's a good hotel to sleep in, and it's got good insulation with double glazed windows. I didn't get to grips with the air conditioning.There were no unneccessary swipes of my credit card, no little extras charged which i hadn't used, all very top notch customer services. The staff were kind and courteous, and very decent.I will be using this hotel again as a base to explore Paris. I felt comfortable and relaxed there. As i did in Paris as a whole, Paris is quite laid back, that surprised me for a capital city.But Paris is so used to tourists and seems to accept them, but be warned. Relax there, leave the drama-queen traveller mindset at home, just shrug the shoulders if things don't go your way, be patient and I think the French will accept you all the more! There is little point getting all hot and bothered about things.Chill out, relax and amble your way around Paris whether it's shopping, or Museum stalking, or just walking. And if a problem arises, just take a deep breath, smile, and it will be resolved all the quicker. C'est possible!Tee hee!

<Content>Just fine We booked here because we were obliged to spend a night in an airmiles hotel and this was the cheapest near le Marais.It was easy to get to and convenient if you are planning to travel by the metro but wasn't really in le Marias - a 10 minute walk away in fact. However it was clean, the room was an okay size and it had a (small) bath. Make sure you feel comfortable with your travelling companion if you are sharing a room as there is a (slightly opaque) glass sliding door which does little to protect your modesty when using the toilet in a confined space!The best thing about the hotel were the staff on reception. They were very helpful and friendly and made all the difference to our stay. The breakfast was fine too- served in a light bright breakfast room on the first floor. We had a choice of bread, crossaints, fruit, jam, coffee, cereals, cheese, yoghurts etc and it was available from 7.30 - 10.30 which was great.As in the title..just fine...

<Content>Highly recommended This is our second stay at this hotel. Loved the location, very convenient for moving around with 2 metro stations nearby. Friendly and helpful staff. Served a more than you need continental buffet breakfast. At our first visit (Dec 2007) we had a room facing the back which was a bit small, this time we had a bigger unit facing the road which was great. Might be a bit noisy, but the double glazing windows does solve the problem.

<Content>We will go back there! In reading all the reviews on this hotel, it is important to remember it is a 2/3 star hotel and not a 5 star. But having said that, in many respects it was better than a 5 star. For example, the way you are treated by the staff makes you feel like you are the only guest there - they always had the time to chat, help and smile. We had room 34 overlooking the road at the front. Yes, of course the traffic was noisy, is this not the centre of a major city? But the double glazing was excellent and could shut out all the noise if it was necessary. The room was not huge, but quite adequate for our short stay. It was clean and functional, and the big double bed was firm and very comfortable. The bath/shower room was fresh and clean, if a little small. And oh boy, what a breakfast they serve up! No, not an English breakfast, something much better. Healthy, energy food and lots of it! If you are looking for a clean and friendly good-value 2/3 star hotel in central Paris, look no further. We will definitely go there again - even if I could afford to go to a 5 star! Finally, forget the review about the rooms that are near to the lift and effected by its noise, there is no noise.

<Content>Great Place My wife and I stayed in a double room and our cousin stayed next door in a single room. We were all very pleased with the rooms. Clean rooms and comfortable beds. Also, the hotel staff were wonderful and friendly. When I tried my poor french out, he didn't wince and even continued speaking in french to me--most of the french will just respond to you in english as soon as they hear a horrible accent like mine. But don't worry, the staff speaks excellent english too and were always friendly and helpful. Also, we noticed this across several shifts--everyone was great!The location is also very nice for getting around to all the sights. Will def. stay there again.

<Content>Pot luck I guess we must have been unlucky based on the other reviews. Our room was dirty; half decorated as if started a few years ago and left e.g. pencil lines on the walls. There was insufficient storage for a five night stay: a small wardrobe with only one shelf which was occupied with spare blankets and pillows, a small battered desk, a chair and one bedside shelf. Where to put our suitcases? Store our clothes? We ended up operating out of our suitcases and I managed to secure an extra chair to use as a bedside table. The bed sagged badly in the middle causing roll-together which was not good as the room was very hot in the night even with the air conditioning on full blast. Furthermore we suspect that the bottom sheet and whatever lay beneath it was not properly made up by the maid as the bed was uneven and bumpy. English-speaking TV is BBC World and CNN news only. Our room overlooked the back of apartments and was dark and dingy.The person who greeted us told us that our room was beautiful!The breakfast was fine as were the staff but our horrible room did detract from the enjoyment of our holiday. Location is central but no way is it in the heart of the Marais and actually the area is quite quiet and devoid of good places to eat and drink (L'Absinthe excepted).All that being said if you don't get Room 47 you may have a better stay than we did.

<Content>great base for exploring We arrived at this hotel very late at night, and were greeted by a very helpful staff member who outlined exactly the best place to go for late night meals. All of the front desk staff at this hotel were friendly and courteous. The location is great, we walked from the hotel to the Pompidou centre, Notre damme, Louvre and back again, and we had no problems. the area directly around the hotel is relatively cheap compared to the rest of Paris ( I.e., still very expensive) and we found some truly great places to eat and drink.We booked the hotel through turquoise tours, and I would highly recommend them as it was so much cheaper and completely hassle free when we arrived. We got a 3 nights for 2 deal which really was so cheap. The room we had was small, but exactly as we expected. the shower was brilliant, better than our one at home!! You can hear a lot of goings in in the hotel, particularly as the room adjacent door was literally right next door to ours. But we knew that this would be the case, and for the price we really didn't mind. The bed was comfortable enough, and although the view wasn't good at all we hadn't planned on staying in the room much anyway! As we were out drinking and eating every night til after 2 am we never made it to the breakfast - we were awake but after steak and chips ad midnight we just weren't hungry again until lunchtime the next day! I would definitely recommend it and would stay there again, particularly for the location and staff.

<Content>Refurbished rooms We were very impressed with this hotel, for the price range. The staff were very friendly and efficient. Our room had recently been refurbished with a contemporarary feel and although small, (in typical Parisien style) was spotless. I have stayed in other city centre hotels that exceed in price but don't come up to the same standard that you'll find here. It's not luxury but that is reflected in the price. If you're out all day sight seeing and you want to walk back through the centre of Paris to a clean , comfortable room then this place is ideal.

<Content>Decent hotel, terrific location My daughter and I stayed here for a week in mid-March 2008 We will definitely stay here again. The room was very clean...basic but comfortable. We were on a higher floor; so traffic noise was not a problem with the windows closed, or even open for the that matter. (I'm a sound sleeper.) The staff is very friendly and helpful, as well as English speaking. The hotel's location can't be beat. Just around the corner is the Monoprix supermarket with many reasonably priced take-out salads, sandwiches, terrific breads and cheeses, etc. The area has pharmacies, bakeries, all kinds of shops. Plenty of nice cafes nearby too. We tried a different one every night for beer/tea/coffee/wine and were never disappointed. One subway stop is basically under the hotel and a big one--Republique-- with several lines intersecting, is five minutes away. From either of these stops, it is an easy and quick trip to the key areas of the city. For a reasonably priced hotel, this is a fine choice.

<Content>Exceeded Expectations!! I stayed here for 6 nights and had a wonderful experience!! The room was clean, comfortable, modern and a perfect size for someone traveling alone. The staff were super friendly and went out of their way to help me and they were happy to practice speaking french with me! The area was awesome...a short walk to everything and the marais area was everything I hoped Paris would be. There is a little cafe 30 seconds away called the Croisanterie where i grabbed fresh juice, coffee and croissants every morning (for half the price of the hotel's breakfast) and the monoprix around the corner came in very handy when my luggage didn't make it and I had to buy some clothes, food and toiletries. As a woman traveling alone I was concerned about safety of the area and I found that I was really comfortable there and I had no qualms about walking at night in the neighbourhood. I found some of the negative reviews for this hotel to be kind of silly....of course the rooms are smallish and it's not in a rural community so there will be some city noise. Overall, an excellent experience and I highly recommend staying here. I will be back!

<Content>Great Value for Money Being just 2 stars I was worried the hotel wouldn't be very good quality but when we arrived we were very pleasantly surprised. The manager greeted us very warmly, spoke excellent English and was very friendly. The room was clean, modern and to a very good standard. The location was excellent being in the centre of Paris. Overall I would visit again and have recommended it to all my friends.

<Content>Exceeded Expectations I'm really surprised at some of the negative reviews on this hotel. I thought the hotel was great value, it was also a great location for my needs i.e. right outside of Temple Metro and only a 5 minute walk to Republique Metro (which takes you straight to Gare Du Nord). The hotel is simple - don't expect The Dorchester if you're paying for a Travel Lodge. Nice room though with plasma TV, good powerful shower and a very comfortable bed. It wasn't noisy at all for me - I stayed on the third floor - however I do like a drink so maybe I'm not the best guest to pass comment on that one! Overall though good value and no complaints.

<Content>So So The hotel is located right above the Temple Metro, which is good but bad. If you're a light sleeper, don't stay here. The walls are paper thin and you can hear the train every two minutes beneath the hotel! The staff were nice but the hotel is a bit dark and dank for my taste. I should have stay in the Latin Quarter, wasn't crazy about Marais.

<Content>Outstanding value, can't beat the location We found a pay-for-2-stay for-3-night special on a European website (Turquoise Tours and Travel, out of London). Total cost for two adults, including breakfast, was $285.The hotel is situated less than 100 meters from the metro station Temple, or about 250 meters from the metro Republique. Our flight from the US arrived at CDG at 9:45 a.m. and at 11:10 a.m. we checked into the hotel.Hotel staff is very friendly and appeared to appreciate our speaking French to them but obviously spoke English well. The room was rather small but not too small--typical size for Paris. It was not claustrophobic. Quiet windows, a very clean and modern bathroom, very nice shower, daily fresh towels, soap, and shampoo; comfortable (=firm) Queen-sized bed. (Note: The hotel has no rooms for three persons or more.) Small flat screen TV with lots of cable offerings; good lighting in the room; only one AC outlet; free WiFi in the hotel, included in price. Breakfast (great coffee, OJ, cereal, croissant, cheese, eggs, jams, bread, joghurt, no meats) is served in a bright, totally newly refurbished breakfast room--very happy, clean, and just refreshing. There's an outside veranda for the sumer months.The location of the hotel is fabulous: A Velib bicycle station is located maybe 50 meters away, giving you immediate access to the Latin Quarter (10 min), Marais (6 to 7 min), Opera (15 min), Louvre (10 min). neighborhood is safe, relatively quiet. There's a large Monoprix grocery store just around the corner, 2 min walk. We've stayed in lots of different places in Paris and this is our new favorite (apart from the two in-town Hilton properties, but you don't get in there for this price. :))We'd highly recommend this property, especially if you can score a deal the way we did.

<Content>Noisy Room I realise that it is only a 2 star hotel, but the experience could have been much better. Booked this Hotel through Airmiles. So We were expecting a really good standard of hotel albeit the 2 star status.Also we booked on the understanding the hotel was actually in the Marais which is the area we wanted to be for socialising at night. this was not the case. It was at best on the very edge of the marais and was 2 metro stations away.The room was tiny, The bathroom flooded every time we took a shower. Also the room was right next to the lift shaft which was very very noisy. Also I think anytime used the toilet in any other room. the smell was shared to our room. that is the most polite way I can think of to write what I am trying to sayI think if you request a front view you will have the busy main road, But less likely to hear the noise of the lift.The hotel lobby and public area's were very nice, the staff very friendly and helpful and spoke excellent english. Help with Taxi's and directions. Nothing was a problem to them. The breakfast room was lovely and modern. The breakfast was very good.The hotel is quite central. Having Temple metro right next to the hotel and the main Republique only a 5 minute walk away. We used the Metro a lot and found it easy to use.I hope this review helps anyone reading.

<Content>Nice but noisy Stayed here for four nights as it was good value and one of the only places we could book (stayed the week before the big Rugby final). First time to Paris and so cannot compare this to anything else. The room was small, but managable. The decor was nice (a budget boutique hotel). The bathroom had been recently redone and was quite nice, very modern. But the noise! We stayed on the first floor (they did not have a room higher up) and facing Turbigo. The staff said, Just shut the windows and it will be quiet, but not so. I guess they are used to it. I slept with earplugs all four nights, but my husband did not and he managed to sleep alright. We skipped the breakfast as there are many great little cafes/patissieries just steps away. The metro is close. Most staff were very helpful. I attempted to speak in my dismal French, but they were happy to communicate in their excellent English. Next time we go to Paris, I'll do much more research and will book further ahead of time to find a place on a quieter street.

<Content>Good value The rooms are small and simply furnished but the bathrooms are contemporary and efficient. Breakfast is typically modern European with a reasonable variety. The friendly reception staff are English-speaking and helpful and the hotel is convenient to the Metro (two nearby stations) and bus routes.

<Content>a great value I go to Paris 2-3 times/ year and stayed at many different places over the years. Recently moved from the Left Bank to staying in either the 3rd or 11th Arr. I was in Paris by myself for a few days so I decided to try this hotel. it was pretty much as expected. Great location, small rooms (I upgraded to the deluxe double for an extra 15Euros and was glad that I did). Biggest complaint was that my room which was on rue Turbigo was quite noisy (I slept with ear plugs so it was fine). Big surprise: the front desk. They couldn't be nicer and there was always someone there to let me in (I have stayed in many 3 and 4 star hotels where if i came in very late -and paris is a late nite city- I have had to bang on the door and wake someone up to be let in. Not here even when I came back one morning at 3:30AM there was someone at the front desk.). Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for someone where price is a primary consideration.

<Content>18th Birthday in Paris After the hectic CDG airport it was nice to get to the hotel!The Relais du Marais is a very pretty hotel in the centre of Paris, just down from the Place de la Republique.My friends and stayed there for two nights for my 18th birthday and really liked the atmosphere of the hotel.The hotel itself was lovely, the old spiral stairs were beautiful, despite us being on the 4th floor!The staff were very helpful with every request we had - especially the convienence of a luggage room. The rooms were very well presented, if a little small and the bathrooms were extremely clean with new fixtures and fittings. All this with a bonus of an atmospheric view of some of older Paris. The breakfast rooms were very modern which suited our younger tastes and the selection of food was good.

<Content>great location, friendly staff We stayed at this hotel for two nights. The hotel is in a great location, less than 5min to Temple metro stop or less than 10min to Republique metro stop. We used the metro quite abit mostly in the evening and walked alot during the day. From the hotel, its a nice 20min walk to the Louvre. The rooms are clean but quite small, however am told that this is the standard in Paris. Front desk staff was friendly and very helpful. I would stay here again if I return to Paris.

<Content>great staff Loved our stay in Paris and at this hotel. Great location, close to the metro and supermarket etc. After reading other reviews of this hotel it seemed the best rooms were at the front so that is what we asked for and that is what we got. The guys on the front desk could not have been more helpful or friendly. Every day the staff took an interest in us which made our stay fun as we could practice our limited french. English was spoken as well. I was travelling with my daughter who loved the modern glass breakfast room as well as the breakfast. She rated our european hotel stays by the breakfast and this hotel rated highly.We would recommend this hotel as well as stay there again if we were lucky enough to be able to return to Paris. I booked our room through a pre paid internet option so the rate was very reasonable.

<Content>Grand little hotel My girlfriend invited me for a citytrip to Paris in February 2007. She picked out this little hotel next to Place de la Republique in the Marais. Although I'm not that often in Paris, I've been in a few 2 and 3 star hotels there. And let me tell you: Le Relais du Marais will exceed your expectations. As long as you keep in mind that you're in the city centre, meaning you won't expect an ocean of room, that is.The hotel staff is very friendly. My speaking French was appreciated and made them treat us in a familiar way. They are young, and know what young couples want. The staff has been very helpful in providing nice dinner addresses and offers. Be amused by their little stories on how they go through a world of trouble to reserve a table in a fine restaurant around the corner (very cute and delicious food, with the chef taking care of his customers personally). Obviously they have some common understanding.Breakfast was served in a modern style kitchen-dining room with fresh, simple furniture. Take a moment to savor one of their croissants, or munch on a 'petit pain au chocolat'.The rooms are definitely ok for a 2*+ hotel, though the one negative point I could make is the door separating bedroom and bathroom could have been repainted/replaced.Conclusion: Excellent quality/price, young, fresh and simple. Enjoy while it's there!

<Content>Friendly and clean We're just back from a 3 night stay, Thursday- Sunday having stayed in Paris 3 times before but at different hotels.The best thing about the Relais is the friendliness and enthusiasm of the staff- they appear genuinely nice and helpful. Our room was also spotlessly clean throughout our stay.Our en suite room on the 2nd floor (25) was freshly decorated and although small had everything we needed for a short stay. The only downside for us was that were very aware of the traffic noise even with the window closed and if we'd been staying longer would have asked for a quieter room.Breakfast served in the dining room was a good start to the day- our kids would love the bright/funky decor.The hotel is centrally located and also handy for the metro.

<Content>Fantastic price, location, and great room! My girlfriend and I stayed here for two nights and absolutely loved it. This was the second hotel of our 4-night stay in Paris ... we decided to try one Left-bank and one Right-bank hotel, but now I wish we spent the whole time at Relais du Marias.We spent quite a bit of time reading reviews on TripAdvisor, and all of the good things said about this hotel we found to be true.Checking in, the man at the front desk was extremely friendly. I do speak a little bit of french (it has been 5 or 6 years though) and when in Paris, I always make an attempt to converse in French, but most parisians will immediately respond in English as soon as they hear my terrible accent. This guy was very nice, and spoke in slow clear french that I could understand (he did speak English, too).The room was small, as has been noted in other reviews, but it's Paris and that is to be expected. It was plenty big enough for us and our stuff. Our room had a lot of light from a large window that opens, and a little desk and decent sized closet. The bathroom was also very bright and clean, it had a good bathtub/shower and was appointed with clean towels and little soaps.Possibly the best feature ... free high-speed WiFi internet on every floor. Worked great. Bring a european power adapter for your laptop or you can buy one at a place like FNAC.Our rate included breakfast, and I would definitely recommend it. The breakfast room was decorated very modern, with tables and chairs from IKEA. Breakfast was typical french and buffet style ... coffee, croissants, cereal, hard-boiled eggs, yougurt, and orange juice.Location is absolutely perfect for walking or taking the Velib bikes around. The Marais is a beautiful neighborhood with lots of cute stores, restaurants, and cafes.For the price, this place was fantastic. I'll definitely come back on my next Paris trip.

<Content>Delightful Parisien Hotel Delightful small hotel in a traditionally Parisien block. Room and bathroom very compact, but freshly decorated and very clean. I'm not too sure about the opaque glass bathroom door, though - some guests might prefer more privacy!Continental buffet breakfast served in modern and stylish breakfast room (terrace outside if the weather is suitable).Hotel is in a good central location close to Metro stations, shops, and a wide variety of restaurants and bars.Highly recommended!

<Content>Walker's paradise We booked this hotel because it was an Air Miles recommended hotel and a few minute's walk from the Gare du Nord where the Eurostar arrives. It is pretty central for the price and we walked all the tourist trail from here with ease. Handy for the subway and the river it was ideal for us.The staff, reception and breakfast room are all fantastic. The en-suite room we had was OK but could have been so much better with one day's decorating. Aircon was good and the road traffic acceptable when the double glazing was closed for the night.Would definitely recommmend to a friend and go again.

<Content>Great Hotel, shame we didn't stay there We booked this because it was in the heart of the marais district, when we arrived we were told that are booking has been changed and we were staying in the Le Molay around the corner, we also had a friend that booked the same hotel and his booking also got changed. I think that if you want a good hotel book Le Molay rue de achieves, just minutes from the Gay District. Wonderful.

<Content>Excellent hotel The best feature here are the friendly and helpful staff. We found Room 51 to be too dark - even though recently refurbished like the rest of the hotel, it was very claustrophobic with only a small window looking nowhere, but the staff did their very best to move us to a front room which they managed for our final night. The front rooms (we had 55) are terrific and the double-glazing means the street noise is not a problem. Breakfast was very good and the cleaning staff also great. With a room fronting the street, we would stay here every time in Paris.

<Author>RichNY62
<Content>Friendly Paris Hotel I just returned from a week in Paris and my choice of this hotel was a good one. The are several key elements behind this comment, the first being the friendliness of the staff. Comments about the staff in other reviews here helped me make my hotel decision, and they were all right on point. All of the staff was very positive and helpful, especially front deskpersons Hakim and Lena. Also, everyone speaks fluent English, making requests and questions very easy. All rooms have nice AC (controlled in-room), which is not a given in Paris. Another good reason to choose this hotel. I was worried, however, that the smoking in Paris hotels would find the rooms to be musty and smelling of stale smoke. Not so at Relais du Marais. I'm allergic to tobacco and didn't notice a hint of prior smoke as the room was always fresh and clean. For American travelers: a warning on the size of the rooms. Having been to London twice and reading and prepping for a first trip to Paris, I knew that, generally, hotel rooms in Europe are small by American standards, so be forewarned. I suppose you could find large rooms in Paris, but you will pay. Keep in mind that this is a two star-plus hotel. It is very clean, however, and all of the hallways and rooms are freshly painted and decorated, with new, good-sized bathrooms. (For reference, a call to a Paris Marriott found the rooms there to be only a few square feet larger). On arrival at Relais du Marais, the room given to me and my partner and was nice, but having booked a full week in Paris with two large suitcases, we needed a little more room. A problem when requesting a change with the front desk? Not here. They could not have been nicer to look up something more accommodating, which turned out to be a very nice room with sufficent space for the week. A great and positive way to start our stay to say the least.Try to book your stay with daily breakfast included. The hotel has a newly-renovated breakfast room that is a pleasure to start the day in with a bright, hip decor and a small tasteful covered patio area. Breakfast items are continental, so don't expect pancakes and bacon, but there are ample offerings with croissant, crusty French bread, yogurt, cheeses, cereals, juices, hard boiled eggs, coffee, etc. Certainly enough to satisfy before embarking on a long day of sightseeing in beautiful Paris.Finally, the location is a good one for tourists making daily treks to the sights of the city. The Temple metro (subway) is literally 1/2 minute walk down the street. You will be using the Republique station, a 3 minute walk, most of the time however, as it is a main station with 4 lines (note: take the 8 line to Ecole Militaire for the Eiffel Tower). Believe me, close proximity to a main line metro is very important if you are planning on doing a lot of sight seeing on foot. The last thing you want to do after a long day of walking is to walk even more to get home. The metro in Paris is a breeze to navigate. I'm from New York City and commute via subway daily and must say that the Paris Metro is a very tourist friendly mode of transportation. In addition, there is a Taxi stand in Republique circle should you wish to take a cab somwhere. The area where the hotel is located, north Marais bordering on Republique is fine. While the Latin Quarter or St. Germain may seem more stylish, you'll pay for it in the hotel bill. The Relais du Maris is in a safe area, two blocks off Republique, which is a fun, bustling traffic circle (with a huge monument in the center). There are plenty of restaurants and brasseries at Republique to satisfy, yet the hotel is far enough away to separate you from the traffic of that zone. The hotel is on a mildly busy street, but at night, traffic volume slows down to virtually nothing. This, combined with new, double-glazed windows, allows for a good night's sleep. You'll need it after a day of sightseeing. There is certainly plenty to see.This is a nice little hotel with, again, very friendly staff which I definitely recommend. Enjoy Paris!

<Content>A great little hotel We booked this hotel after reading some trip advisor reviews.The room we had was agood size in comparison to other Paris hotels we have stayed in and though it needs redecorating ,it was clean and comfortable with a modern bathroom.Areas of the hotel were being painted and rooms that have not been upgraded will be in the future.The one next to us had been completed and looked lovely.The staff are marvellous-friendly,funny and extremely helpful.The location is good with lots ofattractions nearby and 2 metro stations to choose from.Overall a very pleasant experience.

<Content>You will not be disappointed! I will not bore you with all the details since several others have already covered the important stuff. I will say that we had the best room in the place which is #64. There are three rooms like this that have been renovated and there are plans to continue with the other rooms. If you look at their website you will see the room that we had. I stayed at this hotel for 8 nights with my 16 year old daughter. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

<Content>Little gem of a hotel! This hotel is a real gem! I stayed there in April with a group of best mates to celebrate my hen weekend. We wanted to be close to all the action, especially the bars in the Marais and the main tourist sights in Paris, and this hotel was spot on for location. The staff were also great, really helpful and friendly. Our rooms all had balconies so we could look out over the street and soak up the atmosphere whilst still getting a quiet night's sleep because there was good double glazing and air con (a real bonus!). At the end of our stay, we all said we'd recommend this hotel to our other friends and family. All in all, superb value and customer service!

<Content>Central, friendly, happening We stayed here for three days. Like most buildings in the older neighborhoods, it had 5 stories. It has an elevator (small by US standards but large by Parisian standards--easily fits two adults and baggage) which is really important if you end up on the 5th floor as we did.Like all Paris hotel rooms, it was much smaller than a US standard, but ours was quite charming--nicely decorated bathroom, a small writing table, a closet wardrobe and french-door windows with a low wrought iron fence around a small ledge.Our reservations included the price of breakfast (not always so, you may want to check the price first otherwise), and the breakfast had a very nice variety of items--croissants, pain au chocolat, mini-baguettes, butter, soft cheese, yogurt, cereal, milk, coffee, hot water for tea, hot milk for hot chocolate, and various confits (jellies and jams) and the omnipresent but must-have nutella (try it on the croissants). I actually found their breakfast better than the breakfast menu--which means a set breakfast usually of coffee, juice, croissant or pain au chocolat and/or buttered baguettes offered at a set price--found at the nearby cafes.The entire staff was friendly and polite--from the front desk managers to the cleaning crews--it gave the hotel a very nice relaxed atmosphere. The managers spoke English fairly well and they were very helpful with directions and questions.The hotel itself if a half-block (if that) from the Temple Metro station and a mini half-block further to the Republique Metro station (a larger station which services more than one line). The hotel is on a side street (quieter) but very close to the Place de la Republique, around which there are cafes, boulangeries (bakeries) a bank (for those ATM withdrawals), bistros, a Monoprix (like a small upscale Target which came in very handy), and boutiques of the expensive and dirt-cheap varieties. There is even a MacDonald's (if you really must) further along the Republique circle.The nearby metro stations were great for getting to places like Notre Dame, Il de la Cite, Eiffel Tower, etc.Marais itself is often hopping, but we ended up spending a Saturday and a Sunday there, so most of the shops on the streets radiating off of the circle were closed then--but nearly all of the shops, cafes, restaurants, bistros, etc. on the circle itself was open. We've heard of accounts of people having much worse accommodations for about the same price we did. If you've done research, you'll know that Paris hotels (particularly ones located in this kind of neighborhood) are pricey. But I think we got a great deal for our (ever-deflating) dollar.

<Content>Excellent service, great location and close to bars My name is kevin, My partner and I stayed at the hotel relais du marais from May 26, 27 and 28, 2007. We had a great time. What we liked about the hotel was that it was central in the marais area. The hotel was close to the rue du temple metro and the R茅publique metro, which connected us all of paris. I really enjoyed the breakfast and the hotel and rooms where clean. Most inportantly We found the staff to be very helpful. One male staff member who worked over night took the time to go over and mark site seeing locations and direction on both metro and street maps. We would recommend this hotel if you would like to have a comfort and enjoyable stay in Paris.Kevin

<Content>kind helpfull people The people are very kind and helpful.We were not satisfied with the room we got, but then they offered us an other room that was just renewed. This was a most wonderful room, very nicely and careful decorated, with bath and view on the street. Balcony with flowers. Because we are a couple, they asked the cleaning lady to make our bed into a double bed. The hotel is near the metro 'Le Temple', near supermarket and near a very nice park. Close to the beautiful sights of Marais.

<Content>Never got to stay there..... I attempted to stay at Le Marais last weekend. A few days before travel I emailed the hotel to make sure everything was ok with the reservation and they replied quite promptly saying that everything was fine. Our flight was delayed on the way out so after landing we phoned the hotel to let them know we were going to be arriving late. Upon arriving, we were told that the hotel was fully booked and that they had made a reservation at another hotel for us around the corner. This has never happened to me before, so needless to say I wasn't very happy.I would NOT reccomend this hotel to anybody!!!The hotel we were transferred to was Hotel Mesley R茅publique, which turned out to be quite nice - stay there instead!!

<Content>Parisiens rude??-mais Non!! The Relais du Marais is a little treasure of a hotel. I cannot fault it one iota. The staff fall over themselves to help you. The manager is half english/french and was so friendly that it felt that you were a personal friend and not a guest. My room (no 64) was the best in the hotel. Very comfy beds and a bathroom to die for. I was told that all the rooms would be refurbished to the same standard and all the hotel would be very ultra modern. The Manager told me they were aiming for this to be finished in 3 months. Cons: Yes, the lift is small, but so what? It's a lift not a room and it serves it's purpose! The corridors are quite narrow too but it certainly didn't bother me. After all, you need to remember that we are talking about a 2* hotel and it's plus points far outweigh it's minuses. The hotel is in a brilliant location, 2 metro stations nearby and the bus stop is over the road. Takes you to all the sights. Loads of bars/restaurants to choose from. Massive Monoprix over the road that has the biggest bakery I have ever seen and I sure enjoyed trying out their bread and cakes!I went to Paris with my 11 yr old son and I can certainly say we both had a ball, even when we were encore une fois perdu dans le metro! In a nutshell, lovely hotel, beautiful city and friendly people.As Arnie once said - I'll be back.

<Content>Hotel With Personality My wife and I stayed at this hotel for a week while we were on our honeymoon in Paris. This little hotel was wonderful, great service, very friendly staff and would ask any questions that they could, good buffet breakfast, and the staff spoke very good English. The rooms were pretty small but what european hotels arn't. This hotel is pretty far from the Eiffel Tower and other attractions so I would suggest getting a subway pass to see everything this wonderful city has to offer. This hotel could very easily be a 4* and I would stay here again the next time we go to Paris

<Content>Ideal location I stayed in Le Relais du Marais in Feb of this year. The hotel is in a great location, directly beside Place de la Republique. The decor and furnishings are a bit dated and the rooms are a bit small (this seems to be the norm in Paris from my experience) but then again I didn't travel to Paris to stay inside a hotel room and look at furniture.One negative aspect was that I had specifically requested when booking a room that was not facing onto the main road as I didn't want to be subjected to traffic noise. However, on arrival, I was given a room at the front of the hotel.The staff in general were friendly, particularly one guy who worked there who had impeccable English. I tried speaking French to him but in the end gave up because his English was so much better than my French!!

<Content>Good Little Hotel We booked Le relais du Marias through Airmiles and stayed there for 3 nights last week (March 2007).The hotel is classed as 2 star so we were not expecting too much but were pleasantly surprised.All the reception staff were polite and helpful and many spoke english but were also happy to listen to our stuttering attempts at french!The room was average size, clean and the bathroom was also fine.Breakfasts were good in the very modern breakfast room.Excellent location. Close to the Metro but also walking distance to the Seine. Monoprix supermarket close by to purchase those delicious french goodies to take home!We would stay again.

<Content>happy stay I must thank you for the Tripadvisor  everybody who had voiced their remarks here before helped me to make the choice of 5 nights stay in Le Relais Du Marais. ALL staff are exceptionally friendly  helpful, special thanks to funny charming Anyl  Khslen. My room kept very clean/tidy everyday (I appreciated a lot) location easy access to everything. The lock did really got big noise so I made it carefully every night I returned my room so my neighbor should not hear that like alarm. : ) I traveled long way Paris from Hong Kong and I could sleep like pig everynight. Please keep up the good work and I will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Exceptional Have stayed in this hotel twice and would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. The level of customer service and friendliness is exceptional. It has a great location - just off Republique with 2 Metro stations to choose from. Very well managed and spotlessly clean. The newly refurbished breakfast room is the best I have ever seen in this type of property. The choice and freshness of the food/drink is equally as good.

<Content>Good location and economical This hotel room needed a paint job , but it had a good bed and bathroom. Great location near the Marais with a Metro station just up the street . We made sure we got a room on the quiet side of the hotel or I'll be it would have been noisy on the street side. They provided a wonderful complete breakfast included in the price of the room. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would say it was a good choice for the price. I would stay there again.

<Content>The Best of Three Within 14 Months I have stayed in three hotels in Paris within the last 14 months and this one was my favorite. The other two were three star hotels (Hotel Beaubourg, Hotel Delavigne) while this one is a two star hotel and priced accordingly. I wouldn't turn anyone away from the other two, however I preferred this hotel because the rooms, and the bathrooms, are newly renovated, bright, clean and handsome, because the housekeeping was impeccable, and especially because everyone who worked there was VERY kind and VERY helpful--most notably, Anyl, Hakim and Gloria. Some of the staff at the other two hotels were disagreeable. You can believe the advertising when they write free WIFI. I was able to use it 80% of the time in my room and when the reception was too weak, it was simple and comfortable to use it in the lobby (good reception 100% of the time). Some rooms are smaller than others, but totally in line with the rest of Parisian hotels. The location is superb, a skip and a jump from La Republique, and if your being economical, there is a Monoprix next door. There were no problems with the invoice, I paid exactly the rate that I booked on the internet. If this is your price range and the right location for you, stay here!

<Content>Good Hotel in Good Area I have just returned from a 3 night trip at Le Relais du Marais and can honestly say i was not disappointed. As with many other travellers, i was somewhat apprehensive in choosing a hotel from so many but the hotel was ideal for our price range and length of stay, thanks to the help of Trip Advisor. Having visited Paris several times previously, staying either within the Montparnasse or St Germain districts, i thought a change would be best. The hotel was easy to find, the metro stations of Republique and Temple very close by, and the room was adequate, not big by any means but clean, tidy with an ensuite that included a bath. Breakfast was typically French with cereal, croissants, coffee, tea etc and was ideal. The hotel staff were great, their English very good and more than helpful.As for the area itself, there are plenty of cafes, bars and shops at the main Repubique Square as well as along the rue du Turbigot. Easy to find and suit all tastes but would recommend the Temple cafe opposite the hotel as well as a small and typically French restaurant one block away whose name escapes me, think it was Le Sommeilles, but was recommended to me by the hotel staff. Absolutely great food and not too bad price wise (90 euros for 3 courses + wine).As for getting around the city, we jumped on the metro (best to ask for a 'carnet' - 10 metro tickets - cost 10 euros) and bought ticket for open top bus. This allows you to get around the city stopping off at most of the main attractions. You can get the red bus at Musee D'Orsay, Notre Dame, Opera and Eiffel Tower to name some of the stops. It cost 22 euros and you get the use of the bus for 2 days.In summary, a good hotel to use as a base, in a good area and would recommend. That said, still prefer St Germain area for its close knit atmosphere but that's a personal choice. PS booked through Air miles and got a great cash price

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Highly recommended Our 3 night stay here was a real pleasure. Our first impression was of ultra friendly, extremely helpful staff, who don't mind catering to non-French speaking tourists. Having stayed in Paris before we've been used to tiny rooms. This, however, was a good size and included a bath! Windows are double-glazed, so although the hotel is central and on a main road you can get a good night's sleep. One of the highlights is the breakfast room (see for yourself!).One downside was the booking agent took 100% of the fee upon booking the hotel, dunno if that has anything to do with hotel policy or not but we'd HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>We really wanted to like it..........! You need to know about the noise! The electronic door locks are like an alarm bell. You can hear every door open and every step in the corridor as if it is inside your room. The shower sprays the whole bathroom. This is the most basic of hotels, no style no luxury but it is very clean. The staff are very helpful and pleasant. I would like to say good things about it because of the location on the metro and because of the friendly staff but I would not return.Only in France could you be inhaling cigarette smoke at 6am from the room next door.

<Content>Great Location, Friendly Staff With a great location just off the lovely Place de Republique, this friendly hotel was a great base for our 3-day holiday in Paris.The hotel is situated on Rue de Tubrigo(an off-shot of Rue de Temple) approx 300m from Place de Republique. There are two Metro stations located at either end of the street(Temple and Arts et Metiers) and the larger station at Republique is within easy walking distance.The en-suite room was small enough but was well-maintained and comfortably warm. The room faced out onto the street with a view of the Place at the end of the street. Traffic can be heard at peak times(scooters in particular) but Rue de Tubrigo is generally not that busy.The hotel staff are friendly and speak good english. Breakfast is served in the mornings until 10am and is included in the price.Some advice: A good idea is to purchase the Paris Visite travel cards for the Metro and Bus services. This allows you to use the (very handy) Metro at anytime without having to worry about buying a ticket and looking for change for the ticket machine etc. We got the 3-day for 3-zones ticket. This costs about 鈧?8 and works for all the central metro lines.The open top (I think they are called L'open top) bus tours are also a good way to see a lot of the city if you only are staying for a limited time. A one day ticket costs 鈧?5 and is valid for all of the lines, the best of which is the green line which takes you to all the major attractions (L'Arc de Triomphe, Louvre, Notre Dame etc.)All in all, an enjoyable city break, greatly helped by our stay at the Relais du Marais.

<Content>Great Hotel We just got home after a five night stay at the Le Relais du Marais Hotel in Paris, first of all the location could not have been better just 100 meters from Republique place and 30 meters from the Temple metro station. The room we had was on the 6th floor and had not long been refurbished so it was very clean and was a joy to be in, the breakfast could not have been better there was a lot to choose from which gave us a good start to the day.The staff were all very nice and helpfull at all times so it made our stay one of the best ever, we look forward to our next stay in Paris and the Le Relais du Marais. Best regards Geoff  Sandra  Green

<Content>Great Location Just stayed Mon13th Nov to Thurs Nov16th 2006Have stayed at this Hotel 3 times over the last two year and love it more and more each time. Arriving by EuroStar from London getting off the the train till arriving at the hotel can be done in 15mins. The hotel is 90 seconds walk from Place du Republic Metro and its many metro lines and 10 seconds from Temple Metro which is good for many tourist attractions.The staff all speak English and are the friendliest staff at any hotel I have stayed. The rooms are clean and good sized for Paris with very good size bathrooms. I cannot fault it.Its just on the north/west part of the Marais the street is busy during the day but at night time is very quiet for Marais/Central Paris and I have only stayed in the front rooms.Lots of tourist info maps/ places to visit in reception. You can walk to the Picasso museum and Carnavelet Museum in 10 mins and all the other Marais attractionsI am looking forward to my next visit early next yearstevefullerton@aol.com London

<Content>Very Enjoyable After reading the reviews on this website regarding the Relais du Marais, my partner and I decided to book for his 40th birthday. Although the rooms are quite small, they are very clean and presentable (would have loved tea/coffee making facilities in the room but hey it wasn't a major problem as they had a coffee machine in the Reception area but being typically English, after walking for miles around the attractions, to come back to the room and have a nice cup of tea would have made the trip to Paris perfect!)The staff were not only very pleasant but also very helpful. Would recommend this hotel. I am also glad that I booked the Relais du Marais, after reading this website, as I knew exactly what to expect when I arrived.

<Content>Very accomodating My partner and I stayed at Hotel le Relais du Marais for 3 days near the end of October. The greeting when we arrived was outstanding, making us feel right at home right from the very beginning. The staff was tremendously accomodating at all times and did whatever it took to meet our needs. The location of the hotel is also great, situated a few minutes walk from some of the best shopping, restaurants, cafes and bars in the city.We were very comfortable throughout our entire stay and are happy that we chose to stay at le Relais du Marais.

<Content>Very happy with our stay I booked this hotel after reading the TripAdvisor reviews.We stayed 4 nights at the Le Relais du Marais in mid September 2006.Our double room was small (but not tiny) but that's what we expected in cities such as Paris and London. The double glazing on the windows kept the noise of the city traffic out which was a blessing and so we slept very well.Friendly and helpful staff, quiet airconditioning, larger than expected modern bathroom with bath and shower and small balcony off the bathroom where we could open the french doors. Breakfast was included in our rate and this too was good. Very happy with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel. Paris is all about walking and with a fantastic metro system, this is a good location.

<Content>Friendly Staff but very Noisy The hotel is nice but not really in the center of the Marais, it is closer to La Republique. The rooms are very noisy due to door slamming. The rooms are close to one another and the doors when closing slam very strongly. So do not plan on sleeping after 7 am when guests start waking up or maids start cleaning the rooms.

<Content>Fantastic Location and Service We stayed recently (25-31 - July 2006) at this hotel and had an absolutely wonderful time. The hotel is centrally located, right down the block from a large metro station, with so many different platforms you hardly ever have to transfer. The hotel itself was very cute, and the desk staff were EXTREMELY accommodating. We took an early train in from Germany and were able to store our luggage at the hotel until our room was ready. The staff were also very helpful with directions and metro station transfers. We booked a three-person room, and it actually came with an extra bed for my daughter to sleep on, unlike many other hotels where extra bed is code for couch. Our room wasn't that big (are any in Paris?), although it still had enough room for all of us to walk around comfortably. One of the greatest things about our room was that it was facing a private courtyard-like space, off the main road, so it was dead quiet 24 hours a day! All in all, this charming hotel is sure to make your Parisian vacation a pleasant one, and won't break your budget either.

<Content>Great choice This is a superb choice for the price. The location is excellent -- about a block from the Metro and close enough to major attractions for those who like to walk. The staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Room was small but very well kept and the bathroom was spotless. Air conditioning worked great. We were there for 8 days in July and the weather was very warm. Ask for a room facing the front on the 5th floor and you'll get a nice balcony. Highly recommended and would stay there again without question.

<Content>Wish I was back there now The reviews on this site are a very accurate summary of my expereince here. A special mention to the charming staff (yes that's right - charming staff in Paris!), especially Khaled. The 6th floor facing out was great - quiet, beautiful. We had a twin and had plenty of room for a hotel of this rating. The bathroom was clean, bright, modern. The daily servicing was excellent and adjusted to our needs. The lift limit is 225kg which indicates a small size, but is ok for 2 people or one with luggage. Despite not intending to have the breakfast, we had it almost everyday and the staff responded well to moderately demanding guests. The breakfast room is small, and with steep stair access, but the food was fine, plentiful and buffet. One of Paris's most intriguingly idiosyncratic cafes is just across the road Cafe Le Temple. If you are looking in this price range look no further, just ask for room near the top, facing the street.

<Content>Excellent value for money I mainly chose this hotel for the room price and the location (very easy to get to from the airports, very close to the Republique and Temple metro stations, safe at night). When I arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the very friendly and helpful staff! My single room was quite small - just enough space for a large bed and a little desk - but after all I wasn't going to stay in the room all the time. Room and bathroom were both impeccably clean. The bath room was almost as big as the room by the way. Free wireless internet access in the room was definitely a plus. The only downside was the price of breakfast (8,50 for a choice of patisseries, bread rolls, coffee etc.) but it looks like all European hotels in bigger cities are going that way. Next time in Paris I'd like to stay in the Saint Germain des pr茅s area. But otherwise I'd definitely go back to this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel, great location, great service The hotel is a in a very convenient neighborhood, away from the crowds but still close to everything via the metro. It is located within a minute walking of a metro station to get you anywhere you need to go in the city, cafes, and good grocery store around the corner where you can buy fresh sandwiches and pastries for your day's travels. There is also an internet cafe and laundry close by. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. The room had a new bathroom with good shower, and the room was clean, neat, and a decent size for European hotel standards. The breakfast food was ample and tasty.We would stay here again for sure.

<Content>Very friendly, great value for money no-frills hotel. This hotel is not in the buzziest part of the Marais - but there is plenty of social activity in nearby streets during the day, although less at night. A 5-7 minute walk however and things liven up immensely.Apart from a little mishap with being given an uncleaned room on arrival (they gave me another room straight away and apologised profusely), the rest of my stay was very smooth. Room was clean, great bed and fresh sheets, extra pillows, and a fantastic renovated bathroom (although hot water was a little stretched in the morning peak hour). Decor was average but heating was more than adequate. And as I had a (double) corner room on the south side of the building, i did not have any common walls with neighbours and did not have a noise problem. The only noise i heard was from the lift and doors across the hall - and that was not a problem. But what really made this place memorable was the EXTREMELY friendly staff. Everyone including the night watchman went out of their way to be friendly and did not have a problem with my truly ghastly french. Staying on my own, i really appreciated this.Even the included breakfast (cereal, orange juice, yoghurt, fresh pastries, chees, coffee, tea) which i did not intend to take, was so good I couldn't pass it up each morning while i planned my day. If you have a limited budget and want to experience Paris rather than spend your time in a Parisian hotel - I would certainly recommend Relais du Marais.

<Content>Excellent Value Hotel - Excellent Location I agree with a little from every review that I have read. Unfortunately, we didn't realise how thin the walls were until being shouted at by next door on our first night! Apologies and red faces were in order the next day!Other than that, I couldn't really fault the hotel too much. We had breakfast in bed on 2 occasions, which was more than sufficient and set us on our way for our travels of the day.We were also up on the 6th floor, which was fantastic for the view as we could see the eiffel tower and the rebuplique. Unfortunately, during our stay of 3 nights the lift was broken most of the time. This also caused problems in the morning as although the hotel website says it has a mini bar, it does not say that the mini bar is on the ground floor!! This combined with a hangover, and having to walk 6 flights downstairs and then upstairs again is not good fun!Anyway, this was our first time staying in the 'gay' marais (although we are a straight couple) and I have to say that it was probably the finest of our 3 stays in Paris, having stayed in Montparnasse and the Latin Quarter previously. The people we met must have been the friendliest ever in paris from the staff in our hotel to the people on the street and everyone we met in the bars.We specifically came this time to enjoy ourselves and not to sight see as we have previously done. A stay in the marais and in this hotel are both highly recommened and we will definitely come back here to stay. We found an internet deal that cost only 拢120 for the 3 nights (3 nights for the price of 2) and I cannot envisage beating that price in such a good location again.So thank you to the relais marais and everyone else who made our stay so welcoming.

<Content>Great modest hotel for exploring the Marais I am actually writing this review from the hotel; so for those seeking internet access in their room and who have a wifi device (laptop or pda) the connection is free and excellent.This is a modest hotel which does what it does, very well. Small (to tiny) rooms which are clean and inexpensive (for Paris). No view, at least from my room - the airshaft, and not what you would call ambience. But it gives 80% of what you need in a hotel - comfortable bed and clean room with no hassle. The location, on the edge of the Marais, is very good if you like the Marais and convenient to the Republique and Temple Metro stations for further afield. Don't bother with breakfast in the hotel - there are many better and cooler places in a few minutes nice walk.The only real downside I would mention is that the walls are paper thin but it wasn't a problem during my stay, though it could be for others.I will be back again because it is the best value I have found for exploring the Marais. Try it unless very small rooms or thin walls (and small lifts) are your pet hates. Excellent price\quality ratio (for Paris) 鈧?9/night.p.s. I'll update this tomorrow if I get any hassle when I check out.

<Content>simple Now there is very little one can expect from a hotel room at 鈧?0 a night in any European Capital city but the Relais du Marais was a fairly good deal as it included breakfast. The rooms are small and could do with some freshening up but the bathroom was clean and new. The staff were very friendly (quite unusual in Paris) and the hotel is well located in the vibrant Marais district (which contrary to earlier posts is not the slightest bit dodgy).
