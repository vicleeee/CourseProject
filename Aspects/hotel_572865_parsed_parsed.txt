<Content>5 stars without the fussing The apartment was as nice as a five star hotel, but with a fully equiped kitchen and at a tenth of the price. We paid 拢40 a night for 4 nights and basicly we couldn't believe our luck. Nice lounge, comfy bed, big bathroom. Balcony. It is about a 15 minute bus ride away from the CBD, but the value for money makes up for it.

<Content>Geared towards extended stays, not tourists looking for charm The Meriton Cameo Apartments are located in a part of town that is really rather nondescript. You don鈥檛 feel at all like you鈥檙e in Sydney. The apartments are clean, light, and spacious with out door balconies. They have kitchens and washer/dryer units. During my stays, there was never a maid service. And check in both times was slow. The gym was adequate but the pool facility was OUTSTANDING! One of the most beautiful lap pools I鈥檝e ever worked out in.My only dislike was really the location. If this is not an issue you should be fine. To get to Sydney Harbor you have to call a cab, which sometimes takes 15-20 minutes to arrive. The cost will range from $15 (to the harbor) or $25 (to the Sydney Opera House at curtain time.) Getting a cab after the performance took a little while. Additionally, there is no WiFi connection and Internet (Broadband) is not cheap. Food is also expensive. The Cr猫me Caf茅 served excellent omelets and the proprietor is just lovely. I also found some lovely cafes after a walk down Burke Street along with an organic grocer and a nice produce market.Although as a single traveler I felt safe, one of my cab drivers mentioned that Waterloo was not one of the safest neighborhoods in Sydney. If I return, I would definitely try to book a hotel closer to downtown but if that is not an issue for you, the Meriton is a solid hotel, just not a charming one.

<Content>"Cheap" Firstly let me say - for the price, it is OK.Secondly, for a weekend or night away when youa re nto going anywhere, it is OK.I live nearby so knew what I was in for as far s location, the acres of besa brick apartments ... I walked across around lunch time to book a room for a friend to stay in after dinner. I saw online there were rooms and thought I would go and look and book.The staff (appeared too many) were unusual to say the least, one extremely well groomed, one not so and the thirs was well very scruffy.I was shown a lovely high floor 2 bedroom apartment - wow - nicely appointed if a little cheaply made. I presume this was the show suite and it is rarely used...We went back down to reception - we cannot take a reservation here you need to go: home/internet cafe to book on wotif (!!!)We don't have any one bedroom apartments, only two. BUT, 10 minutes earlier there were one bedroom apartments being sold online.WHAT ???If I had an alternative or had needed a room on a different night I would NOT have booked at this stage!I then went to do some grocery shopping and returned home an hour later to find, yes, still two one bedroom apartments online to sell.I reserved and paid online for a one bedroom apartment.Walked back to the property.Checked in - oh its a handicap room - no, i want a bath and online it didnt say anything about being the last (worst) apartment ... So I paid an additional $20 and was upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment ...The first one, the door lock wouldn't work ...back down to reception - the three musketeers had NO idea why it wouldnt work so after much testing with keys I was put in a lower floor 2 bedroom apartment.***Now, again, for the price ($159 for a 2bedroom apartment)it is not a bad place to stay.Quite well appointed suite with balcony and spacious. However, be warned, the internal apartments overlook a central courtyard = NO privacy unless the curtains are closed and they overlook a creche. Between 2-5pm it was bedlam, so if you do not like screaming children ... The other noise I encountered was from the sport team (?) staying on the same floor, in and out between midnight and 4AM .........................slamming doors, talking loudly ...

<Content>Great Place for the Price Great Place for the Price!! The apartments our brand new and have everything you could possibly need. It is about a 8 min drive to the city center, but a taxi was always near by. Reception was great and helpful. If you are looking for an affordable place without missing out on amenities, this place is for you. Very spacious and clean. Cheap parking compared to other locations as well, $15. The room had it all good size TV, DVD, couch, nice bed, washer/dryer, full kithen, stero system, etc. Again, it is a few minutes from the city, but what you get for the price makes it all worth it.

<Content>Terrible Service.....never again Well were do i start. Firstly we arrived around 1pm to check in and reception would not check us in until 2pm on the dot! when we checked in the room was not cleaned properly with food on the kitchen bench! When i initally checked i asked for 2 rooms one with a double and one with 2 singles. We did not get the 2 singles but instead got a double. They were not helpful at all.The staff at this hotel are very rude and even sending a complaint email to the General Manager i did not recieve any follow up! Coming from the hospitality industry myself i was appalled by the unprofessionalism by this hotel.I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Boring High Rise If you like staying in among a collection of high rise apartments with absolutely no character in the middle of an industrial zone which could be in any city in the world, this is for you.   I booked a two bedroom apartment via Wotif, believing their blurb that it was close by the city. It's not. The buses come every half hour and it's a $15 for taxi ride to the CBD. Returning from the CBD late in the evening was downright scary with nobody around.  The wind whistled through the badly made doors all night making an incredible noise. I couldn't connect my computer via dialup and it was implied that it was my computer's fault, even though I have been on the road for a month staying in various serviced apartments and haven't ever had a problem with dial up.I tried to cancel the reservation as soon as I walked in the door realizing that I'd made a big mistake, but having booked with WOTIF they would not consider a cancellation.  Being so far out of the buzz of the city or the charm of the inner suburbs made it a miserable time for me in Sydney, and I'll never again book via WOTIF or with an apartment/hotel which is really just in the selling/leasing business, not the hospitality business.

<Content>Great apartment Stayed her Dec 30- Jan 5 with family in a 3 bedroomed apartment. Very clean and comfortable with modern decor and furnishings. Easy to get into city by bus or taxi (about $15 to circular quay). Pool and gym facilities really good. Not much of a view though if you are on the outside apartments.

<Content>Very Very Nice Stayed in a three bedroom unit from 26 to 30Nov. Best hotel, best value place we stayed while we travelled in Australia. Paid A$201 per night + A$15 per day for parking. The unit are very well maintain and everthing in tip top condition. We love this place. will stay here again. The front desk is small and difficult to find though.

<Content>Very nice A few friends of mine, including myself, stayed here three or four times during the two years I lived in Australia. The place that we rented was very very nice, spacous, about six or seven stories high with a wonderful view of the city street (nothing breath-taking or anything, but it was nice). We had a very pleasant stay there every time. The only thing that I thought was weird was how the desk clerk(s) would always look at you like they thought you were hiding something and they were going to find out....kind of funny though. Alltogether great place!

<Content>Great find We stayed here for 1 night prior to leaving Australia. We had previously been in Sydney for 1 week and stayed in the City Centre. First of all, the Meriton was an extremely good deal especially given the amount of space, the cleanliness, and the amenities. It really is an apartment, not a hotel room, and there is a fully-outfitted kitchen as as well as a separate laundry room with detergent included. Excellent for long-term stays but was great for a short stay like ours, too. It was really nice to have an actual couch to sit on to watch TV, etc. There was a convenience store and 4-5 ethnic restaurants nearby (the pizza at the Middle Eastern corner one was fantastic), as well as a DVD rental store (the apartment has a DVD player). The apartment is pretty convenient to Centennial Park and to the Paddington area. Too far to walk to City Centre, though, let alone the Harbor (our hotel in City Centre allowed us to walk to Darling Harbor and even to Circular Quay when we weren't too tired). However, it is well-positioned in terms of cabfare, generally about A$10 to most areas of the city, with fare to the airport $20 (we didn't realize this and took the train in from the airport, then a cab, very roundabout and well over $30!). The front desk people were very courteous and helpful, as well. Highly recommended!

<Content>Excellent Apartments The apartments and overall facilities exceeded our expectations. For a very reasonable price we got a new, well appointed apartment that was quiet, secure and extremely clean. The location was not like being in the heart of Sydney but there were some good eating places close by and it was not far by taxi to Sydney center. We would certainly stay at the Meriton again in the future.

<Content>Sydney's top shelf! What a great find! I recently travelled to Sydney with my girlfriend for the weekend, where we stayed at Meriton Cameo for two nights. What a great place to stay! Location - It was only a $14 taxi fare from the airport (15 mins), and buses to Circular Quay (301, 302, 303) leave regularly from just around the corner (Bourke St), and it's only a 15-20min trip. There are countless pubs and restaurants on Crown St in Surry Hills, which is a very short walk away (25 mins to the most distant we visited at Foveaux St), and even shorter on the bus. The $10 steak at Forresters was excellent, and we were impressed with every one of the bars we visited. We also walked home during the early hours of the morning, and never once felt unsafe. Fox studios and the SCG/Aussie Stadium are about a 30min walk, and Bondi is not far on a bus. There is also a handy 24hr convenience store in Potter St, which is surprisingly well stocked, and fairly inexpensive.Room/Facilities - Our room was modern, very clean, spacious, and well equipped. The 2 balconies gave us some nice views, and the king size bed was a dream to sleep on. The kitchen was a really nice touch, and would probably satisfy a budding chef. Sparkling bathroom, with a great shower and a large tub. We managed to visit the pool complex, and were blown away! Three pools (one was a genuine lap pool), a spa, and a sauna. The gym looked to be very well appointed too.Staff/Service - The staff were the best I have experienced at a hotel. We arrived at about 10:30am, and rather than just holding our bags, the staff checked us in early! They were more than happy to hold our bags until departure, and offered to organise a taxi for us. We were always greeted with smiling faces, and our requests, though few, were met with ease. I thoroughly recommend the Meriton Cameo to anyone visiting Sydney. Those worried about being out of the city, don't. It was a breeze to get there. There is plenty of nightlife/activities to keep you occupied in Surry Hills. You won't find a hotel in the city as good as the Meriton for less than double the price. Truly a top-shelf stay!

<Content>Carefree Cameo We only stayed 1 night at the cameo aprtments, but for under 拢100 a night the accomodation was exceptional. We stayed in a beautiful 2 bed apartment which appeared to be brand new. The only thing which detracted from the stay was location a little out of the city, but still only a $12 taxi ride (5 minutes) to circular quay.The staff at reception were friendly and helpful (organising taxis etc.) and we were very pleased with the whole experience. With a little more experience of the public transport system I would say that this is an ideal base for a Sydney holiday.

<Content>Bargain price if you know where to look My mother and my sisters family of four needed somewhere to stay while visiting me in Sydney so booked a 2 bed apartment through the wotif site a week before they got here. Very good value for money and if you are capable of getting into the city by yourself by bus(15-30mins) or taxi and don't want a broom cupboard for a room then these newly built a/c apartments with kitchen and access to a 30m pool,gym, sauna, jacuzzi across the road might be for you.Service - Like most things a bit hit and miss depending who you get (hit - receptionist provides us with access to car park to drop off families luggage and efficient check in, miss - a/c not working so after reporting it (guy notes it on writing pad) he says 'thanks' and stares blankly at you - no feedback on when it's going to be fixed - doh!)If you're here on w/e's there is some cool brekkie spots around the area - Danks St Depot and others. Not far from Cleveland street too which has a good few restuarants to eat in the evening too. For bars walk (15mins) up to Surrey Hills - White Horse, Clock hotel, Dolphin hotel, Foresters.Not so easy to get to the beaches though without a car although possible by going into the centre and then out.

<Content>Excellent base for Sydney We stayed here for 5 nights on our first trip to Sydney. We had a 1 bedroom apartment, and were really pleased with the size of apartment and facilities offered (all very clean and new). Really good to have your own washing machine/dryer at the end of a month long trip in Oz! There's a bus stop just outside which takes you into the centre of Sydney (about 15 mins). You can also walk to Fox Studios, and find shops/bars etc, and other local neighbourhoods.We would definitely think about staying there again. Highly recommended!

<Content>"A home away from home." We have stayed there twice in the past month and found everything perfect. Rooms are very spacious, clean and quiet. Decor is very nice. Room with garden view was much nicer than room looking over street.Pools were really great, didn't bother with gym but it appearred to have everything that most gyms have. All staff extremely friendly and helpful.A good base to stay when going to races at Randwick. Lots of nice eateries and pubs at Surry Hills which is a nice stroll or about $8.00 taxi ride.Will certainly stay again, so much cheaper than staying in the city and easy to get to if you need to go there.

<Content>Good value for money, new and spacious We stay for four nights in a two bedroom apartment. The building is very new and you can find all the kitchenware you need. The taxi fare from Chinatown is only $10. A bit of inconvenience is that you have to call and wait for a taxi when you go out.
