<Content>New Orleans - Close this Hotel Today Found this hotel on Hotels.com, but booked with the Hotel.This will be a breif review. I don't know where the other positive reviewers stayed, but it could not have been this roach invested, mold ridden 12 story hotel. STAY AWAY. The city should condemn this building before something bad happens to somebody. Rooms are nasty, beds short-sheeted, bugs on floor, wall paper hanging off the walls, pipes rattle, exposed pipes with holes in the wall, faucet handles come off, lamps didn't work took four tries to get them fixed, keys only worked one day at a time, they make you sign credit card receipt when you check in and then make you sign another one when you leave, (double charge possibility), urine in the elevator, no food (glad for that), broken irons, carpet damp, hallways smell. I Complained about my room ,so they moved me. The new room had about 10-20 roaches crawling on the floor, I had to kill two that were starting to climb up my shoe. Went back and asked for my old room. (without bugs). No offer for credit, when I asked I was told they couldn't give room credit. $100/night what a rip-off.Only good point, the soap and shampoo are from Bath and Body Works, so at least they hade decent soap.

<Content>No hot water, no internet, no lights - if you can believe it This used to be a Ramada Inn (you can tell by the ghost of the Ramada logo on the exterior of the building.) Ramada made the right decision!Yes, they have wireless internet - but only in the 8ft by 15 ft lobby which has 4 chairs and its on the same channel as a competing service provider so the wireless connection drops constantly.Yes, it has cable tv - but it's so snowy that you're better off disconnecting the cable and going with the tv's internal antenna so you can see the local network affiliates.Yes, there is a separate vanity / bathroom area - but my floor was without power and hot water on one of the days (that's why you bring a portable alarm clock). And, the other days I had no cold water so I was careful with my showers.They were unable to print a receipt nor handwrite a receipt - they promised to email one, but that too hasn't happened.All would have been forgiven if I felt that the staff cared - but no....

<Content>From bad to worse There was no parking as advertised on the internet.There was no hot or warm water in the shower.There was plenty of hot water in the flush.There was (---) on the toilet paper.The manager was never available.We were never offered an alternative to our problem.Orbitz offered the following compensation: a $50 bonus the next time I book a hotel with them, which I never will.

<Content>A Total Dive 16 people from my office in NoVA stayed here for 5 nights from Nov 28- Dec 3. We were in New Orleans to build houses with Habitat for Humanity. Originally, our boss wanted to stay in the volunteer shelter (Camp Hope) but many of my coworkers had issues with staying in group housing (20 people in a room with cots), so we lobbied hard to get hotels. It didn't make sense to stay in the Ritz for our volunteer trip, so we booked at the Warwick.Do not believe their website! It must be pre-Katrina... We learned that this hotel WAS a Ramada, but they backed out. This hotel is substandard. The best thing I can say about it, is that it is slightly better than staying in a shelter.Our shower was leaking through to the room below us and a hotel worker came in and pulled the entire fixture from the wall with his bare hands! The whole thing was rotted and rusted out. Disgusting! Many in our group did not have hot water for their showers, and one day the water was turned completely off from 9 am - 4 pm! I had to use bottled water to brush my teeth because the faucet water was so disgusting and tasted like licking a rusty pipe.The sheets did not stay on the beds, which were saggy and painful to sleep on. The wallpaper was peeling off and had mold underneath. The air units were full ot a black crud that I did not investigate further. I took 2 benadryl pills every night for fear of having an allergic reaction to all the mold in my sleep.There is no breakfast in the hotel, which is probably a relief. We had to walk across the street to the Holiday Inn, but ran into problems because NOTHING is open in this city before 7 am!This hotel has a lot of permanent residents. We saw several people strung out on drugs hanging around. One morning the desk clerk was sleeping behind the counter for over an hour (snoring loudly!). Many in our group did not feel safe in this environment.Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else!

<Content>Great Location My boyfriend and I stayed two nights at the the warwick. When we got there to check in, we were able to park right accross the street from the hotel for free (b/c it was a weekend we didn't have to pay the parking meter.) We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. The Superdome was only a very short walk (2 blocks) which was the main reason we chose this hotel. We walked to Harrah's casino, which was maybe 6-7 blocks away, and from Harrah's we walked to the French Quarter.  The key card lock on the door of the first room they gave us did not work, so they were happy to give us another room. This room was a suite and was quite nice. It had a king size bed in the bedroom w/ a tv, bathroom, and living room w/ tv, refrig. Overall I was very satisfied. For the price, it was a good deal. I have been to New Orleans many times and this was my most enjoyable experience yet.

<Content>You get what you pay for... This hotel was built in the early 50's and has seen minimal renovation since that time. It is located in the central city district next to City Hall however this area is quite blighted with several abandoned buildings and homeless folks hanging about. The rooms in this hotel are acutally quite large and there is plenty of closet space. The problem however is the overall condition of the rooms. In my room in particular, upon entering, the hall light was out, the table light was out, the tv didnt work and in the bathroom, the toilet was stuck running and the facuet was leaking and not secured to the sink properly. There is quite a bit of deferred maintenance in this property so be prepared. Overall the hotel was clean (other than a foul odor in the hallways similar to wet dirty carpet). This hotel is perfect for the 20 something party crowd visiting during Mardi Gras but not for a family or business traveler like myself.

<Content>Very Nasty!!! This hotel looks nothing like the one on the web site... from the outside to the elevator... the room... the beds... the bathroom! EVERYTHING! I went into the room and the beds were not made the carpet was so nasty... there was no phone in the room to call the front desk! I wanted my money back and she said i couldnt but she'd put me into another room! (The paper was even checked of f saying that the room was clean!) She said there were better rooms and i certainly wanted one! Well that one was no better! Still nasty and very discusting! The neighborhood looked unsafe! I was very scared! No one should ever rent at this place! They should have the pictures of how it looks... not how it use to look! I know Katrina did some damage but it should be in sleeping condition for some one to sleep in there! No one wants to sleep in flith! I sure dont and i think they should give my money back or something!Thanks for a horrible nite!

<Content>Run down facility-nice staff The hotel is rundown, inside and out. The staff does the best with what they have but the owner's must spend some money.1. Mattress stained and soiled so badly that it looked as though it had been in floor waters. 2. No electrical power for the reading lights on the bed head board.3. That particular day I checked in, the key card machine was broken so staff had to be asked to open my door whenever I left the room.4. Ceiling in the bathroom over the tub was nearly ready to fall in...mold around it.5. Coffee maker but no coffee available (no big deal)6. The area is not safe at night (not their fault)7. Too far from the Quarter (again, not their fault)8. I had a 4 day reservation and even though they refused to refund it, I checked out after the first night and went to the Royal Sonest.....a fabulous hotel!!!Even if they remodeled the Warwick, I would not stay there again until the surrounding area is better lighted and there is some feeling of security....maybe some police officers on foot. There were a few National Guardsmen in Hummers driving around during my visit.Love New Orleans and the people and services were wonderful. Visit and enjoy the city...just choose better accomodations.

<Content>What a bargain! I had never been to New Orleans before, so you might ask, Why now? Well, I had the time (though not much money) and figured there may be more of interest there now than ever. I was not disappointed, but especially, after visiting New York and Boston recently, I was thrilled at the prices. My New Orleans hotel, the Warwick, was an extraordinary value, with huge rooms, a wonderful staff, and a good location. But best of all, I only paid $52 per night. what the rates are other times of year, but this was perfect for me.Go to New Orleans. Stay at the Warwick, and you'll be happy.

<Content>Nice room/hotel but felt very unsafe The hotel room was cheap and very very nice. Lots of room with a king bed and a seperate room for dressing with a bit for the ladies to do their make up. Interesting interior compared to other hotels, in general the rooms were very good. There is quite a poor excuse for a pool that can only take about 4 people and on a hot day that was disappointing. The location was less than desireable, felt very unsafe walking to the french quarter. New Orleans in general was a massive disappointment, a very dirty place with none of the class we were expecting. Would not advise families to travel here as it seems to be a place for drunken boys wanting to go to a strip club.

<Content>Large room is biggest selling point Stayed in this New Orleans hotel, 2 blocks off of Canal in the CBD, within walking distance of the French Quarter, at Tulane Medical Center, so there's good foot traffic around this less-touristed area. Room was very large, comfy king size bed, walk in dressing area. I parked around the corner for free without any problem. Dim lighting in the room made it hard to see the condition of the room, which was probably a good thing in a 2 star hotel. Price was right at $58 per night thru Ramada website. Check out their best rates deal--if you find a better room rate anywhere (on the web), you get your first night free. I did and received my first night free, making the Ramada a great deal. Free mediocre coffee in lobby wasn't bad. Pool is small and grungy, but kids love it.

<Content>Spend some extra money, and don't stay here. Well, we stayed here for 6 nights, and wouldn't stay again. If every other hotel were not sold out, I would have moved.The shower went from hot to cold ever couple seconds. The toilet must have been made for a giant, even someone 6'2 had to reach the floor w/ his tippy toes when sitting! Room was very large, there was maybe 200 sq feet of closet space alone. Not a single hanger to be found. Hmmm.Also, the safe didn't work in the room, and I had to battle w/ the front desk to remove the $2.00 per day charge they automatically charge you, whether you use it or not.Onto the restaurant. What a joke!!!! We had the buffet breakfast, for $9.99 per person. Ok, I'm NOT exaggerating... They didn't have any potatoes, toast, bread products of any kind, the eggs were ice cold and swimming in some sort of watery substance. So, for $10, I was able to eat 2 oranges, and they were not ripe. It was beyond comical.

<Content>This hotel is not that bad... After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor for this hotel I was afraid of what we would encounter upon arrival, because of the Essence Music Festival and 4th of July weekend we would be stuck if the hotel were like the majority of the reviews...but to our surprise it turned out to be just fine! We were greeted by a very friendly staff, the elevators are very slow and hold only five people, but they were clean and depenable. The rooms were spacious and decorated with old southern charm and housekeeping did a great job of keeping them clean. Something that we did find a little odd was the fact that the restuarant downstairs was Greek...not something you expect to encounter in New Orleans. Also the shuttle bus service was not frequent enough and the driver was a little grouchy aside from that it was a very pleasurable stay and I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to stay within walking distance of the Superdome.

<Content>Not the Ritz, but a good value After reading several negative reviews on tripadvisor about this hotel, I was very worried about my upcoming stay. I had booked a block of 6 rooms since I was bringing a group of students (I am a teacher) and parents to New Orleans for a convention. After reading the negative reviews, 2 of my families decided to stay elsewhere. The other two families checked into the hotel, but found their rooms to be unsuitable. The front desk staff kindly offered to fix whatever was wrong, but their complaints (small, slow elevator, small pool with greenish water, mold spot on carpet) couldn't be fixed immediately. I, along with the other teacher in attendance, had NO complaints about our rooms. In fact, my room on the 7th floor had new carpet and mattresses. This hotel is really old so you have to keep that in mind. This hotel is a GREAT value for the 51.00 per night I paid (AAA rate). I would recommend it for anyone who needs to be close to the superdome. The Canal street streetcar is 3 blocks away making access to the French Quarter very convenient. The hotel is bordered by the New Orleans Public Library  the Supreme Court. I felt very safe walking around alone in this area during daylight, but was a little leary at night.

<Content>Great location, old hotel, but pleasant to stay in First off, the location is awesome, you can walk anywhere in the French Quarter in less than 15 minutes. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms (we had two rooms) were clean and I could tell that they've done some painting to update the bathrooms recently. The bedrooms are huge with tons of closet space, and it was nice to get expanded cable in the rooms. If you're looking for a place close to the French Quarter and don't mind ugly wallpaper, you should stay here. The only things wrong with the place were cosmetic (old decor-- which is easy to overlook if all you plan to do there is sleep,) and an overpriced buffet breakfast.

<Content>Good Rate for Location When I stayed at this hotel, I though the location was o.k. for all the attractions such as the French Quarter, the Aquiarium, etc. It was about the best rate you will pay for a hotel in this location. I saw many other hotels in the same area and location that were much more expensive. This would be ideal to just to be able to stay close to the attractions without having to spend a lot for a hotel, especially if you are not going to spend that much time in the hotel. The only thing that I the hotel needs to do is just update the restrooms a little bit, but other than that they are o.k. I always came back to a clean and peaceful hotel after a long day of sight seeing. The shuttle was also helpful to get to the French Quarter, but if you couldn't get the shuttle you only have to walk two block to get the streetcar! The staff was very helpful. If I needed anything they were there to fix the problem. Good inexpensive hotel for the location.

<Content>Very Dirty Hotel I just wanted to make a comment about the Ramada Inn Downtown Superdome. I returned yesterday from New Orleans and my husband and I booked a package deal that included the hotel and airfare. We stayed at the Ramada Inn Downtown Superdome location at 1315 Gravier and I am letting everyone I can think of know what a total and complete dump this place is. We thought the Ramada Inn had a good reputation and we didn't think twice about booking with them. However, we were amazed by how decrepit and dirty this Ramada Inn was. The first room we were placed in was filthy, filthy dirty and the tub wouldn't drain. After calling 3 times over the course of a day for someone to fix the tub, we requested another room. The other room was just as filthy. The carpets were stained, greasy and smelled bad, the beds were sagging and the mattresses were yellowed. The wallpaper was peeling and there was black gunk around the caulking of the tub. The shower head was rusted and coming out of the wall, the shower curtain rod was held up by folded up cardboard, the shower curtain wasn't even a shower curtain! It was an ancient cloth liner that smelled awful. The elevator was full of scratched up graffiti, the halls were dank and the walls were marred by the yellowed glue from missing signs. We were totally and completely grossed out by this hotel and if it had not been booked as part of a non-refundable package deal, we would have requested a refund or taken the loss for one night's stay and gone somewhere else. Seriously, the only place worse that we have ever stayed at is a guest house off of Koh San Road in Bangkok, Thailand - and we only paid $5 a night there. On a more positive note, the hotel staff was very friendly and it was a short walk to the French Quarter. Unfortunately, the friendliness of the staff was not enough to justify the terrible condition this hotel is in and people should be made aware of how trashy this hotel is.

<Content>good location, cheap but watch out for additional charges The good thing about this hotel is its location (max 10 min walk to French Quartier) and that it is quite cheap for 3 stars in downtown location (I paid less than 60 Dollar + tax). It is advisable to book directly on the Ramada website, while checking if other websites offer a better price for the same room than the Ramada website : because if so, the first night is free :)! Have your free first night confirmed on the internet before check-in.The rooms are old but quite clean, and are really non-smoking if reserved so. However my bathroom urgently needed repair with large chunks of paint falling down from the wall. The shower plumbing sat very loose in the wall and I always feared adjusting shower temperature would tear off some pipes :) Bathroom equipment was antique and there was that anti-splippery coating in the bathtub that nobody can really clean, so it was not clean at all.Dont expect a gym at this hotel, there is none, and the outside, not so clean, non-heated pool is sized for no more than two babies.Then you have to check your final bill for those big and little incidentals. First they tried to have me pay my first free night, fortunately I could show a printed mail confirmation from Ramada.com. Second, there was a safe in the room and I had called front desk upon arrival and they had said using the safe would be at no extra charge. So I ended up refusing to pay the one dollar safe insurance per night, and it was no easy task negociating that with the unpleasant lady at the check-out.Well, the overall impression is that you can go there if you can stand a cheap and quite clean twenty-year old room, in walking distance of everything that matters in New Orleans... additional charges may apply if you dont watch out !For the budget traveller, there is a cheap bus from and to the airport, at 1,60 Dollar per person. The downtown end station is called Elk Place and is in walking distance of hotel. Nobody will tell you about that bus, because they all want their silly commission on those expensive airport shuttles (15 to 20 Dollar) ! At the airport, ask at the information desk for the E2 bus stop, located at upper level, outside Delta check-in. Have the exact change ready, fare is to be paid in the bus. The ride takes about one hour because this bus stops everywhere.The budget traveller will also appreciate the gorgeous all-you-can-eat lunch buffet at the Holyday Inn, one block from Ramada Superdome. I found a coupon on the NOLA website for a two-for one deal, and the food was so great and I ate so much that I didnt need a real meal for two days then :) This food is much better than at all those noisy, expensive and dirty French Quartier restaurants.

<Content>Wrong Way I came with five friends to stay at this hotel. I have never experienced such a horrible time in staying at a hotel. Our check in person was rude and misinformed. The carpets were filthy, we had no cold water our entire stay, the elevators did not work half of the time and we were forced to get out of the hotel by using the fire escape the beds were broken and half of the time our room keys did not work. When we tried to address the management they were rude and unwilling to help us. I would never stay in that hotel again and I would not want anyone to have to endure what we went thru.

<Content>Reasonable Price, Nice Hotel My friend and I stayed in this hotel from Dec. 30 to January 2, 2004. I am from Canada and he is from California. I booked the room online and when I called prior to the trip to confirm the reservation the staff was very helpful and polite. Check in was simple. We stayed on the 11th floor, which could take some time to get to as the elevator (only 2) are very slow. The hotel seemed very clean and the room was VERY spacious with a seperate door to the HUGE closet/dressing area. We were not able to dial out at all using the phone in the room though. We could only contact the front desk. I would say that they are in need of a little facelift though (new wallpaper and stuff...but that is merely cosmetic. Everything else was fine) The walk from the hotel to Canal (to get to Bourbon ect) could be a little scary if you have never been to New Orleans before (or if you are by yourself). We walked every night (left around 9 and arrived back no earlier than 3am) and we were fine. It is about a 9 minute walk to Bourbon Street and maybe 15 (tops) to Decatur. So all in all the French Quarter is very accessible by foot. We actually liked the hotel so much that we booked an extra night which was also no problem at all. They were very accomodating and helpful with that. I would definitely stay at the hotel again the next time I am in New Orleans.

<Content>Nice, Very Affordable My best friend and I stayed here over New Years for 3 days, and all in all we had a very pleasant stay. First of all, the hotel staff were absolutely some of the nicest people I have ever encountered during my travels, and I have been everywhere!! Nikki, and the rest of the front desk staff were so polite and willing to help us out in any way. They gave us great recomendations for restaurants and clubs to visit and anytime we needed anything such as extra towels or a new light bulb, all we had to do was call downstairs and ask. This hotel gives you the basic amenities; no frills here, but it was very clean, our room was HUGE, and it had an awesome greek cafe down in the lobby. The food there was great- try the baklava; TO DIE FOR!!! It has a pool, but we didn't use it. Also the lighting in the rooms is a little dim, so it made getting dolled up for New Years a little difficult; but I wouldn't consider that as a problem. This is a really decent hotel for a really affordable price. If having a great view and fancy frills are important to you, then I wouldn't stay here. But if, like my friend and I, you are in NO to see the sites and party on Burbon St., then this place is for you. It was in a safe area, it was quiet, clean, and everywhere in NO was only a 5 or 6 dollar cab ride away. You can't beat that!!! I plan on staying there again when I return in May.

<Content>Great Hotel - Hospitable Staff I recently stayed here on business. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The room was spacious and clean. My bathroom was recently remodeled and was very nice. I would recommend this hotel for those on a budget. I booked my rsvp through hotels and had no problems when I checked in. They will ask you for a $25 incidental fee ( for your entire stay) and charge you $2 per day for the in room safe.

<Content>Great Value, but needs to be updated We've visited in New Orleans several times and had to pay a fortune for what has seemed like closet space. We were amazed when we arrived and the rooms were so big and for less than I've ever paid for a room in the city! There is no parking at the hotel, but a nicely priced garage next door (actually the cheapest parking I've seen in the city). The staff was friendly and the hotel was clean and they even had a shuttle to the French Quarter. The only compliant that I have is that the rooms are a bit outdated and the plumbing need a little improvement; my husband had to take a cold shower the first morning, but maintenance fixed the problem immediately. Overall we enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay here on our next trip.

<Content>Don't Stay Here! If you like motels that you can rent by the hour then this place is for you. You will be very comfortable with the run-down lobby and the slow elevator thats posts a hand-written sign of 5 max. Once you enter your suite you will feel right at home with the worn dirty carpet and the moldy smell. Torn wallpaper, exposed pipes and uncomfortable bed complete your experience. We checked-out as soon as we could book into another hotel and they refused to give us a full refund for a room we did not use. Enjoy your stay!

<Content>nice, comfortable, affordable hotel Hotel was nice, charming, not a lot of rooms so it wasn't crowded. The rooms are big, really oversized, with good AC, cable, everything worked great! It is close enough to walk to the french quarter but far enough that we could get away from the noise and actually sleep at night. The staff was great, we even got mardi gras beads from the manager! Also, great breakfasts!Thanks!

<Content>IN All Fairness Let me say 1st that if you're planning to spend a great deal of your time here do not come here! I would have given this place a 1 rating bcause, the customer service here is really  I mean really terrible! The people at the front desk seem like they have No clue of anything! Also several of the floors smell awful..(I know this because I went to look for the vending machines which are nothing more than small coke machines) .....But to be fair, my room was fairly ok. the AC  heater both worked fine, since we had to use both due to the change in the weather. Our wait for an elevator wasn't bad at all. You might see a few homeless people pass by sometimes, but if you're from a place where you see that kinda stuff often,then it won't bother you any. .......the only way I would recomend this place to anyone is if you're looking to stay somewhere fairly close to the French Quarter, Inexpensive, everywhere else is booked  you absolutely have no other alternative, then do what you have to do. Just plan to spend alot of your time out doing something. .....I expected this place to be Alot better....but I guess it could've been alot worse!!! My next trip there though, I'll try somewhere else.

<Content>Awful We came to New Orleans for a National T.A.P. Pool Tournament over at the Radison on Canal St. We would have stayed at the Radison since we were eligable for the the group rates, but we booked too late and it was already full. We were not looking for a luxery hotel since we would only be sleeping there. This hotel was nasty, the rooms do not look anything like the pictures on the internet. Our room was dirty, the wallpaper was peeling off the walls, there were large mysterious red stains on the carpeting in several places, the bathroom door did not shut, there was no cold water (even the water in the toilet was steaming). We had to wait so long for the elevator that we had to go down 12 flights of stairs with our luggage to check out (stairs do not lead to lobby, but to 2nd level pool area, where you have to walk all the way around the building to get back in the front). This is not what I would have expected from a Ramada and would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Suffered thru my stay I'm usually very open-minded to small flaws. However, from the first of my four night stay I was jinxed. I had to request an iron twice (the first one did't work) that was supposed to be part of the room amenities. The room safe was not functional and I had them remove the $1 a day fee. I froze in the shower every morning. I came in from my meeting to discover that my favorite shirt, worn for just an hour the night before, was missing from the chair I had neatly folded it on. The bar staff was great, but they didn't stay open late. Will drink there again, but probably not stay there as a guest. Holiday Inn across the street is much nicer. This place needs to be subjected to serious cleaning.

<Content>Horrible customer service! I made a prepaid reservation for the Ramada through hoteldiscounts. When I arrived at the hotel I showed them my prepaid voucher, but they did not have my reservation. It was Saturday morning and the phone number I had to hoteldiscounts just gave me a recording saying that they were closed for the weekend. To top it off, the hotel was overbooked so they would not give me a room. I spoke with both the front desk staff and the manager and neither offered any help. They said I could wait around for a couple hours when someone from reservations came in, but there was no way I'd get a room since they were overbooked, so I wasn't sure what good waiting would do. The only help they offered was directions to the local library where I were able to use the internet to find another hotel (the Sleep Inn which was great!). I expect a lot more from the staff at a hotel. The least they could've done is help me find a new hotel to stay at, but directing me to the library? I will never stay at a Ramada hotel or use hoteldiscounts again.

<Content>Grungy and worn-out This hotel was dark, grungy and thoroughly unpleasant. The toilet ran. There was graffiti in the elevators. The hallways had dark dirty carpets, and my room door barely closed. Also the location is terrible, if you want to go to the French Quarter or other typical tourist attractions in New Orleans; it's relatively close, but a walk through creepy streets crawling with homeless people. Definitely does not feel safe in the evening. I expected better from a Ramada. The only good thing was the staff, who, while a bit harried, were friendly and helpful.

<Content>Read before you book it! Before you book this hotel here are a few things to consider 1) this hotel provides basic, budget accommodations, 2)over the weekend there was no ice available although the restaurant was happy to give us ice, 3) rooms are BASIC with no frills, 4) rooms were old but ours was clean and the housekeeping staff was prompt, 4) if you want a fancy room and spend a lot of time in your room you may not want this hotel, 5) if you want a cheap, basic room and want to spend your money on food and fun this could be a good option for you, 6) we walked to the French Quarter during the day but due to lots of construction and city filth decided to take a cab back to the hotel, 7) great Greek restaurant in the hotel, 8) staff was helpful, 8) the pool area was nice although you have to go down a stairwell to get to it. OVERVIEW if you are fussy about your room you will hate this hotel however we had two queen beds which were very comfortable and our room had great air conditioning and was very quiet and dark for sleeping. If we were looking for an elegant fancy hotel and were going to spend a lot of time in the hotel/room we would not book this hotel again. If we come back and want to take a cheap trip and spend our time out and about we would book this hotel again. Above all, you get what you pay for;)

<Content>Worst hotel we ever stayed at, the Ramada / SuperDome The worst hotel we have ever stayed at. The wall paper was peeling and falling off the walls. They used duct tape to cover small holes in the wall. The room a very bad smell and you better plan to wait 20 minutes for an elevator in non airconitioned lobby and hallways. Our room posted a number to contact the G.M. of the hotel, but when you called the extension it did not go through. ( He is probably forced to hide from outraged guests ). What a complete joke. NEVER visit this hotel, it is a shame that Ramada lets the owner use the Ramada name, as we were so upset that Ramada will never get our business again.

<Content>Most disgusting hotel I have ever seen Where do I start... this was the most disgusting, dirty hotel I have ever seen. I had a room on the 9th floor with 2 queen beds, room was large- only nice thing I can find to say about this rat trap. This hotel felt like a place where crackheads would go to rent a room for an hour to get high! The carpet was flithy- I refused to let my bare feet even touch it. The walls were stained and there was rust drip stains from various vents in the walls. Half of the lights did not work, and the electric wiring was so old, that when i tried to plug my cell phone charger in, sparks shot at me. The elevators were very slow, yes, but I could overlook that part if my room had felt clean. I have stayed at the Ramada on Bourbon in the past and loved it, so I figured that this Ramada would be somewhat similar. Boy was I wrong. Do not stay here if you like clean hotels.

<Content>Avoid this hotel If you have a choice, don't chose this hotel. The hallways smelled musty, the elevators took forever, mold on the walls, if you ask for a non smoking room you probably won't get one, the trainee at the front desk was not helpful. The 3 of the 4 chairs they had a poolside were broken. After suffering for two nights, took a walk around the corner and checked in at the Holiday Inn(you can see it from the Ramada). The rooms were clean, NO MOLD, the elevators worked the staff was wonderful they couldn't be more helpful. The Holiday Inn made my stay in New Orleans a happy stay. If you have a choice try the Holiday Inn. YOU WONT BE SORRY.

<Content>Good place to stay on a budjet Good Location. Within walking distance of virtually everything. Only a few blocks from the SuperDome and New Orleans Arena on one side and just a few blocks walking to the French Quarter. The people at the front desk couldnt have been any nicer. Very friendly staff. Only thing i could complain a little about is the last day i was there i requested a wake-up call but never got it. I set the alarm clock as a backup anyway and believe me, if you turn up the volume on the alarm clock there you cant help but wake up when it goes off! We had a room with 2 queen beds on the 8th floor. The room was much bigger than I expected and the windows were openable so you could enjoy some fresh air. The Air Conditioning in the room worked really good. The restaurant downstarts was ok, a little pricey but hey this is New Orleans, NOTHING and i mean NOTHING is cheap here. Other than the wakeup call pretty much anything we asked for we got right away. Not at all a bad deal for only $59.25 per night which I got of their website. I would recommend this hotel for those who want a budjet hotel with with upscale hotel style rooms and service and I would stay here again if I go back to New Orleans.
