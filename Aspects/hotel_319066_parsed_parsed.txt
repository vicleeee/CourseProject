<Content>A Very Good Stay Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in October 2008.The hotel itself is in an excellent location in Addison. Although we were on the Concierge Level, the rooms were well equipped and the pubic areas were well furnished. The pool was good, although probably needs checking every day for leaves etc.Three downsides - the breakfast room, bar prices and internet access. For a 500+ room hotel to have such a poorly equipped (and sized) restaurant means a disaster on Sunday mornings - so get there early to avoid the queues. I bought a pint and a Baileys one evening in the bar - and it cost $14.50 !!! With so many alternatives for bars in the vicinty, on Beltline Road, those prices are stupid. Finally, the internet access. Despite advertising that wireless access was free in the lobby, what it actually means is they provide 3 terminals in a business centre for anytime usage. If you want to use your own PC, you'll have to pay stupid prices.That said, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the surrounding restaurants are fantastic (especially On The Border), and in response to a previous comment, it is easy to avoid toll roads - we drove round every day without going near a toll booth.

<Content>ok This hotel is a bad location for business travelers- far from downtown - if you want to be near the mall. It is on a toll road so every time you leave the property you must pay the tolls- a very annoying 55 cents/ 40 cents. The room was ok the evelvators where horrible and the parking cost $10.00 an annoying expense for Dallas where most hotel parking is free. There are better marriotts and hotels in Dallas

<Content>great mini vacation We stayed at the marriott off the tollway on august 30-sep1-2008. We had a great time. This was a gift from friends for us so this was special. I loved the free shuttle service. I thought the hours were resonable, after all you did not have to burn your own gas, pay for a cab, or lose your parking space and that I'm picky about. so we went to the galleria and into a 3 story macy's well, the mall was 3 storys. had excellent service there and to truluks steak and seafood on beltline road. I've been there before, but I promise if you go, you never want to go to red lobster again. It is worth the money but it is pricey for most people.I felt this hotel was a little overpriced since it did not have microwaves and refrigerators in the room but found out you can ask for one I don't know if you have to pay extra or not. We tipped everyone who waited on us so expect to bring a wad of money thats how good they are and friendly. We had pizza in the room one night and it was good and the free breakfast was great they made fresh omeletts and waffles at your request. We did not use the pool but it looked nice I thought it would have been to cold but the outside is heated. I liked the little gift shop I found a nice thank-you card there.Not many channels to watch on t.v., but who is here to watch t.v.? The big beds were soft and so were the pillows.our room was a little stale at first, but they fixed that and we had a little misunderstanding with the check-in people about there polices but they sent a bottle of wine and a gift basket up to the room soon after, which was nice of them. There were a few things that could have been better. I think the parking was to expensive. Also don't stay on the window side of the tollway next to the toll booth, it will keep you up all night cars racing all night long, very irritating. And it was to late to move to another room. this was after midnight and lasted until around 5:30 in the morning.The room card also did not work. they were touchy you had to try several times and get it just right or you were not getting into your room.overall It was nice since it was free, but I probably would not stay there again since they have courtyard marriotts all over the place that are just as nice and once you've stayed at the grand hyatt at the airport or Somewhere in Las Vegas you won't want to stay anywhere else.

<Content>Awesome Hotel I recently stayed at this hotel for my honeymoon weekend and really enjoyed my stay. The people at the front desk were really helpful and were very gracious. I was congratulated on my marriage by at least three different employees at the hotel and was sent chocolate covered strawberries to my room along with a few gifts and a card from one of the employees. Me and my new wife were drove around to anywhere within five miles of the hotel and absolutely loved Addison circle. The hotel also made us reservations for a local Italian restaurant who treated us to free drinks and dessert. We loved the hot tub in the hotel and the friendly atmosphere. We will definitely be staying at this hotel again.

<Content>Nice hotel  We are from Phoenix and spent two nights here because my son han a gymnastics meet. The three people we came in contact with at the front desk were awesome. I asked for an upgrade to the concierge floor and they were happy to do it for me. The hotel is located next to the north toll way and has about 40 restaurants within a mile. They have a very nice workout center next to the indoor/outdoor pool with a large jacuzzi. We paid the extra $20/day for the breakfast buffet for up to two adults and two kids which was worth it.

<Content>Nice Stay Stayed at the Marriott for a week in September. The hotel is in Addison and is walking distance to some nice restaurants. The only thing is that the streets are a little difficult to navigate in.The hotel staff was nice. Didn't have too many interaction with them.Nothing really jumped out at me with this hotel. The room was nice. The only thing that stood out was the $9.95 internet access. This was per day. That was a bit high.The room was okay. The bathroom could use a little work.

<Content>Good Rooms but Poor Shuttle Service Spent three nights while attending a conference in the hotel. The room was great and the staff was enjoyable. The conference rooms were great and the breakfast at the restaurant was above average. My only complaint would be that they need to be more lenient on the shuttle service. There were 300+ people in town for a convention and they would only do a drop off/pick up at the Galleria every hour. It wasn鈥檛 that far but if you showed up at 10 past the hour you had to wait the 50 minutes or pay for a taxi. And the shuttle and the driver would just sit there as well.

<Content>Great staff and decor, No amenities We stayed at the Marriott Quorom with a large group for a week. The hotel common areas are beautiful and comfortable. The staff was courteous, very knowledgeable and helpful. The outdoor pool area had terraced levels which included lounge chairs , tables and chairs and shade areas under awnings or trees. The pool was small but nice with both indoor and outdoor with swim through acces to both. The workout room was first rate entirely encase in glass on two sides overlooking the pool area. We ate lunch once in the onsite restaurant and the food  service was very good. The problems we experienced were with the amenities. No refrigerators in the rooms. When your in Texas in summer (or anytime) you need refrigerators for cold drinks. Our group had to go out to Walmart to buy coolers to stock our beverages. It is also hard to understand why these expensive, full service hotels do not include amenities found in most hotels that charge $69/night. We had a discounted group rate through a travel agent but this hotel typically goes for $239/night minimum which includes no breakfast, no refrigerator or microwave, plus $9.95/day internet access and they add a $10/day parking fee. Basically, you are nickeled and dimed to death. Add the Dallas Tollway to it and you really are handing out money all day. Don't get me wrong, the room (a corner king) we had was oversized with great bedding/mattress, granite countertops in the bathroom, and stylish decor. (Shower water pressure could have been better.) However, it is hard to justify a return trip to this hotel unless you have to be there for a convention or group event while within four to six blocks, you have many other hotels costing half the price or more that include many more amenities that make your stay more comfortable.

<Content>They consider this luxury? My husband was in charge of choosing the hotel this time and for the last time. We stayed here for Christmas to attend the Cowboy football game with my Family on Christmas Day, and do some after Christmas shopping. I was very disappointed. The hotel room had an old stale smell, it wasn't very clean and the food was terrible. I'll never stay here again.

<Content>Saved me when I was stranded On a night when over 200 flights out of Dallas were cancelled and the highways were fender-deep in water, I stayed at this Marriott because it was the closest place to the airport that had room as the hotels filled up. A couple of features set this hotel above its competition as a business hotel. First, the mattress is the best I've slept on - better than a Heavenly Bed, better than a Ritz. And not just because it beat sleeping on the floor of the airport like 3,000 of my fellow travelers!Second, the hotel actually acknowledges that you need to do work and so has a great electronics console as a sort of backsplash to the desk - lots of outlets, phone lines, and other plug-ins for all your gizmos so that you don't have to move appliances or crawl around on the floor. Finally, instead of a $5.00 cheapo clock alarm or one of those new weird pre-programmed radios (I hate those things), this clock radio had an iPod docking station attached to it. The room also had a flat-screen TV and wonderful uni-sex orange-scented amenities. And the nice man at the desk gave me a free toothbrush so I wouldn't have socks on my teeth the next morning when I got up to schlep back to the airport. And a free bottle of water, not one that cost $6.00 like the hotel I stayed in the night before.Also - compact flourescents in the guest rooms! Thanks for saving energy, and for keeping the bathroom light fixtures from melting a gal's makeup (even if it was day-old makeup). I only wish you would have had recycling in the guest room!

<Content>Great Hotel  This hotel was outstanding for my two night stay in Dallas. I was there for RR, to visit a friend, to shop, and enjoy the nice weather. I had requested an early check-in which they were able to accomadate, and it was great to be in my room and taking a nap by 12 noon. The room was very nice, decent sized., nice chair in the corner, and the bed was marvelous. Duvet comforter and lots of pillows. Pillow top mattresses. Bathroom was very clean with nice granite top vanity. Good water pressure in the shower.The hotel has a nifty shuttle to the galleria mall. The mall is beautiful and I enjoyed shopping there. I also sat by the pool, on the sunny day and that was very nice. Room service was good and the pizza I ordered and the burger were quite good. This is a great hotel for $239 a night, which is what I paid. There also is a gift shop with a Starbucks attached. Good selection of magazines there. Nice large workout room near the pool.

<Content>Marriot Quorum Very good experience!! My husband and I stayed at Marriot Quorum for two nights (March 17 and 18th) and since I am a marriot rewards member was able to book the ebreaks weekend special for 95 plus tax. This room usually goes for more than $200. The hotel is very clean, the staff are very service oriented and friendly. The pool and jacuzzi were refreshing after a long day of travel.My husband and I took the free shuttle to the Galleria Mall both days. The galleria is worthwhile seeing as they have an ice rink in the middle of the mall. The only complaint was that this is more of an upscale mall so if you are looking for bargains you are not going to find them at the Galleria. We ate at the corner bakery in the mall; the food was great and reasonable priced.My only complaint was that we had to purchase internet for $9.95 per day. We also stayed at the Fairfield Inn in Market Center and got the internet for free. I think these higher end hotels need to start providing the internet for free. I would recommend this Marriot hotel.

<Content>Great Place to Stay The hotel is your typical Marriott and what I mean by that it is a really nice hotel but nothing exciting. When you arrive make sure and valet the first night if you have allot of bags. The parking garage is convenient but the elevator is always broken and you will have to go up stairs if it is broken.The check in staff is always friendly and check you in very promptly, They they have recently done renovations and if you get one of the new rooms they are very nice. If you want a room with some extra space ask for a corner room. If you are traveling on business they have a real nice work area and the TV is very nice. The food at the restaurant is very good especially if you like Steak. The bar is huge but the bartenders could be a little better and more observant. The breakfast buffet is pretty big with a wide selection so if you are looking to start your day off right I recommend it. The hotel is in an area with a bunch of shopping and restaurants so you need to check out the surroundings.

<Content>Great Stay Nice Hotel. Stayed here after the renovations. The room was not big in size but the beds and pillows were wonderful. The flat panel TV is a nice touch. The staff was very friendly. They have a kiosk where you can print out boarding passes which is a blessing. There are tons of restaurants around this hotel and the variety of it is great. Wish they offered wireless since now even the motels are offering them for free !! Great location Great Staff. Definitely will stay again.

<Content>Fantastic! Highly Recommended! I just stayed at this Marriott, and it was great! The service was excellent with a friendly staff. The room size was average, but the beds and pillows were very comfortable. I was staying while the hotel was renovating, but there was no disturbances from the floors being renovated. I was staying in a room that wasn't renovated, but the renovated rooms had a modern touch to them with flat panel TVs. The food in the hotel restaurants was great, but just a bit pricey. Their breakfasts were a great start to the day and even the food at the cafe at an odd hour was delicious. We stayed at this hotel for 70.00 per night (we stayed for a wedding reception to be held in a salon/meeting room), so the rate was a bargain. The wedding reception was nicely set-up, the food was great, and it was fun! The only drawback was a $9.95 for wired internet inside the room, but at least it was fast. The hotel was about 20 minutes from DFW when taking toll roads, which is closer than expected. I was staying in a room that wasn't renovated, but the renovated rooms had a modern touch to them with flat panel TVs. Overall a great experience, would highly recommend, and I would stay here again!
