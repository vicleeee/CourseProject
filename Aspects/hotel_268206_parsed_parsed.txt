<Content>Satisfied customer I was in Boston for 5 days to attend a conference at the Omni Parker but I didn't make a reservation in time to get a conference discount. So I ended up at John Hancock Hotel and I'm glad I stayed there.1) The hotel is only a block from Back Bay T station (orange line). 2) It's safe. I walked alone from the T station around 11:30 but nothing happened.3) The price. You can't beat the price. Mine was a standard Queen size room. I paid less than $100. Seriously. 4) In case you need a rent a car to go to suburbs of Boston. Avis (? I may be wrong about the name) is only one block away and the road leading to I-90 is just down the street. (Mind you. It's really hard to find I-90 exists in Boston. This is a HUGE plus for the hotel.)5) Breakfast included. For this price, I wouldn't complain about the choices. But there are cereals,muffins, bagels,fruits, croissants, coffee, juice etc. 6) The room is rather a tiny side but it's clean. Likewise, the bathroom is small, too. But it's OK.7) Reasonably nice front desk staffs,8) Free Internet connection, and computers in a business room right in front of the front desk.Downside:1) There's no room service or in-room dining unless you order from some restaurants (menus available.)2) Different from other hotels, cabs aren't waiting for you when you check out. You have to ask the front desk to arrange it.I'd recommend this hotel to budget travelers. Basically, I was there just to sleep and was out almost all day. The price was right!

<Content>Great Deal for the Money I was a bit apprehensive after reading some reviews but I was looking for a cheap deal and not a five star hotel as I did not plan to spend all day there. Yes, it is a dated hotel, the walls could stand some new paint and the furnishings are so-so, but who really cares at these prices? It is immaculately clean (which is important to me) has basic amenitites (hairdryer, coffee maker and iron and ironing board, TV in room) and a continental breakfast included in the price. The staff was helpful and friendly, and the location is ideal. For $179 a night it was a steal. I loved Boston, plan to go back next year and also plan to stay here again. For people looking for luxury and ambience stay at one of those high priced hotels, but for people who are more interested in seeing Boston and having a clean, decent place to spend the night this place cannot be beat.

<Content>Basic and in need of decoration First impressions were good, in that the hotel staff promptly replied to e-mails prior to arrival. Due to a change in flights we arrived close to midnight, but they were prepared for us. The room was certainly in need of decoration and quite small. The whole appearance was that it is dated and in need of refurbishment.Beware of the phone service though. I was charged just short of $10 for a 7 minute call to Rhode Island (40 miles away) and it would have been far cheaper to use my UK mobile to make the call on. I queried this on checkout and was told that (on check in) I should have been advised to buy a phone card. No telephone cost rates were displayed in the room.However, our room was reasonable clean and the location is good. Breakfast was okay and you do get free internet access in the business centre.But do not expect a top class hotel in the heart of Boston from the John Hancock Hotel  Conference Centre. I can't even refer to it as a budget hotel as it was not at all cheap. Certainly not Boston's best.

<Content>Nightmare from start to finish I had just travelled from Ireland and arrived at this hotel quite latein the evening only to find the staff rude and the hotel dull and gloomy and this hotel was not cheap to stay in. I am easily pleased as long as I get a room that is clean and staff who arehappy to help which is at the end of the day their job!! First of all our room was nothin like the picture when we got in we could just about find room to put our suitcases down but had to step over them to get in and out of the bathroom! We just thought ah well we are here now this will do! We got dressed up and headed into town but when we arrived back we were addressed very promptly and aggressively by the receptionist saying EXcuse me can I help u with a real attitude! when i said yes we are staying here she replied well like me see your key because I dont remember you. I then showed her the key and she said ok go on even though we had spent the money to stay here afterall!!Exhausted we went to bed only to be awakened by hammering and drilling outside our room at 6.30am! we were so angry by this and phoned reception only to be told I cant help you the Manager is not here! several hours after complaining we had to pack up and move rooms even though the work had been going on for 2 months so the hotel was well aware that we would be wakened!! There were many other minor things but all in all I can only describe this hotel as awful. Please do not stay here!

<Content>Run, don't walk, away from this hotel This was easily one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. I had to go to Boston at the last minute for work, and this was the only hotel under $400 / night that I could find in Boston on short notice. The location is definitely convenient, but that is definitely the extent of the good things that I can stay about this hotel. When I arrived, I was told that the maid service was just finishing cleaning my room. I went upstairs and found my room - which was so heavily sprayed with air fresheners and perfumes that I began to have an allergic reaction. When I tried to open the window, I found that it did not open - which may have been a good thing, as the parking structure for the convention center was less then 12 feet away from my window. I ended up having to leave the room for about 5 hours to let the air freshener smell disburse. The room itself was desperately in need of renovations - it was small, and drab, and the bed had been in use for about 20 years too long. In addition, the whole bathroom was a shower - the whole thing was tiled and there was a shower head on the wall, but no shower curtain and no separate shower area. When you turned on the shower, it sprayed everywhere. Also, the sink did not stay on by itself - you had to manually hold the hot or cold water down.I would not definitely not recommend staying at this location.

<Content>Bargain Stay Don't expect any frills but the service and location are excellent. One block off the heart of downtown Boston makes this hotel an excellent choice for location. A nice quiet spot with excellent service. The beds are a bit lumpy and the walls need some paint.

<Content>PIg with Perfume This hotel seemed like a good deal for the area (right downtown near Copley Square in between Green and Orange lines on the T) and looked okay from the outside, but it has some problems. First, the actual rooms are in sore need of either an upgrade or better cleaning. My room looked as if it had not been updated in 20 years or more and I know for a fact the shower was only clean 3 out of the 6 nights I was there. Cleaning of the floor was questionable, too, as a bobby pin from a previous traveler was there all 6 nights I was. When the bellhop on call first took me to my room, the light did not work and he said he would fix it immediately. I told him it was not essential (as there were other lights working in the room) and he promised to fix it the next day. This never happened. Secondly, and perhaps most crucially, the front desk staff are very inconsistent. Unfortunately, it seems that only some of them are proficient in English. There were two occasions that lead me to conclude that this is the case. First, my mother was unable to get through to my room after 3 tries one night and after repeating the room number several times in several different ways (seven eleven vs. seven one one. I heard only one of the calls and picked it up only to hear elevator music. The second instance was when a group of us tried to get information about the location of a restaurant that was recommended to us. The front desk person asked us to repeat the name several times and then went in the other room to look up online. It turned out that even though she could not get any information for us, the restaurant was literally 2 blocks from the hotel. Speaking of food, the breakfast was AWFUL. Stale bagels, engligh muffins, and fatty muffins were all you could find; there were no whole grain options. These breads were not replenished on the weekend, so whatever was left from Friday was what you got. Finally, when we were checking out, my collegue could not get her own bill even though she had had her own room. The problem was apparently that she had booked 2 rooms online for herself and for another collegue (one room per person, right?). Well, the billing system at the hotel could only give her a bill for 2 people, making it look like there were 2 people in her room since nowhere on the bill did it say single room. Since this was a business trip, the bill really needed to be correct. This could not be resolved and the clerk was not even able to print up a note on letterhead explaining the error. I hate to write such a negative review, but I have rarely stayed in a hotel in America that was such an embarassment, especially since I was travelling with collegues from overseas.

<Content>Great little find! I booked this hotel based on the fact that we had come from New York and weren't suprised that most of the prices of the hotels in Boston are pretty much on par with NY in regards to the price.I wasn't expecting the earth as we didn't pay that much and i knew that this place was geared up as a conference centre and not just a hotel - BUT i was very pleasantly suprised!The hotel itself is fairly understated, but the lobby is spacious and very quiet, with free internet access available. Our room was on the 6th floor and was huge. Massive bed, extra sofa, chair, desk, tables...everything. The room did overlook the breakfast hall  the back of the hotel (which at first i thought would be an issue as we would get woken up really early) but it was so quiet we slept in everyday!Breakfast was fine - basic but you can't really complain as its thrown in for free.The hotel is right next to the reknown John Hancock tower and just minutes from Copley square and Copley T stop.I loved Boston and this hotel made it even more of an enjoyable place to stay. There is absolutely no need to pay though the nose when this place serves your requirement just fine!A great little place to stay, and if i went back to Boston i would have no hesitations on staying here again.

<Content>Nice old hotel This is a nice old hotel. If you're looking for large rooms, this isn't the place. Rooms are very small, but clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful. It is walking distance to Copley square and the T. They serve a continental breakfast from 6:45AM to 10, consists of only cereal and rolls. There are some really good restaurants very close by. The price is good for the Boston area, but if you are looking for luxury this is not the place. I would probably stay here again.

<Content>OK for a night or two Perfect acceptable if drab. It's right in the middle of the Copley area, the rooms were clean, although it was very hard to find (it's off Stuart, at the entrance to a parking lot). Given the price, it did the job.

<Content>Basic Needs Met, Affordable in a City Where Hotels are Not There has always been a dearth of mid-range and affordable hotels in downtown Boston. When I visit Boston I usually stay at the CharlesMark or Newbury Guest House, but this summer both were booked. So I paid the John Hancock a visit.The building itself is quite nice, especially the lobby. The receptionists were polite, helpful and totally professional. My room was large. The furniture was basic. The air conditoning worked just fine on what were the typical Boston dog days in July. The room could have used a fresh coat of paint but was otherwise okay. There was no refrigerator, but there was an ice bucket in the room and an ice machine close by on my floor..I would stay there again and am glad that there is now more competition in this price range. It is nothing special and will not impress your kids if you are looking for a place for a special family vacation, but will work for a business traveller or tourists who would rather spend their money on sightseeing, dining and shopping.

<Content>Zero ambience but it's an OK 2.5 star This hotel has zero ambience and needs a good sprucing up. The lobby looks nice, the staff is fairly pleasant and make an effort to add some kind of personality to the place, but the rooms are from about 1987 and need a good coat of paint and some new decor/furniture. The carpeting (in my room) was old and worn.The bathroom looks like something out of a dorm and has awful flourescent light. But it is clean and has basic accomodations. The bed was good and hard (my pref.) and there was an extra pillow and blanket in a zippered plastic case in the closet. No fridge - ice bucket only. Vending machine downstairs. Laundry facilities on each floor w/ice machines. The free continental breakfast was ok but it would be nice if they had more tables in case you'd like to stay. Free USA Today papers.The ac is adjustable and I could open my window about 1 inch. Cable TV w/about 20 stations.The hotel/former conf. ctr. is connected to a parking garage and on a side street behind Boston's tall Hancock tower. Kind of hard to find but not impossible. There is a Dunkin Donuts on the front street and a gym on the opposite corner. Very close to Copley Sq. and about 3 blocks to the train. It's around the corner from the hotel Jury's.I booked through Hotwire and paid $105 per night - very low price for 4th of July wknd in Boston. If you can handle a no frills experience and your looking for a central place to crash, this is a good bargain. But if you are looking for a pleasurable stay and fancy digs you can brag about, this is not the place for you.

<Content>Old, cheap, not fun Well, for starters, the hotel is hard to get into if you are driving. The entrance is off a deadend street near an alley, there is no place to park out front to unload bags, no one to help you with your bags, and you have to go up two short flights of stairs to reach the lobby. The hotel is old and needs a renovation. My wife and I checked in for two nights. The hotel was picked by others who planned the conference I attended near the hotel. The wardrobe, which doubled as the TV stand had its doors removed. Bring your flipflops as the carpet in the room and tile in the bathroom are both old and worn, dirty. The air vents, especially the one in the shower, was disgusting and looked to have not been cleaned in 50 years. The hallways stunk of bleach. Very unpleasant if you are on vacation and are planning on relaxing in the room. Not bad for a business overnight or someone on a real tight budget. The hotel staff were very nice.

<Content>Good location and price (for boston at least) Don't stay here if you're a hotel snob. If you're looking for just a place to stay at night, this place fits the bill. Its one of the cheapest places you'll find at one of the most ideal locations in Boston. Its central located in a great neighborhood where you have easy access to the rest of the city by foot or by T. The Hotel is old so it definitely needs renovating. The rooms and hallways are outdated and facilities are just okay. I found the service to extremely nice and helpful. The free wi-fi access really helped out. You're certainly not going to get the frills that you would get a big hotel chain, but then again you're going to pay $50-$100 more a night at one of these chains. I'd certainly stay here again if I needed to be centrally located in Boston and knew I only needed a place to crash at night.

<Content>ughhhhh -you have got to be kidding where to start:the positive;it is located in an area easy to do some nice shopping ,go to pubs ands restos and the area is enjoyable and charming.cons:the same cannot be said for the surly very sullen staff woman at the desk when there was a problem with our bill and refused to contact the manager -because apparently the manager only works mon-fri -not the weekends,blah blah blah. she was very reluctant and resistant.My oh my was she not a happy camper.to a point its not her fault -she doesnt get paid enough anyway-its really a reflection of the corporation itself.note: basically this is not a 'regular run ' style hotel. think of it as having a landlord who contracts out workers and its being (barely) run like an apartment building. hotel room; scruffy at best ,worn out dingy scratched , holes in the walls due to shelves and wires changed in placement and the staff did not bother to replaster and paint. over.you can hear your neighbors.bathtub was not too clean (helloooooooo- some Javex would santize things)frankly I have stayed at the crappy youth hostel in manhatten and this hotel managed to badly remind me of that experience.at around $160 US dollars a nite that is an expensive reminder.waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpriced for this junk.go to a youth hostel i(except for the one in manhatten -lol )nstead they will be cleaner than this place and feel more luxurious.breakfast -if you got there early enough. decent for what they had on offer.croissants, danishs, bagels.cereals, coffee tea,juice-like stuff. lots of fruits. although the bad part is they had a ' temptation fridge'nice 'dole' brand fruit juices and various yoghurts. it was always locked! could never get one product.very very strange.I was there for a small convention and we used the various rooms there for classes and demos and I will say I did like those rooms and such.they were spacious, sunny ,comfortable. but the place was barely heated .I felt frozen half the time.but overall the 'hotel' feels like 1.it was in its prime and popular over 15 years ago2. it was converted from perhaps an apartment or condo project3. management is not doing good because the staff is really really really showing it.4. for gawds sakes renovate. already!I swear the youth hostels are in way better condition than this place.

<Content>Nice hotel in Back Bay Hotel staff were very friendly. The lobby is classic/ornate, with a little section for guests to use the computer/Internet. This is not a cookie-cutter hotel. The rooms are named after various famous New Englanders and the halls are lined with paintings of historic personages such as Francis Scott Key, Patrick Henry, and George Gershwin. The room was nicely appointed and pleasant, with a big window overlooking the Hancock Tower.Continental breakfast was average and stopped at 9:30 AM. Otherwise, no restaurant on the premises. It offers Dining In where you can order delivery from various restaurants. However, it's right in the Back Bay and walking distance to Hard Rock, Bertuccis and many other places.

<Content>Seen it's Better Days I stayed for one night as a stopover between London and returning home to Maine. I had a smoking room on the 8th floor. The room was quite large and nicely appointed, but a bit scruffy around the edges. The walls were scuffed up, the hallways could have used some refurbishing. The bed was big and clean (I checked before I went in), but the carpets were filthy, as if they had been sprayed with Febreeze every day or something. They felt creepy/greasy underfoot and I used purell on my feet after my first barefoot trip across the room. I then wore my flip flops because I was really worried that there might be something nasty I could pick up from them. The hotel is in a perfect location though, right next to the Hancock Tower near Trinity church. I do feel that I'll stay somewhere else next time. This hotel could use a good cleaning and a coat of paint.

<Content>Nice place to stay We stayed here for 5 nights. The staff are really friendly and helpful, the room was spotless. The location of this hotel is so great. Its close to shops, restuarants, nightlife, cinema, tourist attraction and there is a subway stop 2mins walk away. You also get a free breakfast, bagels, cereal, juice, tea/coffee etc. As much as you want to eat. I would definately recommend this hotel to my friends for the location and friendly atmosphere.

<Content>Not worth it We checked our bed when we first arrived to make sure it was clean. When my husband pulled back the mattress we saw a 3 inch wide strip of dirt, dust, and hair from one side of the bed to the other. We asked the cleaning staff to clean it for us, and she quickly did. Still, we were a bit bothered by it and asked the front desk staff to change rooms. The night staff said it wouldn't be a problem and that we could switch in the morning. The next morning we again asked the staff and neither worker knew what we were talking about. We explained the situation and were told that we had one of the better rooms and that switching was not something they could do for us. Later, one worker said we could switch to another room, but that it would be smaller. As for the continental breakfast and complimentary paper, get them early because if you don't, you're out of luck for both and the staff will not get anything for you. Plus, there was a 1:00 am fire alarm that required the hotel to evacuate. Later we were told it was due to a faulty sensor that was triggered by the ventilation system.The hotel badly needs to be renovated. The hallway wallpaper was ripped and scratched and there were missing paintings on our floor. Our room had chipped paint, stained carpeting, and scuff marks all over the walls. The hotel also suffers from thin walls. You can hear everything in the rooms around you.

<Content>Nice location One of the cheaper places to stay in Boston and centrally located. My husband and I had never been to Boston and wanted to stay in the city and were on a budget. The hotel is in a great location and proximity to everything. If you walk the Freedom Trail, the end of it is far away (Bunker Hill). Close to Newbury St. and everything else. The rooms are small, but that is okay. The walls need to be painted in the hallways (or re-wallpapered) and in the rooms...a lot of scuff marks from suitcases... staff is really nice and attentive. They let you leave your suitcases in a secured room so you can see the city, which was really nice. We also had a problem with people smoking pot in the room next to us and the hotel staff took care of it right away. There is a continental breakfast as well :) Great experience!

<Content>Great deal for the price My husband and I stayed at this hotel the week before we got married. The staff was very friendly and knew a lot about the area. We were on the 6th floor, and we were in a suite which is just a standard sized-room with a small amount of extra square footage where a couch sits. It cost the same as a regular room though, so we were happy to have it.The decor was definitely not modern - it had a grandma's house kind of feel. It was clean, but not terribly impressive. The tub was chipped and there was a hole in the wall behind the bathroom door. Oh goodness that bathroom was TINY. However, the water pressure was great and everything worked fine.The closet was large and stocked with more than a dozen hangers. That was nice. In the morning they had a free continental breakfast which was okay. We ate it a few times and were happy. It did get repetitive though, since there is no meat or eggs - just rolls and muffins. Other days we went right around the corner to Dunkin Donuts (SUPER long line) and once we went to the Firefly Cafe which was the absolute BEST.It's located in a great part of town and we could get to everything we needed to very easily, both by walking and by riding the T. We would stay here again with no hesitation. However, I would not bring people here if I were trying to impress them. But it's a great hotel for the price!

<Content>Best Value in Boston For the money I think this is the best value in Boston. Our room rate for a Saturday night was just $99.00. The rooms could do with a little updating but everything was clean and comfortable and the staff was very friendly and accomodating. Any other hotel in the Copley Square area would probably cost at least 3 times as much. Overall clean, comfortable and cheap.

<Content>Not Recommended If I am in Boston again I will not be staying here, the rooms are tiny, so small that I had to climb across the bed to get into my side it was pinned to one of the walls. The view was a multi storey car park and there were no coffee making facilities and the entire building is in need of refurbishment and some TLC.The location is good and the staff are OK but its just not worth the money 鈥?even if it is one of Boston鈥檚 cheaper hotels.

<Content>Great for the price! We stayed here for four nights in February and were pleasantly surprised. I chose the John Hancock mainly for the price ($99 a night), but the location was also excellent. It's right next to the BackBay Station, which we came into from the airport, and behind the John Hancock Tower. There are many other T-stops nearby and tons of good restaurants, especially Skip Jacks. We had a large corner room (#729) that had a very comfortable queen bed and a loveseat with a coffee table. The loveseat was a bit worn, the bathroom was small, the windows didn't open and the room was hot (we had to turn on the AC), but it was extremely quiet! I don't know whether we just lucked out and there wasn't much going on there that weekend, or if it's always that quiet, but it was great. They also had a nice continental breakfast available. The hotel does need some painting and touchup work, but I definitely recommend this hotel for the budget traveler and we will definitely stay there again next year!

<Content>Not bad for the price I stayed at this hotel on a week-long business trip at the end of November, and it was a fairly good deal for this area and time of year.At $129 I wouldn't call it cheap, but it was by far the most reasonable I saw anywhere near the Hynes Convention Centre. The rooms were definitely not large but I'm used to European hotels, so it seemed fine to me. For such a large city the price was also okay.The hotel staff were helpful and friendly while I was there; the hotel lobby is nice and the free high-speed internet access was a bonus (though it would've been nicer if they'd had it in the rooms).Breakfast was nothing special, but free and convenient so much appreciated.The hotel was a bit more run-down than I'd expected, and not as clean, which was the biggest problem for me and the only real complaint I have.

<Content>Great location This is a small hotel in a great location. The price was great. The room was a little small, but very clean. The complimentary breakfast only consisted of sweet rolls, bagels, juice, fruit and coffee, but was adequate. I cannot stress enough what a great location it was. You can walk to Prudential Center, Public Gardens, Cheers, etc. and the T stop is only two blocks away, right through the park at Trinity Church. We had a great time.

<Content>No Problems Stayed here two nights Oct 19-20, 2005 and tend to agree with most of the previous reviews. I stayed here primarily for the location, being just a block off Copley Square and also because I couldn鈥檛 find availability for anything cheaper in the area. It was $149 per night (before taxes) but other hotels were more. My room was ready early (11:30 am) and was a good size and actually had a nice view facing south. The double bed was comfortable and the bathroom facilities were certainly adequate. I couldn鈥檛 figure out how to turn on the heat but once under the thick blankets didn鈥檛 really need to. The entrance is a bit difficult to find but leaving Copley Square, cross Stuart on Trinity Place and it鈥檚 there on the left. No sign really. Free typical continental breakfast, good selection if you get there early. The hotel was good for me and I would stay there again.

<Content>No frills hotel Booked at relatively short notice in the peak, fall season this was one of the most expensive hotels we've ever stayed in. But then Boston is a very expensive city. 2 star is about right...no frills and shabby but staff are friendly and the location is very good. Local parking is expensive... best option is not to have a car whilst in Boston. Driving or more accurately navigating around Boston is very difficult.

<Content>There's a reason it's cheap We spent three nights here and booked it because of other somewhat favorable reviews but I would not recommend it unless you really can't find anything else for the price.It's outdated and cramped. We booked a Queen sized bed that turned out to be a double and that was what all the rooms had. The breakfast was mediocre but better than nothing if you're traveling on a shoestring.The hotel needs updating or even a really good cleaning.

<Content>An Okay Place We booked this hotel because of the location and the price was less than most. The location was great, close walking distance to anywhere you want to go. The price was less then most hotels we checked out, but for the price, the room was small and the bathroom was somewhat inconvienent with no hooks or shelves. The staff was friendly for the most part.

<Content>great inexpensive Boston lodging! Just wanted to share an opinion about the John Hancock Confrence Center. We just stayed there and loved it. It is a perfect location near Copley Plaza, very convenient to the T, shopping and Back Bay area. The room was clean and decent size. There is a small continental breakfast. For the price it is a great deal....

<Content>perfect location I booked this hotel through Continental Airlines Home page a month before we left home. When I arrived in the pouring rain with my two children, the hotel had no record of our reservation what so ever. They where fully booked. I had reserved a 2 twin bed, room with an additional roll away bed.  The staff at the front desk called other hotels near by to try and find a room. There was nothing availabe for under $350 per night any where near by. They felt so sorry for us that they somehow gave us a room! Wish I had gotten someones name to send a Thank You card.  Just like all of the reviews I read, I agree the location was perfect. The room and breakfast where just fine for what we paid. It did take a little work to convince the taxi driver that a Hotel acctualy existed in the conferece center. After reading reviews about how to locate the front door I was prepaired for that. I would definately stay there again.  I would however call ahead to make sure I realy have a reservation!

<Content>Ideal for the traveller on a budget This hotel is nothing to look from outside and the entrance is a bit austere.However, we cannot complain at the accommodation which, whilst being a bit basic (what was that elephant tape covering above the bath?), is clean and surprisingly quiet.The hotel is superbly situated around the corner from Copley Square and close to the Prudential Tower and all the shops.Breakfast, while not overly exciting was sufficient for our requirements. It was taken in one of the small lecture rooms and seemed to be like a library everyone was so quiet.Great facility whereby we could leave our bags all day as we had an evening flight.All-in-all a great place to lay your head when visiting Boston if you just want a base. I recommend this to anyone.

<Content>No frills but Great. Price + Location = Great Value If you are in Boston, this is probably the best buy I have found. This has a very good location and is steps away from Copley Plaza and the Boston Subway system. (Which by the way is one of the safest and easiest to use in this country in my opinion outside of Washington, DC.) At any rate, here is the deal here...this place is definitely a budget hotel, and it may be a bit shabby, but if you are here to sightsee you don't want to stay in the room anyway. The rooms were clean, but small, with a double or queen bed, the bathrooms were clean but spartan. Basically everything was clean. There was some wear in the hotel, but nothing major. There is really nothing to do here but sleep.....that is, no lounge, no restaurant, etc. However, you are less than 1/2 block to the Fairmont. Stay here and go splurge there!!! (BTW Fairmont is GORGEOUS.) This is a bit far from some of the tourist locations, but as I said the subway is maybe 1 to 2 blocks, and for .75 it will take you anywhere you want to go. YES even the airport!!!!! Call the hotel and get the exact subway stop it is. I can't remember the exact name. Oh, it does have a continental breakfast. Not much, but its free. If you are expecting the Hilton or Hyatt, then go to them, and expect to pay in the $300 plus range. Boston is more expensive than New York. But if you want to pay less than $150 (tax included) this is the place for you. Check the discounters. You may be able to get it for less than the hotel's posted rates. Boston is very very walkable. If you don't mind walking you should walk whereever you go. Even the farthest things can be reached in a casual 1 hour walk. Don't expect a business center here, but you can go to the Fairmont and use the one they have. Oh, look for the entrance to this hotel. It is on a side street that leads to a parking garage. Little hard to find the right door!!!

<Content>What a deal!! Great price, great service, great location! What a gem of a hotel! If you are looking for the most bang for your travel buck, don't look any place else, stay here. We stayed here four nights and are happy we did!My daughter and I are traveling for college auditions, so price, value and location really matter. The school in Boston gave us a list of hotels but all were very pricey and some even had poor reviews. We found John Hancock online and took a chance based on the reviews, and we were NOT disappointed. In fact, we wish all the hotels we stayed at were this friendly and affordable.First of all, none of the pricey hotels even offered a hint of any free food. The Hancock served a complimentary continental breakfast including juice, fruit, bagels (with a toaster) and pastries. Some mornings were fresher than others but again, I must reiterate, at least this hotel offered something! Boston is a very expensive town so every little bit helps. They even provided cookies and hot cider in the lobby in the evening. What a nice surprise when you have been out all day and just need a little snack to get you to dinner! Next, I have to say that the room size was awesome! There are smaller rooms available here....I inspected one before checking in...but ours was terrific, very roomy. I even went down the street and asked to inspect a room at the Colonnade to compare. It had a very impressive lobby but the room was miniscule - and reception told me that they were showing me a upgraded room. They offered me the room at almost triple what I was paying at John Hancock! Next, the location is perfect. Even though it was not across the street from the audition, it didn't matter. It was just two stops away on the T. Trinity Church and the Boston Library are literally just one block over. Great location for seeing the sites. I was most impressed with the level of service from each and every hotel employee I met. When I called the front desk for assistance, I was addressed by name. (Nice, professional touch.) Everyone was extraordinarily courteous and helpful. Even though our room did not have a refrigerator, the staff offered to place something in the kitchen's refrigerator for me. How many pricey hotels do you know would do that for a guest? (without an attitude!) The hotel has no restaurant, but reception was quick to provide me with menus from delivery restaurants in the area. I can't stress enough that the staff was terrific! I hope their boss reads this and gives them all a bonus! They deserve it! They understand customer service and get an A+.Bottom line - If you are looking for a brand new hotel with all the bells and whistles, don't stay here. This place is NOT like that at all. This hotel is older and full of character. Some might say it needs updating but it is clean. I happen to like character, charm, and old fashioned hospitality over brand new, over priced and boring. Be careful.....You will barely notice the hotel from the street. There is no doorman, but once inside, you will be glad you found it. Bottom line - If you care how you spend your travel dollars, want a clean room with pleasant employees to make you feel at home, stay here.......If, however, you are impressed by a fancy front door and a lot of employees standing around looking for their next tip, stay across the street at The Plaza.
