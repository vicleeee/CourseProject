<Content>Hotel Meridiana My wife and I stayed at Hotel Meridiana for 4 nights the last week of November. We were with a tour group of about 50 people to mostly see Florence and surrounding areas. The hotel is a bit of a walk from the main downtown area of Florence...I'd guess about 30 minutes. If you're from the States, I'd say this is like a 3 star hotel, similar to a Super 8. It is definitely European style, which may be different than Americans are used to. It's clean, but older. The bathroom and shower are quite small, but adequate. Don't forget your electricty converter if you're going to use an electric shaver or curling iron. We didn't spend much time in the hotel, and it's definitely not a place to hang out, but then again there's so much to see in Florence that it would be a wast to stay in the room. The free breakfast is mostly breads, cereals, a little fruit and coffee and juice. Pretty good for a light breakfast. There aren't a whole lot of restuarants in the area, but we ventured a dozen blocks or so and found some quaint neighborhood restuarants. There's a grocery store about 2 blocks from the hotel where you can purchase about anything food or drink-wise. My overall impression was that the hotel was adequate, but not anything special.

<Content>Great hotel for the Price Hotel Meridiana is a great hotel. Extremely clean and only about a 10 minute ride from the railroad station. Our checkin was smooth, we got our rooms right away although we were very early. The rooms were very spacious and the bathroom was very clean. It's about a 20 minute walk to the main attractions such as il Duomo, you can also take the #1 or #7 bus as well and it leaves you right there in less than 10 minutes. My only complaints is that the breakfast was extremely poor. They only offer like bread, butter and cereal. But I do have to say for the price we paid it was definitely well worth it. There's a great supermarket about 2 blocks away that sells EVERYTHING!!!!Will I stay here again, ABSOLUTELY!!!!

<Content>Within easy walking distance of main attractions Have just returned from a tour of some of Italy's main cities, and stayed at this hotel during our stop in Florence. Clean and adequate rooms, food good, staff very helpful, and as for the location it is an easy 20-30 minute walk into the central of Florence. Would recommend it to friends.

<Content>Close but Loud We stayed here as part of the Cosmos Splendors of Italy tour. The hotels are average, probably 3-4 star European Ratig, probably a 2-3 start American Rating.we checked into the Meridiana, which was a nice hotel located about a 45 minute walk from the main attractions of Florence. Since we were tired, we decided to eat in the hotel that night, we had a casual dinner and went to bed really early. Dinner was just average. The hotel had a larger shower, allowing me to finally shave my legs and a full size bed. The room was again warm, and we had to sleep with the windows open. Since this hotel is located right on a main street, we had the opportunity to hear many fans cheering for a big soccer game that was going on. It was a little loud and our next door neighbor liked to sing very loudly out his window.

<Content>nice hotel for the price went to MERIDIANE a little apprehensive after reading reviews but was pleasantly surprised. Hotel was clean and tidy, front staff were excellent especially the guy who was on in the evening (sorry never remembered his name). Bedrooms were big enough and warm, bathroom was spotless but a little small but that was not a problem would certainly go again, a little out of the tourist area,but an ample bus service made the Attractions feel quite local. excellent value for money

<Content>Great stay in Florence The hotel was a bit of a walk from the center of town, but it was charming and gave us good exercise. We walked into town every day and just took a cab back at night. The front desk staff was very nice. The rooms were a good size and condition. The breakfast was ok, but it was free which was nice. We would stay again for a good price!

<Content>Great value, location to be desired The only problem with this hotel is the location. It is very far north of the city, about a 30 min walk to sites. We were up for it, but for those with physical problems, it would be a problem. The hotel was clean, staff was friendly, rooms were more than adequate. The shower was CRAMPED but clean. Breakfast was adequate--cereal, milk, coffee, croissants, packaged toast, jelly, cheese. Internet access cost 2 euro for 30 min, so good rate. Certainly adequate for our needs, and a good price.

<Content>First-Class Service for Economy Price!! My mother and I traveled to Italy for Thanksgiving week in November, and stayed the first part of our trip at the Meridiana in Florence. What a wonderful surprise!The only time I've had service this gracious and helpful, and always correct, was when I've stayed at a Ritz-Carlton. The front-desk staff was wonderful in helping us- check-in early  leave our luggage safely, so that we could go out and enjoy the day in the heart of the city- stay on top of our luggage that was lost by the airline- call taxis quickly (essential when not staying on top of the Duomo in Florence)- provide (!) appropriate postage for overseas postcards, etc.They even offered to make us martinis when we were rather desperate for a cocktail after a long day. The internet available in the lobby is easy to use, and the staff (again) quite helpful in connecting you. While we had already made day tour arrangements and other plans, options were available and easy to peruse/compare, and it was nice to know that, had we not been able to do all that in advance, we could have done so there quite easily.I worried that our Italian was pathetic (which it still is) and yet the staff at the Meridiana was patient and helpful, and wonderfully fluent in English when we faltered in our Italian attepmts. The breakfast was generous, and started early enough in the day so you could really be out and about early enough to beat the crowds. Our room was clean, the bathroom large and generously appointed (especially with extra toiletries, thanks again for that lost luggage Alitalia!), and we had a lovely window to open out onto the boulevard.Truly a wonderful stay for a great price, and we would definitely go back again! Thank you, Meridiana!

<Content>Bad experience A group of 6 of us stayed at this hotel during a Cosmos tour. When the travel agent says the hotels are not as nice as Globus tours-BELIEVE THEM-and if you are over 20 years of age GO WITH THE BETTER HOTELS!! Bare floors, small showers, no tubs, and cots for beds remind me of a youth hostel. The breakfast is nothing but carbs with Italian Tang for juice. My advice-do not stay here!

<Content>Great service! The first time I stayed here I was studying abroad with a group of other college students. The location was good because although it was not in the center of Florence, it was a quick bus ride away and had enough around it to stay busy for the summer. The next few times I went to Florence I also picked the Meridiana because of the great service. I became friends with most of the friendly staff, and now return not only to see the city but also the people!

<Content>Far from the Center where there are lots more options La Meridiana is a 25 minute walk from the center of town. It doesn't have many amenities and its rooms are much like an old, outdated American Motel 6. It is not situated near any attractions whatsoever, nor any restaurants or anything desireable to see in Florence. There are plenty of other places to stay much closer to the Duomo and major sites, which I believe do not cost that much more (and would be worth the extra money).

<Content>Okay We stayed here with a Cosmos tour group. The rooms were small to average size, and a little shabby. The shower was a 3'X3' stall with glass doors. Way too small. We had a street facing room and there was a lot of traffic noise. Beds are comfortable and the room was clean. The staff was very friendly. Breakfast was the usuall continental with the worst coffee I had in Italy. An easy bus ride to the Duomo.We liked Alfredo's pizzaria down the street. Strongly recommend the salmon pasta. There's another restaurant across the steet that many liked. I had the veal there and didn't care for it.

<Content>Good value base, BUT.... This review turns on to what extent you can hold a hotel responsible for its guests, or, perhaps, how it is sold by tour operators.Of itself the Meridiana is fine; a decent, value for money hotel perhaps just a bit further out from the centre than ideal but providing a good base for Florence  day trips elsewhere in Tuscany. We emailed ahead to ask whether they provided tea/coffee making facilities in the room [they don't]  to ensure we got a non-smoking room [we did]. Arrival, reception were fine; we had a cosy room on the back of the hotel, very quiet  with a great shower. Jumping ahead somewhat breakfast was basic but ok.And then the school trip arrived. There are a couple of earlier posts on this but nothing could have prepared us for this.We'd gone to bed fairly early [1030] so with the arrival of a coach load of Italian school kids a few minutes later we were prepared for half an hour or so of bedding down; at 1115 we went into the corridor  asked the group immediately outside our door to be quiet; at 1145, ditto, but this time to a teacher who seemed to think his responsibilities were limited to shrugging his shoulders. At 0015 to the night manager, who'd already been up to see the teachers following other guests  again at 0045. Each intervention damped it down but after 10 -15 minutes it would start over, with shouting, door slamming  thumping up  down the corridors for most of the night. Next morning the staff were apologetic,  said they were moving to the 5th floor [We were on 3] they had read the teachers the riot act  invited us to call them as soon as we heard anything unacceptable. We can't speak for people on the 4th  5th but the last 2 nights passed off quietly.Judged against reception, facilities, value  nights 2  3 I'd post this as a 4; with the 1st night we've gone for a 2. To be fair, I think the hotel did pretty much all they could that night  maybe this was a particularly bad group. The issue I think is in how this place is sold by itself  tour operators; we called our company the next morning because we couldn't have endured another night like the first. If your operator or the hotel can guarantee its a hotel not a hostel then you'll be well satisfied - but do check!

<Content>Tourist Style Hotel - Convenient to main Bus Routes The Meridiana is a modern hotel situated on the outskirts of the City. It is however easily accessed via several popular bus routes, which run dusk to dawn; the bus stop is within 100 yds of the Hotel. (3 day passes cost 12 euro) Rooms are comfortable and well appointed and ours was double glazed which prevented traffic sound from the very busy adjacent road. Public spaces are well lit and bright but have a somewhat 'utility' feel including the breakfast room. Breakfast was an adequate continental one.The area around the hotel only has a few restaurants to choose from and we would recommend the five-minute bus journey to the centre for more choice. An evening trip to Fiesole on bus 7, which again runs past the hotel, gives a panorama view of the city and also has some nice restaurants. The hotel has a very small bar but we did manage to find a German Beer Hall tucked in a side street behind the hotel, very enjoyable!All in all an ideal hotel to spend a few days exploring the delights of Florence.

<Content>Not Bad! We stayed at The Meridiana Hotel in Florence recently on our Cosmos Essential Italy tour. This hotel was centrally located and was about a 20-25 minute walk to the main Piazza. Our room was a little small but doable. Breakfast was not bad. They had a selection of cereal, breads, yogurt, fresh fruit, juice and coffee or tea. Reception staff was friendly and helpful. There were a couple of restaurants within a two block area to the right of the hotel. We ate a couple of times at the Pegasus(sp) which was across the street and to your right. Make sure you visit the Pitti Palace. It was not included in the Cosmos' tour.

<Content>Disappointing stay My husband and I stayed at the Merdiana for 4 night in the first week of July, having spent the previous week in Paris. After arriving at the hotel and then going for a stroll around the vicinity of the hotel we were feeling pretty disappointed.The hotel itself is very basic/budget style accommodation. It's not in a great location and is about a 20 to 30 minute walk to town before you can begin to start to see the sights. The hotel does have air conditioning which was a real plus but rooms aren't sound proof (which is a factor given the hotel is a on a busy road and you can hear people talking outside your room).In the foyer there is a small (and I mean small) bar area and some old couches and a small TV. At the bar you can buy water and drinks but that's about the limit of the hotel facilities. Breakfast was included in our package but the breakfast room and breakfast was so depressing we only went the one morning.If you're looking purely for somewhere to sleep with no frills then this hotel would be okay but we were after a few comforts.

<Content>Rather disappointing The room was ok but the bathroom could use some renovation as it made a bit of a worn out impression. Staff was friendly and helpful and by thus the main asset of this hotel. Main problem was the presence of several EF student groups. Their running from one room to the other created troubles for us to fall asleep. We sometimes had the impression of being lodged in a youth hostel instead of a three star hotel. A quiet breakfast was also out of the question since these students began their noise making again at the breakfast table. Breakfast itself was rather limited in choice but the cookies are nice though :) . Meridiana, maybe you should decide whether you continue lodging large groups of youngsters or not? If yes, maybe it's better to focus on this market entirely and announce this in your hotel info.We would not stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Don't stay overnight in Florence. We decided to stay one night in Florence to get the most of the absurdly few hours we could spend in the city. We stayed at this hotel after much searching. It's quite a walk from the center and tourist places. It's in a commercial part of the city with little in the way of tourist services and with many busy streets. Our room faced the busy street, which was noisy. We had to leave early to catch a train, and the evening staff agreed to set up some early breakfast substitute for us, but in the morning, there was nothing for us. We had to take a taxi to the airport, which was expensive considering the early hour. The room was nice, standard hotel fare, but who's going to stay in their room awake in Florence? Our conclusion was, do not stay overnight in Florence. Stay in a small manageable place that's an easy train ride away.

<Content>Nice Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Meridiana for 3 nights at the end of March. We found the rooms to be very clean and pleasant. The hotel was in a perfect location as it was about a 15 minute walk from the main attractions. This meant the streets were quieter and not as busy as they are at the heart of Florence.The staff were very friendly and helpful. The only disappointing part of the stay was the breakfast, as there wasn't a lot of choice. However, this did not spoil our stay and if we were to go back to Florence we would stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Ideal Base Hotel Meridiana is an excellent choice for a trip to Florence.It's around a 15 minute walk from all the main sights, making it a little quieter that the main part of town.There is also a bus which runs from outside the hotel straight into town in around 2 minutes if you don't fancy the walk.The hotel is clean and the rooms are fairly spacious. The staff are all really friendly, especially the desk clerks.When I asked for directions on my first day, the clerk brought out a map and proceeded to guide me to my destination. He then went on to recommend other areas of interest as well as good restaurants to eat in. He marked all the areas on the map, then gave me the map to keep.Excellent service.The breakfasts are fine too, and the coffee is the best I've tasted.Overall, I would recommend this hotel and would definately go back there again.

<Content>It's clean, safe and quiet and I'd stay there again. Stayed here as part of a package. It's about a 15-20 minute walk to the city center, you go past the Academy where the Statue of David is. The rooms are small but comfortable and the bath is nice. Breakfast is ok but the coffee was wonderful. If you're on a budget or part of a package this is definitely an OK place to stay and would do so again.

<Content>Good quiet location within walking Distance of Attractions Clean and comfortable beds. Top floor room was very small but had balcony with view of mountains and city. Staff was helpful. Stayed one week with my wife. Found a great bakery/delicatesen just down the street. Used that and and a nearby supermarket for most of our eating. There was a nice restaurant several bloocks east. Would not recommend Alfredo's down the street. Expensive fillbelly. Continental breakfast was satisfactory but limited. We were glad to be away from the noise and crush of tourists downtown at night. Walked everywhere north of the river. Would probably use again, since hotels are primarily for sleeping. Loved Florence and the art scene!!!

<Content>Not bad Hotel was about 20-25 minute walk to the centre of Florence. The room was clean, with a good shower and the staff were friendly. The only downside were the banging of doors late at night and in the early hours from other guests 'coming and going'. It did get on your nerves after a while and stopped a good nights sleep. Probably wouldn't stay here again for that reason.

<Content>Too far from the Centre Staye here for three nights in July 05. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Hotel and room (on top floor) clean and of good size. It's main problem was it was too far out of the centre of Florence.The Hotel is situated is a predominantly residential area of Florence and concequently lacks any atmosphere.There were very few restaurants to choose from with only one decent restaurant (Alfredo's) at the end of the street. The breakfast room in the basement reminded me of a school dinner hall. Breakfast choice was basic but none the less edible.Unless you are on a tight budget - look elsewhere.

<Content>Acceptable but would look for somewhere esle next time An average one overall. Nice and clean but rooms are on the small side. Bathrooms have apparently just been renovated but not other areas. Breakfast OK, great cappuccino but you will have to wait in a queue to order over the counter.The night we arrived the coffee machine at the mini-bar next to the reception broke down. No drinkable hot water and the man on night shift asked us to use those from the basin!Price and surrounding reasonable. Do not recommend walking. Bus nos. 1  7 take you to the centre in less than 10 minutes. Taxi should cost no more than 10 euros without luggage.

<Content>Nice place! Overall a nice place...clean, comfortable and the staff was helpful. It is walking distance to the sites, but the bus is also convenient. The breakfast was nothing great and the dining area not the most appealing.

<Content>Reasonable budget hotel Stayed here for a week at the end of April 2005. Rooms are tiny compared to American standards BUT definitely average for European budget hotel. Our room and bathroom were neat and clean. This hotel is not centrally located but is a pleasant walk (15min-30min depending to where) from pretty much anything that you'd want to see. There are also many buses 1, 7, 12, 13 that run often and whose schedules are posted that take you to all the sights under 5-10min. I think the front desk sells bus tickets and there is a tobacco shop a block away that does too. Breakfast is buffet style - croissants, rolls, cereal, juice adn coffee/tea. If you get tired of it, there are a multitude of pastry stores nearby. There is also a grocery store a block away. My only complaint was that 2 of the nights, there was a tour of young girls on our floor who ran around yelling til the wee hours of the morning. We did complain and they were less loud but walls are thin- you can hear doors opening and closing and people in the hallway. After they left, it was quiet so was more a problem with the guests than hotel. This is definitely a more than adequate hotel for those on a budget.

<Content>Definitely a good choice for Florence My girlfriend and I just spent 3 nights in the hotel as part of a package trip. The hotel staff was definitely helpful and more than willing to go out of their way to help with anything. As everyone else has said, the Meridiana is a nice little walk North of town, but nothing to bad. Additionally, the restaurant down 2 blocks towards the circle is awesome! It was the best retaurant we ate at the whole time we were in Italy. The rooms at the Meridiana were very nice sized for a European hotel, although the shower was extremely tiny (i bumped the shower handle multiple times with my arm and froze with cold water). The one problem I would mention, is that the only way to lock the room we were in was by a keyed deadbolt, therefore, if an emergency you would have to unlock the door with a key. Additionally, 2 days we came back and found our room unlocked. These were both minor problems, but, could have turned into major problems. Overall, I thought the service and hotel were above average and would recommend the Meridiana for a traveller on a budget to Florence.

<Content>Good Hotel This is a nice hotel, with a free breakfast buffet and comfortable beds. It is not centrally located -- to go to town without exhausiting yourself, you need to take the (quite frequent) bus 1 and 7. Hotel staff was friendly, but do not take the advice to walk to downtown. Buy a bus pass. Hotel is on a main street, but the rooms were quiet.One thing to note -- the shower was quite small. Plenty of hot water, though.

<Content>Nice Modest Hotel We just returned from Italy which included a stay at this Hotel. The rooms are modest but we had a beautiful hillside view from our huge window and the room was always spotless. They have a nice breakfast room downstairs with all your basic European breakfast needs, including fresh made cappucinos. This was all included in price of room. Location is a bit out of the way but bus stop on corner takes you right to Duomo. Also there are 2 wonderful restaurants on same street, we asked at the desk and they made reservations for us. Nice place to stay.

<Content>A little out of the way for old legs Our stay, March 4-7, 2005, Florence being a walking town, we did our share. This hotel was a pretty good distance from the sights, although we did do a lot of walking to and fro and a bit of cab rides. As far as the hotel, it was clean, big rooms, big baths, the breakfast was very good. The staff was helpful. The airline lost all our luggage,but we all got it by the second day, it is amazing what you can survive without. Around the corner is a grocery for water,etc., a bank atm on the next corner, plenty of restaurants around the hotel. We took cabs from the airport and cost 12 euros. We had two doubles and a triple. Traffic noise muffled by the windows, so maybe double paned. This hotel was part of our package so I am not sure of the price, but most likely budget. If you cab it everywhere or can walk easily, stay here,otherwise, find a hotel closer in to Florence.
