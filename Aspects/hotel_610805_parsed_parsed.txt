<Content>Location Location Location This was our second holiday in Bali and we decided to spend more time in Ubud than we did the last time when we stayed in the beautiful, but artificial Nusa Dua. We chose well. What a beautiful hotel this is. The layout and accommodation is absolutely stunning and right slap bang in the middle of working rice fields gives the place a feel of being part of Bali rather than just visiting which is what we were looking for: Extreme luxury, but deeply embedded in the land. The shuttle takes just over 5 mins to get to the centre of Ubud and a bit longer to get back as Ubud is a one way circle in the centre and runs on the hour. During those 5 mins on the shuttle you pass the entrance to the Monkey Forest in case you want to stop off and take a wander there which is well worthwhile. We never walked into Ubud from the hotel, but I reckon it would take 20-25 mins for an average speed walker to get to the central drop off point (the sister hotel) if you follow the route of the shuttle. If on the other hand when you exit the hotel you turn right and right again you can walk into the Monkey Forest from the back gate in about 10 minutes and a further 5 mins to the centre. There is also much less traffic on this back route. We had already booked this hotel before the review of the 24th August about the lax security. Sadly it concerned us and I wonder if we would have booked the hotel having read that report. We were so glad we had already booked the hotel as it turned out and feel saddened how one persons review can so easily damage an up and coming beautiful hotel such as this one. The reviewers complaint about the view from his villa isn鈥檛 reasonable in my opinion. Yes that part of the rice field is small, but its stepped and fully visible from the terrace with a view that I sincerely believe most people would have loved. In fact if I were ranking the view from that villa I would say it had the second best view of rice field in the hotel. Other than the entrance with tight security we didn鈥檛 see much evidence of patrolling, but its clear there were plenty of staff around the hotel and in my opinion you should see for yourself what a wonderful place the hotel is. Moving on. We had the top of the range pool villa which was truly magnificent. Every amenity in a deluxe environment and beautifully clean and classy. Lots of storage space鈥?My wife was able to hang up all her clothes which is highly unusual!The villa also had two little ponds separated by the outside tub. Both ponds full of small fish which was a major bonus. Feeding them with bits of bread from breakfast鈥?.They spend half their time biting your fingers, but it feels like tickling. The inside shower had a floor to ceiling window looking out on the outside shower and one of the little ponds. Likewise the separate toilet had a glass wall looking on the other pond. Really quite gorgeous and restful. The restaurant has a sophisticated look downstairs and a more casual feel upstairs on the balcony 鈥?which has absolutely fantastic views of rice fields. A clever part of the design of the resort is having a couple of rice fields in the central area of the hotel for everyone to admire. A stroll round the entire grounds takes about half an hour if you investigate every nook and cranny鈥hich we did. Beautiful walkways with lovely planting and clever architecture. There was a library, table tennis, pool and a large (and cold!) swimming pool, plus an area for afternoon tea. We used the spa a couple of times and thoroughly enjoyed that too. Breakfast was nothing special, but the outlook over the rice fields was amazing. We lingered long over breakfast just enjoying the serenity and magnificent views inside and outside the hotel. Lunch and dinner could be served in the more sophisticated section downstairs and was accompanied by live local music which we also enjoyed. The staff throughout the hotel were really nice and helpful. Maybe not as clone trained as many top resorts, but because they were such beautiful people their natural niceness shone through. This is one of the best hotels you could ever wish to relax in. Go try it out.

<Content>Best hotel we stayed at in Bali! At first, I was a bit hesitant booking a hotel that was 15 minutes away from the main area of Ubud. But my husband and I were on our honeymoon and wanted to splurge on a private villa, with a pool and outdoor tub and shower. And for under $200/night, it was definitely a steal!When we arrived at our villa, we were very very impressed. The room was surrounded by windows, with a pond that wrapped around the villa. Our bedroom overlooked the pool area that had a small cabana area and just behind the bedroom was the outdoor tub. The tub was definitely bliss and relaxing. Unfortunately, I had broke the ceramic bottle of bath foam and had to pay $10. =( Outside of the villa was very nicely landscaped with huge lotus flowers ponds and fountains. Breakfast brunch had an amazing view of the rice paddies. Really beautiful morning to wake up to! Some of the other great qualities about this hotel: Staff is extremely friendly and very accommodating. They have convenient shuttle vans that go to and from Ubud Resort to Hotel on Monkey Forest Road every hour between 9am to 9pm (except 1pm). They can drop you off at your destination if it's around the main Ubud area and pick you up at the Ubud Hotel. They can also arrange drivers to take you around the area. For 350,000 rupiahs (roughly $40 USD), we had a private 3.5 hour tour guide. We also paid this amount to take us back to DPS airport. Because Ubud Resort is slightly farther away, you may have to pay about 40,000 to 50,000 rupiahs to get back to the resort if not using the shuttle. However, anything can be bargained in Ubud and was able to go as low as 30,000 rup. Other than that, I don't think there is anything negative I can say about this hotel. I would 100% recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good value rooms but poor security 鈥?while we were asleep our room was burgled Obviously having our room burgled while we slept negatively affected our experience . To give a balanced review let me share our thoughts both before and after our unlucky time. It鈥檚 a long review 鈥?if you don鈥檛 have time to get the whole picture jump to the last couple of paragraphs.Before the robbery: Our first impressions of the resort were that it is secluded and peaceful and the rooms, without question, are beautiful and great value for money. We were on our honeymoon and were looking for two things: a touch of luxury and the 鈥淰iew Directly To Swaying Rice Field Of Ubud And Landscaped Garden鈥?as promised in the description on Expedia. When we arrived we were told we had been upgraded which obviously sounds great and when we saw the room we had mixed feelings 鈥?it was truly magnificent accommodation with outdoor shower, bath, private pool, loungers etc. 鈥?but there was no view as it was surrounded on all sides by wall or hedge. Obviously a bit of a dilemma 鈥?on the one hand you feel lucky and on the other you鈥檙e left wondering what the view might have been like. So we asked to see some other rooms 鈥?just to see if we鈥檇 prefer the view from them. That was no problem and we saw another villa that was indeed next to a small rice paddy but it was not what we had in mind as it was not a 鈥渧iew鈥?in the 鈥渧ista鈥?sense of the word i.e. a view that you鈥檇 like to look at for a little while with a drink; and it really was a very small rice paddy and at the time was unplanted 鈥?so it was more of a muddy pond. So we stuck with our upgraded bit of bling and felt like life could indeed have been much worse. We asked the management if it would be OK if we decided to check out early if we changed our minds and they said it would be no problem. The next morning we had breakfast and it became clear that the resort does have a lovely view that you鈥檇 like to enjoy over a drink 鈥?but that the only place to really savour this view is from the restaurant. We really enjoyed our peaceful breakfast and decided that we鈥檇 probably stick with the place 鈥?why not?After the robbery: When we woke up on the morning of our second night we realised that during the night that someone had come into our room and stolen some of our things. It was one of those horrible moments when you realise that things just are not quite right鈥? Our day packs had been taken from the room and some of our possessions had been left in the outdoor shower area and on top of the external wall between the outdoor shower and the pathway beside the villa. The items discarded by the burglar in the shower area included my wife鈥檚 glasses (left on the bedside table following watching a movie before falling asleep). It was clear that the burglar had quietly gone through our room 鈥?careful not to wake us up - and picked up items a bit at random in the dark. They then sorted through the things whilst sitting on the top of the wall and left what was not of interest. In this case they took our cameras, camera equipment and a few other items in our daypacks. Luckily our passports and credit cards were in the safe. We normally put cameras in the safe too but it doesn鈥檛 necessarily occur to you that someone would come in the room while you鈥檙e in it. So you can imagine we鈥檙e feeling a little bit 鈥渟haken鈥?鈥?someone has been in the room while you slept and taken things from your bedside table. Not a great feeling. On reflection, I guess burglary can happen at any hotel but the thing that really helps you understand the philosophy of a place is their reaction when there is a problem. I went to reception and explained what had happened and asked them to call the Police and the manager of the hotel. I asked numerous times but they absolutely would not call the Police until a manager had arrived. The deputy manager arrived after about 30 mins and then called the police and the General Manager. A contingent of Police arrive and take a look at the villa. They see our possessions in the shower area and on top of the wall (wet from rain during the night) and they see marks on the outside of the wall where someone had climbed over into our villa. A layer of dust had settled on the wall so it was very easy to see the marks showing where the burglar had climbed up. Then the General Manager finally arrives. I meet him in reception and ask him if he wants to see the room. He says 鈥渘o need鈥?as the Police have already seen it and have everything they need for their report. We鈥檇 expected the junior staff to be a little bit indifferent 鈥?I mean what can they do about anything 鈥?but I had expected the General Manager to take the issue seriously and be concerned not only for our welfare but about the state of security at the hotel. Not only was he completely indifferent but he was also pretty sceptical that we鈥檇 been burgled. He kept on saying 鈥渋f you have been burgled鈥?and 鈥渨e have to wait for the result of the Police investigation鈥?to find out what happened. We really were astounded. We were on our honeymoon in a $470 night place and the General Manager basically thinks we鈥檙e making it all up. And he can鈥檛 even be bothered to come see the room. The approach was much more like 鈥渋ndifferent landlord鈥?vs 鈥渉otel manager鈥? His point was he was not going to do a thing until the Police had 鈥渇inished their inquiries鈥? Which of course would take days/weeks/whatever. I said we鈥檇 talk to him later. We went to the Police station (for 3 hours) and filed the report. They were clearly satisfied it was a burglary and gave us the report we would need for the insurance. When we came back I had another conversation with the General Manager. We wanted to know what he was going to do about the situation. $3000 worth of camera equipment had been stolen and the only thing he kept on mentioning was that he was 鈥渋n a difficult situation about the security certificate鈥? I asked him what he proposes. Answer: nothing. I ask him if he expects us to pay for the night鈥檚 stay during which we were burgled 鈥?he says 鈥渙f course鈥? Well maybe he鈥檚 technically in the right but the way he says all these things is with complete indifference. Fundamentally the hotel has an issue - it does not run itself like it's a hotel but more a collection of villas. When we stayed at the Oberoi (amazing by the way) the place is surrounded by security guards stopping non-guests from entering the grounds. The Ubud Village Resort, in contrast, felt deserted. The resort accepted zero responsibility for what happened and were not gracious in the slightest. Not the behaviour you expect from a top end place. My advice to you if you choose to stay: Lock every one of your doors and hope for the best as this not a place equipped to deal with problems. Check out the other less positive reviews on TripAdvisor, especially one from August of 2007. I wish i had before we came! On a positive note... there are some beautiful things to see in Ubud... we had a lovely trek in the Sayung valley (and the 4 Seasons in that valley really did look special). But if you have the time while you are in Indonesia check out the Tana Toraja region of Sulawesi.... that is a truly beautiful and culturally interesting experience. Enjoy your trip!

<Content>Great Review I will start this by thanking the staffs at The Ubud Village Resort who made our honeymoon very memorable last July... Came to Ubud for the first time and I was a little bit nervous as I take my wife and wanted to surprised her during our honeymoon. We booked directly to the hotel and efficiently handled by their sales staff. We arrived at Ubud Village Resort and were greeted warmly by the staff. We were escorted to our villa that are called rice field view and we were stunned with the villa and view and pool and room..bath tub.. hmm.. can write all of the lovely interior and exterion actually鈥?br/>I was so happy to see my wife reaction when we enter our villa (that is how they describe the villa..(welcome to your private villa Mr. and Mrs. Frances..)Breakfast on the second floor of The restaurant that called Angkui Angkui was delicious.. and the view... stunning and breathtaking.. what more to ask...My highlight here that my honeymoon was very memorable and we feel we were at our second home away from our home. Thank you for the staff who treated us as their family (got very emotional thinking about this..)A little suggestion is only that front office staff need to have more knowledge about the event that happening in Ubud town.. dont get me wrong... I get the information when I asked for the dance performance in Ubud but takes 10 minutes for them to get back to me.. and I thank them for that.... I hope this review is hopefull for whoever plans to stay at The Ubud Village Resort...Best wishes to Gusty, Adi, Dasak, Erna, and other lovely girls at front office.... and also Citera at restaurant...Ron and Cindy

I've stayed at this resort last month with my boy friend... it's so WOW.....I love to sit at the garden they have antique chair near the lotus pond and rice field its so green, yet the environment there is so tranquil very recommend it for honeymooner, for the activity my boy friend and I tried to do a cooking class we made a local food Betutu Chicken鈥?(If I鈥檓 not wrong I dunno how to spell it) the chef is so helpful, and the staffs are friendly and fun they treat us as like a family and friend and at the other side they respect us as their guest. My boy friend definitely loves the villa. we got a good deal with USD 220++ plus the benefits is better than stay at four season (we stayed there last year) The room is clean, the bath tub is surrounded by fish pond, we got both inside and out side shower鈥nd my suggestion are please try the spa they got a huge bathtub fabulous!! 鈥?About the security I鈥檝e heard rumors about it but I don鈥檛 think there is a problem coz I鈥檝e seen the security guy checking every corners of the resort during the day  evening, and they provide safety box in the villa as well, also they have big safety box at their front office.

<Content>Secluded Relaxation We spent out honeymoon on Bali in July 2007. The Ubud Village Resort was our first experience of the wide range of accommodation offered on Bali and it remained unsurpassed.Set amongst breathtaking rice fields it is a surprisingly short distance from Monkey Forest Road, Ubud town centre (a short walk or resort shuttle bus ride). This resort offered everything that we could have hoped for and more including impeccable cleanliness and round the clock service.Faultless and thoroughly recommended.

<Content>Perfect Oasis,Wonderful Kind Staff I stayed at this resort in July 07 with my elderly parents. The place is wonderful. The setting is truly breath taking.The villa was set in wonderful quite rice fields.If found that there were days when we did not want to leave the Villa, it was soooooooo spacious. Breakfast each day was plenty to get us started. The hotel has a free bus into town but you can walk.Even my elderly patients made. We found a GREAT a restaurant on the way to town called ' Gate Of Indian' which i did fantastic food. We had a great stay.I know booking a hotel can be quite nerve wracking as its expensive  you want it to be the best for your money.You will not be disappointed with this resort, the service is great  the staff are very kind  make you feel at home.If you have any questions please contact me, I have great holiday pictures i can send as for some reason i cannot upload them on the website for some reason.

<Content>Truly memorable, and an incredible deal Ever wanted to feel what it's like to live like a multi-millionaire? At the Ubud Village Resort, we paid about $250/night for our own private walled-in villa with our own private pool, two outdoor gazebo'ed beds, two fish ponds, a fabulous (air conditioned) marbled room, and our own private view of the rice field next door...oh yeah, and that came with a candle light dinner served to us in our villa, and a massage for the two of us. Elsewhere in the world, this would have easily cost $1000-2500 per night, so it's an incredible deal. The staff was so kind and helpful, the grounds are beautiful and peaceful, and you feel like you're in heaven. Such a fabulous place - I highly recommend it, and I will certainly be back there.

<Content>Amazing Place I decided to book at this resort as I had read the reviews on this website. We went there on honeymoon for three nights as part of the package. The villa was amazing with our own pool.. The people were so friendly and the food was the best in the whole of Bali.. We had dinner in the villa one evening and it was the most romantic evening of my life.. I would recommend this place to everyone goingLoveHazel

<Content>Beautiful but Security was Lacking Beautiful new resort with excellent staff. Location amongst the rice fields makes it romantic, but it has had problems reported in the local news relating to security. For some reason, security issues are not allowed to be reported on Trip dvisor's website; however, I advise that you heed this warning. When we stayed at the resort, there was a terrible stabbing and robbery in the middle of the night which we were witness to. The hotel staff and security were useless, tried to hide the incident and did not catch the invaders. People should be warned about these types of incidents before they choose a place. Too bad Trip Advisor does not allow for these warnings to be placed on their website to assist travelers.

<Content>the truly heaven ubud village resort is one my favourite place to stay. I have travel around the globe since i was 25 and this was my sixth visit to bali. I know about ubud village resort from a book published by lonely planet called Bali Lombok when i was in sydney 4 months ago. I got $220/night deal for the pool villas and it was terrific. I stayed there for 3 nights, everything doing really well. The check in was fast. They serve me a kind of balinese traditional drink mixed with lemon as the welcome drink. The room was outstanding with the ricefield view in front of my private pool. The restaurant was fantastic, i talked a lot with Mr.Lancar, their restaurant manager about balinese culture and he is one example of balinese man. kind and always nice to everyone. One thing that surpraise me is the size of the main pool. It was huge...Overal, i really recommend you to stay in this resort.. i reckon three night stay is the best way to feel the relaxing atmosphere of ubud village resort.

<Content>Off to our second visit to Ubud Village Resort We stayed in the Ubud Village Resort in June of 2006 to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. Our promise to each other on that trip was to make it an annual event! We have just booked this year's trip.As Ubud veterans, we have stayed in countless facilities there. The Balinese people have made every one of our stays special, but we have never before experienced such luxury as the Ubud Village Resort. We loved our rice view villa with the private plunge pool, and the morning fruit basket. Breakfasts were excellent, and the restaurant is beautiful. While it is quite a hike to town (through the monkey forest or along a busy main road, about 15-20 minutes) it is a quick trip via the free hotel shuttle.This hotel is pricey for Ubud, where one finds infinite (and generally lovely) choice in accommodation. But it is magical, and it is possible to negotiate a better-than-rack rate by contacting the resort directly via email. You will not be disappointed if you splurge a little!

<Content>Relaxing This is an exceptionally beautiful hotel. We stayed in the centre of Ubud for a couple of nights then moved out here - a totally different experience. Not for culture vultures, but a very peaceful place to be. The villas are amazing - encased in glass with beautiful furniture - lovely areas to relax in with indoor (for evening mozzies) and outdoor bathrooms; a small swimming pool and beds overlooking the paddy fields. The staff were always polite, friendly and helpful. The travel in and out of town is really not a problem as the hotel has a free shuttle taxi to their other hotel in town which goes on demand fairly frequently. The only downside is that it was fairly quiet when we visited which gave it a bit of a ghost town vibe and there are much better (quality and value) restuarants elsewhere.

<Content>Romance in the Ricefields This recently opened Resort boasts 25 Villa's with private Pools and is located a 5 minutes driving from the Centre of Ubud. My girlfriend and I stayed for six consecutive nights and had the most Romantic time of our lives. The well equipped Villa overlooking the beautiful Ricefields of Ubud offers all the luxury one could wish for: a great Kingsize bed, a huge bathroom with all the amenities, a marmor bathtub and shower in the open air and two pagodas in the private Garden where one can enjoy the beautiful sunset while sipping on a cocktail. Each morning one takes a short stoll through the well attained tropical garden to enjoy Breakfast with fresh fruits, eggs, pastry etc. on the Restaurant-terrace overlooking the Resort and the Paddyfields.The Resort has very friendly and helpfull staff; complimentary Shuttleservice is arranged between the Resort and the Ubud Village Hotel, which is located in the centre of Ubud and belongs to the same, very friendly owner. Highly recommended !!!!

<Content>worldclass resort We had an unforgotten experience in ubud village resort. The green ricefield view was beautiful. I stayed for 3 night in villa banjar kelod. the villa was georgeous, worldclass villa with a very reasonable price. The villa was very big and well maintained. The villa has a private pool which good enough for small exercise. This resort also has a main pool with 40/50m lenght. After swim, we can have a cup of coffee in paddys coffee shop which located exacly infront of the pool. I was surprised with how kind and friendly the staff. They all were well-trained. I absolutely recommend this hotel for couple, honeymooners and family. This resort is truly heaven. boutique resort, worldclass villa, 5star dining, friendly staff and beautiful ricefield view. Everything was perfect.

<Content>superb We stayed in the ubud village resort for 3 nights for our honeymoon and it was absolutely perfect...they gave us a free message upon arrival.what a surpraise..when we came to our room,we found a bucket of rose and chocolate on the table.that was not the only surpraise,when we entered the bathroom there was a hot tub with full of flowers.  The villa was really great with a private pool.The villa also very big and clean.There were 2 gazebos and a private pavillion beside the pool.They gave us a candlelight dinner for the benefits of 3 days staying.it was a unforgetable moment. the staff was very kind and well trained.The resort also has a main pool.The main pool was really big..hmm..Huge..I think it was the bigest one in ubud. overall I was very satisfied with my honeymoon.The resort, the pool, the surpraise, the dinner everything were wonderful.I think i'll return to bali and stay in this resort again.
