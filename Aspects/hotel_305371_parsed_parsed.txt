<Content>Sumptuos You may wish to know that I am a diamond member of the Hilton Group (which gives me upgrades) aqnd neither my wife nor I will see 50 years old again.We went to Hong Kong for a wander down memory lane (we lived there with our 2 sons many years ago) and as a stopover on our way to Sydney. The Conrad brand represents mainly up market business facilities within the Hilton group. The Conrad in Hong Kong is a fabulous hotel which also caters for tourists such as us (4 days ). We were upgraded to a high floor with a fabulous harbour view. The bedrooms are sumptuos with quality furnishings, with a sizeable and discreet bathroom . The room insulation is great. Breakfast arrangements will satisfy most people and the service typifies what one expects in the far east. There is a good gym and small spa. Also a small outdoor swimming pool which is mostly hidden from the sun. The hotel is wthin a group of 3 adjacent hotels (Marriot and Island Shangri La).The location is so convenient for Central, the incredible Pacific Mall which is below the Conrad and the MTR which is also available below the hotel.Not a lot more to say. Great location, great facilities, great service.

<Content>Pretty good all-rounder I stayed at the Conrad for three nights during a recent business trip. It is a very nice hotel in the Pacific Place shopping mall, near Admiralty train station.Overall the hotel was fine. Rooms were large  bed was comfortable. But I have to say that I find it really annoying that a top-class hotel, for which I am already paying top dollar, wants to charge me extra for using broadband in the room. Indeed, even the 'business centre' (which is a slightly pretentious title for a couple of booths with PCs in on the reception floor) charges for printing and so forth. And on checkout day they wanted to charge me for internet access! To me, I think all that stuff should be included in the price. It was in Tokyo, for example.Breakfast was very nice.

<Content>Business oriented, and highly recommeded for that purpose Well, haven't stayed in Four Seasons or Peninsula so hard to compare those clearly spectacular venues. But this place delivers for all intents and purposes, no doubt. Excellent customer care and the quality and response time for room service is commendable.Got upgraded to a suite overlooking Victoria Peak, an understandable gesture considering we book all our corporate guests through this place but still appreciated.Abit impersonal though, so if you are looking for a place remembering your name Conrad isn't the first place to look, on most important points it clearly delivers.

<Content>Very Good Hotel The Conrad is without doubt an excellent hotel, even by HK standards. We had a double room with great view  a bathroom that was out of this world. It was fantastically well designed  had absolutely everything you could want for a couple of days of luxury - right down to rubber ducks for the bath.It is quite expensive, but somethings are worth the expense  I think the Conrad is worth it.If you can get a deal, don't hesitate to book. I doubt that you will be disappointed.

<Content>A little taste of honk kong luxury This hotel is just mangnificent!! We paid for a room at the club floor and it was at the 56th floor so you can imagine the view!! The room is regular size,not enormous but not small as well. The service is impeccable, the restaurant is great, the location its excellent, the concierge are very helpfull too. Being at the executive club floor you have free lunch or tea/coffee/ snacks. Just an amazing hotel!!

<Content>Tasteful comfort The rooms at the Conrad are elegant, with tasteful classical chinese furniture and framed old prints, but light and airy. The staff are gracious and attentive. The doorman wouldn't let me get into a taxi when he'd spoken to the driver and it was clear the driver didn't know how to get to my destination. The location in Pacific Place is convenient for both the offices in Central district and the airport express station, as well as the Wanchai entertainment district. Pacific Place mall has the best designer shopping in HK and some great restaurants. There are lots of lovely touches about the stay - a massive bath in the room with a little rubber duck and a teddy bear by the bed. In an ideal world every hotel would be as nice as the Conrad

<Content>Superb Service We stayed at the Conrad Hong Kong from October 28 to November 1, 2008. The service at this hotel is outstanding. The rooms are small but expected on this small island. They keep bottled water, fresh fruits, and chocolate in the rooms. They were undergoing construction during our stay so the elevators to get the floor where breakfast was served was a little slow but the selection was well worth ithe wait. The hotel is connected to the Pacific Place shopping mall which is upscale and the subway stop Admirality. Lots of restaurants and shopping within a comfortable walk.

<Content>Great stay at Conrad Hotel We stayed at the Conrad for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon. Booked directly with the hotel at a rate of 3300 HKD a night for a deluxe harbour view room. Check-in was easy, we got upgraded to a suite room as it was our honeymoon. Also free bottle of champagne, Conrad teddies, fruit and chocolates - which made our stay really special. View over the harbour was good, but as you are set back from the waterfront you do get some obstruction from other buildings, so if you want a better view I'd stay at a hotel on the waterfront. Nonetheless it didn't stop us enjoying the view, lightshow and the buildings around us being light up. Rooms cleaned each day, service in the restaurants very good. We ate in the Golden Leaf - chinese, staff very helpful in recommending dishes, also outside near the pool area - less formal. We didn't book any tours with hotel, but just went off ourselves, always plenty of taxis outside hotel and reasonably priced. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would recommend the hotel. Compared to other 5* hotels this was a good price for the type of room we booked.

<Content>Quite possibly the best city hotel we've ever experienced Can a hotel anticipate a need before you have it?? If it can, then the Conrad HK can do it!Superb service (truly outstanding), beautiful rooms, great location. What more can you ask for?We won't stay anywhere else on future trips to Hong Kong.

<Content>Nice Business Hotel, GREAT location Great Business hotel with a bit more flair. Nice big bed and rooms. Wind down was a nice touch, with a little teddy bear, but this hotel excels in location! You are an elevator ride away from Pacific Place- not many other hotels can claim that (with exceptions)...Overall fantastic hotel, only thing that lacks is a bit of style/decor or culture aspect but can't really nitpick as this is a business hotel after all..

<Content>Superb, but ... Stayed at this great hotel for the third time this year. As I have diamond status I was immediately put on the 59th floor and as usual service, rooms etc. were great.The only thing I continue to critisize is the extra money such a hotel wants from you for the use of in-room internet access. The smallest Hampton Inn, also part of the Hilton chain, less posh and a lot cheaper offers this service for free. A logic I fail to understand.

<Content>Can't wait to return It may have been the upgrade, but I didn't want to leave the room. Really, really nice place - the rubber duck in the bath wasn't my scene but good to know it was there.Conveniently located above Admiralty metro station (just catch the elevator to the bottom and you're there), which was very handy. The area is also pretty leafy, so it feels quite relaxing and apart from the hustle bustle.The opulence lends an air of Lost in Translation loneliness but that is par for the course on 5 star hotels and a small price to pay for a great stay.

<Content>Great for a Business Stay Overview: The Conrad Hotel in Hong Kong offers a great location, very good physical facilities and outstanding service.Location: The Conrad is located in a tower above Pacific Place, an upscale shopping mall, with direct (air-conditioned) connections to the subway. It is located on floors 40 to 60, which means a lengthy elevator ride before reaching your floor. During the summer this can be quite warm and uncomfortable. Floors 58 to 60 are the 'executive level' with the Lounge on the 59th floor.Physical facilities: I have only stayed in rooms with a king bed. Once with a less inspiring view of buildings and the mountains and once with an inspiring view of Hong Kong harbor. The rooms are spacious with a very comfortable king bed (complete with a pillow menu), a dresser with a large flat screen TV (with a host of cable channels and pay-for-view movies), a nightstand, desk and chair. The closet is spacious, and lighted whenever the door is opened. A free, and large, safe is found in the closet.The room has many conveniences: a master light switch by the bed turns off most of the lights, a second turns on a muted night light and a third progressively lights two flood lights over the bed. A typically over-priced mini bar, but with a coffee maker and ample supplies, completes the room.The bathroom is mostly marble and quite large. Double sinks are complimented by a full-length mirror, a selection of upscale bath accessories and a convenient hair dryer. A large, deep tub and a separate shower provide bathing options. The commode is located in a quite cozy adjoining room. Towels are large, soft and numerous. A bathrobe and a sleeping robe are provided.A scale and a mechanical stair-stepper complete the bath equipment.Sometimes, the commode area has an unpleasant smell, which seems to come from the water.The 'gym' is located next to the Gardens Restaurant, and then down a spiraling staircase. The gym is small with six treadmills (ask for earphones when you come in, in order to listen to the flat panel individual TVs.) Other equipment includes a couple of bicycles, weight machines and assorted other equipment. The staff is friendly and efficient. I had a massage that was reasonably priced but fell short in technique.The swimming pool is small and somewhat inconvenient.The Executive Lounge is somewhat small and can become congested as guests access free internet there. (Internet access in the room costs about $11 per day). The view is fantastic. An adequate buffet breakfast (optionally you can take breakfast in the Garden Restaurant) is served (but it can become crowded), tea and sweets are served from 3 to 5, and drinks and light snacks from 5 to 7. The wooden furniture is attractive but somewhat heavy and ponderous.Service: Check in, at 7 in the morning, was prompt and my room was ready! Service in the Executive Lounge was always excellent. Food service is prompt and courteous. Attention to business needs (printing, copying, etc.) is handled without fuss and at a reasonable cost.I did not eat often in the hotel as I attended business meetings elsewhere. Two evening meals in the Garden Restaurant (once from the menu and once from the buffet) were forgettable, although it seemed very busy with local residents.

<Content>Slick service for your money This is a five star hotel, make no mistake about it. Everything from our arrival at a very late hour to the smooth late check out five days later was impressive. The airline managed to lose my luggage in transit. When I mentioned this at check in, they sent me an emergency kit with a few essentials in it. The room, the decor and the general ambience of the hotel was all exactly as a hotel of this calibre should be. You do get what you pay for. The only negative thing I will mention however, is that the staff do get a bit above themselves. There were two instances when I was actually tempted to report a couple of the waitresses to the duty manager but generally, our stay was very comfortable, restful and we would certainly stay there again. The dulcet tones of the lounge singer in the lobby bar was a welcome respite in the evenings along with the slightly potent cocktails. The location above Pacific Place is perfect for wandering around Central and Admiralty. The restaurant on the lower ground floor was consistently good. Breakfast was a little bit of a rip off but this is HK and hotels are expensive across the board, especially the better ones.All in all, a five star hotel for five star prices.

<Content>One of the best hotels of Hong Kong The Conrad is really a fabulous hotel. Service is top-notch, all employees are doing their best to help and they really made us enjoy our short stay. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to a small suite, which was a nice attention, as we travel with a young child, and need some extra space for him to run around... Location and view are exceptional, the hotel is sitting on top of the Pacific Place Shopping area, together with the Marriott and the Shangri-la properties. The room was large, well decorated, chocolates fruits and cookies were served every day, a very nice attention from the staff, and a favorite for our little kid.We will of course come back.

<Content>Excellent Concierge Flooor We picked the Conrad from the multitude of hotels on Trip Advisor and were extremely pleased with the location, the cleanliness, and mostly the amenities. We are Hilton Honors Gold and used our points, and they immediately upgraded us to their top executive floor with a delicious breakfast and snacks all day and evening until 11 pm or dine in their huge buffet downstairs. (unlike Sheraton that we have had MAJOR fights with over this in many cities-(see NYC and Bangkok))The staff was friendly and the Pacific Place is a great location at the train.We did not love Hong Kong, as it was simply a cleaner New York CIty (in some parts) and a filthier in others. We did the short half day tour they offered to the Peak and Aberdeen, but compared to other places we have been across the world, it was really not very exciting.But, if you have to go to Hong Kong stay at the Conrad, it seemed to offer the best value and is a wonderful hotel.

<Content>Deserves Its Excellent Reputation Stayed here for two nights in April at the end of a cruise and had an outstanding visit. I chose the hotel specifically because of the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor and I was not dissapointed. I booked a harbor view room and it was worth it for the view. Rooms were beautifully done, especially the all marble bathrooms. As far as the service, this is a first class hotel in every aspect!

<Content>Will be staying here again I just finished my first stay in the Conrad, I normally use the Shangri-la or the Mandarin.As I was staying over the weekend mid way through an Asia roundtrip, so I had a chance to use more of the facillities than I would on a normal use on a business trip. The gym is good, about 6 running machines (so no queueing in the morning), free weights, bikes and weight machines, sauna, steam room all in the basement so no natural light, but better than most.The outdoor pool was excellent, actually have some nice views over to Kowlooon and down through the canyons of Hong Kong. Beside the pool there is the outdoor eating and drinking area its nice to sit outside in the sunshine, or the dark, when you spend most of the trip locked in meeting rooms.The room was a good size, mine was with a harbour view (exec floor, Im a HH member) and had all the things you would expect. I was a bit suprise that they expect you to pay for internet useage, most other hotels in HK is included. Though free wireless is available in the Exec lounge, I have to agree with the other comments that the exec lounge is pretty dreary and really not very exciting, great views but no atmosphere.All in all a good experience, and I think I may be converted, I will stay here again on my next trip back to Honkers.

<Content>Stayed here 5 times in 3 years and will be back This is a five star hotel - make no mistake about it. They look after you here and make you feel welcome. The pool is outside and is great to swim in at night and check out the buildings as they light up. The gym is a little small but well equipped. The rooms have a nice flatscreen tv and the best bit (as I get bored on business trips) is that they also have a dvd player in each room. HK is great , you can pick up a vcd or dvd and off you go. Rooms are of a good size and well equipped - desk, armchair, large bed. Bathroom has a separate shower/bath and again good size. What makes this so easy is the location. As other reviewers have said, it is part of the Pacific Place complex and therefore really easy to get out and about. Drop down into the mall and walk over to the MTR. THe MTR is very cheap and easy to use. If you want to take a cab down to the star ferry or the airport express - its only going to cost you (max) HK$30. Its SO CHEAP.Breakfast is a good spread with everything you'd expect. The price is high - but you get this comp'd if you are a high tier Hilton HHonors card holder. The exec lounge is a little sterile but the views are great and not a bad place to go up and have a coffee and look down over the skyline.I've never been tempted to go next door to either the marriot or the Shang.

<Content>More Holiday Inn than luxury My wife and I just returned from a 4 day stay on the executive level of the Conrad Hong Kong. Perhaps our biggest mistake was to stay in the Intercontinental in Kowloon immediately beforehand. The comparison between the level of service and ambiance was stark.Pros and cons:Pro:- Room was large with a great bathroom (separate shower and bath, two sinks, etc.) and lots of closet space. Excellent harbor view.- Great location in a high end shopping mall Con:- The executive lounge was more similar to a something in a cheap long term stay hotel (such as Residence Inn) than a luxury hotel. It consisted of what looked to be a couple of gutted guest rooms packed with small tables and a few couches. Since the executive level benefits did not include free internet in your guest room (unlike the Intercontinental) the lounge was constantly packed with business people checking email and conducting phone meetings - not a pleasant environment. The executive level check in/out and concierge was also located at a small desk within this space, further compounding the general scrum of activity continuously going on. - The staff seemed more intent on pushing for a tip than on providing service. The staff in the lobby bar (a grim and dismal place) was particularly nasty.- The on site high-end Italian restaurant Nicholini's was very good however the staff was relentless in pushing the more expensive menu item (Wagyu beef, lobster, etc.). Needless to say even if you resist the pressure expect to pay US$400+ for 2.Perhaps if we had not had the contrasting experience at the Intercontinental this place may have seemed better.

<Content>My Top pick when in Hong Kong I've stayed at the Conrad about 6 times or even more and it never fails to please.From the comfy beds to the chocolates served in the evening. The staff at the conrad have always been the most pleasant.And did I mention how convenient the Conrad is? Approx 5 min walk (in air conditioned walking conditions) to the MTR (Admiralty) which sits on the same line as Central and Causeway bay stations.

<Content>Conrad HongKong-5 Star service benchmark This hotel certainly sets the benchmark for 5 Star service-kudos to hotel management-well trained, attentive,polite and helpful staff from the front desk to knowledgable concierge. The room was large and clean and the signature teddy bear and rubber duck was a nice touch. Views out facing the harbour were great also.Location is tops-with easy links to Pacific Place /Queensway Plaza shopping and transport is a cinch with Admiralty MTR station near by and linked airconditioned walkways to Central MTR HongKong. Thankyou for making my stay a memorable one!ETanKuala LumpurMalaysia

<Content>Conrad Hotels in Asia are Wonderful! We recently spent a week at The Conrad, Hong Kong at the end of a two month trip to Asia and this stay really finished off our Asian sojourn in style! We were on the 59th floor facing the harbor and just down the hall from the Executive Lounge. Our room included breakfast, either in the Lounge or downstairs in the Garden Cafe which opened onto an outside terrace by the gorgeous pool. Our room, tho not particularly large was extremely comfortable and very nicely decorated in an oriental motif. The only negatives about the room were the fact you could not adjust the airconditioning temperature or air flow and the commode was in a very tiny separate cubicle off the main bath which was awkward and uncomfortable. Overall this is an elegant hotel which offers great convenience and outstanding warm yet professional service! We will certainly stay at the Conrad Hotels in Hong Kong and Singapore when we return to Asia!

<Content>Room is small  During my business trip, I stay Conrad for 2 nights. When I walked in corridor, I feel some smody smell. The furniture location is a little bit strange. TV is in the left hand side, bed in the middle and there is an armchair in the right hand side. So, it is not possible to watch TV on the bed. Also, the bathroom is very small. Generally speaking, the room feels old and overall quality is not 5 starts.

<Content>Best Hotel in Pacific Place! Designed to WOW for the price you pay! Convenient Location=================1. From airport, you can take the airport express to HK Island  have a free shuttle transfer to Conrad.2. MTR: The hotel is connected to Level 5 of Pacific Place Mall. You can 10 mins walk from through the mall, and go to the basement which is connected to the Admiralty Station3. Walking distance to shopping, HK Park, and office in the vicinity.Lobby=====1. Reception is nondescript  functional. Staff at reception is business-like , efficient  very professional. 2. The hotel do try to optimise every single space in the lobby.Room - Deluxe Room on the 48th floor facing the hills==========================================1. Fluffy pillows and plush mattress2. Hitachi Flatscreen TV3. Bose Wave Radio/CD with remote control (I wish they have of those with Ipod docking station so that I could stick my Ipod and play the music I like). Who travels with CDs these days?4. Philips DVD Player5. Thinner Digital Weighing Scales (thank goodness!)6. Toiletries including nail-clippers!7. Philips Iron  Ironing board8. Bedroom slippers  cotton sleeping robe  terry cloth bathrobe9. Broadband connection 10. Decent size study desk11. The rooms are suprisingly big for HK standards12. Complimentary drinking water13. And of course ...... the signature Conrad rubber ducky  Conrad Teddy bear. Now, that's the REAL reason why I stay in Conrad!!Other amenities=============When you have back-to back meetings, there's just no time to check out the pool  gym. Now you know why that Conrad Teddy bear is an important companion. Or that Rubby Ducky. At least the Conrad recognises that there is a child in everyone of us!!Conclusion==========I have stayed in the Marriott  Shangri-la in Pacific Place, but give me the Conrad anytime. The Marriot feels used  old. The Shangri-la has an old dame feel (some call it grand). I like the Conrad because, on relative terms, it is the most modern of the three, both decor and personality. You could just stay in-doors and vegetate  watch dvd. For those on business, bring your other half along, so that your other half can enjoy Conrad while you slog yourself away.

<Content>A welcomed return - more please! I've been lucky enough to stay in this hotel on four occasions now. They have that wonderful knack of making you feel very welcome and special regardless of the hour at which you arrive. The rooms are great, the bathrooms fantastic and well appointed - I was lucky enough to be upgraded top the Executive Floor - and the service friendly, unobtrusive, professional and polished.Location is great for business or pleasure, and if you're a shopper, you can walk into one of the best shopping malls without even exposing yourself to sun, rain or natural light! The food was also terrific. I was there on business and a couple of times was too tired to even go to a restaurant in the hotel or the shopping mall. I had room service - always a hit and miss affair, but here I had 2 really good meals, served piping hot, tasty and, importantly, of sufficient size to not have to resort to mini bar treats to fill the gap!I travel a lot on business, and arriving at the Conrad in Hong Kong tends to take the stress away as you are made to feel at home.

<Content>Air condition the elevators! Hong Kong is hot and humid much of the year (including now, and it it will get hotter and steamier in the summer). Given that the rooms start on the 40th floor and go to the 60th floor, to have to ride that long from the lobby level in stiflingly hot elevators is frankly enough for me not to stay here again. What were they thinking?

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel has great location, it stands above a high-end shopping mall, Pacific Place. Looking for food is relatively easy. The MTR is underground the shopping mall. Basically the hotel boost its convenience.The room is excellent, the service is good, i guess overall it truly states its five star standard.

<Content>Consistently Fantastic Experience My family stays here every year when they visit Hong Kong and each time the Conrad goes above and beyond the highest levels of service. Attentiveness is comparable to staying at a Four Seasons, but friendlier.We stayed for one week on the Executive Floors in 3 different rooms. Everyone in the lounge was always nice, remembered each of us and what we like to drink. Overall, food in the hotel is excellent and receiving the Executive benefits was definitely worth the extra money.We traveled with my elderly grandparents and the entire staff was not only respectful of them, but did everything to make getting around easier for them. Our room was beautiful and because it wasn't ready when we arrived, they upgraded us to a full harbor view. Gorgeous view, comfortable beds, big closet and I looked forward to the box of chocolate truffles everyday! My uncle even received a birthday card, small cake and Conrad birthday stuffed bear in his room - and his birthday was in Feb. The Conrad is first class all the way and we will continue to stay here whenever we visit.I recently stayed at the Lanson Place and would definitely stay at that hotel as a back-up to the Conrad if I'm looking for a less extravagant stay.

<Content>Pleasant surprise, not much to fault Last leg of our honeymoon, spent five nights here.Been to Man O, Four Seasons, Sheraton Kowloon. Paid ~2500 a night.Have to concur with previous posters. There's something about Asian hotels, Asian attitudes of service and care, that make them quite a cut above elsewhere. You'd pretty much have to pay ManO or Four Seasons prices in other countries to get the service. Conrad was a pleasant surprise. Not top-tier like Peninsula/MO/4S, but was very happy with pretty much everything.Location is a selling point. Perfect for business, close to Central. Excellent for shopping. Being attached to Pacific Place is a real bonus. It's still more lively than IFC I feel.Room (mountain view) is very decent sized, separate shower and bath and toilet, decent desk. Very well maintained, one of those mid 90s quasi grandeur decor but nonetheless clean and new. Not sure whether they'd renovated recently but really that new.Room service tip top, dry cleaning ironing etc cheap relatively.Daily fruits. And of course the obligatory mini bears !Having lived in HK before, and knowing the geography a little, at low 2k, it's hard to beat. I'd stay here again for that price. High 2k, low 3k, I'd probably go ManO or 4S. I'd avoid Shangri-la at that price that's for sure. Conrad the best of the three at Pacific Place for value.

<Content>First Class Sevice and Accomodation Stayed here prior to a trip to Thailand. The hotel is in a good location close to main shopping and eating areas. In fact there is a great shopping centre / mall below the hotel that also has good restaurants too. The hotel itself was in good order and the service from the staff was first class. Everyone was exceptionally courteous and nothing was too much trouble. We stayed in an executive room on the 59th floor which had awesome views.... You must try it, especially as you also get access to the executive lounge for free breakfast, free wifi, free aftrennon tea with scones and clotted cream / jam !!! Plus free drinks all day and free alchoholic drinks / cocktails between 5pm - 7pm. In short, a great hotel with superior service.

<Content>excellent business hotel with good size room My wife and i stayed here for 4 days in March. Conrad is one of the newer hotels on the Hong Kong island, next to Island Shangri-La and JW Marriott. It's on top of the Pacific Place shopping center, a high-end shopping complex with restaurants and a cinema. You can also get to the Admiralty subway station by walking through the mall, without stepping outside. it's about a 10 minute walk. Admiralty is also a public transportation hub where many double-decker buses stop, but navigating the buses may be a bit difficult for first-time tourists. We had a deluxe room with harbor view. the room is big by Hong kong Standard. I like the fact that the desk has outlets for both 220V and 110 V as well as various plug configurations. I didn't even have to use my adaptor. There is internet hookup but the hotel charges USD 15 per day. The bathroom has separate shower and bathtub and two sinks. I was impressed with the complimentary items in the bathroom, including toothbrush, shavers, nail clippers, small scissors, and basically the all the stuff that you can't take on a carry-on bag nowadays. I usually stay at the Harbor View Renaissance in Waichai , but after staying here, the Conrad is a much better hotel in terms of room size, amenities, and location.

<Content>World Class Hotel What's Good - 5* Hotel that lives up to your expectations with impeccable service, great rooms/views and in a great location (an elevator ride from the metro and one of the most exclusive shopping malls in HK - a short taxi ride to just about anywhere). What's Bad - nothing really - expensive, but no more so than other hotels of this standard - gym was cramped and some of the equipment was tired

<Content>Five Star Hotel for Business Travellers I disagree with PreciousPrincess on her complaints. All room on the Executive Floors require key access - if the reviewer thinks she needs high security, then she should have booked her room on the Executive Floor. Besides, Hong Kong is one of the safest cities in the world.Regarding the location of the gym and pool - all she needed to do is to put on a bathrobe. I have been going to this hotel for more than 10 years with no problems.If spa and gym is what she is looking for, then do not book into a five star business hotel. She should stay at a resort instead.Business travelers stay at the Conrad for its convenient location and excellent service.

<Content>Didn't meet my expectations Large room with a plasma tv and BOSE alarm is always a bonus. Convenient location to Pacific Place shopping mall and attentive staff. However the gym and pool is located on the lobby and basement floor which meant you had to pass through the public area and restaurant to get there. Not a very nice look when you are in gym clothes or in a robe with slippers! I am also very big on security and was surprised to find that you didn't need to insert your room key to get onto the room floors. Not one of my favourite hotels in HK. Had higher expectations for a Conrad name.

<Content>Simply awesome - as Conrad as always I stayed here on the way from Macau to London, but I regret I only stayed a night. We checked in and were upgraded to a suite, so my review is a bit unfair, but I am a regular Conrad visitor and service and everything else was what I expected: simply awesome! Highly recommended. A great stay

<Content>The Conrad - True Hong Kong Magnificence! I cannot speak highly enough about this hotel. Aside from the magnificence, it is really the service that sets it apart. The staff is extremely attentive, and their attention to detail is outstanding. Starting with my shoes which they picked up to shine in the evening and delivered on time the next morning, to the snack that they bring in the mid-evening... they are making me feel like an emperor!The concierge has been helpful in so many ways with recommendations for sight-seeing, shopping, and restaurants, as well as arranging my visa into mainland China. The front desk are polite, helpful, and very friendly... so my positive experience really started when I checked in!The view from my room on the 49th floor is hampered only by the ever-present smog, but is incredible nonetheless. I only wish I did not have to leave after the week!

<Content>Five star for sure While I am not accustomed to staying at five-star hotels, this hotel HAS to be in that category. There is virtually nothing to dislike and much to be thrilled with. Everything about our stay was top-notch: the location, the facilty, the room, the staff, and the concierge. All of it was great. The price may be a bit steep by American standards but no hotel is cheap in Hong Kong. After many trips to Hong Kong, I much prefer to stay on Hong Kong island than in Tsim Sha Tsui, which feels to me like a tourist ghetto. Here, you can walk to Causeway Bay and get a much more normal Hong Kong shopping experience.The hotel is right on the edge of the botanical gardens, making it a natural respite from the hectic pace of the rest of Hong Kong. We ate at the Zen Chinese restuarant in the very high class shopping mall in the basement of the building at the recommendation of the concierge. The meal was great.

The service even at the pool is very good.Meals with roomservice are great as well as te meals in the hotel restaurants..Pity the pool is in the shade around noon..so if you like to sunbathe the JW Marriot next to it is a better choice

<Content>Outstanding stay We just stayed at this property in Hong Kong and are extremely satisfied with our stay. This Conrad is truly a 5 star hotel. The staff are very professional and friendly. The room decor/comfort is outstanding. First rate gym/sauna/steam room.The executive lounge has an amazing view of the Hong Kong harbour.They offer complimentary breakfast, afternoon high tea, evening canapes and sweets. Most of the guests seem to be business travelers in their powersuits negotiating multimillion dollar deals. The hotel treats every guest like royalty. For leisure travelers,you will have time to enjoy all of the hotel amenities. It definitely is one of the best city hotels in the world. The location is very convenient and is in Pacific Place, a high end shopping complex. It adjoins the Admiralty MTR station.We highly recommend this property. You will definitely be impressed with this hotel.

<Content>Feels like home I have been staying at this property for 15 years,and I daresay it is one of the better Hongkong hotels. The staff is excellent and make you feel at home. The Executive Floor Lounge is a great place to have meetings, and the cocktail hour just gets you going for the evening. The concierges are very helpful. In fact I left my credit card in a store in Kowloon, and they made arrangements to pick it up.There are newer hotels in HK, the Four Seasons being the choice spot right now ( I have stayed there twice this year) but there is nothing like the familiarity of the Conrad -- good sized rooms for one. They should update the rather cramped gym though, but it works !

<Content>A good choice all around I'm from HK originally and travel there quite a bit for business. Have stayed at all the hotels except the Four Seasons and the new Landmark. I stayed at the Conrad for 4 nights in early October.What one has to remember about HK hotels is the service at even the average hotel blows away anything you would find in the US. The Conrad is no exception. Very convenient location, great gym, nicely appointed and spacious rooms. I had a room on the 55th floor facing the harbor and was able to view the fireworks over National Day. The breakfast buffet was disappointing, but other than that I would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Excellent - will stay again Excellent experience and accomodations. Note that I am a Hilton Honors Diamond VIP level guest which may affect my experience.Excellent check-in...a staff member took us personally up to the executive lounge for one-on-one check-in service. Room was excellent...very well appointed with all the ammenities of a top tier hotel. Bathroom was spacious and had everything from a TV, weight scale, good products, plush towels. The view we had was incredible. The staff at the hotel is excellent - we were glad everyone spoke excellent English and were eager to make our stay enjoyable. The executive lounge is excellent...can have afternoon tea, cocktails and there is great breakfast buffet selection in the mornings. The view is incredible, overlooking the harbor and skyline. The location of the hotel is excellent - it is located in the Pacific Place shopping center where it is hard to leave! It is also in walking distance to the park and the rail car that goes to the top of the mountain. Easy access from airport...we took the train directly to Pacific Place, walked through the mall to the hotel. On the return to the airport we took the hotel shuttle to the train station where you can check your bag then train to airport.

<Content>Excellent hotel, excellent location, accepts pets Having lived in HK for three years we chose the Conrad as our last place to stay before leaving.At about 100 USD less than the Four Seasons this hotel is an excellent value luxury hotel.The hotel is situated on top of Pacific Place Mall, which is home to many fine shops and restaurants.The staff are helpful and speak English, and arranged a car service to the airport, extra needs for the room, and reasonable room service.The Conrad is the only hotel in HK to accept pets (200 HKD/night fee).

<Content>Good hotel on Hong Kong Island The Conrad is located above Pacific Place shopping centre on Hong Kong Island, approximately 15 minutes walk from the star ferry and peak tram. Our room was on the 40th floor with excellent views of the harbour and was spacious and smartly decorated. Pleasant pool area and outdoor cafe/bar. Service was great - BA lost my luggage and the hotel were very proactive in tracking it down. It was also my husband's birthday during our stay and the hotel provided a cake (unbidden) which was a nice touch. My only complaint is that there was refurbishment work going on during our stay and consequently some banging from the floor above. The hotel warned us on check that there might be noise between the hours of 09.00 and 18.00 but I think we should have been warned in advance/when booking. Good restaurants in Pacific Place include Peking Garden and Zen. Hutong at One Peking Road on the Kowloon side was also great with stunning views of the harbour. www.aqua.com.hkThe number 15 bus from outside Pacific Place is a great way to get up to the peak.

<Content>Good hotel in a good location I stayed in the Conrad Hong Kong twice on my way to and from mainland China in April 2007 with two other work colleagues.The first time was for one night, and we got rooms on the 42nd floor, one of the lowest. Not all the rooms were refurbished, and mine was an old one with a very small TV in a cupboard and old-fashioned flowery decoration. Despite booking three rooms with king-size beds, they only had two available, and one of us had to take a room with two beds in it.The second time was for longer, and this time I asked for a higher room, and got one on the 49th floor which had been refurbished. Much better, with updated decor and a flat-screen TV. However again they didn't have three rooms on the same floor with king-size beds.Plus points:Very large and comfortable bed; large flat-screen TV with DVD player attached, and also all cables to attach a PC or iPod to it; Bose radio again with cables for mp3 player, wired broadband, very large wardrobe and very large bathroom with bath, separate shower, separate loo and two sinks. Hotel is linked directly to the Pacific Place shopping centre, where you can get breakfast - don't pay the minimum $200 for hotel breakfast - and walk to the MTR or tramway. Whenever something was wrong - no hot water out of a tap, burst light bulbs, telephone not working in the bathroom - it was fixed straight away. Oh, and you get Conrad the bear :-)Minus points:Broadband is not free, I paid $600 for a week's worth; The coffee maker was primitive compared to the rest of the hotel; and the gym is in a small windowless room with the old equipment crammed into it, not at all what I expected. The outdoor pool is also small for the number of guests.However the staff are - in the main - very helpful and approachable. I have to say though that if I wasn't on expenses - and a special company rate - I'd have to stay somewhere else.

<Content>OUTSTANDING Hotel This is one of the finest hotels is which I鈥檝e stayed; the best Conrad I鈥檝e been in (although the Singapore Conrad comes close). The service was impeccable and the room was well appointed and spotless. No complaints whatsoever. This property is attached to the Pacific Place mall, which in turn is directly connected to the Admiralty MTR (rail rapid transit) station, so getting to the rest of Hong Kong is a breeze. It is fairly close to the Airport Express Station; a free shuttle bus stops at the hotel; however, it is a short and inexpensive (US$6) taxi ride. The only drawback to the location is that it is in an office/hotel complex and is therefore a bit sterile, but the easy access to the MTR mitigates this issue.

<Content>Awesome Hotel I traveled to Shanghai last May for a wedding and wanted to take advantage of being in China so I opted to travel solo to Hong Kong for a few days. Since I would be celebrating my birthday I wanted to pick the best place possible. I was also traveling solo and wanted to feel safe in a place where I knew no one and could not speak the language. I arrived in Hong Kong and it took me about and hour to get up my nerve to figure out how I was going to get to the hotel. I opted for the train and the free transfer to the Hotel which was a great and inexpensive ride. It was right before a Holiday when I checked in late on a Tuesday afternoon. The weather was overcast and the hotel lobby seemed a bit muggy. The Bell Hop was very generous and held by bags while I traveled to the Executilve Level to check in. The host was nice and I explained it was my birthday and she was kind enough to book me in one of the renovated rooms away from the construction they were doing at the time. The Bell Hop brought my luggage and even connected my computer and arranged for someone to come and open my bedroom window so I could get some fresh Air. My room faced the Harbor and was beautiful. All the small touches like the flowers and rubber duck in the bathroom were nice.After being in Asia for over a week, I was excited to see a burger on the room service menu. I ordered it with fries and soup and it was delivered in good time. The burger was a bit soggy but I tried to eat it. During my stay I filled out a customer card and commented on the burger and the kitchen actually called and apologized. They were also kind enough to bring me some fruit and cookies and chocolates due to my experience.The Italian Restaurant was a bit pricy but I was able to get a late sitting at 10pm. I was dining solo and they arranged for me to have a table overlooking the city. The bar adjacent was nice as well. Again it was a Holiday in Hong Kong so not many folks were around.Hong Kong is real easy to get around and the next day I ventured out and took the Ferry. I was a bit nervous getting around on my own but I did just fine. I treated myself to a massage on my birthday at the spa. It was so heavenly I almost wished I had not made reservations for dinner because I was so relaxed all I wanted to do was sleep the night away.After I returned from dinner, I arrived at my room and the Hotel arranged a very nice birthday cake for me. It was a nice way to end my birthday.The Hotel staff was wonderful. My only wish was that the concierge could have given me a few more tips and ideas on what a single person could do as far as night life. Overall my stay was nice. This hotel is in the business district so you won't see as many folks walking around at night like you will on the other side of the harbor. And the Construction Teddy Bear was great.

<Content>Fabulous service I stayed at the Conrad for just one night, but was extremely impressed with the level of service. I arrived in Hong Kong late on a Sunday with meetings the next day in Shenzhen and an expired China travel visa. The concierge was extremely helpful -- taking care of my visa and rebooking my flight out of shenzhen. I was upgraded to an executive room on the top floor with a fabulous view, and i found the complimentary breakfast in the executive lounge on the 59th floor to be excellent. The staff was very attentive. I was absolutely stay here again. They even brought me a second stuff bear (i found the first tucked into my bed on arrival) so each of my kids can get one.

<Content>Convenient Conrad I visit Hong Kong regularly and stayed at the Conrad 3 times. The check in process was always fast and efficient. I always booked the mountain view room - being their standard room and everytime I had positive experience. However, I cannot call this hotel perfect as the room size is small and although everything else seemed to look right, the general decor and furnitures were dated. Conrad seriously need a big round of refurbishment in their rooms if they havent started planning to do so - to really make the guests' money worth. Otherwise, Location is fantastic. I totally love the Pacific Place, it just feels great to know that the big mall with everything you need is right underneath. Few hours of shopping and then drop of our stuff to rest our feet is always a plus. My next trip in December, I will be trying The Lanson Place in causeway bay for the first time since their rooms look spanking new with very good deal I found on the internet. I will return to Conrad only if the company pays for my stay or after their future renovation!

<Content>Must Stay in Hong Kong The Conrad Hong Kong was one of the best hotels I have ever experienced any where in the world. I travel 3 or 4 days per week on the average so to say the least I was extremely satisfied with this hotel. We booked a normal room and where upgraded to a suite with a bay view. I am sure this was because I am a Hilton Diamond. The breakfast on the Executive floor was outstanding. Also do not miss the drinks and finger foods starting at 5:30 pm. The staff at the hotel bring you to your room upon arrival and get you acquanited with the hotel. Nice touch! We stayed for three nights and wished it cold have been longer. Take the Airport Express train from the airport and then go to #1 bus at the Central station. This is the easiest and fastest way to get to hotel. Our room was just finished being remodeled. I recommend this hotel to business or leisure traveller.The concierge recommeded the Hu Tong restaurant on Kowloon side for dinner. This restuarant has to be on your list of MUST DO when in Hong Kong. Try and have dinner during the 8 pm time slot to watch the light show on other side of bay.We stayed here as part of our 20th wedding anniversary.Richard and Emily

<Content>Predictably Excellent I've stayed in the Conrad before, always on the executive floor, and always thinking THIS is the way to run a hotel. The room in which I stayed had been newly redecorated, and with few exceptions was perfect, in terms of comfort, charm, sophistication, and pleasantness. The staff are predictably Conrad, in that my needs were anticipated as much as they were met. The service is quiet, elegant, and unassuming, yet it is very much evident and professional. My spouse accompanied me on this trip, and she, too, was extremely impressed with the property and the staff. In a city of great hotels, this one continues to be great. I stayed here because I am a Hilton Diamond member, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit to this very quietly and tastefully sophisticated hotel.

<Content>Overrated Stayed for 5 nights recently and was disappointed. Customer service was lacking and perfunctory when offered, smiles were at a premium, decor significantly dated and food very average. Only redeeming feature was proximity to the MTR station and good food court in shopping mall underneath. Try the Shangrila next door, the new Mandarin Oriental or the Four Seasons for about the same price range.

<Content>Conrad is good Stayed at the Conrad Hong-Kong twice for 10 and 9 days in July and August 2006. The hotel is currently renovating the rooms located in the top floors (above sort of 55). The old rooms have a greenish design (did not stay in one of these but was offered one with bay side view) and the renovated rooms have a very pleasant yellowish design. So, finally we selected non-renovated room on the executive floor for our first stay and a renovated room for our second stay. The non-renovated have standard TVs and furniture as you can see from pictures in other posts, and the renovated rooms have new furniture, including a flat-screen 32'' TV, and a separate DVD player that's particularly pleasant if you stay for long as you may want to just go downstairs to the mall and pick up a DVD to watch from Hong-Kong records. Rooms are very well isolated from noise enabling a very quiet sleep no matter what, the air-con is non-intrusive, and the marble bathrooms are very pleasant with double sinks and a toilet behind a door that closes. Staff are very pleasant, and as mentioned in other posts, service is top notch at this hotel. Examples include airport pick-up (charged), tea immediately upon arrival and possibility to view and choose your room (I guess that only applies to gold and diamond hhonors members). We also tried the restaurant on the 8th floor, which despite being very pricey deserves its reputation of best italian in Hong-Kong.

<Content>Not Impressed We stayed at the Conrad Hong Kong at the end of our three week vacation to China. I was not impressed with this hotel and thought the service was sub-par at best. I am a Hilton Diamond Member too.We did get upgraded to the Executive Floor Level - thankfully as the room had recently been remodeled. Seeing the floors that had not yet been remodeled, it would NOT be worth the expense. But, even for a recently remodeled room, I was not impressed with the cost. The location of the hotel is it's only saving grace, as you have access to the MTR in the shopping plaza underneath the hotel.The breakfast buffet was terrible - the food was overcooked and cold. The service at Happy Hour was uptight. The maid came to turn down our bed at 10:45 PM the first night and 7:15 PM the second night. Further, I celebrated a birthday during our stay at the hotel and they had mentioned sending up a birthday cake for me. Well, the cake came at 10:30 PM at night - a heavy cheesecake is not something to be enjoyed so late - and we didn't even cut a slice because of this! Why make a promise you aren't really going to fulfill?Just felt that the Conrad name would carry better service - but of all our stays in China, the Conrad was the worst!

<Content>Elegant and luxurious This is probably one of the best properties under the Hilton Honours umbrella where you can cash in your points for a great category 6 hotel stay. (I tried the Hilton Paris and Hilton Milan using my points but they are not even half as nice as this hotel) As a diamond card holder, they even upgraded my redemption stay to the executive floor spontaneously and offer many extra benefits, such as complimentary breakfast, free canepes and drinks at the clubroom, for which champagne is also on offer, free daily pressing  newspaper etc. The hotel staff really treat you as a VIP guestThe exec floors are located at the top floors of the building and they can be accessed only with your key. You are escorted to the club lounge to do your check-in and explained all you need to know to enjoy your stay. The room offers great amenities like Bose audio system, personal fax machine, a nice 2-seater, bathrobe, etc. They also put a couple of Conrad bears on your pillow and a rubber duck in the bath, which is a nice touch and quite cool! It is in great location (just above Pacific Place at Admiralty MTR station) and the room is more than just comfortable, but elegant and luxurious. Room service is reasonably nice. I haven't tried out the gym but the pool is quite nice. Having stayed at Shangri la next door and Regal in Causeway Bay previously, I would definately prefer this one and will come back again when I visit family  friends in HK.

<Content>Great finale to Hong Kong My husband and I stayed at Conrad HK during our last 10 days after having worked and lived in HK for 8 years. We were impressed by the service and polite staff mainly Julian the doorman and Solomon the bellboy. Loved the chocolates they placed in a bamboo dimsum box everynight. Enjoyed our stay in a full sea-view room. Not a family-oriented hotel, ideal for business travellers and discerning travellers.The proximity to an upscale mall for , literally just below the hotel building is fantastic for shopping. But food in the hotel is not good after having sampled better ones in HK.I had not stayed in another hotel in HK before but it is among my fav list with Grand Hyatt Shanghai, The Legian Bali , Banyan Tree Phuket and Four Seasons Jakarta.

<Content>One of Hong Kong's Best! Just completed my third stay at this Conrad -- three days in length. I travel to Asia 5-6 times a year from the States and last year switched to the Conrad from the Pen for two reasons: first, I decided for 2005 to consolidate all travel to staying at Hilton properties, and second, a business partner living in HKG recommended I try it. Suffice it to say, each visit met or exceeded my requirements. The service is exactly what you'd expect from a 5-star Asian property; in a word, stellar. From bellmen to concierge to check-in to chamberstaff, everyone encountered seems genuinely committed to the guest's satisfaction with their stay.As a Hilton Honors Diamond member, an upgrade to the Executive Level room (second and third visits I was rewarded with a harbor-facing suite) is automatic, if available. The Executive Level Lounge provides breakfast, drinks and evening snacks at no charge; while this is not enough to constitute a meal, it seems that many people frequent the lounge before venturing out for their day's work or prior to dinner. The view is amazing. The rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet. Beds are most comfortable with your choice of pillows, comforter/blanket available upon request. TVs with plenty of english-speaking channels (also a few french, italian, spanish and arabic). Amenities such as chocolates, tea, fruit and bottled water are gratis and plentiful. Wired or wireless Internet access is reliable (but not inexpensive). The service can be as solicitous or unobtrusive as you prefer; simply set your door for Do Not Disturb.I keep referring to the service as it impresses me so. Here's a couple of examples: I have a standing request for a bucket of ice in the room upon arrival and each evening before 6pm -- this is always accommodated. Another is a second clock in the room set to east-coast US time so that if I wake in the night I can immediately decide whether I want to communicate with the office. These are the kind of touches I don't find in many other properties.I can't speak to shopping, location or restaurants near the Conrad as most evenings I'm out with clients or co-workers near TST, and as locals, I leave the decision making to them. I can attest to a short walk to the Star Ferry, even shorter to the MRT subway 1-stop to TST and near to the Peak Tram.August 13 my wife will finally accompany me to HKG for a week then on to Beijing (Peninsula there -- I've also reviewed) fro another week. I will post an updated review thereafter as I will likely be able to speak to shopping, restaurants and sightseeing. Shen-Tzen, Lantau and Lamma are on the itinerary.Hope this helps my fellow business travelers.

<Content>very average, bring in the decorators I stayed at the Conrad Hotel for a business trip, originally for 5 nights. It looks and feels like a hotel that has not been renovated since the early 90's. I stay in hotels all the time, and was excited to try the Conrad. I stayed on the executive floor (the top floor), which seems to smell like noodles all day and all night. There was not very much excitment in the club lounge, and food was very ordinary. The other reviews were all accurate - the views are great and the location is excellent. The service is good. But the hotel seems to desperately need a facelift. It certainly is not chic if that is what you are looking for. And for the price - on par with the Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental - I would have expected much more. My view is that you should not come all the way to Hong Kong, pay $500 for a room, and then feel like it is ordinary.

<Content>Just the best Stayed at the Conrad for 3 days in June 2006- although have to say we actually stayed in the serviced apartments owned by the hotel in the same building rather than the hotel itself as due to a full hotel we were moved there with our agreement so perhaps my comments aren't entirely on the Conrad Hotel itself. I have to say if given the opportunity to stay in these apartments - just do it, they vare tremendous, although we didn't really use it this was a superior kitchen to most serviced apartments I have seen. the apartment itself was a large dining/lounge area, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom and entrance foyer- just wonderful to have so much space. Views were not of the harbour but up towards the peak so still spectacular.The hotel itself could not be faulted in my opinion- little touches that just vadded to teh xpereince- for example- my wifes birthday fell when we were there- the hotels ent up a cake and card which was unneccasary but very nice. We had a late fligt home but were able to shower and change at the hotel before going to the airport without any issues. A very impressive gym and nice pool area.Dined at the Chinese restaurant inhouse and a tremendous meal so ceryainly would recommend it.Great loaction- airport express in and bus to the hotel and back is very effiecient. The hotels location so close to a good mall and MTR stop makes getting around very easy.All in all one of the best hotels I have been lucky enough to stay at- stay here it won't be regretted.

<Content>Fantastic! Loved the Conrad, Hong Kong. Good location to be in. Access to the MRT via the shopping mall below the hotel. Great service. Rooms are large, plush and very clean. Breakfast was amazing - spoilt for choice. I only had one day here but wished I had more time. It was good to stay on the Hong Kong Island side as you can travel into Kowloon for shopping and site seeing during the day and back near the hotel for the night life of Lang Kwai Fong. Will definately be going back!!

<Content>great location! I recently stayed at the Conrad during my first trip to Hong Kong and I thought it was excellent with a great location in Pacific Place mall which has an MTR. The room was a good size with amazing views overlooking Kowloon.The bathroom was spacious with a separate shower and bath and the beds were really comfy.The hotel restaurants seemed very expensive but with so much choice down in the mall and over in Kowloon we never felt the need to eat here.

<Content>Thoroughly enjoyed my stay The Conrad is an excellent hotel. I enjoyed every night of my stay here. Service is impeccable!My room was clean and comfortable, with nice views of Hong Kong. The bathroom had excellent lighting and a full range of ameneties. Power converters were available at no extra charge. The bed was comfortable and the hotel offers turndown service with fresh fruit every evening.The Conrad has a very convenient location. It's located above Pacific Plaza mall, with high-end shopping and a Metro station. There is a nice park two blocks away, and it's a short walk to the Peak tram.I have no complaints about this hotel and will stay here again on my next visit to Hong Kong.

<Content>Friendly and fabulous Stayed at the Conrad for 5 nights on holiday with the wife. Not cheap, but worth every penny. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble from the second we arrived until when we departed. The room was fabulous with a great view of the harbour, hugely comfortable bed and great bathroom. We came back early from a shopping trip and the room was being serviced. The maid asked us for proof of who we were - great to think that all of their staff are focused on security as well as service. Great breakfast, great concierge, really couldn't fault it and would definitely, definitely stay there again.

<Content>Service is immaculate We choose to stay at the Conrad at the start of an extended holiday and it set the standard for everywhere else that we visited.The main thing that sets the Conrad apart from the others is the service. The staff could not do enough for you. Within 15 minutes of our arrival we were greeted by some freshly made Chinese tea. Later that day, we were presented with a fruit platter to celebrate Chinese New Year. The rooms were made up a number of times a day, and small gifts left to make us feel even more welcome. Every member of staff took the time to talk to us which made us feel very welcome.The hotel is ideally located for both leisure and business. Despite the maps making it look otherwise, Hong Kong is a very small city and everywhere is easily accessible by foot. We bought a top ten book before we visited and there is more than enough in it to keep you very occupied for a few days. Highlights for us were the peak tram (try walking down on a bright day for some amazing views), the star ferry and Kowloon, the MTR, the friendly people etc etc. The food in Hong Kong is amazing and we would recommend the restaurants in the basement of Pacific Place for some cheap eats with the locals.

<Content>Perfect hotel in a great location I could find no fault in my recent visit to the Conrad hotel in Hong Kong. The room was excellent, the bathroom was fantastic, and the service superb. I had a great view over the harbour, and on one night decided to have room service in my room because no restaurant nearby would likely match the view I had.Travelling there from the airport was easy: take the train to Hong Kong island and the shuttle bus from the station drops you right at the door.The elevator in the hotel goes down into Pacific Plaza shopping centre, located under the hotel. The location of the hotel is great for exploring Hong Kong island. I walked everywhere (apart from the Peak Tram ride) and felt very safe doing so. Hong Kong park is next to the hotels at Admiralty and this is a really lovely park to explore.October is an expensive month for Hong Kong hotels and so the only thing that would have made my visit better was a lower price!

<Content>So attentive! What a wonderful place! The rooms and bathrooms are perfect, and the staff are so attentive and polite. We couldn't have asked for better......except the food and drink is vastly overpriced. We paid nearly 拢80 for both of us for lunch, and only had a few pieces of sushi. And a non-alcoholic cocktail was 拢8. We soon found other places to eat!

<Content>Lovely hotel, location good or bad, depending... This is one of Hong Kong's several high-end luxury hotels that predominantly caters to business travellers in the Central district. However, my wife and I greatly enjoyed our four-night stay for leisure as part of our recent Asia trip. The hotel is exactly what you would want and expect from a five-star, big-city hotel.The room was excellent, relatively large in size, with lovely furnishings and comfortable bed linen. The bathroom was large, marble, and included separate bath and shower. The shower water pressure, one of the details that I look for in order to separate the great from the pretenders, passed the test. It was excellent. Dual vanities as well. The view from our room was OK, labelled as a deluxe ocean view when I booked on the Conrad's internet site. As I did not book an executive level room, our view from our 48th floor room did include a view of Victoria Harbor from a large picture window, but the view was obstructed by the office immediately adjacent to the Conrad. The rate that I got was 2300 HK dollars per night, roughly $300 US per night, not including service charges and taxes. I thought that this was an excellent value for the hotel, as I compared it to the 3500 HKD rate at the Island Shangri-la (admittedly a slightly better hotel overall) next door, as well as even higher rates at the Four Seasons and the historic Peninsula on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong.The best aspect of the Conrad was the superior service, from the moment of arrival to our departure. Every little detail was taken care of in what appeared to be a genuinely sincere manner. None of the snootiness that accompanies the service at many 5-star city hotels in the US and in some European cities. In fact, I find that hotel service in Asia seems to be superior in general terms as compared to that in other areas of the world. The location of the hotel is somewhat up for debate, in my humble opinion. The hotel is fantastic for those interested in the immediate availability of a wealth of shopping, immediate below the hotel in Pacific Place Mall. Most of it is high-end designer label shopping. If you are travelling from the US, though, I'd window shop only in the high-end stores that are plentiful in Pacific Place and throughout Hong Kong, as the prices translate to substantially more, for the most part, than you'd pay in the same stores in the States. Shopping in Hong Kong is all about the bargain fare found at the Street Markets, but even then bargains are much rarer than they once were. If your interest is being right in the heart of the action, however, the hotels above Pacific Place (The Conrad, the Island Shangri-la, and the JW Marriott) do not exactly fit the bill. The luxury Central District Hotels that fit the bill better in this regard are The Landmark Mandarin Oriental and the Ritz-Carlton (although the latter is even a little off-center, but is convenient to various ferries). The best harbor views in Hong Kong are actually probably on the Kowloon side looking across to the more plentiful lights of the Central disctrict. The best hotels for view, therefore, are the Peninsula (new tower only, as the Space Musuem obstructs the views of the original hotel building), the Intercontinental, and the Sheraton. The Kowloon Shangri-la also probably provides good views, but a little off-center.The things that we found were not to be missed included: gazing at the lights from both sides at night, riding the very cheap Star Ferry at least a couple times, at least once during the day and once at night, riding up the tram to Victoria Peak for the incredible views, wandering the street markets, visiting the very well done Museum of History, having dim sum as many times as possible. For food, I can vouch for excellent dim sum in the restaurant in the Hong Kong Cultural Center (I think it was called Serenade), including a stunning harbor view as well, and also at the Metropolitan restaurant in the Pacific Place Mall. We also had excellent dinners at the Square Restaurant at the Exchange Square as well as at the wonderfully historic Luk Yu Teahouse on a small side street in Central. The last thing that I'll mention is that we did go to Macau as well on a daytrip. A very interesting boat ride there and back. The juxtaposition of old Portugese influence on the architecture mixed with the predominantly Chinese backdrop was quite interesting. The facade of St. Paul's Church was worth the visit, and the Macau Museum of History was OK, but otherwise I found most of the rest of the city to be rather unattractive. The trip can be skipped unless you must see St Paul's, the dichotomy of old Portugese rule with current Chinese governance, or are intent on gambling at one of the many casinos.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel but aged a bit My wife and I stayed at this hotel over the holiday season. I had stayed at this hotel previously on business trips and had always found its location as a convenient one. Apparently, this location was also fine for vacationers.The service was, as always, superb and probably perfect. I won't know what perfect is. We had meals at two of the hotel restaurants but both were unmemorable except that they weren't inexpensive. The Zen and others in the Pacific Place were better in my opinion.All aspect of hotel service was excellent even as compared with other five-star hotels in Asia. The hotel facility has aged a bit but it's being improved. Still, this hotel will be my first choice for my next trip to Hong Kong.

<Content>Fantastic Renovation, Rooms 55FL and Above I travel to Hong Kong bi-weekly and a good night's rest is very important to me. I previously always stayed at the Ritz due to the wonderful service and intimate rooms.I now choose the Conrad, especially given my preference to stay in the newly renovated rooms. Make sure to request these rooms, new decor, furniture, cloth, etc. Great bathrooms, separated shower and bath tub.Service is good, price is a bit high, but seems everything in Hong Kong is rising too. Excellent location for shopping and a cab's ride from any major office building as well.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel, Wonderful Service The Conrad Hong Kong is a wonderful experience from check in to check out. The lobby is modern and glamorous and the bar area inviting in the evening, complete with a good jazz trio performing standards.The rooms are surprisingly large and the views of the skyline and Victoria Harbor are breathtaking. The turn-down service was a very nice touch indeed! Every service we required, from room service to shipping packages, was handled with expert service and panache. The breakfast buffet was bountiful and fresh everyday. I would definitely recommend the Conrad to anyone visiting Hong Kong, either for pleasure or for business trips. It is not an inexpensive hotel but you definitely get what you pay for in this instance. It is one of my new favorite hotels in the world.

<Content>Conrad the hotel that makes you feel at home I stay at the conrad for the couple of time. The last time (Nov. 05), I got a room on a higher floor (56). The decoration is so elegant but relaxed. All amenties were for guests to feel at home. Room attendant was also highly trained and they had a high service mind. The location is perfect, in the Pacific Place, a paridise for any shoppers.I recommend this hotel for all.

<Content>Conrad - Club Level I was travelling alone and got upgraded to a Club Level room. Having breakfast on the 59th floor is an experience I am looking forward to repeating.This is certainly a top-class property. It makes you hesitate between staying here or the Peninsula.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Conrad for 5 nights, while visiting HK to sight-see and visit friends. We found the hotel to be excellent. The room was very clean and a good size, with a great bathroom. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is in an excellent location. It is next to Hong Kong Park, which is a quiet oasis, but within a few minutes walk of the Aberdeen MTR station, which means very quick and inexpensive access to most areas.

<Content>Great hotel Fantastic hotel as you will have seen from the other reviews. Nice touches like the teddy bear by the bed and the duck by the bath.Very central for business travellers and there is an MTR station below the hotel in Pacific Place, a massive shopping centre but not cheap!The only slightly negative thing I could say about the hotel is to do with the swimming pool location. The hotel is next to the Shangri-la hotel and in the afternoon the Shangri-la blocks the sun from the pool.Other than that the place is faultless.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised The Conrad is a wonderful hotel that I would recommend to anyone visiting Hong Kong. The room was spacious and immaculate and the bed was extremely comfortable...even better than the famed beds at the Four Seasons. Everyone was extremely polite and courteous. The hotel is also conveniently located near the subway and shopping center. I would definitely go back.
