<Content>Good place to crash before/after SeaTac flight We stayed at the Red Roof Inn for a night between flights. A complimentary shuttle arrived within minutes of ringing them on the courtesy phone at the airport. The reception area, like the building itself, is plain but functional. The front-desk night staff was friendly and kept registration simple to make it short.Our room was at the end of two long corridors (a new wing, by the looks of it).The room itself was a pleasant surprise: well-appointed, immaculately clean, comfortable beds, with little but thoughtful features that many more upscale places lack, such as a desk with conveniently located power and Ethernet outlets, a good desk lamp, a sink separate from the bathroom itself and 鈥?don't laugh 鈥?thick toilet paper and sensibly sized bath soaps.There are no coffeemaking facilities in the room and no dining room (just an area with drinks machines), and I can't vouch for the area, but if you need a clean and pleasant place to crash before or after a flight at SeaTac, this is worth considering. One downside: Boingo isn't one of the roaming internet options.

<Content>Great Stay and they have NEW ROOMS!! I stayed there after they oened the new rooms and it was great. It is not the same property it was last year. They have new management, new staff and brand new rooms. It's about time they did something to change the attitude' of this property. It's right across from the main gate of SeaTac airport and less than a 3 minute shuttle ride. Not a lot of frills, no coffee in the room but they did have ironing boards and the staff was SUPER! Nice to see positive changes here!!!!

<Content>Basic but fine I've stayed at this place twice now, once by myself and once with my wife. It's a mile or so from SeaTac Airport, and they have a shuttle running from there to the hotel -- every half-hour. So, you may have to wait a little but that's fine with me.The hotel is a bit old and needs a paint job in places, but that doesn't bother me. Both times I've stayed my room has been clean and functional.I've found the staff very friendly and accommodating. In particular, they are willing and happy to use a shuttle to drive you to places in the area. On my first visit they drove me to a local cinema, about 2 miles away, and picked me up again afterwards.

<Content>Placed Worked Out Fine For Me I was arriving in SEA after midnight and traveling with two German Shepherd pups that I was delivering to clients. I wanted an affordable place for the short stay that was pet friendly and had a free airport shuttle. This place fit the bill. After some of the previous reviews I decided to pack my own linens and pillow; unnecessarily.When I called from the airport for the shuttle I was politely told that the shuttle driver (who I later found out doubled as security guard) was out sick and to summon a cab and they would pay the driver. We (pups and I) conveniently boarded the first cab I saw and they were true to their word. Upon check-in the desk clerk mentioned that since I must be tired she had already filled out my check-in form and all I had to do was sign it. Although hotel policy states they accept one well-behaved pet I was traveling with two young pups which I wheeled through the lobby in their crate unnoticed . I didn't inspect microscopically or anything but didn't see any filth or grime as mentioned in previous reviews. My room of ample size and was clean and comfortable. To their discredit I was informed at check-in that since the hotel was under renovation the water would be shut off from 9 that morning until 5. This meant in order to shower I would only be able to sleep about 6 hours. Had I known that beforehand I wouldn't have stayed there.I took their shuttle back to the airport to rent a car around noon. The driver was most professional and polite as was everyone I encountered who worked there except one. The daytime desk clerk/manager was indifferent in service: not really bad or good. She seemed ready for a career change. When I asked her about the free continental breakfast that was mentioned on the confirmation page of my booking she kind of coldly informed me that they no longer offer any sort of breakfast. No apology or concern. There was an automated coffee machine featuring a few different type of coffee drinks.All in all this place was okay for the less than 12 hours I was there. To me it was not nearly as bad as I had feared.There was a letter in the room announcing that the entire hotel was under 6 months of renovation. Those of you who stay there after it's complete please remember those of us who suffered without hot water for you. :)

<Content>Make Another Choice! This hotel is under renovation, however it's no excuse for lack of cleanliness or professionalism.Upon entering the hotel for the evening; encountered a local 'working girl' complaining to front desk about how they had wrecked her 'night.' Do not expect more than 2 small towels for 2 people. ** WARNING ** Do Not expect to receive a receipt of your stay or payment if you book through Expedia. Tried to speak with the Site Manager and told he was a travel. Tried calling the 800 number, and was connected twice with a remote 'work at home' customer service contractor, was on hold for 7 minutes and 51 second the 1st time, and 5 minutes 31 seconds the 2nd time. It's 3 days later and still no response.The bed was terrible, we rolled to the center.The parking lot was dark and uncomfortable. Wish I had brought my shower shoes -- not the cleanest place.Spend a little more $$$ for good customer service, cleanliness and safety.

<Content>Dangerous, Hookers, Broken Utilities Hookers passed out in the hall, bathrooms that flooded, topped off by the SWAT team bursting in down the hall at 2 am. This hotel was so dangerous that we complained about the drunk We didn't even have our luggage out of the rental car before two guys got in a screaming fight and ran right past us. It got better a few hours later when a hooker passed out in the hall in front of the room next door and our sleep was interrupted when the SeatTac SWAT team arrived after a dispute between a lady of the evening and a hotel guest that involved a weapon. Our daughters room flooded, but the front desk staff couldn't come upstairs as the clerk wasn't allowed to leave the desk. To top it off they failed to give us a ride to the airport at scheduled and we had to call a cab at the last minute. This is a DANGEROUS place to stay and there is a reason it is cheaper then the other hotels on the same street.

<Content>Do Not Stay Here This place was horrible! We checked in after a flight from Phoenix and the clerk was complaining that she had too much money in the drawer and if she was audited by the sheriff, she would be in big trouble cuz we don't want to get robbed. WHAT? That should have been my first clue to RUN! We get to our room and it had to be 90 degrees since the heater was on! We shut it down and turned on the AC to cool it off. Gross.Bed was like sleeping on plywood. When we left in the morning, we noticed the room across from ours had been bolted shut with L brackets. This must have been where the filmed the movie Vacancy.Spend more cash and stay at the Ramada next door...at least it looks better!I also complained to their Customer Relations department and am awaiting a reply!

<Content>Acceptable for a short visit I stay in Seattle for only short (8-10 hour) periods; waiting for an International flight. If I had read the reviews I might have selected a different hotel. I usually stay at the La Quinta (SeaTac) but rates have steadily gone up to where they are almost $100 night. The Red Roof, on the other hand, was about $50. The room was quite acceptable. Wake-up call on time. Did not use their shuttle as I had a car. The facilities are a little 'banged' up and could use some management attention. Probably would stay again given the price/value relationship.

<Content>You Get What You Pay For!!!!! The hotel lists a shuttle service to and from the airport, without telling you that it runs on a specific schedule. So, have extra money for a cab! We checked in and asked for a wake up call, which we never got, that in turn made us late to meet the shuttle to the airport that left us by one minuete! He returned while we were waiting for a cab, but of course he was on a 'schedule' and we'd have to wait or take a cab. We took the cab! Traveling with two kids is hard enough, but the hotel staff didn't make it any easier! I guess you get what you pay for.

<Content>Dirty place Hotels.com gave this hotel a 2 star review. I assumed it would be a basic clean, comfortable place. It was not! The entire hotel was dirty. The elevator walls had dirt streaks and peeling tiles. And then it was broken for most of the day! The rooms were in worse shape. Sheets had small holes, some room doors were damaged with chipped wood and stains and peeling veneer. The continental breakfast is supposed to go until 9 am. I came down at 8:15 am. Almost everything was gone, and I was told that was it for that day. It was only white bread, cereal, and some cut up fruit anyway, but there was nothing to pick through. No milk left, either.

<Content>Terrible I travel for work all the time and this was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. While there the cleaning staff went thru my suit case and stole my personal information and used it to pay their personal bills on line. When I called management it took days for them to return my call and they were no help at all.

<Content>Stay Far Away Our family of four arrived at the hotel at 10:30 pm after a long flight to Seattle from Washington, D.C. Some of my judgement may be clouded by the fact that it was 1:30 am our time, and I was very tired.Check in was very slow. Only one computer was working and there was a long wait. The desk staff did not seem very competent in speeding things along. Many guests coming into the lobby appeared drunk or that they needed to get a room. The whole check in time took 30 minutes (the longest I have ever experienced).When we finally got to our room, the air conditioning was running full blast and the temperature was about 60 degrees--not so good since it was raining and we were cold and wet. There was also a large fly zooming around the room. Otherwise the room seemed clean.The continental breakfast consisted of a loaf of bread, jelly, peanut butter, 2 types of cereal, a coffee machine and fruit salad. I expected a little more variety. Check out was fine, but next time I think we'll pay a little more for better service.

<Content>Terrible Hotel Stayed here one night in room #136. While checking in at 2:30 pm, reminded front desk clerk of our request for a crib for our 19 month old daughter (made request when room was reserved on website). Clerk said that since they'd had a problem with guests stealing the cribs, they had only one crib for entire hotel. I stopped her mid-checkin and said that we would need a crib or we'd have to cancel our reservation. She said we'd probably have a hard time finding a room at that time, that hotels call them all the time asking if they have any rooms available. I told her I'd have to take my chances, because our daughter doesn't sleep with us and I didn't want her to roll off of the bed while we slept. She then left the front desk and told me to watch for customers while she went and checked to see about the crib. She came back maybe five minutes later, said she'd found the crib and it was folded up by the elevator on the first floor. She said we'd need to get it and take it to our room, due to being short-staffed. I said fine and she checked us in.We found the crib by the elevator, and my husband and I carried it to our room and set it up. It was, however, missing any sort of sheet to go over the flimsy mattress. We called down to the desk, asking if we could possibly get a sheet to go over the plastic mattress. There was another clerk on duty by this time, because she seemed confused and asked if was our crib that we brought from home. We told her it was the hotel crib, put us on hold, then said that we should grab a maid in the hallway to get one, because they had no way to get one up to our room. The then called back a few minutes later and said that they had one at the front desk, but we'd need to come down and get it. Fed up, we were on our way down when we finally ran into a maid who gave us a clean sheet for the crib.OK, as if this whole experience with the crib was not headache enough, room #136 was an absolute dirthole. The room itself was about as shabby as a room can be, and looked like it had not been updated since 1975. Absolutely terrible. The bathroom was disgusting, cracked tub and unfinished wall around plumbing. We will never stay here again and suggest you stay away! We stayed at the Hampton Inn at Seatac last year and plan to stay there next year before flying out. It was more expensive this year, so I went for the cheaper room ($72 online). Spend 10-20 more and stay someplace nice! You'll be better rested for your flight!

<Content>This is a dirt hole!! This is the dirtiest place I have seen ever. Everything is so disgusting, the bed, the floors, the bathroom, the smell. There were hair everywhere and the dirt on the floors piled up. Under the beds it looked like a trash can. It was loud and not even cheap.STAY AWAY!

<Content>Not superb, not horrible--just OK We stayed at the Seattle airport Red Roof Inn for one night in May as a stopover to our final destination. The facility seemed older and in need of updating, but nothing was dirty or broken--the carpet in the hallways just seemed a bit worn. We arrived late but there were still a few parking spaces left in the lot. Our room had two very comfortable queen sized beds, a table with chairs, a TV and a lowboy type dresser. There was a hair dryer and shampoo, but no other in-room amenities. Our room did NOT smell like smoke at all. We didn't use the air conditioner/heater, but the shower worked well and the water was hot. T-mobile wireless internet access was available for a fee; we brought our own laptop and bought a day pass for t-mobile, and it worked out very well. Overall I don't have any real complaints about this place. It isn't a luxury hotel but it's adequate, and for the price, we were not disappointed.

<Content>Absolutely disgusting! My family and I reserved a room at the Red Roof Inn on recommendation from our travel agent. I honestly don't know WHAT she was thinking recommending this place!We needed to catch an early flight out so we checked in around 9pm and were out by 4:30am the next morning. I don't even know where to begin with my complaints. When we went upstairs to our suite, it smelled of smoke, so I went to open the window. I found there were no screens on the windows and we were on the 2nd or 3rd floor. This was supposed to be a family friendly room! Very dangerous. Then I went into the bathroom and found the toilet had been used and not flushed! When I tried to flush it, it was broken. I went to the front desk and asked for another room and they did move us promptly. But that room wasn't much better. The toilet flushed but I'm not sure it had been cleaned. There were unequal amounts of towels in the bathroom and some were mysteriously crusty. The wallpaper was peeling in several spots. The beds were hard, walls were thin, the carpeted floors and woodwork were dusty, and I could hear the person in the next room snoring as well as road and airport noise all night long.

<Content>Awful place don't stay here! This was one of the worst places we've ever stayed. When my husband went to the lobby to check us in the person behind the desk wouldn't look up at him for several minutes. When we requested additional pillows (back problem) we were told the entire hotel didn't have any extra. After we got to our room, my children needed to use the restroom so they took turns going in while we unloaded. When I finally stepped into the bathroom there was a pile of towels sitting outside the tub, I assumed one of my kids played with the towels but after asking them and upon further inspection of the bathroom, we realized it hadn't yet been cleaned!!! GROSS!!! Eventually we were moved to a different room, at this point it was very late and we had a very early flight to catch. So, we asked the front desk to please put us on the list for the 4:30am shuttle, they told us that they don't do reservations for shuttles it's first come first serve. My husband and I woke up early got the kids and stuff down to the lobby by 4:33am and we were told we were too late for the 4:30am shuttle. Since we could see the van outside we asked again, politely if we could just go ahead now. The flat answer was no, another van will leave in a half an hour. So, my family waited in the lobby for another half hour even though we were only 3 minutes late! Upon our return to Seattle we were supposed to call for their shuttle van to let them know what time we were arriving. So, we called from our cell phone when we landed, then we were told we needed to go find a special phone out in the parking garage and call from it. We complied and were promptly told the shuttle van was busy for the next couple of hours (a trip into Downtown Seattle had just left?!) and we could find a taxi and the hotel would pay for it. Well, we're a large family and we didn't all fit in one taxi but we also didn't want to be separated (twin infants) so this caused my husband to demand that they send us a van that would hold all of us. Apparently they finally called in a favor with the parking lot next door to them and we were shuttled over there. When my husband went to get the car the manager did try to make things right by offering us a free night's stay. We're not sure we'll ever use it but it was a nice gesture. Hopefully the management will be able to train it's staff to care for their guests better. My final recommendation would be to find somewhere else until they do.

<Content>Renovations are coming.. I have stayed at this Red Roof Inn countless times in the past years.While I have to agree that some aspects of this hotel have certainly declined in the past 2 years (especially the cleanliness and general upkeep), I was assured by the Manager of the Hotel that a complete renovation is coming and they should have all new Rooms- redesigned in the Red Roof style that you can already see in many Red Roofs around the country.For the staff, I have to say they are always friendly and accommodating to me and I never had a problem that was not resolved to my satisfaction.Many of the Front Desk staff has been there for years.In general this Hotel is one of the best deals around the airport (believe me, I checked around many times) and if you can do without room service and do not need a bellhop I would certainly recommend this Hotel. It is not a 5 Star Luxury establishment but gives you a good nights rest at a very reasonable rate.

<Content>Ideal one night stopover Stayed one night between flights. Arrived 11.30pm and left 9am. For our purposes it was ideal - comfortable beds, good shower with lots of hot water, friendly satff and a free airport shuttle. The coffee, juice and donuts are fine till you get to where ever you plan to have beakfast. If like us you want cheap and convenient for one or two nights this is the place, if you are on holiday splash out and go somewhere with a pool and resturant.

<Content>Convenient and very satisfactory accommodations. We stayed at this hotel on Nov. 28, 2006, the night before taking an early flight to Atlanta. For our $57.87, inclusive of the myriad of state and local taxes, we had a large room with two double beds, a decent bathroom, non-smoking. The room was spacious and well-kept. Since we had to leave before 6 am, we had to miss the continental breakfast offered. Personnel at check-in and check-out were polite and helpful, notwithstanding being very busy. Restaurants are easy to reach by car and even walking would not take more than 10 minutes to get to. Free airport shuttle both coming to the hotel and returning to airport was on time and service was friendly and polite. We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. Good value.

<Content>Never Again We stayed in this hotel in July of 2006 and we will never do it again. Our non-smoking room smelled of smoke worse than the smoking room our travelling companions had, the halls and elevator were filthy and we had several hundred dollars worth of shoes taken from our locked vehicle. There are no signs posted and their corporate offices refused to reimburse us because they do not consider the area high risk despite information to the contrary.

<Content>Don't stay here! Over the years, we have been very satisfied, but this time, things were very run down. The carpets, floors and elevator were dirty and grimy. Things looked old.Our room key card had to be re-programmed 3 times before it worked. Our section of the motel borders private homes, and the noise from an all night party outside could not be drowned out by the air conditioning unit.The toilet ran all night.We won't be staying ther again.

<Content>Ugh...AwfulG!! I chose this hotel based on the reviews here....and was horrified. Really musty, nasty smell in the rooms, stained carpeting and chairs, hooks ripped off the door and light out in bathroom, beat-up furniture. No assistance with baggage, coffee machines broken in the breakfast room, van driver dropped us off at the opposite end of the airport from our airline.There is not one thing to recommend here!

<Content>Cheap, nice stay near the airport This is an older but fairly well-maintained hotel. The only wear I noticed was the carpet in the foyer and the room doors. The rooms were spacious and clean. The decor and mattresses were OK. There is a free gourmet coffee machine for guests in the foyer, and free breakfast. There is no pool, but there is a small workout room. There isn't much to do in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, but if you want a comfortable stay near the airport, this one would be fine.

<Content>Good hotel for the price This hotel was a decent hotel for the price. The only problem we experienced was being able to hear the next room's TV and it wasn't on a show that I would want children to hear. Wasn't bothered by airplane noise, just the TV in the next room. Just be sure to BRING EARPLUGS. Even with the thin walls, I would stay again. Hotel staff said there will be a $5 Million dollar renovation in Nov 06, so I hope the prices don't go up.

<Content>Good hotel for a good price I stay at a lot of Red Roof Inns and would rate this one above average. It has inside hallways and is conveniently located next to the airport. Sure this means you hear some cars and planes in the distance, but it's more gray noise then anything else. The AC unit is litterally louder.The rooms are clean and everything is in working order all the times I stayed there. I like the fact that the rooms are very large which is nice if you have to stay a couple of days. The bed is very comfortable.The continental breakfast in the morning is okay. There is a selection of donuts, muffins, and bagels as well as an assortiment of jam and butter. Of course there is coffee and tea to choose from, and the new coffee machine they just introduced actually produces a decent cup of coffee.If you are looking to stay somewhere close to the airport and are looking for a good value I would recommend this hotel. I've stayed here many times and was never let down.

<Content>Cheapest Decent Hotel I Could Find The rooms are very large and quiet and the beds comfortable. Rooms come with a coffee maker and iron but no ironing board. There was a iron burn in the carpet and we suspect someone tried ironing on the floor and left the iron in place too long. For Internet access, each phone has a data port so you can hook a modem into it; but you must have a phone number of your ISP to dial in. My room looked out on a residential area and in spite of the fact that the hotel is located on a very busy road, the room was quiet. My wife detected a faint odor of urine in one corner of our room but not strong enough to get us to request a new room. We suspect a previous guest had a pet with them in the room and it soiled the floor in the corner. There was no soap or shampoo in the bathroom so I went to the room service to get some and was given a handful of wrapped soaps but was told that shampoo is not provided. Normally Red Roof Inn does not provide free breakfast but this one is the exception. They provide muffins, bread or bagels with peanut butter, jelly, cream cheese, and margarine, and three kinds of dounuts. There is coffee with sugar but no milk; if you want milk you must use powdered whitener. I stayed at this hotel four years ago while visiting Seattle and knew what to expect. This time I stayed here one night on my way to the airport. The Red Roof Inn was the cheapest hotel I could find and in my opinion it served its purpose.

<Content>Poor Quality. Stay here only if you absolutely have too. Terrible sound proofing. located on a noisy street corner with take off jets a block away. No pool , no whirlpool, no high speed internet,no hair dryer, no ironing board, no free shampoo, free breakfast was terrible, with no variety. Room had stains on the ceiling. Old room carpeting, old furniture made the room feel dirty. Poor lighting made reading difficult. Avoid this place, stay only if you have too.

<Content>terrible Bad experience. Would not pick me up at the airport - told me to take a taxi because their driver was not available and they would reimburse me when I got there! Had to wait a long time for shuttle back to airport in the morning because again driver was not around. Room old and dingy. Never again.

<Content>A Pretty Nice Hotel In my opinion, this hotel is worth the price. My family and I stayed here for one night, as a stop over on the way to Canada. The breakfast that they serve here is excellent! Had many things to choose from, such as the typical coffee/juice, however they also had hot chocolate and many varieties of tea. Then there was donuts, muffins, bread, bagels and fruit. It had more than the other hotels my family and I stayed at.On the other hand, there was a downside to our stay here. Throughout the night we could hear the people above us walking! It was such a drag to hear each step they took during the hours of 1-5am!! I don't know if the ceiling/floor is just thin or what. But overall, it was a comfy room, with a spacious bathroom.
