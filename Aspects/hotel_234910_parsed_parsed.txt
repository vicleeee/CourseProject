<Content>A Class Act The Branderburger Hof IS A CLASS ACT. A clue is in the name, and is quickly confirmed on arrival. THE RED CARPET is permanent, and you may catch sight of ANGELA MERKEL arriving for a function.There is an understated sense of quality about the BRANDENBURGER HOF which should sit easily with discerning British guests. Once inside, you appreciate the skilful mix of traditional and modern which makes the BH quite simply THE best hotel in BERLIN. The staff are friendly and attentive; the cuisine modern and clean; the roomscomfortable and well appointed.As with all such class acts the key is management. Both the owner DANIELA SAUTER and the GM MARKUS OTTO GRAF are visible and the staff react accordingly. NOTHING IS TOO MUCH TROUBLE, AND IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE THAT THEY CAN ARRANGE ACCESS TO EVENTS FEW IF ANY CAN MATCH.Although not a spa hotel the BH can organise a great range of treatments for the weary or those who just want pampering.THE WINE LIST OFFERS OVER 900 EXAMPLES OF GERMAN WINES WHICH IS UNEQUALLED ANYWHERE. FOR THOSE IN NEED OF RAPID RECHARGING THE BH IS WITHOUT EQUAL.

<Content>Always great I have been to this hotel a few times - and it is always great. If you book a hotel transfer from the airport you have water and magazines in your car. What even more amazed me the first time I stayed at the hotel is - when the doorman open the car door for me he greeted me immediatly with my name, even though he had never seen me before!The rooms are modern and very comfortable. Great are the small treats you get each day in your cream, such as small cakes, fresh fruits etc. Even when travelling alone, you get it for two - yummi! The breakfast is to die for! And dinner in the Michelin starred restaurant is a must too. You will definitely be looked after in this hotel!

<Content>Very nice Moved to this hotel for one night as we were too disappointed about our first hotel. We were happy with the swop.Very professional and friendly staff.Hotel has a little design without being over done. A feature I really appreciate. Nice and small boutique hotel.Breakfast was pricy but really good and had a lot of varieties.Location superb for shopping at the Ku'damm but a little far from more bohemian eastern Berlin.Mostly older guests.Rooms spacious.Will be back.

<Content>Wear a nice suit Stayed in this hotel as part of my honeymoon - booked four nights, limo pick up from airport with fruit  champagne on arrival included. Arrived into Berlin at 11PM, no sign of the limo, rang the desk and they had no record of my reservation. No mention of them sending a taxi so I made my own way to the hotel. More fun on arrival - I had to produce a copy of the email they sent me confirming my reservation before they believed me. Fair enough; things happen. A room had to be made up and we were left standing in the lobby, no offer of a coffee or something stronger while we waited. When the room was ready we were brought up and we had to get into an argument with a cranky but well dressed concierge before the champagne and fruit was provided. We'd arrived from Salzburg after a long train journey from Austria and had dressed accordingly. On arrival we were tired, shaken and looked it. I can't help thinking that if I was wearing a swanky suit I would have got a lot more satisfaction.That said it's a beautiful hotel and the staff were very helpful for the rest of our stay. Great uniforms!

<Content>Understated luxury Superb and discreet service are among the many positives of the hotel. Most of the staff is fluent in English and almost always cheery. the hotel is a short distance from the famous KaDeWe store and the Kurfurstendam.The room was - #417 - very spacious with three windows overlooking the hotel's central courtyard. Apart from a gigantic bathroom with two sinks and a large tub there was a separate toilet room with its own sink. WiFi service is fee based but of a high quality. The restaurant - Quadriga - has an amazing multi course tasting menu that has a range of delicately flavored mediterranean items and a slew of freebies from the chef. Be prepared for a very long stay as a four course dinner can last nearly 3 hours.The negatives include the absence of a gym and the somewhat slow elevators.

<Content>Great Boutique Business Hotel in the Heart of Berlin Great boutique hotel in the Heat of Berlin, with a couple of minutes walk from Ku'damm. For the price of a standard room in an international chain, you get to stay in this fine old-school hotel that is quiet, private and very central.Every time I stay in Berlin on Business I choose to stay here. Great Concierge, Exceptionally helpful and knowledgeable staff, fantastic breakfast and one of the best restaurants in Berlin, with a great selection of wines and great sommelier.(But the seats in the breakfast room are seriously uncomfortable).Great business location with lots of sofas/tables to meet clients.The rooms are a little minimalist, with a black and green theme, but the beds are exceptionally comfortable, and the hotel is very quiet. There is no gym.When staying here, you feel you are staying in a very personable 10 bedroom hotel rather than large international hotel.

<Content>Nice, but not my cup of tea. A very nice hotel, gives the feeling of being smaller than it actually is. I found the minimalist approach in the rooms a bit sterile to be honest and have seen it done better elsewhere (Hotel Josef in Prague for one). The restaurant setting is really good but the service at dinner was a tad slow, and overly fussy. Good to try but you wouldn't want to go through the little plate menu every night - shame because the flavours were sensational! Breakfast was interesting and certainly unique - but would become tedious quite quickly.Staff were really friendly and I wouldn't disagree with any of the other reviews.Short weekend in Berlin - perfect. Lone Business traveller - probably not.Not the best I've stayed in by a long way, but certainly in the top half.

<Content>Like a Home in Berlin I have stayed in many hotels in Berlin but this is my favourite. It is a short walk from the KadeWe department store and the main shopping area of the Ku'damm but is located in a charming residential street . The decor is wonderful - ditto the breakfast which is served on Royal Prussian Porcelain in the gorgeous wintergarden. We dined at the hotel's Michelin-starred Quadriga resturant which fully deserves its rating. When the staff bring each dish to your table - they come out of a door as if by magic. The real crown for any wine lover is the 850 bottle Treasure Trove of German Wines - a wine cellar that has won numerous international awards. Every member of staff we encountered was helpful, welcoming and couldn't do enough. Etro toiletries in the bathroom, beautiful bathrobes, nice little touches like a brass statue of a dog at the main door. Because I travel so much in the course of my job I experience five star hotels all over the world but I consider the Brandenburger Hof to be something really special

<Content>Not worth the expense This is a boutique hotel, 5 minutes walk from the Ku'Damm and 10 minutes from KaDeWe. The rooms are clean and stylishly furnished and the beds are comfortable. The staff are polite and helpful and breakfast is plentiful, well presented and served in the conservatory which surrounds the oasis that is the central, Japanese inspired courtyard garden.However, only the demi-suites are airconditioned. We booked a 3 night package in a standard room and didn't realise this. We were allocated a room at the front of the hotel. The weather was hot and humid and there was a lot of noise from the traffic and the building works in the flats opposite so we couldn't have the windows open. After one night, we explained the difficulties and asked if we could move. We were told that they had a demi-suite available but we would have to pay for the upgrade. 拢82.00 per night is a lot to pay for the privilege of being cool and quiet and it really took the shine off our trip. We wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Class act 4.9 star hotel - but not all rooms are airconditioned! There is virtually no way to give any negative review comments about this hotel. It is a true 5 star, in my opinion, in every way. BUT, there is one significant exception. The single rooms do not, I repeat DO NOT have air-conditioning. Perhaps this is not a regular issue but given that it was 31C on the day of my arrival it was absolutely horrendous. Essentially, you must upgrade to a demi-suite at a significant price increase to garner AC.Perhaps I am just a spoiled American, but at north of $300 a night I do think that having AC is not totally unreasonable.They, otherwise, take care of every whim that you may have including a breakfast that is the most elegant that I have ever experienced in any locale. A courtesy limo to/from the airport, complimentary bottle of champagne, Michelin rated restaurant. The clientele of this 78 room hotel included, on my day of departure, an Italian diplomat who received a 20 man police escort and motorcade. The hotel is set two blocks from the K'Damm and, accordingly, very centrally located. There are tons of reasonable and quite good restaurants within a several block area. If you like Turkish food, one is less than 2 blocks away and the food is most excellent.Were it not for the AC, this hotel would receive 5 stars from me rather than the 4 that I have provided.

<Content>Very pleasant Only stayed one night (was in the room for about 6 hours) but struck me as a very pleasant and well run boutique hotel. Arrived in a group yet was individually escorted to my room, fresh fruit waiting, very friendly staff. Fantastic breakfast consisting of literally 20 courses served on tiny plates in a large stone garden room, naturally lit with creeping plants everywhere. Everything you touch has a german proverb attached, asked reception for a packet of cigarettes at midnight  they first placed it in a sleeve saying tobacco is the substance of dreams and relaxation or something and explained it to me in detail. Exceptionally well run, suit regular business traveller or a romantic getaway - rooms very modern and everything spotless, high attention to detail. My only complaint was that of the 7 pillows provided per bed I surprisingly couldn't find one of a comfortable size but manufacturing a pile of 4 smaller ones did the trick. Would definately stay again.

<Content>Great stay - again Our second stay at Brandenburger Hof; the first was 2 years ago. Had a 1st floor suite (2nd floor US); had room noise from the conference rooms below both early and late with set-up and take down. Ask for one of the higher floor rooms. Service was excellent again, although it seemed less intimate this time, and the server staff at the bar disappears. Breakfast is good. The one thing in need of help is the Wintergarden seating - totally uncomfortable. The Wintergarden is beautiful. The location is great for everything you want and it is in a residential neighborhood. The front desk, door and the concierge are top notch for help, from the 100 bus to dining. I'll keep staying here when we go to Berlin.

<Content>Terrific Hotel We just spent three nights at the Brandenburger Hof and I highly recommend this hotel. The decor is lovely, the rooms are spotless, the ambience very calming. Breakfast is traditional German with very interesting additions. You will enjoy the table linens and wonderful china and exceptional service. Management is doing a very fine job at this Hotel. It is obvious that there is a commitment to customer service and that the endeavor is a labor of love. The location is off the beaten path in a fairly quiet neighborhood but still close to a Ubahn station.

<Content>What a wonderful hotel! We stayed in the Brandenburg Hof in early August 2006. From the moment we arrived, to the moment we left, we found the hotel wonderful. we arrived in a heavy rainstorm, for which the porter apologised so profusely thathe seemed to consider it to be his own fault! The poor guy was soaked as he unloaded our bags from our car. We had booked a suite, and stayed in Suite Oberon. The bedroom  study area were a good size,and elegantly decorated with very individual pieces of furniture. I especially liked a wonderful area rug in the study. The bed was firm, but very comfortable. I noted that one reviewer commented on the quality of the duvets  pillows. In hindsight, the reviewer was right, but it did not impact on my enjoyment of the hotel, nor did I remark on it at the time. The Michelin-starred Quadriga restaurant was on summer break at the time of our visit, but the Quadriga Lounge provided a wonderful breakfast, quite unlike anything I've had elsewhere. The service in the restaurant, and throughout the hotel, was warm and efficient throughout our stay. I would highly reommend this property for anybody looking for something a deal different from the cookie-cutter 5 star properties that abound in Berlin.

<Content>a gem of a hotel We really enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel. The room was well appointed with classic design furniture overlooking a beautiful courtyard. The windows opened onto the courtyard for fresh air. The food was wonderful. The breakfast was the best we had ever enjoyed in a hotel. So beautifully presented. The location was also very convenient.Our only complaint was the quality of the synthetic duvet and pillow which were respectively very hot and lumpy and made sleeping difficult. A hotel of this standard should provide down (at least on request). We did request down pillows and we were treated as if we were completely unreasonable. They advised they didn't have any in the hotel - but if it was so important they would go out and buy 2 down pillows. They did go out and buy these pillows and made us feel uncomfotable about it until we left. So silly.Don't let this put you off - the other features of the hotel made up for this unnecessary incident.

<Content>Simply Superb! I stay in many excellent hotels around the world but the Brandenburger Hof is certainly top of my list! A wonderful, elegant, classy, friendly hotel with superb service! The decor is very tasteful and done with great flair. The decor does not feel as if a team of professional designers have 'done' the hotel but rather as if each item of furniture, piece of art etc has been specially chosen by the owner. The food is excellent and the breakfast is a treat! The greatest attribute of the hotel though is the staff. Everyone is friendly without being obsequious. My 11 year old daughter joined me for the weekend and everyone went out of their way to ensure she had a special time. There is nowhere else to stay in Berlin!

<Content>Lovely boutique hotel in the heart of Berlin With Berlin seeing a new five-star hotel opening every other month, the classics seem to remain the real thing. Located 5 minutes from the Western city center, Brandenburger Hof is set in a quiet residential side street. The hotel is a period building, just the right size for the traveller who looks for quiet comfort and personal service. The highlight is the Japanese-style courtyard, where you can sip your aperitif in a light-flooded winter garden, or have breakfast. Service is personal and very friendly. The rooms are nicely decorated, but probably a bit on the small side.

<Content>Wonderful hotel My wife and I have just returned from Berlin where we stayed at this wonderful hotel.Enchanting staff ,a lovely courtyard with a Japanese style garden ,excellent food ,delicious breakfast and a bottle of champagne delivered to our room just after we arrived free from the management ,all this adds up to a superb place to stay in this city.Only complaint was that the weather was very hot and our room had no air conditioning but this seemed to be a small price to pay for such a lovely place.

<Content>Pure Class!! This hotel is pure class. Superlatives won't do it justice; it simply must be experienced for itself. The rooms are filled with bauhaus treasures, the staff are charming, the breakfast is wonderful  served in a delightful, sunfilled covered courtyard. I simply cannot reccommend it highly enough to anyone wishing to visit Berlin.

<Content>The one and only Whenever we have business people to accomodate, the Brandenburger Hof is where we set them up. It's the best value that you can get for your money. With a breathtakingly beautiful (glass roofed) courtyard, extremely attentive staff, elegant, quiet rooms and georgeous food it is the most comfortable place to be in Berlin.

<Content>fabulous small hotel in berlin a friend told me about the hotel brandenburger hof in berlin, germany. it is a small hotel off the main street, close to shopping and the berlin zoo. the rooms overlooking the garden area are wonderfully furnished in the mies style. the concierge service was above and beyond and the front desk/door hotel staff were most gracious and accommodating. the die quadriga restaurant is a must with food and service both excellent. this is a hotel to remember if you are traveling to berlin. i contacted them directly for reservations.

<Content>Excellent in Every Way Ten nights at the Brandenburger Hof in May/June 2004. The staff are among the best trained I've encountered anywhere. The hotel has a refined and elegant atmosphere and a quiet location that is convenient for everything. Dinner at the Quadriga restaurant was amazing. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.

<Content>The Best in Berlin Amazing. Every superlative you read is correct. The staff is totally committed to serving your travel dining experience. The location is quiet, 1 block from the underground, 2 blocks from KuDamm, and where you want to be for shopping and comfort. Food (breakfast in the Wintergarden is a full-american breakfast); for dinner eat in the gourmet restaurant and go for the gourmet menu with wines. Concierge service is knowledgable and helpful. Granted, we had one of the 4 suites, but AWESOME and WOW (and thanks for ag reat stay) are the words we had upon our departure. We will return.

<Content>Fabulous hotel This hotel has been added to our short list of great hotels. The room was beautiful, the food fantastic, and the concierge was constantly trying to make our stay enjoyable. The staff was attentive without being cloying and it seemed that anything we needed or wanted, they made happen. One member of our party had lost some much needed medicine and the hotel called some personal contacts to get the medicine replaced. The most elegant and varied breakfast buffet I've ever seen. Somebody still knows how a hotel ought to be run!
