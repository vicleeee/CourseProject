<Content>Tired hotel. Needs a facelift First the good things - the hotel's position is first class. The hotel staff are most helpful and their English good.Now the not so good ... the room was very dated and a little shabby. It looked like it needed a good spring clean. The windows were filthy. One irritating thing - there was no milk with the complimentary tea/coffee making facilities. Surprising for Hong Kong - the hotel's wifi internet access was amazingly slow and incredibly expensive. A small cafe around the corner (which also offered a bargain breakfast) had free wifi access.What I didn't like. The square fronting the hotel became a cruising area for prostitutes as early evening fell and on most evenings there were prostitutes in the hotel lobby. The hotel security staff seemed not to care about this.

<Content>Does the job, but .... This is a well located hotel, near everything and next to Hong Kong Centre, despite traffic. The personnel talks very good english and there is a good attention, overall.However, I feel that it does not stands for what you are paying for. The rooms are old, I mean like from the 80's, the sheets of the bed were crushed, the mattres was a nightmare (it was so used it has several holes in it), the furniture was scratched, the rug was full of dust, the bathroom was dirty. And it seems it is like this in all hotel, because you need to look for example, when you go to cafeteria, how the place is.

<Content>Really good location Girlfreind and Istayed there whilst on shopping holiday . Rooms very clean , little dated , but overall everything worked and was tidy. Reception area was certainly well managed and staff were always happy to assist . The breakfast was supplied in our package and it was superior ,we found a huge breakfast was the best way to go before we set out on our daily activities the choices were fantastic and felt very satisfied all day TIP take a peice of fresh fruit when you laeve the breakfast room place it in your backpack and have it later on in the day .  I can only think of a couple of negatives about the accomadation and they were , Check your credit card balance after they take imprint of it I was shocked to find they took an authorisation of $1000 AUD as security over damages . This was not acceptable and they quickly changed it when I stated I worked for the Bank and they did not have my authorisation for that much with in 24 hours it was removed Be Mindful and Aware !!!!!!!Only other complaint I had was no fresh milk in fridge for Tea or Coffee only powdered . YUK they do not supply , so I bought my own

<Content>Great place in a great city We booked the Regal Club package and I wouldn't stay there without booking this. The hotel is fantastic with all the extra we got.The room was fantastic, a good sized room, LCD TV, broadband internet access, access to the gym, express checkin, 6pm check out.We had complimentary mini bar items each day, comped buffet breakfast each morning in the restaurant, afternoon nibblys and drinks in the Regal Club.We met several very nice couples in the club lounge and would recommend this to anyone. There were a lot of business travelers who seemed to be taking advantage of the Club lounge and conference room for business meetings also.Unfortunately no pool or sauna, but otherwise a great stay. The bed was turned down each afternoon, a morning paper and fresh fruit each day.We stayed on the top floor but missed out of the harbour view.I'm sure the Regal is a great hotel in its own right but, after the pampering of the Club off, I wouldn't have it any other way.Hope this is useful for anyone who reads it!

<Content>Good hotel Stayed 3 nights at this hotel - the first leg of my honeymoon.I e-mailed the hotel to say that we had an early flight into HK and this please have a room ready - however, we did have to wait around for 3 hours for a room to be made ready.The room and the hotel itself is good...and our room (superior) had plently of space! Didn't eat at the hotel - but plenty of resaurants around. Dont go and eat at the Ruby Staeak House round the corner - unless you have money to burn!Location wise - not too bad. Everything in HK is close by. I did like the fact that I could walk to the hotel after a large evening meal - and its was safe to do so. Would stay here again - if not then would love to stay at the Pennisula (need to save first though!)

<Content>Exec Level is the way to go We had a great 2 night stay here. The lobby was undergoing renovation and was very underwhelming. We were directed up to the Exec Level check in which was smooth and friendly. Unfortunately we couldnt have a room with a view but no problem, just kept the sheer curtains drawn. A non smoking room was requested and it was great- no smell of smoke at all.We had a twin bed room which was reasonably spacious. The decor was OK, neutrals and an Ipod docking station and plasma TV.The linens were all fresh and clean and I requested non feather pillows which arrived after 2 calls to housekeeping along with an adaptor plug.Bathroom was very well appointed, we recieved hotel toiletries then an additional range of Neutrogena products with the turn down later that evening. Water was hot with good pressure The shower is over the bath.The stay was made all the better for us because of the perks of the Exec floor. The cocktail hour( s) was great- nice lounge with gorgeous views and plenty of snacks and drinks (We later stayed at the Metropark Causeway Bay and the lounge there was not a patch on the Regals). We also had b/f included that could be taken in the lounge or in the cafe downstairs, we opted for the cafe- great food, big selection. Our room also included free airport transfers, we used the in bound one and it was free (I think a previous reviewer had been charged), we had the free minibar and in room snacks that were replenished daily, we also recieved a HK$500 credit on meals which meant that our buffet dinner on the 2nd night cost all HK $50!!!! Amazing value stay. I would stay here again for sure.

<Content>Nightmare Under no circumstances expect services from this hotel to be on par with the West (despite the exorbitant rates). The concierge in the lobby referred me to a boat tour of Hong Kong that seemed fine at first, but then the crew physically pushed me off of the boat on Hong Kong island, which meant I had to find my way back to Kowloon, and the Regal shuttle back to the Riverside hotel already left, which meant I had to take a taxi (at my own expense). This was not what I bargained for. Moreover, the assistant manager of the hotel pretty much blamed me for my lack of Cantonese language skills and left it at that. Then, when I finally got back to my miserable, overpriced room, the internet connection wasn't working. Then, they moved me into another room and refused to comp me for internet charges...then I made a stink about that, and then finally they did comp me for the internet (at about 11:30 p.m...a lot of good that did). I guess the water runs in this hotel (though the toilet water runs pungent all the time), but it doesn't warrant the price AT ALL. You're better off paying a bit more for actual quality. AVOID AVOID AVOID.

<Content>It's the Little Things Although we had had a wonderful stay at the Harbour View Hong Kong in 2006 we decided in 2007 to stay in a different location, somewhere closer to the centre of town, and based on reviews on this site we chose the Regal Kowloon. We negotiated a really great price for a suite by dealing with the hotel direct, and found them excellent to deal with. When we arrived in Hong Kong, our transfers were all in order and first impressions of the hotel were great. Then, oh no, it was the little things that nagged. Okay, the bed was a lovely big, very comfortable, king size, and the bathtub positively huge. The lounge furniture was comfortable, and we did actually score a room with a good view. However, then the little things started counting. For instance, during our stay I don't think there was one single night when both sides of the bed were turned down or when a chocolate was left for both of us - usually one side turned down and only one chocolate. The cupboards in the lounge area and the drawers in the bedroom all smelled strongly of damp. If we left the towels on the rail to say don't bother changing them they would be changed, whereas if we put them in the bath to indicate they should be changed this was ignored. The hotel boasts a choice of pillows, and we found that the ones in our room were so soft that it was almost as though you had no pillows at all, but it took about three requests from room service to get replacements. With the mini bar, sometimes things would be topped up, sometimes they wouldn't. When we asked for more tea bags we were given about a year's supply of tea but no coffee. Yes, there are freebies from the mini bar when you're in a suite, but oftentimes they simply weren't there, such as the crisps/Pringles. For the first two days of our stay we enjoyed these munchies with our drinks, but then the supply wasn't stocked up. After a couple of days I rang room service to ask about this and was told that no Pringles were available anywhere in Hong Kong. This sort of left me speechless, so I just accepted it and gave hubby the bad news, No Pringles in Hong Kong - almost as bad as the pub with no beer.I think the hotel has fantastic potential, and these are problems which an overhaul of housekeeping would iron out - oh, and the trouble we had explaining that we just wanted something ironed, not dry cleaned - and so they really are a management issue. Sure, the hotel is a bit dated, and, yes, in places the wall paper looks as though it wants to make a get-away, and, yes, the carpet could do with replacing, but the rates are great and the location is really fantastic, with superb restaurants like the Red Stone just over the road (to die for!!!!), and, as someone mentioned in an earlier post, that wonderful harbour walk just a minute away.If I was to go back to Hong Kong again I really don't think I'd go back to the Regal but would certainly check out some of the others in close proximity.

<Content>Past it's Prime First the location, its not that great, removed from Hong Kong Island. It's a fast trip on the subway, but spend the extra money and stay on Hong Kong Island. The hotel is VERY dated, I don't believe the hotel has been renovated since it was built in the 1980's. Also we where upgrated for free to the excutive floor and the room smelled bad. Also the wallpaper was pealing and bubbling. The overall experience was not one I would recommond to anyone.

<Content>Nice business hotel I stayed at the Regal Kowloon in October 2006, during a business trip.The hotel is nice. It is pricey, which is usual for Hong Kong.The room was of a good size.I would suggest to have breakfast outside as the breakfast buffet is very expensive and not so nice.Overall, a nice stay

<Content>Good Location, Service In Kowloon: I liked it a lot; No Complaints I stayed at this place for 5 nights in January 2008, for a conference, and was very satisfied. I suspect I paid less a lot less than market price. (PC Tours was the organizing travel agent for the conference, and they seem to know what they are doing).Spacious rooms, especially for Hong Kong, (I think I was in superior, upgraded from Standard).One can walk to the harbor, (Avenue of Stars), in 5 minutes for me, the nearest MTR station in 10, the museums in 5, and a square out the back, (Granville Square?), in 1, with plenty of eating places there, or nearby.I found the concierge service, and indeed all service friendly and efficient, again, especially for HK.The quilt on the bed was heavy and hot, and the air conditioning quirky and seemingly uncontrollable; but, after a brief conversation with the housemaid, a sheet and blanket were provided. -The rooms were quiet. I liked the place, for a corporate hotel. Check out the interesting statues in the lobby.

<Content>Nice This is our first time in this hotel, I know it thet it wouldn麓t be the same like Shangrila麓s Hotel, but the staying was good. I stayed at the suite room, was very big, but the bathroom was little, and the beds were very hard. The breackfast is included, american breackfast, ok, very complete. Very quiet, it麓s a good option, well located in Tsim Tcha Tsui.

<Content>Amanda, Singapore We stayed there for a week recently.. though our room located in non-smoking floor, there was strong smoke smell whenever we walked out from the room to lifts area. Staffs were annoyed and unfriendly started from check-in till we checked out. Room service was okay as we didn't expect too much. They hold 600+SG for a week after we checked out and back to home, Singapore. I had to called a couple of times to hotel account department to release that amount of $. Again, I received unfriednly tone over the phone. More over, they still charged to my card HKD120 after we checked out though I paid our room minibar consumption in cash when we checked out. I have been to HK for holidays a couple of times and this recent trip was the only set back for me to visit HK again. I will not book for this hotel again. If you want to enjoy your HK holidays, I won't recommand you to stay in this hotel.

<Content>Works for families We went to Hong Kong for 8 nights and then on to Shanghai and we stayed at this hotel as it was one of the only hotels that don't charge for 2 extra kids if sharing existing bedding. Please note though that we intended to buy a air mattress for them to sleep on, but don't bother looking as they don't exist in Hong Kong. So make sure to bring one with you if bringing kids. I read from other viewers that this hotel was out of way, this is far from the truth. Except from staying at the Shereton or Penisula which are in great spots,amd 3 to 4 times the price, i think that the Regal kowloon Hotel is in a wonderfull spot near very good hotel's like the Mandarin and interconinental hotels.The rooms are small and be sure to get the upgrade to a least the superior room. We payed $1000 hong kong per night, the cheapest i have seen is $950 on wotif.com. The Hotel looks like it was state of the art in say the mid eighties but hasn't got out of that era!. Lot's of gold splatterd throughout the lobby and lifts, does look a bit tack y. But at the end of the day it is clean, staff were helpfull and we found the spot great. as we didn't get breakfast included we found the Delifrance excellent over the road. They sell a hot breakfast with coffee for only $24 hong kong dollars, we ate there each day for the 8 nights we were there. Also there is a starbucks right across the road and a seven eleven for all needs including wine or beer/spirits. don't use mini bar!. I would say hotel is approx 700-800 meters to Nathan Rd and can travel this in the underground subway if raining. Make sure to ask for room with harbour view, we were in room 605(great view). There is only a handful of rooms with view as there is a big glass building in front.i would say only 4 rooms per floor have the harbour view like on their website.Thera are also many western restraunts/bars around this hotel and only maybe 100 meters from the harbour where their is the boardwalk and view of light show on every night at 8pm. Much better spot than a lot of hotels in Kowloon up Nathan Road which is grotty and where you get hassled by hawkers. I feel Kowloon is the best place to stay as you get to look at the wonderful view over to Hong Kong island. I think Nathan Rd is tacky and dirty.I much prefer Hong island for the shopping and wonderful restraunts near the peak esculator.To travel across to Hong Kong island is dirt cheap by ferry or MTR Train. Get an Octipus card from the Train station that you can use on trains and buses everywhere so you don.t need cash. We took kids to the Science and Technology Museam which is only approx 400 meters from Hotel, worth a look. Be sure to go to Stanley Market over the other side of Hong Kong Island a beautiful spot right on water, be sure to have a seafood platter at The Boathouse, very resonable and delightful. and was the highlight of my trip. Families or people who want to have good western restaurants right on your doorstep where you can eat from Mcdonalds's to great steakhouse Restaurants on yor doorstep this hotel for the money is very hard to beat.Happy HolidayCheers

<Content>worth upgrading we upgraded from a standard room on the 7th floor to a deluxe room on the 12th and, for $60 extra a night, there is no comparison. i say upgrade to a deluxe or stay someplace else. the deluxe room is spacious and a lot more up to date than the standard room, the latter of which is tiny, cramped and little depressing. go deluxe!

<Content>Great location I stayed at the Regal Kowloon for one week in October 2007. In general, the hotel and the room met all expectations. I've heard that hotel rooms in Hong Kong are notoriously small, but the size of our hotel room was more than sufficient. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the TV had a good selection of international channels. The only minor complaint I have is that the hallways had a bit of an odd smell, which I think came from various types of food that guests were bringing into their room. I had no problem with the location, mainly because the only stops I made in Kowloon were along the Tsim Sha Tsui promenade. The walk all the way to the Star Ferry Terminal and Harbour City shopping mall from the hotel is only about 15 minutes. Once you're at the Star Ferry Terminal, the ferry ride over to Hong Kong Island is only 7 minutes, so if you're on vacation, this shouldn't be too much of an inconvenience. Also, you get a great view of the Hong Kong skyline from the promenade. I didn't find the MTR to be as convenient; the Tsim Sha Tsui station is walkable from the hotel, but once at the station, you have to walk under group for awhile and you miss the scenery of the promenade walk. If I was to stay in Kowloon during my next visit to Hong Kong, I would probably consider staying at the Regal Kowloon again.

<Content>OK, but rooms could be better I have stayed at this hotel 3 times - once for 2 nights, the other times just for 1 night. The first two times I was upgraded to a suite; this was in both cases a large main room with a LCD TV and a seperate large bedroom, with a similar LCD TV and with 2 double beds and a bathroom. Last time I had a normal room which was small-ish but did have a large double bed and a two seater settee; it did not seem that good value though for $1900HK a night. The rooms are in need of a makeover, they look like they've had a lot of use. There was no free bottled water, only Evian in the minibar which at $35HK for 0.5L was pricey. Internet access was $600HK per 24hrs, also not cheap. I did not try breakfast - there is a Starbucks on the corner of the square outside the hotel that kept me in caffeine. The hotel's location is good for Kowloon and there is a free shuttle bus from Kowloon MTR station, else its about $45HK by taxi.

<Content>Regal Kingsize!!! Stayed here at the start of July 2007 as part of our honeymoon with Kuoni.We stayed for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Regal.We stayed in a superior room on the 15th floor. The views were of the square down below which were ok. the room however was superb. We had a receptionist on our floor for any problems! It had recently been refurbed and was very well done in dark wood and black marble. There is flat plasma tvs and a great radio system which took a docking for our ipods!!there is a computer display by the bedside which controls the air con, disturb signs and all the lighting. its brilliant and a very lazy gadget!!The location of the hotel is ok. Its on Kowloon and short walk away towards the harbour is a ferry terminal for Hong Kong. This is not the terminal for the Star Ferry though. Just a private ferry company which charge about 6 HKD instead of the cheaper star ferries. but its quieter than the star ferries.another 5 minute walk is the nearest MTR station. this is a great way to get around the city. in fact due to the crazy traffic its the only system we used. a must really. The hotel bar is good as well. with a happy hour of 2 4 1 in the early evening it got us in there!!There are some good bars dotted around the hotel. We found most of them in the DK eyewitness travel guide book. Top 10 of Hong Kong. I strongly recommend this book (im not on commission!) one of the bars not in the book was the bulldog bar in the shopping centre opposite. Im not one of the british who go away for cheesy brit bars but this is a British/Aussie bar definately worth a visit. My tip on this is get a tab for your drinks as every time you buy a drink the 10% tip surcharge goes on.Overall a good hotel in a not bad location which is made better by the public transport. The rooms are first class especially the superior ones which i recommend.

<Content>Nice room, but... Stayed there 3 nights in May 2007 on the executive floor as part of a tour of China. Upon checkin, discovered a malfunctioning toilet with a crudely repaired patch of wall above the toilet. (As noted by another traveler, the plumbing also made scary noises in addition to being malfunctioning.) When engineering was unable to repair the toilet, we were moved across the hall to another room which produced elevator or dumbwaiter noise 24/7. The room was not made up until about 4:30 each afternoon. Aside from those comments, the room was smartly decorated with cream leather furniture and plasma tv, etc. Lobby is eye-popping with stained glass ceiling and gold sculpture.Great location and very nice staff. Would definitely stay there again, but had higher expectations for such a nice hotel than my comments reflect.

<Content>Very good value for money We booked a one night stay here through Priceline for the night of June 1st and were very pleased with what we got for our winning bid of $91/night. Without us even asking, we were upgraded to a suite with a King Bed (a real american king sized bed - not a queen as another tripadvisor reviewer experienced). The room was very large and clean. There was a separate sitting area and while the bathroom was not large, it was fine with us. I agree with other reviewers regarding the smell of cigarettes in the hallway - but there was no smell in our room and I am ultra-sensitive to that. The public areas of the hotel are a little gaudy - lots of shiny brass and glass decor but I guess that is considered chic over there. This hotel also seemed to be popular with tour groups - lots of people milling about/waiting for tour buses in the lobby. However, I must point out that the hotel staff were uniformly very helpful and efficient. No wait to check bags with the Bell Clerk or to check out. One potential drawback of the hotel is its location which is a true 15 minute walk to the Tsim Sat Shui metro stop on the Kowloon side. True, most of the walk to the metro is underground and therefore is airconditioned but it is a fair walk to catch the metro trains. Also the area surrounding the hotel is kind of cheesy and touristy with men hanging outside their shops and pestering you to come in and have a suit made as you walk by. If this says anything, there is an Outback Steakhouse restaurant across the street from the hotel as well as other chain eateries.However, given that we got a clean nice suite from the Regal Kowloon for $91 a night, given HK hotel price, I am not complaining!!

<Content>A wonderful time We had a wonderful time at the Regal Kowloon. The location is excellent. Easy walking distance to just about everything, also quick access to the subway. The staff was great. The bed and the bedding was also very comfortable. The only negative was that our hallway smelled like cigarrette smoke, but thankfully our room had no oder. There was also a great transfer to and from the airport. Very convienant. Great experience.

<Content>the regal nice big rooms overlooking the bay - the decor wasnt great but we didnt go for that - only major complaint was the awful teabags supplied in the room...for a country renound for their tea it was a real let down!the breakfast buffet was about $10HK each and ok - lots of fruit and cereal - the fried stuff wasnt fab - and you had to queue sometimes for a while as there was only 1 chef on duty...watch out for those queue jumpers!had a really good lunch of curry out near the foyer - really cheap and deliciouseveryone was very polite and curtious - everything is in walking distance and i think it was an advantage being on kowloon as HK island wasnt as interesting for us...i walked around late by myself with no problems although my boyfriend did get solicited one night by some girls outside teh hotel...no big deal though!over all this hotel was perfectly ok - and we would stay there again if we go back to HK

<Content>Very pleasantly surprised - great hotel First of all yes this hotel is a little farther out of the main tourist area of Kowloon but the MTR is only 10 mins walk, and if you walk an extra 5 mins you can be in the middle of Nathan Rd and all the action. If this bothers you taxis in HK are everywhere and cheap.I have stayed in a few hotels in Kowloon and this has had the nicest rooms and was best value for money by far. Our room was very big by HK standards, furnished nicely and clean. Service was good and so were the facilities like the gym that I used. I am planning on returning here for my next trip.

<Content>spacious rooms but location not great We paid HK$700 a night for a weekend there, and found the rooms fairly spacious (especially by HK standards) and clean. The bathrooms could be spruced up somewhat, but still satisfactory. The room we got also offered a peek at the harbour, though it felt more industrial than scenic. We did not have much contact with the staff (largely because we could not find them!). The one that we did find at the concierge desk was curt and not particularly helpful -- in short, he told us that there was no dim sum served in the hotel, and that we were better off eating elsewhere. We did.Also, we found the location to be wanting. It was somewhat of a trek to the nearest exit (near Shangri-la), and even then, it took another 8 mins walk from that exit to the trains proper. Not sure if there is a shuttle -- certainly no staff offered such information to us. The second night, we gave up on the MTR and just took a taxi. In hindsight, the extra time and costs on transport could justify paying a bit more for somewhere nearer transportational facilites.Would recommend it only if you are big on space, or like it quiet at night.
