<Content>The Worse for Wear Like many of the hotels at SeaTac, the Holiday Inn is an old facility that's showing its age. Unlike other hotels in the same few blocks, however, the rooms have not been renovated recently -- the overall feel is of staying in a Holiday Inn ca. 1988. The sheer curtains in the room don't feel like they've been cleaned since then.Check-in staff at 10 p.m. was efficient although not friendly. The room itself was functional. The mattress was okay -- not too firm, but had that old, hollow hotel mattress feeling. The room had basic amenities (iron and ironing board hanging out in the middle of the room, soap, shampoo but no conditioner, coffee but only decaf). Wireless internet was free. We were at the end of the hallway, and the room was relatively quiet.Our room reeked of cigarette smoke when we arrived, although we'd been given a non-smoking room. It seems they slapped a non-smoking decal on the door and took the ashtrays out of a room that had been smoked in for decades, and voila -- a non-smoking room was born.Beyond that, our main complaint was the temperature. On one of the coldest days in Seattle in many years, the heat in our room had been turned off until we arrived. I turned the thermostat up to 80F, and by morning the room had only reached 65F. It would have been a nicer touch had they turned on the heat in advance in the rooms they were planning to rent, or put a blanket on the bed or a spare blanket in the room.On value for money: I'd say it was worth the $45 I got the room for on Priceline, but not much more.

<Content>No water! Slow emergency response. We reserved a 2-double beds room for 4 adults using a pre-paid website. We reached there around 11pm, and the check-in was quick. The room size was decent, although the bathroom was small. We had an early flight to catch the next morning. Imagine our dismay when there's no water for the sink, toilet  shower use! I called the front desk at 5am, and was told that the City broke the water main in front of the hotel. They told me that they will be bringing us some water in 15 minutes. So, we waited until 5:25am but still no response. I called again and was told that they are out buying water from the convenient store. By the time we got a knock from the door, it's close to 6am. The worst part was the guy that was distributing the water to the rooms told me that 1 room = 1 small bottle of water. The guy finally relented in handing over 2 extra bottles when I pleaded there were 4 of us staying in the room and we had an early flight to catch as well.When we were checking out, I overheard someone mentioning that the water main broke since 3-4am. I think the management could be more efficient by preparing plenty of water before the guests woke up for their earliest flight. And trying to compensate them by giving free coffee/breakfast as best as possible.Overall, it was a horrid experience.

<Content>Take earplugs! We booked this hotel as it was offering a great rate for a one night stay. As we were only in Seattle for one night for a football game, it seemed logical to stay at Holiday Inn, SeaTac. Next time, I'll just spend the extra cash and stay somewhere else. Another reviewer has already mentioned the inept check-in staff. I would absolutely agree. The room I was given was supposed to be non-smoking. It absolutely REEKED of cigarette smoke. I was given another room 2 doors up which had no such smell but did not offer the same Priority Club benefits as the previous room (not sure why this was, as it was never explained). Another reviewer also mentioned the paper thin walls. Agreed! Our new room was opposite the ice machine. Oh my Lord I could hear every single cube of ice ALL night, and I am a pretty heavy sleeper. The bed and pillow were comfortable, shame I couldn't get to sleep on them!Bathroom was very small, and the room perfectly functional. The airport transfer was fast and efficient. I didn't stay for breakfast so I have no idea of the restaurant quality. Overall, this hotel was OK, but I am certain that other hotels in the area would offer better value, comfort and service.

<Content>Great Hotel for the value We stayed here on our way to Maui. The rooms were very clean with good mattress and pillows. The staff was super friendly. We walked up the 7-11 and bought some wine. The bar opened it for us and supplied the glasses. We left our car there for 14 days with no problems at all. Stayed there on the way back home as well. This time we got a free breakfast with our room. The shuttles leave the hotel regularly. When we landed we called and were picked up in about 5 or 10 minutes. It was a smooth stay. I would for sure stay there again and would recommend the hotel to friends.

<Content>If you want to sleep, this is not the place for you While the Holiday Inn at Seatac Airport is a lovely facility and everyone was very friendly, I will never stay there again -- the walls are less than paper-thin. During the night, I heard every cough, sneeze, hiccup and word from all the surrounding rooms. Although we were four rooms away from the elevator lobby, and the 'ding' was not loud -- I heard every ding all night long. Any other amenities and positive aspects of the hotel sank into oblivion by midnight, when I realized I was not going to get any sleep at all.So if you want to sleep, do not stay at this Holiday Inn.

<Content>Business travelers will be disappointed The reviews are right on for this hotel. The hotel is renovated and relatively nice. The service however is bad. The front desk staff tries to be friendly, but is clearly not trained. I had several issues from their errors. They corrected them all, it was just irritating to have to deal with it. The restaurant is ok. The food was good, again service at dinner time was poor. The breakfast buffet was decent, and honestly the service at breakfast was the best service I received while staying there. Maybe the dining staff in the morning can do some training for the evening dining and front desk staff.I think the hotel has invested a lot in physical improvements to not have the service to be able to back it up.Oh, and I reserved a corner room thinking it would be larger ... I was wrong. The room reminded me of one time when I was forced to stay at a Mircrotel. It was tiny. I stayed at this same hotel last summer and didn't have these issues.

<Content>OK airport hotel close to airport This is a standard 3-star Holiday Inn close to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Good free transfer service to and from the airport. Comfortable soundproof rooms. Basic restaurant - you won't starve but unmemorable. Hopeless night manager at 2am - we finally sorted our intended room after two mistakes on his part and treks to the room and back on ours. Well furnished clean rooms. You can actually walk to the airport (we did for a stroll) and if you had the directions right and little luggage could do it on foot if you knew where you were going. With a good transfer service why bother. There are quite a number of other hotels along the same strip. We had a good light brunch at the Hilton, but in terms of independent restaurants there are only appalling American chain restaurants offering oversize fried meals within walking distance. So if you want a good meal, choose one of the nearby hotels. Day time desk service was excellent - we dealt with several different desk clerks and all were excellent, it was only the night manager who did not have a clue. A useful feature is a 24-hour accessible business centre where you can check in on line and print boarding passes. Good value at the price (discounted) which we paid.

<Content>nice place We stayed here because it was close to the airport. Shuttle driver was very nice. The rooms were nice, with sofa and bed with four different types of pillows, towels were nice, room was clean. The lobby was very nice, the staff were great. I would stay here again. I had bid on this and for $80 it was great.

<Content>past reviews are about right I read the reviews for most of the airport hotels in Seattle and decided to try this one, mostly becuase of the room rate. I got the best rate here, and I can see why. The past reviews were very mixed as was my experience. I booked a corner room. It turned out to be in the middle of the building and in fact, there are no corner rooms where you can see out two sides. The food was OK, the staff didn't seem all that interested in assisting people but they weren't rude, and there really aren't many choices for eating within walking distance. If I go back to Seattle I'll find something more suburban (probably cheaper) and pay the taxi. This hotel seems to cater to the park and fly. If that's your thing, the bed and shower should work well enough. I do not recommend this hotel for a business traveller.

<Content>Clean hotel was just okay but very convenient to SeaTac This hotel is a bit dated but it is located right across the street from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport so it is very convenient. They have a free hotel shuttle so you may not need a car because parking is extra and is more expensive than even the adjacent off-airport parking lots.The initial smell inside the lobby was a bit musty. The elevators are a long walk from the check in desk and hard to find.The rooms are large and have decent furnishings that are not totally worn down like I was expecting. The beds were a little firmer than I liked but it did appear clean. I was expected a bad room based on the smell of the lobby, but I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were nice and we had very innovative and unique housekeepers.The room had a nice large desk and the Internet service was fast and easy to set up.While this is a decent place that has good prices, you have to take into account that you are right next to the airport.There is a great deal of airport noise and combined with the very loud air conditioning in our room, it is not easy to have a quiet night's sleep.Plus, there is a major construction project going in right across the street (they are building a light rail system from the airport to Downtown Seattle that opens in 2009. No more long taxi or shuttle rides that cost a lot and clog the roads).So, this a pretty good place to stay but be ready to deal with noise issues.

<Content>Great Value ...Polite Service In USA Hotels... The experience at this hotel is a reflection of hotel service perhaps 10 years ago when the business was still polite, the service staff still cared and the business was run well.The room was very clean and big for the price paid and the amenities very well appreciated by travelling business people who may forget to pack an item or two.The vending machines on 3 differing floors didnt work and was a tad frustrating. From the hotel, there are good links to downtown thru a bus or a 30 min cab ride to the usual sights in downtown Seattle.The restaurant breakfast was nothing to impress although the service was the highlight. Dinner was good, the restaurant is small in size and sufficient for the low level of walk in guests. The service was generally better than any downtown hotels I stayed in LA, Miami  Galveston beating evening the double tree in miami for personal  sincere service.The hotel is a good choice for those who like to be close to the ariport as there is a free shuttle provided to pick you up

<Content>Beware of hidden costs Via Priceline this Hotel was a good deal for the money, even with the hidden cost. However, after naming my own price, I was surprised to find that they charged $12 for parking. Hotel is right across the street from SeaTac and if you've been there, it isn't exactly a high density urban development. Why they felt the need to charge this is beyond me. If you arrive late in the evening as we did, you'd be better off using their airport shuttle and getting a car the next day. Bathroom needs updating, beside being one of the smallest hotel bathrooms I've ever seen, the fixtures appeared to be Motel 6 vintage.

<Content>So far it's awesome Well, I don't understand all the bad reviews.The computer I'm typing on in the business room is free. Free printer so I could print my car rental information.the room is very very clean. The people at the desk are incredibly helpful and nice. I will update later if I find anything wrong. So far? This place is worth the money I paid for it.I did find the overnight parking to be a little irritating, but we're not leaving our car here so It doesn't make any difference :-)

<Content>Not a 3* property (anymore that is) Stayed at this property for one night (2/21) with my wife, prior to an early AM departure.Parked my car off site, as I didn't want to pay $12.00 a night for parking. Shuttle picked us up at the airport within five minutes. Quick trip to hotel (Driver was friendly and helpful).Check in was very convenient and quick. Front desk folks were very nice. Lobby looked nice with good looking lounge/bar downstairs. This is about the end of anything good at this property.We were assigned a room on the 8th floor (a smaller king room, according to the nice guy at the front desk). He was right. very small King room, with a bathroom that looked like the size of a broom closet. No way two people could fit in that bathroom at one time.The room had a work station, king bed, small chair in the corner and an older 27 inch tube tv. The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were not very nice...really could not find a combination that worked for us. The outside room noise related to airport traffic and plane take off and landing is pretty significant. I think only slept well between 2-4 am, when I was not hearing plane noise.The room was old and needed updating. Old linens, furnature, etc...what I would expect at a 2* property.The check out was easy, and shuttle ride to the aiport was quick and less than 5 minutes.If you want a hotel that is great for location, nice people and prompt shuttle service this would be the place...but if you are looking for a good night sleep, nice rooms....look someplace else.This place had be a good 3* at one point. But now, I could only give it 2.5 due to the amenities it offers.We had a great rate through priceline, so maybe that's why we got shafted in a small gross room, but I can't imagine any other room on the 8th floor being much better.Good luck!

<Content>Very disappointing - better service from a Dell call center I was catching an early flight out of Seattle, and only really needed a hotel for about 8 hours to sleep and to leave my car for 2 days until I returned. Unfortunately this hotel met neither of these requirements in the end - I barely slept and I wasn't able to park my car there.When I booked my room I specifically asked if I could leave my car parked there for 2 days after my stay, and what the charge would be. I was informed that as long as I was in fact a guest at the hotel, I could leave my car parked there as long as I wanted for $12 a day - I would just need to let them know at the front desk when I checked in, and they would bill it with my room and validate my parking pass. Since I called the hotel directly I had no reason to think this wasn't good information.When I arrived at 8:00pm on a weeknight, I checked in and asked to pay for 3 days parking (1 during my stay + 2 afterwards), I was informed that they don't do park  fly anymore. I explained that I had called the hotel THREE DAYS prior when I booked my room, and that I had been informed that I could leave my car there for 2 days after my stay for $12 a day. All any of the front desk staff could say was sorry we don't do park  fly anymore. I really have a hard time believing that they changed their policy in the 3 days between when I booked and when I arrived, and I was dumbfounded that they could not make an exception given the circumstances.I had planned on getting to sleep by about 9 since I had to be up at 4am to get a 6am flight, but instead I was driving around looking for a parking lot. (I really didn't want to get up at 3am to do this in the morning.) All the lots closest to the airport were full. I wasn't being chinsy either, I wanted to get some sleep and I was checking the valet lots, absolutely any parking lot. The 6th or 7th lot I stopped at had 2 spaces left, so I got the second to last spot. Then I walked back to the hotel with all my stuff, stopping at a gas station to buy dinner since the restaurant would be closed by the time I got back.When I finally got into my room, it looked pretty much like the pictures except a bit smaller. The decor was actually really nice, and the shower head was high enough for me (I'm 6'). That's really the only good thing I can say about this hotel, they have some nice mirrors and lamps, and the lobby is really nice. But the curtains and bed sheets were yellow. The pillows felt really lumpy and old, so I looked under the pillow case and they were all brown with water stains. I assume from drool and who knows what else... I ended up sleeping on a couple of rolled up bath towels.I don't know what else I can tell you about this hotel to express my disdain for it. All I needed was to sleep and park my car, which I had called ahead to arrange - and I ended up with barely 4 hours of sleep and had to find somewhere else to park in the middle of the night. I might as well have slept in my car, I honestly would have gotten more sleep.

<Content>Run down, loud, and dirty I'm a Platinum Priority Club member and was very disappointed in my stay at this hotel. The lobby was very nice, but the room left a lot to be desired. The window in our room wouldn't really open, but neither would it close all the way to seal. I think if it did seal, we might not have heard the road and airport noise quite as bad. The hairdryer did not work (yes, we tried the reset button). The room was very tired, threadbare, and on the dirty side. I've stayed at a lot of Holiday Inns, many of them are in the process up updating. This one was not.The indoor pool and hot tub, although open 24-hours, were a dingy green. I enjoyed the hot tub after a long day of traveling, but I was sure to shower afterward.Parking was very tight, not many spaces were open, and the special priority club parking was always full.The one thing I will say is the management at this hotel is great. Despite our many problems, the manager worked to make me happy, or at least content.

<Content>As good as an airport hotel really gets I booked here because I was working in Tacoma and then Seattle on apposing days then jetting out of SEATAC really really early in the morning. The shuttle got me to and from the airport quickly.Clean Clean Clean room. Prompt timely quick shuttles to and from the airport. Close to food places, restaurant hotel was just fine. Close to the highways. What more can I say .. except ... do not rent a car! The shuttle bus driver from the airport to the hotel told me my reservation was way overpriced at about $65 a day. I got to the hotel canceled it and they arranged a $29 a day rental via budget with shuttle bus pickups etc etc. It was rather a hefty discount on the SEATAC prices found via Orbitz etc etc. Because of the shuttle service I was able to drop the car off the night before I flew instead of the morning of ... stress saver.UGLY hotel room view --- kind of an ugly hotel but fine on the inside.

<Content>Average Hotel, Convenient Location, Great Staff Stayed at the Holiday Inn Seatac for a long weekend. I did not have a choice as to where to stay as I was traveling with an organization. The hotel is convenient to Seattle International Airport, and is about a 3 minute ride from the baggage claim.The rooms were typical Holiday Inn hotels with some signs of aging. Nevertheless, the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathrooms are a bit small, but were sufficient.The pool area and gym was better than many other Holiday Inns, and was even open 24 hours.I did not go to the bar, but as part of the group, I did partake in the breakfast buffet every morning. The buffet had the typical selections found at most hotel breakfasts, but the food here actually tasted quite good and different from other hotels.All in all, an OK choice for an overnight, but I would not recommend this property for stays more than a night or two. I would like to praise the hotel staff, though, on being very friendly , and accommodating requests.For good food within walking distance, I recommend Thirteen Coins, an upscale bar and restaurant open 24 hours.

<Content>Fitted the bill perfectly I was a bit nervous about staying here after reading some of the reviews, but finding myself overnighting in Seattle, with an early flight the next morning, I tok advantage of my company's corporate rate at the Holiday Inn. I was pleasantly surprised, from the quick pickup at the airport, to the friendly desk staff, spotlessly clean room, quiet and comfortable, great night of sleep, and the free highspeed wireless was great since there is absolutely nothing to do in the area. I checked out early the next morning, and took the very short shuttle ride to the airport. At rack rates (or even internet rates on HI website), this property seems expensive (but that seems to be the case for everywhere in Seattle). At the corporate rate I paid, I feel I got excellent value for money. I would stay here again without any doubts.

<Content>As an airport hotel, it fills the bill Convenient location, very short shuttle trip to the airport.I had to spend an entire afternoon and evening, and, believe me, there's nothing to do; so be sure you have a laptop or are prepared to watch television. It's a bit price-y to pay for transportation into city center Seattle.Dinner in the hotel restaurant was okay. A huge group of Russians arrived and took every available seat. The wait staff handled the extraordinary situation well and with good humor. I wasn't in a hurry so I enjoyed watching the interactions.At breakfast, again they were understaffed and there was an enormous line even though there were empty tables. I walked to the Denny's next door.The next morning I had an easy check out and shuttle trip to the airport.

<Content>The Best Holiday Inn Don't know how you could beat this hotel for a stay at the airport. The front desk was exeptional, the room was large and very confortable, the restaurant was good for dinner and had a wonderful breakfast buffet, and the convenience to the airport was perfect. If you are a Holiday Inn Club member they have 3 special floors, parking at the door, fruit  candy in your room, and a special check-in area. First class establishment used by several cruise lines.

<Content>Gross! My husband and I spent one night at the Holiday Inn SeaTac Airport. We specifically chose this hotel because we had an early flight out in the morning and we wanted to be as close to the airport as possible. First, let me tell travelers unfamiliar with the area that this hotel is not near downtown Seattle. The airport and the hotel are a fifteen minute/ $35 dollar cab ride from the tourist area. We arrived in our room and it was awful. It was a non-smoking room that smelled of smoke and had a cigarette butt in the toilet. The bathroom was beyond dirty, with hair, mold and wet dust collecting in the cracks between the ceiling and floor. There was a hole in the wall and the curtains did not close so we had the bright lights from the parking lot beaming in on us all night. The restaurant had a VERY limited menu with not much more than a few pasta dishes, hamburger, a few sandwich options and a few salad options. I have stayed in many Holiday Inn鈥檚 and this was the worst experience I have ever had. I would give it one star, one dirty star.

<Content>Pretty good stay at the Holiday Inn I stayed two nights at the SeaTac Holiday Inn. The property was pretty standard for an airport hotel. Check-in was quick and easy and my room was well-appointed. The location is convenient to the airport but a bit difficult to get to because of construction of a light rail line. Positives: The location was convenient. The room had good lighting throughout, and a good work desk with available outlets and free wireless internet. My room was quiet and the bed was comfortable. An additional touch was the Holiday Inn pillow menu, which allowed for the selection of 4 different types of pillows. Negatives: While the room was mostly clean, there was a stain on one of the sheer curtains that was a bit off-putting. The hair dryer in the bathroom could also have been cleaned better. The bathroom was a bit small. $9 a day for guest parking? Come on! I could understand that at a downtown property, but you're better than that, Holiday Inn!Overall though I had a good stay. I would stay at this property again.

<Content>Likes  Frequently stay at this Holiday Inn. It's not as upscale or antisceptic as the Hilton or Doubletree. In general it is quite ok. and it offers a few amenities that I like far better than either of those hotels. The 24 hour pool, jacuzzi and gym access is GREAT. More hotels should have this available since their guests generally arrive late and leave fairly early the next day. Physical access is limited by use of the room key which lends a security feature that the Hilton does not have.The jacuzzi needs resurfacing - it looks pretty grungy. The jets need fixing as there is almost no power coming from them. Unlike the pool at many hotels, this swimming pool is big enough to do laps. It is one reason I LOVE staying at this hotel. It is kept at an excellent temperature for swimming or playing = not too cold, not too warm. Internet access was free at the business center until this most recent trip. The old computer was replaced with a newer flat screen model and now they require credit card input and charge after five minutes. I was very disappointed to see the loss of this customer service amenity. The rooms are clean and the beds comfortable everytime I've been there.PARKING charges are less than other hotels ($9). I find the whole parking charge thing at Seattle Airport hotels to be a complete RACKET. I wish there was a way for customers to revolt. (Ironically .. the two star hotels usually offer FREE parking to guests!!)This hotel is close to Denny's so if hungry it's easy to pop over and get a salad or snack for far less than the hotel restaurant.

<Content>watch the room charges I stayed here for a weekend sci-fi convention. I was on the same floor as the 'party room' which was at the opposite end of the hallway from me. People were smoking in the party room, and the hotel was aware of this.However, I got dinged a $200 'smoking in room' fee when I don't smoke. They charged everyone on the entire floor $200 each for a smoking fee. Guest services had not been in my room. Nobody had been in my room to ascertain any smoking. The hotel didn't ask me or warn me in any way before putting the $200 on my debit card. This sent me into overdraft.It took 5 days to get the funds returned to me.

<Content>I would rate this a high 3-4 star. Attending a major trade show we booked late was unable to find anything in downtown. Here we are at Seatac Airport Holiday Inn. What a breath of fresh air as a Priority Member (it's free and takes 5 minutes) and a 100 night a year traveler I was pleasantly surprised after the bad reviews I read here. Our rooms were large with desk and sofa, clean double sheets, bright towels, very clean. Rooms cleaned efficiently daily. The breakfast buffet is excellent and we interacted with all staff and found them to be EXTREMEMLY helpful. I will stay here again as you be downtown in 10 minutes. Shuttle 24 hours a day check in and out quick and with a smile, which you do find many here.

<Content>I would rather stay at the Bates Motel! I went on a business trip for what was origanally to be for three days. We called and spoke with the manager prior to booking to ask if a company issued check would be accepted upon arrival and he assured us it would be fine. When we arrived we had to get a cab since the shuttle never showed up. When check in began they informed us they were sorry but they would not accept the check. I asked to speak with the person whom we originally spoke with and he came to the counter. He denied ever speaking with anyone from our company and refused to accept the check. He asked me to pay the $300.00 per night, yes that's right PER NIGHT on my credit card. While we were trying to come with a better solution seveal airline employees who had just checked in came to the counter very upset due to the fact their rooms had not been turned yet from the former guests. The hotel's response to that was  well sir you do understand we have another contract with other airline carriers besides you. I could not believe it. I thought the pilot was going to come unglued.Finally after an hour and a half ( at 3:00am) the manager finally asked us to go to our room and he would work it out in the morning. When I woke up the next morning and looked at my pillow in the light I was disgusted to find mold all over my pillow. When I showed it to the desk clerk her response was  so would you like a new one? You think?? I asked again what the status of my room situation was and of course she did not know and the manager was gone. I was attending a seminar held near the lobby so I kept checking all day and was basically blown off. At one point while speaking with one of the clerks I mentioned I was from the Detroit area and he proceeded to tell me he used to live in Detroit but had to move due to the fact he did not like black people and too many lived there.That was it for us we immediately checked out. They of course charged me the 300.00 for the $79.00 at best, room we were in. When I asked for some sort of discount for all of our problems They agreed to take $60.00 off but then claimed they couldn't since we were already receiving a discount. I am not sure what discount they mean since our room was a standard double with 1970's decor and we were charged $300.00. We walked across the parking lot to another hotel which the room was identical and paid $100.00.

<Content>Smoke Free-No Way We stayed at this hotel out of convenience to the Airport to facilitate a next-morning flight. We usually expect more of a Holiday Inn than we saw here. The carpet was dirty with two large areas stained with coffee or we hate to think what else. In a record heat year (check the weather reports), you can only hope you are paying for adequate air conditioning. The air was on full all night and barely cooled a ten foot area in front of the one and only vent. This was supposedly central air-not one of those window units. Despite the heat, we wish that had had just turned off the air conditioning entirely as periodically throughout the night the disgusting scent of cigarette smoke came through the air conditioning vent. We don't know if an employee was smoking near the fresh air intake or someone elses smoke-laden air was recycled into our room. The management should seriously look into this. We didn't complain when we checked out as we were in a hurry to leave the next day and figured the best way to make a change is to alert future would-be customers. To end on a positive note, the staff were quite helpful and polite.

<Content>Better the second time but still some concerns This is the second time we've stayed in this hotel -- both times I booked through Priceline. This time I made the extra effort of joining Holiday Inn's Gold Club, which is free and entitiles the guest to their more updated rooms. We found the renovated rooms much nicer than before with double sheets and nicer furnishings. Towels were bright white and very fluffy. We had a view of Mt Rainier, albeit over the parking lot. The pool area could be improved upon by actually turning on the heater for the pool -- it was way too cold to swim in comfortably. The hot tub needs to be resurfaced or something -- it looks a bit dingy.Also, in the bathroom of our room the shower curtains had a distinct midewy smell. They need to be launderd.Check-in and out was no problem. Paid parking is silly -- they've got plenty of room for parking, they are just trying to gouge an extra $10 out of their guests.

<Content>Good price We stayed for 1 night and were plesantly surprised. The room was large with nice looking furniture and a comfy bed. As priority club members we were given a voucher for free buffet breakfast in the restaurant which had a good selection including cereal, toast and cooked. We paid in advance directly thru holiday inn and it cost 鈧?4 plus tax which we thought was great for an airport location.The courtesy shuttle was quick to pick up at the airport and runs approx. every 10-15 minutes in the morning.We would definatly stay here again if the price was right.

<Content>Not a bad stay, but beware of little things A pretty good hotel for a Holiday Inn. The bed was comfortable, and the room was clean. Breakfast buffet was good, but stay away from an other meals in the restaurant. We had two rooms, and the staff automatically assumed we had two vehicles, so we were double charged for parking (they never asked how many cars we had at check-in, so we had to get the extra charges removed at check-out). Also, they never explained the parking system (you get a card each time you come in the parking lot and reuse a card they have validated to get out of the lot without paying, and our pass to get out of the lot stopped working several times during the trip. Someone on the staff also made a call on our room phone, and we had to get the charges removed.Pool is indoor, but is not heated.

<Content>A Decent Hotel Close to the Airport I recently stayed at the Seattle SeaTac Holiday Inn on a business trip before I was heading to Calgary. I was at the hotel for about 3 nights before I left for Canada (posted a review about the Holiday Inn Calgary Airport).I arrived at the airport and quickly called the hotel from the phone at the airport. Within about 10 minutes, the hotel shuttle arrived. The service was ok; the Asian guy who picked us up could have been a little friendlier.The rooms at the hotel were average. For the price, location and amenities, they were pretty good. The rooms were clean, and the furnishing did not seem too old.The food service at the hotel was better than average. They had a decent selection of food in a wide price range. If you are a priority club member, all you have to do is sign up on their website; you get their breakfast buffet for free. This is not an ordinary buffet for a hotel of this class. They actually have a person to make custom omelets and waffles, and the food on the buffet was plentiful and of good quality. The service was very fast.The pool was not heated but the spa was very good. Since it was pretty cold in Seattle, I did not use the pool, but I did visit the spa once.Since I was there only 3 nights, I did not have maid service, but the maids seemed to be very nice. The hotel front desk was very friendly, and was happy to arrange transportation for me to Kirkland (about 20 miles from the hotel).I did need to use the laundry room since my trip would be about 14 days. I was disappointed to find out that the hotel had 1 washer/dryer for the entire property. Not to mention, it was in a bad location next to the elevator and vending machines. It was very difficult to do laundry in this location.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised... Having read all the less than promising reviews on this hotel, we were understandably nervous about our stay. However, the renovations to the rooms must have turned out great as we had no complaints about the rooms. The bathrooms though could have used some updating as well. All-in-all, for $40 via Priceline the room was more than satisfactory.Had dinner at the hotel restaurant as well, and that was also good!

<Content>Not to worry! Hotel is nice, standard. Not as bad as other reviews. I am writing this review from my room at the Holiday Inn Seattle-Seatac International Airport. I also got this room on Priceline, and was dismayed based on these reviews. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived in the hotel and my room. It's not the Peninsula, but it is a nice, clean, airport hotel. I would definitely stay here again on future trips to Seattle.Now the details. We arrived late at night and used the free shuttle from the airport. The shuttle service is conventiently located outside baggage claim, and the shuttles for the various hotels circle around on a regular basis. The shuttle runs 24 hours a day. It is very convenient.We arrived at the hotel and were greeted at the front desk by very friendly, helpful staff. As usual with Priceline reservations, I had sent a letter to the reservations manager ahead of time to let them know I as a Priority Club Gold member. We were placed on the 10 floor, which is a Priority Club Executive Floor. This may be where the renovated rooms are.Our room was very nice! Everything was clean with a nice, neutral, modern feel. The furtniture was a warm wood and both beds had matching wood headboards. Everything seemed relatively new. There were no scuffs or stains anywhere. The room does have an electronic safe, coffeemaker, hairdryer, and free wireless internet access in each room. The linens were clean and comfortable and each bed had 3 down pillows. Our room was quiet and we both slept very well.The bathroom was interesting. There was a little post-it note form the housekeeper basically stating that if you think she did a good job, please give the note to the manager. All the towels in the bathroom were folded in a fancy way and actually the bathroom and room were very very clean. Maybe this is a new initiative but I appreciate it. Good shower pressure made for a great shower.We did have dinner in the hotel restaurant. It was good an relatively affordable - about $8 for a burger or very tasty Reuben sandwich (recommended.) The lighting was a little harsh, but otherwise it was a nice experience. As with most restaurants in Seattle, they had at least one good beer (Sierra Nevada) on tap.I personally feel the complaints are unwarranted. My expereice was excellent. I recommend joining the Priority Club rewards program (it's free anyway), and asking for a room on the 10th floor or higher. This hotel is very close and convenient to the airport. As I stated before, I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Get a newly-renovated room. It makes all the difference Back in March of 2005 I wrote a Trip Advisor review of this hotel that was VERY negative. At the time, it was one of the worst hotels I had experienced in years. I got that room on Priceline for $40, but it was so bad vowed never to return. Recently, however, a trusted friend reported she had overnighted there and she said the place was OK. Swallowing my pride, I put in a Priceline bid for a 3-star room in the Sea-Tac area. I was hoping for the Hilton or Marriott, but got the Holiday Inn, instead. My bid this time went to $52. With taxes and fees, the total came to $66.81. A friend who joined me in Seattle also booked a room at the hotel, but through a different service. He ended up paying more than $100 for a room identical to mine.  I am pleased to report that my October 2005 stay was remarkably better than my earlier one. M y room had obviously been renovated and it was a definite improvement over the last stay. I only occupied the room for about 10 hours and did not use any of the other hotel facilities, so I can't comment on much else. I had my own car, so I can't even comment on the free shuttle service to  from the airport. The place was reasonably clean and the bed was reasonably comfortable. The linens and towels were Holiday Inn standard--i.e. above Motel 6 but below Hilton. Basically, this place is a two-star hotel that has somehow conned its way into the three-star club. There is no way it is on par with the Sea-Tac Hilton or Marriott, each of which is very close to the Holiday Inn. However, it was not a bad room for $67. If you can meet or beat that price, I feel you will not be doing yourself a huge disservice.

<Content>Overpriced Hotel - Buyer Beware!! I stayed at this Holiday Inn during the last week of September, 2005. The room and bed were okay, but was pretty much the same quality I would expect from a motel such as Red Roof or Motel 6. Definately not worth the price I paid for the room. You can get a meager continental breakfast for ~$9.00, but there is a Denny's right next door where you can get more for less. Perhaps the most annoying aspects of this hotel are the free high-speed internet and parking. Their internet service would not work, (at least not on my computer), no matter what I did. This problem may be exclusive to my computer, but the parking fee is not exclusive to me. There is an $8 per day airport parking fee. I took this to mean that it is $8 per day to park there if you are going to the airport, but it is actually $8 per day regardless if you are simply parking your car there or if you are staying there. For the price I paid for the room, I would have expected parking to be validated or something; especially since the parking lot is owned by the hotel and not a private parking contractor. I ended up paying nearly $100 for parking for an over-priced hotel room.

<Content>Gross The sheets were scratchy and rough. The tub was dirty or stained. The bathroom had a vent but no fan. I snooped behind a panel in the closet where the AC unit is and it looks like the filter hadn't been changed in years. It was gross. I should have taken a picture. It's no wonder my allergies were acting up. The room was marked as no smoking like all the rooms around it, but the hall and room had a smell like smoke covered with Lysol.We didn't go in the pool, it was murky and the hot tub tiles were brown and slimy looking. I wouldn't sit anywhere near that tub.No breakfast unless you pay $7.99 for a continental style.I've stayed in much nicer 2 star hotels. Unfortunately we made the reservation through Priceline and then I checked the reviews. I won't be using Priceline again. Too risky!

<Content>Avoid this hotel! Luckily we only stayed one night. They have a very small parking lot. When we checked in, the night front desk clerk felt it was more important for her to finish her joke with her co-workers as I was standing there. They acted like I wasn't even standing there.Anyways, I had called the hotel asking for a non-smoking room the week before. When I arrived, they said they only have smoking rooms available.When I checked out, the morning front desk person was not any better.It is a good thing I only stayed one night. I will not be returning to this hotel.

<Content>Revolving Restaurant Gone We planned to have a relaxing evening meal in the hotel's rooftop revolving restaurant to end our visit to Seattle before returning home to Boston as we had on our last year's visit. I had called to confirm our stay and restaurant availability and confirmed the website confirmation that even today promotes theit rooftop revolving restaurant that has been closed forever some six months ago according to front desk staff and the lobby lounge that does not serve the same quality of food regardless of what the current staff says! The room was basic, facility mediocre, but the morning shuttle to the airport was great. Sorry, but there are better overnight Seatac airport accommodations with good food for the money !
