<Content>Born to top the charts! I stayed there about a year and a half ago, not long after opening. I explained then that this was the best boutique hotel in Paris, by far. They're doing even better now, with closer attention to details (breakfast, umbrellas, massage room, etc.). And as before, decoration, ambiance, location, beds, bathrooms, televisions, service, etc. remain top quality. I'll come back, again and again, for business and pleasure.

<Content>Wonderful, stylish stay My wife and I have just returned from a two night stay at this excellent boutique hotel. Located in a quiet street very close to a Metro station, the transfer to and from Gare du Nord for Eurostar users is very easy. Great welcome at reception, lovely room, beautifully clean and with great art in the public areas as well as the bedrooms. Free internet access in the lounge. The room was fairly small, but had plenty of well-designed storage as well as good TV. We had one breakfast, at which service was immaculate: fruit, yoghurt, pastries etc. Breakfast can be taken up to to twelve, which is very handy for late risers. Staff very solicitous and helpful in providing dinner recommendations, and there are plenty of choices in the neighbourhood at all prices. Easy walking to St Germain with loads more bars, cafes etc. Overall, best small hotel we have stayed in for ages.

<Content>Very good overall. Small rooms. Stayed here with my wife from 10/9 - 10/13. It is a very good hotel, quiet, very good service, great design, close to the metro station and to great dining (all budgets) plus a super friendly staff. We just tought the rooms were very small even more when we got the superior kind. But everything else was really good (didn't try the hotel food). If back in Paris and maybe with only 2 large (not extra large), we'd go back to this hotel.

<Content>Funky and friendly Although the hotel room was small, it was very clean and stylish. The motif of the little white figures which permeates the hotel is fun and interesting! We had one painted on our bedroom wall :)The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and modern. Common areas in the hotel were also decorated with flowers and candles which made for a relaxing and attractive atmosphere.The best thing about this hotel however was the staff. They were very friendly and were happy to recommend restaurants and places to visit. They also offered umbrellas when it was raining, and let us borrow a travel plug and an iron. We felt that nothing was too much trouble and were made to feel very welcome.The location of the hotel is excellent as it is close to a number of metro stops, the closest being Vavin, Notre Dame des Champs and Montparnasse Bienvenue. It is easy to reach the main sights using the Metro, and you can buy a carnet of 10 tickets for E11.60. The Galleries Lafayette is close by, as are excellent restaurants. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and would visit again if I returned to Paris.

<Content>Contemporary Boutique Hotel Hotel des Academies and des Arts is a modern 20-room gem just south of the Luxembourg Garden. It is technically in the 6th Arrondissement but borders the 14th. The staff, Henri, Pierre, and others, were all welcoming and helpful. The hotel sits on a quiet Parisian street; Gauguin painted in an atelier on this street and this area continues to be popular with artists and students. We liked staying in an area that was not overrun by tourists. The major Parisian sites are all accessible by metro or by foot. There are at least 3 metro stops servicing major lines within a short a distance of Hotel des Academies.There is no shortage of tasty brasseries and cafes in the area. We became quite fond of Cafe Vavin which was several short blocks away; a typical Parisian cafe, this was a fun place to go for cafe au lait and breakfast. We recommend having the hotel's breakfast at least once (15 euros) for the experience of it, but you can get similar 'petit dejeuner' at Cafe Vavin for half the price. If you are looking for antiques, this is not the place for you. As the hotel is only a year old, rooms are modern and very clean. They are small as one would expect, but we travelled with 3 large suitcases and managed to find a place for everything. Our queen bed was very comfortable. There is free wi-fi in the rooms as well as a computer with access to the internet in the lobby. The common areas are decorated with attractive contemporary fresh floral arrangements. We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel des Academies et des Arts. For us, the highlights were chic decor, helpful English-speaking staff, charming neighborhood, and value.

<Content>Little Gem A beautiful little hotel with the most fantastic staff. Our room was immaculate, new towels, toiletries etc every day. The staff were brilliant from suggesting the best places to visit in our time there to booking restaurants (v difficult with an adventurous eater husband and a pregnant, fussy wife!). So easy to get to, 2 minutes walk from Metro Station Vavin on line 4. We'll definately be back.

<Content>One word: Fantastic We spent 3 nights in this beautiful small pearl. The staff was super professional and fantastic: helped us with transportation, lost luggages, airport check in...and other infinite questions. The hotel is full of small beatiful detailes...The hotel is situated in a quite street without traffic just behind the corner of boulevard de Montparnasse and 10 min away from the imponent jardins du Luxembourg. Many parts of the city can be seen by feet..The hotel staff recomended us to walk to the Louvre (instead of taking public transport) and the choice was the best!!Don't miss the incredible breakfast.

<Content>Small, stylish and cosy We were delighted with our hotel room, it was small but didn't feel cramped. The theme throughout the hotel was fun and unique.The staff were all extremely helpful with one concierge in particular who stood out for us as welcoming and sincere.We never ate in hotel simply because Paris had so much to offer! We would definitely go back.

<Content>Amazing small cozy hotel with great location and most friendly staff My english is not good enough unfortunately for description of this lovely hotel. But i deffinately think that is a very good choise for this money. Rooms are realy small, but it's PARIS. If you need to have 50 square meters - go to four seasons. It's the city hotel and it correspond to the city size :)

<Content>Perfect Stay To keep it short and sweet... Spent 6 nights here. Could not have been more satisfied with the property, service and staff at this price point. Would highly reccomend to people visiting Paris for the first time. Staff was MORE than willing to answer my endless questions. Thanks to everyone, especially the gentlemen who works the overnight and was extremely helpful! Hope to see you again soon.

<Content>Failed to live up to expectations...... In my opinion this hotel is in a good location. It is easy to get around Paris from here by either metro, bus or on foot. Very convenient for the excellent organic Raspail market and there are many excellent restaurants nearby. The hotel is OK. Rooms are small and expensive for what you get. The luxury promoted on the website is sadly not what I would call luxury. The furnishings include lots of vinyl upholstery, the bathrooms are clean but with taps which are a triumph of style over function. For a hotel which promotes its arts, art is pretty thin on the ground apart from the themed installations and wall paintings of the white figures. The walls are very thin and expect to be able to hear your neigbours every word. Also, a word of warning, the bedside lights are a halogen bulb inside a metal shade, these get incredibly hot and are an accident waiting to happen.All in all, a comfortable and clean room, a great location, little 'wow' value, overpriced and a hotel with some significant flaws.

<Content>What all good small hotels should aspire to be On top of all that has been said about the aesthetically pleasing decor, the great location, the beautiful breakfasts, and enthusiastically pleasant service, I would like to commend them on going the extra mile to make a special birthday celebration go like clockwork.In just three days, they organised 4 taxis for us, a limosine tour, confirmed and followed up on restaurant reservations, proposed a visit with the artist of the hotel, and gave us the impression that nothing would be too much trouble for us to do.Having some experience of such things, and executive service in business, I would have to say this was the most real, warmest, and least forced example of a personalised service I have ever experienced. If you have the money to spare - you are accessing a really top quality of service at a fairly moderate price and hence it deserves to be at the top of your shortlist.We upgraded the room of the person whose birthday it was. in practice this gave them an extra seating area, and a bath in addition to a shower. Worth it as a treat, though we were very happy with our smaller room, which though small was artistic in feel, and with quiet and fully functioning a/c.

<Content>Great Experience We stopped in Paris on our way to Italy for a 2.5 week honeymoon and were very pleasantly suprised by Acadamies et Des Arts. It's a fabulous hotel in a great location - close to everything you could possibly desire. The staff were very friendly and helpful and made us feel very comfortable and welcome. Rooms were small but nice and well decorated. Very clean, updated bathrooms/showers.

<Content>Location excellent - next to Vavin Metro The room assigned to us was very comfortable as per description. Typical compact Parisian hotel room but well laid out with a seperate wc and bath area. The hotel was superbly located with many attractions on your doorstep and walkable. The metro location was litterally across the road which made navigation smooth and easy. The hotel staff were all very friendly, with excellent English and a good sense of humour. They made sure they did their utmost to make our stay pleasent. Recommendations were given for eating and directions to a great jazz bar along with making bookings for Moulin Rouge.Only downsides were a dodgy keyboard in our room, which choose not to work and an entertainment charge which was not nearly as flexible as just having a standard sky package with MTV etc. I would recommend this hotel for a romantic two - three night getaway.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel - would go back We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and would thouroughly recommend it. The location was suberb, with a metro line (Vivane) seconds from the hotel doorway. The staff were wonderfully helpful, aiding us in any which way they could and the rooms were lovely - we even had a bath which is not a common Parisien hotel feature!

<Content>A Little Gem We booked this after reading the reviews on TA and were not disappointed. The staff are really fantastic and so helpful. The hotel is in a great location and is well appointed and furnished. We will definitely be back...

<Content>The Praise is Deserved This boutique property deserves all the praise it has been getting. My wife and I stayed there for four nights in early July. Everything was as advertised, especially the friendliness of the staff. I had emailed the hotel that we would be arriving about noon and, although check-in is officially at 3 pm, they had made a special effort to have a room ready when we arrived. That was a real plus after hours on a plane. Henry, the day person at the desk, is especially nice and extremely helpful in all matters. I really recommend this hotel most strongly. And, by the way, when you ask for ice, they really give you ice! That is a real plus for me as it is for most Americans.This was our first trip to Paris, though we have both travelled through Europe extensively. I feel compelled to give new visitors to Paris a bit of a warning about the Underground as it generally receives unrestrained praise. Yes it works fine if you are knowledgeble about all the recent alterations. However, if you are not, be prepared for frustrations. For example, we wanted to take a riverboat cruise on the Seine and were told to take the number 6 (I think I am remembering the number correctly) in the direction of Charles de Gaulle Airport and were given directions to the Underground station. However, when we arrived, there were no signs indicating a that the #6 had a direction of Charles de Gaulle. All that was available was direction Nation and direction Etoile. Turns out the Etoile is Charles de Gaulle, but it took some research to find out. Similarly, we took a side trip which required we get a train at Gare de Lyon. We took a taxi there, but decided to take the Underground back as the map of the underground indicated that good old number 6 stopped at Gare de Lyon. We found the entrance to the Underground and need to head in direction Etoile (we had wised up at this point). But it seems that the platform for direction Etoile was closed for some reason, perhaps for repairs. Again, a frustrating difficulty for someone unfamiliar with the peccadilloes of the Underground. Other problems we found we that the maps of the Underground are not current, though station signs are. On a couple of occasion the maps showed the direction ending at a location but, evidently, the line had been extended so we could never find the direction shown on the map. Why they don't post easily readable lists of stations like the ones which are actually in every car is beyond me. In short, being familiar with the terrific maps of the Washington DC Metro, I sure wish the Paris Metropolitan would do the same.But, again, the hotel is great. You won't go wrong. And the free wireless access to the internet is a real plus for me.

<Content>Compact and bijou Whilst I have to agree with all the positive comments in previous reviews, i.e. beautifully appointed rooms, freindly staff, close to the metro and on a very quite street just off Montparnase, I do feel the need to point out the fact that some of the rooms at least are a bit on the small side. There was barely room to store a couple of suitcases, it was only just possible to close the door whilst using the toilet and although the bath was beautifully designed, I'm afraid taking a bath was totally out of the question.That said, we did thouroughly enjoy our night here, I'm just a bit surprised that, at around 180 euros a night, ,most other reveiwers think it worth 5 stars,

<Content>Great Hotel and Great Staff This hotel was fantastic! The staff was so friendly and the location was wonderful. We stayed in room 33, which I would recommend requesting, it was a very good size room with two windows that opened up. The decor is modern and everything is recently renovated. A note to those traveling to Europe- we stayed at 5 hotels in four countries and NONE gave out wash clothes or hair conditioner! Two important things for a gal to have... so bring them with you. The rate we paid per night was $197.00 euro's per night (inclusive of taxes). The only downside to the hotel was that the elevator was very tiny, but most of the hotels over there have this issue. Overall, great place, great location, great staff... a great place to stay in Paris!!

<Content>Absolutely Wonderful! We just came back from a stay at the Hotel des Academies et des Arts. I can't say enough wonderful things--great hotel, great decor, WONDERFUL and helpful staff who all speak perfect English, excellent location in the 6th (close to 4 Metro stops, the Luxembourg Gardens, countless bistros, cafes, bakeries and bars). The rooms are a bit of the small side, but since you're in Paris, who is really spending that much time in a hotel room when you have a beautiful city outside? The are decent sized for Paris, and very reasonably priced. There's continental breakfast available every morning in the hotel, but since it is 15 Euros/person, we ventured out every morning to a cafe or bakery for a croissant or crepe and saved a bundle. There's no bar or restaurant in the hotel, but since you're in such a great area, you can go just about anywhere and find a drik or a lovely meal. Try the Blue Sky Pub just down the street for late-night drinks...great crowd and staff. I would highly, 100%, without a doubt recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Paris.

<Content>Delightful hotel What a delightful hotel in the Montparnasse District with ready access to everything!Our room was a very comfortable size by Paris standards and the hotel decor throughout was welcoming and unpretentious. The room had a feeling of luxury and was complemented by the most wonderful shower encountered in our 6 weeks of travel!The service was excellent and the staff were genuinely warm and friendly and very helpful in pointing us in the right direction, making our stay all the more memorable. We will now look forward to our next return visit to Paris, and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as an ideal place to stay.

<Content>An outstanding charming hotel experience in Montparnasse, Paris Everything positive written about this hotel is true. The staff is outstanding, the hotel is extremely charming and the value for money is without comparison. The location is the only but - it could be more central, but H么tel des Academies et des Arts has used its location in the arty Montparnasse area in a positive way and integrated art in the hotel interior, design etc. Truly a highly recommended hotel.

<Content>What a treat! Hotel des Academies not only provided us with a fabulous stay in Paris but also ensured we are eagerly planning our next trip to visit ASAP! The design, decor, ambience, service provided by friendly staff and location of Hotel des Academies is wonderful. Although the rooms are 'cosy', their thoughtful interior design ends up making you feel like you're staying in a spacious, modern retreat. We loved everything about our stay with Hotel des Academies and in Paris!

<Content>Simply Delightful After much research into where to stay for our first trip to Paris, we decided on this hotel and were extremely pleased. We stayed five nights and never got tired if it. The hotel is technically in St. Germain (6th Arrondisement) but is in the most southern portion of St. Germain and borders Montparnasse, therefore it's a bit more quiet (we didn't hear a peep at night and slept very well) while still being in a very convenient location, with easy access to the Metro and busses too. It's about a 20 minute walk to the Seine, through some beautiful blocks. The hotel was clean, modern, stylish, it felt very safe, and all of the staff we encountered were extremely pleasant. The bathrooms are nice and modern and while not huge, were certainly not simply closets. The bathrooms are well appointed with nice soaps and shampoos and even bath salts to use in the very clean bathtubs. The concierge recommended an excellent restaurant (La Timbre) and were always smiling and willing to help. We did not take advantage of the hotel breakfast since it's a bit pricey (15 Euro per person), especially considering that there are many good pastry shops and cafes within 1-3 blocks. Also the hotel is a mere 50 paces from a BNP Paribas bank, which is useful if you're a Bank of America customer since BNP Paribas partners with Bank of America such that Bank of America clients can use the BNP Paribas ATM to get cash completely free of any additional fees, very helpful to know. Overall this hotel was clean, stylish, relaxing, welcoming, and very comfortable. The rooms are on the small side, even the Double Club which we had, but we had plenty of room for luggage and even some nice shelves on which to unpack, and the coziness of the room was just perfect to come back to after an exciting but tiring day of hitting the pavement of Paris.

<Content>An amazing weekend Wow. What an amazing weekend my wife and I have just experienced. We went to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and we couldn't have hoped for a better place to stay.It's so easy to get to - straight there from Gare du Nord (metro line 4) and the hotel is literally around the corner.The hotel is clean, well decorated and themed (check out the lift) and the staff so helpful. Paris is not brilliant for vegetarians, but Anne-Sophie on reception decided to do some research for us and printed maps, names and numbers whilst we were out sightseeing.The surrounding area is full of cafes and brasseries. You get better value for money by eating breakfast at one of these rather than the hotel, but if you want a lie-in, the hotel breakfast is probably best as you can have it until midday.Overall a fantastic hotel which I would recommend.

<Content>Incredibly convenient Firstly, the hotel is incredibly convenient for anyone arriving via Eurostar to the Gare du Nord. It's a direct metro ride down to Vavin. The surrounding area is quieter than some of it's more central neighbours, but there are some lovely bars nearby for al fresco drinking and it's about a twenty-or-so minute walk down to the Latin Quarter via the beautiful Jardin du Luxembourg.The hotel itself is modern without being distractingly so and the staff are courteous and helpful. The rooms are modest in size, but bright and clean. As I think some other reviewers have mentioned, it is possible to sometimes hear people in the adjoining rooms, but unless you are a particularly light sleeper I wouldn't let this deter you from a really great hotel.

<Content>Loved this hotel! You Must Experience this Gem! Staying at this location was an incredible experience from start to finish. The staff is outgoing, and willing to provide you with great recommendations on anything from restaurants to the sites not to be missed. The location is perfect because you get a mix of the locals, going to the cafes and markets, as well as access to the tourist attractions. The location is very close to the train and bus routes, which makes getting around Paris easy. Having been recently renovated, the hotel rooms are clean and well decorated. I love the art-influenced decorations. There are tons of cafes and places to eat any meal, all within walking distance. We ate at a great place across the street, it is painted maroon outside, and enjoyed a delicious dinner. The hotel is intimate, and they serve an incredible breakfast ... fresh juice; great pastries; fruit slices and delicious coffee -- great way to start the day. When I return to Paris, I will be back to this hotel!

<Content>Wonderful hotel I booked two nights at the hotel based on reviews on this site and could not have been more pleased. The hotel is beautiful, wonderfully decorated and an excellent location. The room was completely comfortable, great beds, lots of pillows. The highlight is the staff, so helpful and friendly. Definitly wished we had more nights there. Highly recommended.

<Content>A Great Paris Experience This hotel deserves it's ranking as one of Paris' best hotels. For service it must rival the grand hotels and in a great location too.We stayed 6 nights recently - a family of 4 from Australia with two teenage children. We could not have felt more welcome. With two teenagers the hotel thoughtfully gave us two rooms across from each other and by closing the fire door we could interconnect them. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff (they even helped my son with his schoolboy French) and they provided excellent restaurant and sightseeing suggestions that made our Paris trip especially memorable. On top of everything the breakfasts were really delicious. We would not hesitate to stay there again, I cannot speak too highly of it.

<Content>Fabulous! I stayed in this hotel for one night only but it I was very pleasantly surprised. The staff is really friendly and helpful and the service is great. The room was very pretty, loved the classy decorations and the beds were fantastic! The location is very close to two metro stations. The area is nice also, close to Montparnasse and the Jardin du Luxembourg. I hope to stay there again and I truly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Amazing hotel! Lovely, friendly, helpful staff made my 3 day stay very welcoming! Located in the Montparnasse area right besides Vavin Metro Station. The hotel upgraded us to a Superior room upon arrival!! The room, although small (but hey this is Paris) was very clean, cosy and functional. Definitely recommend to anyone!!

<Content>Absolutely Fantastic!! I stayed in this hotel in March 2008 for three nights on a weekend break with my mam. We were delighted with our choice of hotel which was in a lovley area of Paris. On our arrival the staff could not have been more helpful and throughout our stay they were very friendly and lovely to talk to. The hotel itself was fantastic, with lovely contemporary decoration and very comfortable beds. The rooms were big enough for us both and our luggage, the bathrooms are compact but we had no problems managing. The location is also excellent and we walked to all of the major sites. There is a great bar/restaurant about 2 minutes walk called Charley Birdy which was also very friendly and had great, reasonably priced food. We would definately recommend the hotel to anyone. Thank you very much for a fantastic stay!!

<Content>A Great Find My husband and I have just returned from a three night stay at the Hotel des Academies et des Arts where we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. We had visited Paris once before and stayed in the 1er arrondissement and, although we enjoyed our first stay, this time we wanted to find a more authentic Parisien neighbourhood to experience a different Paris. Staying at the Hotel des Academies et des Arts we were not disappointed as this is a great hotel in a very appealing area - don't be put off by looking at a map of Paris and wondering if you may be too far off the beaten track as this is not the case at all. The Hotel is located a short and very pleasant 5 minute walk from the Jardin du Luxembourg which is a real hive of activity - recommend lunch in the little cafe there - and you can walk through the Jardin and find yourself near St Sulpice and Boulevard St Germain in no time at all. However, the local neighbourhood around Rue Vavin is very buzzy on a Saturday with lots of nice little shops and cafes plus the peaceful Musee Zadkine is just around the corner and you can happily while away a morning or afternoon in the area. There are also several Metro stops near to the hotel for taking trips further afield although you may find yourself, like us, longing to return to the local area when you find yourself emerging from a Metro stop into a typically busy and touristy area!! The Hotel itself is delightful - recently refurbished with a lot of thought and style yet small enough to be really friendly, offering first class personal service. The team on reception were able to recommend some excellent local restaurants, the three that we chose were all no more than a 5 minute walk from the Hotel and we had three superb meals. We decided to pay the extra 15 euros each for breakfast and this was probably one of the nicest hotel breakfast experiences we have had as there is no unseemly battling at a large buffet - instead the hotel staff deliver your own breakfast to your table and, given the current cost of eating out in Paris, we thought that we were getting good value for our 15 euros.Are there any downsides? Well, if your budget allows we would recommend booking into one of the largest rooms as space is at a premium here and our room was a little on the small side. Also try to get a front facing room which will be lighter than those at the back of the hotel. But that's it really - all in all a great find and we will certainly return!

<Content>Wonderful! Yes the hotel is tiny but when you arrive you feel like you've got a real 'find'. Down a little side road from the busy Bvd Montparnasse - you're spoiled with restaurants/bars nearby plus within easy walking distance of most places in Paris. (Well, we walked everywhere - not saying everyone should!) The way the place has been decorated is really luxurious and creative - the reception is tiny, but really cosy and everything looks so well appointed. The room again was really little, but beds to die for and everything you needed - great pressure shower and a bath you could really lie down in. If you're comign to Paris there's so much to do, I can't imagine anyone would want to spend ages in there hotel room anyway - so the size of the room isn't a problem oh and there's heaps of storage/'hanging space for clothes.. Plus all hotels in Paris have tiny rooms anyway. The staff are exellent - really welcoming and friendly. I would return in a heart-beat!

<Content>Clean and friendly We stayed at the hotel for one night on our way to Monaco. The hotel is lovely, new and clean. The staff is professional, friendly, helpful and spoke English. Our room was small but well appointed but it was not as small as some hotel rooms we have stayed in. The bed was ultra comfortable and the bath facilities more than adequate. The location was close to metro and bus stations and some very nice cafes and restaurants as well as close to the Luxembourg Garden. This was our first time staying in the 6th, we usually stay on the right bank so this was a change. There were some thoughtful touches throughout the hotel, complimentary use of a computer and interent in the lobby for guests, a lit fire in the fireplace to warm the lobby as well as some interesting decorative touches. The one thing I did not like was that the decorative throw placed across the foot of bed to give a swish of color to the pristine white sheets had a stain on it but since I am a clean freak I probably noticed it when most people might not have. It was just not something I expected. Aside from that one thing everything else was completely spotless. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel but there is a little restaurant in the hotel which served continental breakfast. I am sure it would have been wonderful.

<Content>great hotel in paris! The staff at this hotel was extremely helpful and friendly. Henry went above and beyond expectations to help make our stay comfortable. The internet on the flat screen tv was a nice touch. Rooms were small but well appointed. Close to the metro for easy access and many great restaurants on the main road. Also close to the very beautiful Luxemburg Gardens. I highly recomend this for any visits to Paris.

<Content>Good hotel but... My wife and I booked this hotel for three nights in early January.Probably I do not need to add positive factors on this hotel since many have already written favorable comments. I of course agree with most of them. Yes, this is a good hotel.What I would like to add, in order to balance the evaluation, is regarding the size.Where we stayed was a standard double room and we had a couple of suitcases with us (since we were from other side of the world). What happened on us is that we were not allowed to find enough room to settle the suitcases due to its smallness. I would stay here again in the light of other positive factors, but I do not recommend this hotel to a sumo wrestler.

<Content>Perfect! I booked this hotel after reading all the wonderful reviews on Tripadvisor, and was not disappointed.The hotel is in a lovely area, and it is easy to walk around the surrounding districts. We felt very welcome at the hotel and the young lady on reception was very helpful and keen to make sure we made the most of our short stay. She was very approachable, nothing was too much trouble and understandably proud of the reputation of the hotel.Yes - the room was small, but it was presented beautifully, there was room in the wardrobe to put everything away, and the bathroom felt luxurious. The room was decorated in shades of white, black and grey and looked very stylish with a wall mounted flat screen t.v., hand painted art on the walls and expensive looking bathroom fittings.We didn鈥檛 have breakfast at the hotel, so can鈥檛 comment on it 鈥?preferring to get a croissant and coffee in local cafes. We had a meal at the restaurant across the street called Wadja, they were very helpful translating the menu, suggesting a wine to go with our meal, and made us feel very welcome.Without sounding too gushy 鈥?we had a wonderful time in Paris and this hotel definitely lived up to its reputation.

<Content>Small but perfectly fomred Hi ,We stayed at the hotel des academies et des arts over new years and had a brilliant stay. This is a beautiful small hotel. Yes the rooms are on the small side but this is to be expected in Paris. The rooms are tastefully decorated and the hotel is in a great location. If you are used to staying in a large corporate hotel with 24hr room service and acres of space then this hotel is not for you. If you want a stylish, friendly, small hotel with great service in a great location then this hotel is the best in Paris.

<Content>Splendid Hotel! This hotel is simply one of the places to stay in Paris! It has been sympathetically refurbished and whilst the rooms are on the small side they are comfortable and have all amenities that anyone could wish for. We stayed in Rm 32, a superior room and we could have asked for no more! The decor is lovely and modern, the beds are comfortable and the power showers are great! The Hotel itself has a very intimate and personal feel and this is enhanced by the friendly and extremely helpful staff that can cater for your stay in Paris! As for location, the hotel is well placed and very near to the Metro station for access to all tourist areas. The area surrounding the hotel is also buzzy and has La Coupole a very famous Frech Brasserie visited by the likes of Hemingway, Piaf and now me! The hotel is also very near St Germain de Pres and that area is worth a visit as is Le Marais - both cool, hip and great areas to walk through and have some food! As for food etc visit La Coupole, Alcazar, Cafe Marly (at the Louvre). As for drinking go to Buddha Bar, the bar at Hotel Costes as well as others.

<Content>Great Place! I had originally booked a room at hotel duo, but after reading the reviews on this site, I quickly cancelled and booked here and boy was that the right decision. The team at des academies was amazing, they made sure we knew our way around the city and made any arrangements to restaurants, day trips,etc. The staff is by far better than some 5 star hotels we have stayed at. The rooms ARE small, but very well thought out. We had 3 big suitcases and we made due, there was no wasted space. When in Paris we will go back to des academies.

<Content>A gem of a hotel I have only good things to say about this hotel. My brother  I stayed at the Hotel des Academies for a couple of nights and we found the hotel to be excellent value for money staffed by a team that really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and assist whenever they could.I have stayed in many hotels in Paris that claim a 5 star rating with a price to match and they have been very disappointing. The Hotel des Academies on the other hand does not claim to be anything it is not. It is an excellent 3 and a half star hotel that is tastefully decorated, clean and affordable and the staff were very attentive and welcoming.I will be sure to come back for my next trip to Paris and this little gem of a hotel proves you don't have to spend 400 euros plus a night for a good hotel in Paris.

<Content>Excellent again Stayed for the New Year with familyPositives. - Excellent staff, Good location, Sexy Breakfast.Negatives - Room size ( I know everyone says it but they are tiny and we misplaced shoes,hairbrush, bottles etc)The setting is modern and we were apprehensive about bringing our 3 kids but all was fine. The oldest hogged the free net downstairs and the baby loved the very comfortable bed.The neighbourhood is exciting with up market cafes and a breakfast cafe close by. The Lux gardens was dissapointing as it was winter as I'm sure it is beautifull in Summer.Expect this hotel to be hard to book in future. Be Warned !!!!!

<Content>Pretty Much Perfect This hotel had pretty much everything we needed to have a romantic and comfortable 3 day stay in Paris. Very close to metro and all sightseeing, with great cafes and restaurants nearby (including the famous seafood restaurant - The Dome, just opposite) modern, newly renovated, beautiful room - small (what room in Paris isn't?) but very cosy and beautifully decorated and appointed. Very friendly and helpful staff, great room service, and everything we needed readily available. This hotel was really good value for the price - beyond 3 stars. We would definitely recommend it if you want a trouble-free and comforatble stay in Paris.

<Content>Highly recommended Positives: a) excellent location 5 minutes away from Luxembourg Gardens and multiple Metro stations. b) super friendly staff c) excellent (continental) breakfast, d) neat modern art, design and furniture, e) free email accessNegatives: a) rooms are small (at least our room 52 was), b) modern design brings with it some quirks like - phone was fastened to night stand so that I had to lie on the floor to dial, - shower temperature hard to fix at the right temperature, - elaborate lighting system takes some time to figure out. Still the positives far outweigh the negatives noted, so we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again

<Content>Cold Outside - Warm Charming Hotel and Staff We just spent three nights at the Hotel des Academies and we had a wonderful stay. We used trip advisor to find this property and the reviews are right on track. The hotel is recently remodeled and very clean. The rooms are small but very nicely decorated and well laid out. Contrary to some of the reviews, our bed was very comfortable and the shower half-door was sealed. It does take some time to adjust the temperature in the shower with the modern handle; but by day three I was an expert. The hotel is centrally located to the bus and subway lines. The Staff (Henri and Patricia) were extremely helpful charting our course every morning and every evening this being our first trip to Paris and having a very long list of things we must do and see. We will be back.Gary  Sherry

<Content>Nowhere near as good as Tripadvisor would have you believe... I booked this hotel based on the excellent reviews here on tripadvisor and must say that I was very disappointed. The decor is pleasant enough as are the staff and the location was very convenient for me too. However, the size of my club room was very small indeed as was the bathroom which was separated from the room by way of a curtain. If you were to travel on your own, the size wouldn't matter so much, however if you travel with your partner I would suggest you find yourself another place to stay. The hotel has been cleverly designed to pack in as many rooms as possible. In this they have gone way too far. Avoid!

<Content>Good hotel, good location I am a hotelier and guide from London. I had a one night stay at the Hotel des Arts with my wife on a sight-seeing and shopping trip. We both know Paris relatively well so I'd chosen the hotel in particular for its location. It is convenient for the RER from the Gare du Nord to Port Royal, and within walking distance of the Jardin de Luxembourg and St. Germain, as well as a host of excellent restaurants and the newly-refurbished Bon March茅.Wanting to maximise the time we had to explore Paris we arrived in the morning and had a very friendly welcome from the receptionist, who was both helpful and knowledgable. Having left our luggage for the day we checked-in later. The room I found to be well-designed, a bit on the small side, although the bed was big and very comfortable; perfectly adequate for a short break. The bathroom was excellent (always a good sign) and a nice touch was that our toiletries were topped up while we were out in the evening. One could say that the choice of t.v. channels was limited, but then again one shouldn't go to Paris to watch t.v.We didn't try breakfast as a good breakfast can be had at most French caf茅s for half the price that you would pay in any hotel in Paris. On checking-out the staff were once more friendly and professional. I liked the small lounge area by the reception which was well stocked with art books as well as a good range of newspapers and magazines.I'd recommend the Hotel des Arts for couples on a short break who want a good hotel at a reasonable price in the St Germain area. It's not somewhere I would go with my children or as a family trip, and I'd be surprised if the hotel marketed itself as such.

<Content>Terrible service - very disappointed Sorry to be the black sheep on Trip Advisor but our experience and my view of this hotel is very different to the others posted. We used Trip Advisor recommendation to decide for the hotel and therefore I feel compelled to give our experience. So it was my mother's 60th Birthday and my sister and I did lots of research on hotell finally deciding on the Hotel des Academies et des Arts 1) because of location 2) because of so much positive review regarding decor and service. I have stayed at numerous others in St. Germain including the K+K Cayre (which is great) and at first sight, the HDAEDA was a good choice. Decoration is fantastic and staff friendly. However, this shiny exterior soon faded. The rooms are incredibly small - cool decor, well laid out - but minute. I had to leave the bathroom to dry myself after a shower ! We had three rooms in the family, my sis, my mother and myself. all rooms exactly the same except in ours they had squeezed a bath in, making the bathroom even wincier. for this we were charged an extra 35鈧?per night because it was deemed a 'superior' room - what a joke. We complained especially as the receptionist agreed that no superior rooms were available (my sis wanted one) and expected them all to be the same price. They were one on top of each other .... since then we have been waiting and debating for a week this extra unreasonable cost. Still not resolved, now waiting for a week. In total we stayed 3 nights - over 1800鈧?spent. not by any means a cheap option. My mother was ill on the Saturday so she needed room service. Some kind of hot drink. The hotel info said up until 11pm service was available. At 9pm, nothing was possible. Nothing. Not even hot water. We had to go to a local restaurant to get a drink for my ill mother. Not good. Secondly, regarding service - we came back on the Saturday, to no towels in our room. Not even flannels. So we rang down and asked for them. Someone came up and asked to come in the rooms to check there were no towels. I told him there were none and he asked me, am I sure ?. I also have disbelief at the service but I wouldn't dream of 'accusing my customers of stealing towels'. Same thing happened to us the third night and to my sister and husband. The excuse given when we left was all of the staff are new, nothing by way of apology. Thirdly, breakfast was very average. Nothing special compared with the K+K buffet which had champagne and a big fruit selection. HDAEDA's was served as there is no space for a buffet. My final gripe was that the TV system was rubbish. Nice flat panel TV, but the menus were very slow, very poor selection of TV channels and for almost everything, you had to pay extra. In summary, I don't want to be unfair. We enjoyed our stay enough, staff were friendly and decor was cool. However, service was lame and the value - per sq metre of hotel you get (i.e. cost and room size) was extremely low in our view. I just don't think this is the best hotel in Paris and I find it hard to believe all of the previous reviewers had none of the issues we experienced. p.s. the candid photos shown must have been Suites I think, not very representative. We had two normal and one superior / club room, all minute.

<Content>Best Hotel in Paris I have stayed at this hotel twice in two months and it is spectacular. Very cool boutique hotel with ultra friendly staff - feels like being at home in Paris. The decor is tasteful, the rooms comfortable - especially by Parisian standards. I cannot say enough about the friendliness of the staff - it is truly the personal service that sets this hotel apart from the rest. This hotel is becoming very popular so book ahead of time - a great homebase in Montparnasse!

<Content>My home away from home in Paris Tucked away in a tiny street near the Luxembourg Gardens, this 20-room hotel is both elegant and welcoming. Although the interior spaces are small, the design is so ingenious that my room was very comfortable. The continental breakfast was generous. Most important, the concierge always seated at the desk in the intimate lobby provided friendly advice and service beyond the call of duty. My thanks to the manager, Henry Mona, for a most enjoyable stay in Paris from November 30 to December 5, 2007.

<Content>Lovely Hotel and Excellent service I can say without a doubt that you will not be disappointed when you stay at this hotel - Now I wouldnt stay anywhere else in Paris. First the location, we caught the train from CDG and got off at a station which is a pleasant 10 min walk from the hotel along a tree lined street. In addition the hotel is v. close to 2 or 3 metro stations and bus stops. There a number of very good restaurants in the area providing very good reasonably priced food and opportunities to dine/drink el fresco and people watch - can be quite addictive!So the hotel, on arrival we were met by Henry who speaks perfect english and were upgraded to an exec room on one of the top floors - which was a good size with plenty or storage and circulation space. The staff are also very useful giving tips on the best transport routes, restaurants and even showed us exactly which bus to take.The staff will attend to your every need without being overbearing - even 4 weeks after you have left. The hotel kindly forwarded my wife's shoes to us after we discovered we had forgotten them. This hotel is impeccably maintained and is a testament to its staff. The hotel is clearly growing in popularity and continues to deliver. The hotel has moved up from number 5 in the tripadvisor reviews in the last few months and Im hoping it will knock George V off the top spot - they deserve it.

<Content>Perfect Service We stayed at the Hotel des Academies et des Arts during the first week of December. We were celebrating my birthday. When we arrived the staff had placed a nice bottle of champagne in the room. The rest of our stay was perfect. Henri and Patricia were so very helpful in making our stay a pleasure. Although our room was small, it was very clean and comfortable. We've stayed at the Four Seasons George V and the Intercontinental on previous stays in Paris. When we come again, we'll stay at the Hotel des Academies et des Arts!

<Content>Beautiful hotel, amazing staff We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights at the end of November but would have loved to stay longer. Not only is it in a convenient and easy to find location (2 minutes away from Vavin metro station), but it is beautifully decorated and welcoming. From the moment we arrived, the staff and owners (who all spoke perfect English) were falling over themselves to help us, recommending nearby restaurants/cafes, the best transportation, places to visit, and telling us about the history of the hotel. With original art in every room and a great living room full of books on the subject, this is a great place for an art lover to stay, but everyone will appreciate its classy decor and overall warmth. Rooms are typically small (but not overly so) and it is somewhat expensive, but totally worth it. I could not think more highly of this place and will definately stay again.

<Content>Parisian Gem I have just returned from a short break here with my husband, and again Trip Advisor has not let me down. What a lovely little hotel, and the staff are as friendly and helpful as previous writers say. We were also there during the strike, but found it a good location for walking to wherever we wanted to go, about 45 - 60 minutes to the Eiffel Tower, Rodin Museum, Louvre and Seine area generally. Having walked all day we were very happy to find that there are many good local restaurants, Wadja the nearest was great, as was the Dome fish restaurant [though this a bit pricey] and one on the opposite corner to the Dome, the name escapes me - Rondello?, or similar anyway. There are fantastic patisserie's nearby too. If you want any recommendations about where to eat, or go generally, just ask at the desk. They will happily make reservations, and a member of staff even went down the road to reserve for us at Wadja when they couldn't get through on the phone!The hotel itself is spotless, and all facilites in our room [34] fine, inlcuding the shower [which seems to have been a bit of a problem in some rooms from recent reviews]. The room was quite small, and I imagine they all are, but really well designed, and I'd expect small in Paris. We found the bed really comfy, and the room was amazingly quiet for Paris being at the side, so we had 3 great nights sleep. Overall we were really happy with this choice of hotel, and it would take some convincing for me to want to stay anywhere else in Paris.

<Content>Hotel des Academies et des Arts - a hidden gem This was one of the first times that we booked a hotel based the recommendations we got from the Trip Advisor which is used extensively by our daughter and son-in-law during their various travels. We were extremely satisfied with our decision as the hotel is an excellent property in the heart of Paris where we stayed from 13th to 16th November. The rooms were functional, neat and clean. The owner of the hotel, Laurent, leads by example and is onsite to give the personaltouch which makes a hotel exceptional. Henri  Patricia go out of the way to ensure that your needs are looked after. In fact, they were specially helpful during the public strike which had crippled Paris during our stay and ensured alternate transport as required apart from making reservations in excellent restaurants in the area. The hotel location allows you to walk to most of the attractions of Paris and there are a number of excellent restaurants within walking distance.A special mention must be made fo the service staff - the room service is 'electric' faster than at any hotel we have stayed.Overall an excellent experience and a hotel we are likely to return to for our next visit to Paris.Suresh  Neera Sawhney

<Content>Wonderful Hotel My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon and we could not have been more delighted. The bed was so comfortable that I never had a bad night's sleep during my entire stay. The rooms are elegantly appointed and I loved the decor.The location is great. There are plenty of good places to eat and drink all along the Boulevard Montparnasse and there are metro and RER stops no more than 5 minutes away.My only (very minor) complaint was that the shower design made water go everywhere, but the maid service was so good that we didn't even notice it when we returned at the end of the day.

<Content>Another 5 Stars for des Academies Just back from three nights at Hotel des Academies and can only echo the praise of previous reviewers. Having been open for only six months this hotel looks and feels in pristine condition and the staff seem genuinely pleased to welcome guest. Henri greeted us at lunchtime and took us personally along the street to their favourite restaurant (Wadja) and checked that they had a table available. The set meal (3 courses) was superb and very good value at 鈧?5.00 per person. What is more, there was a problem with the credit card machine and, unbeknown to us, the bill for our meal was charged twice. At breakfast the next morning, Henri explained that the proprietor of the restaurant had been in to the hotel to explain and apologise for the error. We resolved the problem by going back there on our last day and having lunch again!Our Club room (11) at the hotel was very well equipped and as small as we expected. The bathroom was fine, except that they have a problem at the moment with the glass panels attached to the baths which are supposed to allow you to shower. There is no rubber strip at the bottom and therefore no seal between shower panel and the bath - result - lots of water on the floor when you step out of the shower! The hotel is aware of the problem - but might have warned us in advance.Continental Breakfast was ample and beautifully presented.Not the cheapest hotel in Paris, but well worth the money.

<Content>Great Hotel, Excellent Location, Wonderful Staff We stayed at this hotel a few days ago for 3 nights, We booked the room after we saw Tripadvisor recommendations. The location of the hotel is graet very close to several Metro stations (2-5 minutes walk), we stayed in a double club room, The room was wonderful and very well decorated (flat TV screen, Very Clean room, and the bed is great). The staff was helpful, kindly and speaks fluent English (Henry, Patricia and Irefan) also the girl from the reception at nights was pleasant and helpful, and knew English,The staff guided us every day where can we go and what to see, (several sites are very close to the hotel -such as the Luxemburg gardens which is only 3 minutes walk from the hotel and other sites like St. Saint Germin and the Latin Quarter are also close,you can go there by foot). They recommended us restaurants we can go and the location of those. Henry guided us on the first day and he was more than Wonderful, Patrica told us about a special Cofee shop that we should go, we went and it was a very nice place. Irefan did every thing he could do to help us with the transportation to go to the Airport. We warmly recommend to go to Paris and stay in this hotel. I'm sure [and hope] we will go back there.

<Content>Wonderful Experience We chose this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews and we were delighted! Henry, along with the rest of the team was extremely helpful - great restaurants, best tours, transporation suggestions, etc. They even walked down to the taxi stand to help us get a taxi for the airport during the transit strike - so I guess they also deal in miracles. The hotel was very clean and smoke free. If you don't want the breakfast, you can just order coffee or chocolat (which was delicious). Our only complaint was the hard mattress which we cured by sleeping on the duvet/featherbed.

<Content>a hidden gem Really enjoyed our stay at this charming little hotel...although rooms are small, there is a place for everything (even 2 large suitcases). The staff is friendly and accomodating, eager to help in any way and, in case it matters, their English is very good too. Breakfasts are expensive (15 Euros per person) but nicely served and of course, very convenient. There are some great restaurants very close by and the area feels safe for walking to and from them at night. All in all, we felt we had made a great choice for our stay of 8 nights.

<Content>Brilliant Staff Spent 4 nights here during the semi finals of the World Cup. Unfortunately, France lost.A wonderfully relaxed place to stay. Great location. Interesting art work. Refreshing breakfasts. Would probably opt for a superior as opposed to club room next time, purely on the grounds of size!The young, confident, and charming staff really make it a pleasure to stay in H么tel des Academies et des Arts. They clearly enjoy working there and their enthusiasm is infectious.Keep up the good workMary  Glen

<Content>Fantastic hotel, great location! We stayed at Hotel des Academies et des Arts for six nights. We travelled over to Paris for the Rugby World Cup. It was a lovely hotel, small, but well laid out and comfortable. The room while maybe a little small had everything we needed, was extremely clean and comfortable. I really liked the art work, both on the walls and the sculpture located around the hotel, particularly on the staircase. The hotel is located in/near Montparnasse and so is ideally located for access to several Metro stations, great restaurants, cafes and also the main sights of Paris. We ate breakfast at the hotel some of the mornings and enjoyed it. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and we thoroughly enjoyed our little rugby chats with them. We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Fantastic Boutique Hotel Near Montparnasse Wow, what a find! My husband and I, as well as another couple we traveled with, stayed 4 nights at this fantastic boutique hotel open only 5 months (smoke free). The overall decor was artistically beautiful in every way with special touches everywhere. The staff, Patricia and Henry, speak English and went out of their way to be helpful. Service was 5 star! Beds were comfortable, and the room spotless. Room size was average for European accomodations, but every inch is used wisely. We stayed in room 33 which had a Queen bed and great Vichy shower. Loved our 3rd floor view from the 2 windows opening onto the quaint street, and looking left toward a major intersection - great people watching. Fantastic restaurants steps away as well as the Vavin metro station and bus stop, so convenient and we always felt safe. We will certainly be back, and highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris.

<Content>Stylish and well-located with tiny rooms I'm not normally fussy about room size as we travel with very little luggage and don't spend much time in the room. However, this hotel redefines the word 'small' - and it was a 'Club Double' (the middle category, room 44, 245 euros in period of high demand due to rugby world cup). To walk around the bed, the other person had to be actually on the bed as there was no space to pass! Our friends had same category room, different layout, but still very very small.Now to the positives. They could have put in a smaller bed, but thankfully the bed was decent size, super comfortable with a lovely white duvet (very rare in France, land of bobbly brown blankets and mean-sized top sheets) and great pillows. We had the best sleep - it was really quiet, no noise from neighbours, no morning cleaners banging around in the corridor and we even left the window open onto an inner courtyard which was silent. The room, bathroom and separate toilet had 4 windows, so was bright and sunny, but black curtains to ensure darkness when asleep. The decor was stylish and everything was new, clean and in good order. The shower was powerful (we didn't have the 'jets' mentioned elsewhere), with a slightly annoying joystick type control which was tricky to regulate (the manager is trying to improve this). Didn't have breakfast, just a pot of coffee (4euros) which we were happy with. Staff and manager were very pleasant  welcoming. They were very confused that we had been debited payment for 1st night (even thought we booked direct with hotel), but resolved when we showed the paper print out. The TV internet was useful feature  worked well. We found the location to be really super-convenient for everything we did. Easy to get to and from Gare du Nord Eurostar (direct RER to Port Royal or direct metro to Vavin) and easy to walk or travel anywhere. The circular night bus stops very close - useful if too late for metro and lack of taxis. We had already booked again for next week and we are happy to return. For future trips, it would be interesting to see the larger rooms.

<Content>Great boutique hotel We have just returned from 2 nights in Paris at this hotel. Though the rooms are small, this is somewhat expected for Paris. The great location, charming decor and friendly staff more than makes up for it.I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend others (esp. those who love a bit of personality in their hotels) to stay here.

<Content>Highly recommend!! My husband and I absolutely enjoyed our stay at this hotel. You really do get great value for your money. Our room was very clean and I liked the modern flair of the interior decorations. The location in the Montparnasse area was excellent--1) right off a street busy enough that it felt safe to walk to at night, 2) a metro stop on the next block, 3) easily walkable distance to St-Germain des Pres and Quartier Latin. There are also many dining options and cafes in the neighborhood in case you're tired at night and don't want to venture too far. The staff was very helpful--Air France had lost our suitcase and they called them several times on our behalf. All in all, we would definitely return to this hotel on our next trip to Paris. We just hope the hotel continues to be maintained in the current condition!

<Content>Great Value for Money! Choosed the hotel because of the good rating on tripadvisor.com and it was absolutely worth it! The rooms are not only recently renovated and clean but very stylish as well. I stayed in many hotels in Paris but never seen such helpfull employees. I certainly come back there again, great value for money!

<Content>Awesome! My son and I stayed here on his first trip to Europe. We loved it! It had a very European feel, but the staff spoke great English and were VERY helpful, especially Patricia! The rooms are meticulously maintained and everything is stylishly done.Our room was quite small...I asked for a bigger one but I'm not sure if I got it. Anyway, we gladly put up with it because everything else was PERFECT and the location was ideal.The artwork in the hotel is really cool and the lounge area very relaxing...with great music.All-in-all, its GREAT!I would definetely come back!

<Content>Class, Culture, and Convenience I felt welcome here the moment I walked into the lobby. Patricia and the rest of the staff were wonderful, providing useful information and suggestions without being intrusive. The hotel is within a block of 2 metro lines making it easy to move around the city. The neighborhood offers a variety of dining and shopping options and the Luxembourg Gardens are a short walk away. The hotel itself is lovely and features sculptures and drawings throughout the property including original artwork in each room. The rain shower with jets was magificent!

<Content>an hotel "脿 part" I loved the cultural angle of the place, you can see that the staff is delighted to share it. Ask the guy at the front desk and you will have the tour.There is a real art story there and you do not see that often in Paris especially @ this price.Room charming and clean (obviously not big because Paris but decorated with French taste - the one we like...).Perfect location - you do not run in the average tourist.Not far from les jardins du Luxembourg where i enjoyed reading the latest Douglas kennedy.

<Content>Wonderful Stylish Hotel in Great Location This hotel is fantastic. The staff are very helpful and friendly and are available 24//7. It is definitely the best hotel we have stayed at in Paris, and the location is also ideal for getting about and for drinking or dining.We went as a couple and would have to agree with the other reviews in that the rooms and hotel and of a very high standard and very well kept/cleaned.Unlike our previous visit to Paris, the rooms in this hotel are more or less soundproof and you cannot really hear any external noises - certainly not from other rooms etc. There was also a seperate toilet and shower in the room - the shower is pretty good too and is one of those ones were water seems to come from all over i.e. like giving you a massage.The interior of the hotel is impressive as well, and the artwork from ground floor to the top via the lift should be seen even if you are only staying on the 1st floor. The dining area is also nice, although at 15 euros a head, breakfast is not too cheap for what you get - 10 euros would have been more fair i would say.I'm not too sure what else to say about the hotel, other than we would highly recommend staying here and would suggest the hotel to anyone looking for a stay in Paris.

<Content>Hotel a gem We could not have been more pleased with our 6-day stay at Hotel Des Academies et Des Arts. The hotel is really a gem with a level of service that manages to be both excellent and warm. We had been looking for a smaller hotel with a chic, contemporary style, business-level amenities, attentive, friendly service and convenient to transportation and restaurants. We found all of these things at Hotel Des Academies et Des Arts. Our experience here added considerably to the enjoyment of our time in Paris.

<Content>Great location and helpful staff make this a place to return! Found this jewelbox of a hotel via booking.com while using the internet from another location in France. Newly renovated by decorators in conjunction with fine artists, the owners obviously care about the quality of everything they've installed-- from flat screen tvs to in-room free internet (also avail. via the tv, they give you a wireless keyboard), to the very comfortable firm beds and good pillows.The staff is always on hand to answer questions, and was kind enough to research travel arrangements for my day trip, and had a printout of train times ready for me when I returned from an evening out.This hotel is small scale. The lobby is small, but there is a lovely biblioteque adjacent to it with comfy couches, lots of interesting books on Parisian photography, etc. The real issue at this hotel is the room size, which is miniscule.They have truly done the very best they could to cram all the niceties into the rooms (mini refrigerator, deep tub and complimentary local bath salts), a desk to use your laptop with their free wifi; blackout curtains, good bedside reading lights; but there is precious little room for more than 2 small suitcases without falling all over yourself-- there is simply no there there.My recommendation is to take one small bag to the room, and ask the kind folks at the front desk, if they will store your other bag(s) during your stay. I didn't think of this until after we left, but it might be a good tip.Further, although the rooms are not cheap (we paid about 180 Euros per night on a special through the website), breakfast is NOT included, which we felt it should be, in light of the fact that you're not getting much of a room. One literally could not bring a picnic breakfast or lunch into the room and enjoy it at the teeny table/chairs provided-- you'll end up using the bed as a life raft if you are hoping the room will be functional for anything but relax and sleep.The breakfast looked only ok, despite the staff's great salesmanship of real fresh fruit, really good coffee, and real tea...which is all they offer in addition to a bread basket with a plain and chocolate croissant. For 15 Euros, this did NOT seem like a smart choice, since there are so many places in this convenient Montparnasse neighborhood one could select for half the price.Still and all, we would go back there, knowing there is little room for luggage-- probably booking a junior suite, or whatever their upgrade is...with only 20 rooms, there are limited choices.Also, take advantage of two charming restaurants on the very same block: Wadja and La Sieste. Both excellent values and filled with locals, not tourists, for a real taste of French cooking. Literally SCORES of movie theaters are nearby, too. The only ones which will be in English are those which were originally American or English to begin with, so don't expect to find a French film with English subtitles around here.

<Content>Highly recommend! I just returned from Paris and highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a boutique hotel. It is small and quaint. Very tastefully decorated - a comfortable lobby and tea room. I am extremely particular about hotels and spent countless hours researching a hotel in Paris. I booked the hotel on their website and it was very easy. It is an immediate booking - you don't have to wait back to hear from them like many of the small hotels. I did call the night before to confirm my reservation. There is also a computer in the tea room with free internet access. This was extremely convenient since I do not have a laptop. There is also wifi in the rooms. This location is wonderful. It is not in the tourist section but is easily accessible to St. Germain and is in walking distance to most everything. The Eiffel Tower was probably the furthest walk and took about 30 minutes. We saw all the sights and never had to take the Metro. I really enjoyed coming back to the peacefulness of the hotel after being around the crowds all day. The hotel is very clean and updated. They even have a safe and mini bar in the room. A/C works great! The rooms are small but I understand most are in Europe. I stayed in the deluxe so it was a bit larger. The windows are sound proof but make sure they are shut tightly if you don't want the noise. The staff was wonderful. Henri speaks and understands English wonderfully. The female, I cannot remember her name, was also very lovely. They are very accomodating on helping with maps, reservations, suggestions, etc. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel so I cannot comment on that. There is a spectacular bakery just down the street (towards Luxembourg Gardens) and one block to the left. It is on a corner and I believe has a burgundy awning above the door. You cannot miss it b/c it usually had a line out the door. They have amazing pastries, french bread and sandwiches - very inexpensive! Also, just across the main street in the opposite direction is a market for water and wine, etc. and a seafood stand. I hope this review is helpful as I use this sight often but have never written a review before.

<Content>Great small Left Bank Hotel Hotel was everything the Trip Advisor reviews said it was . We spent 4 nights for my wife's 60th Birthday (remember 60 is the new 40) and had a delightful time. The staff was very attentive, drew out maps to everywhere we wanted to go (we've been to Paris a number of times before so we had some more unusual requests for sights). They made dinner reservations for us and were able to get us in where we wanted to go. Location is interesting deep in the Left Bank and area around the hotel--Luxembourg Gardens, etc. is beautiful and peaceful. We walked to the Seine more than once and to Boulevard St-Germain so area is accessible. The Metro Stop is a few hundred yards from the hotel entrance. Room is Parisian-- small but cute and if you adjust--one stays on the bed when the other is moving, etc. it is fine. Loved the artwork although thru a slight mix-up--our fault--we missed the sculpter/artist when she visited.Also we booked thru Expedia but when we called to just make sure we were confirmed, turned out the fax from Expedia came a bit late and we ended up with a standard queen rather than the slightly larger one--cheaper but a little disapponting but it was French Open week and nothing good was available anywhere else.One of the best, most memorable birthdays my wife ever spent.

<Content>A wonderful small hotel... We've just returned from a week-long stay in Paris, and for two days of the holiday, we booked into the H么tel des Acad茅mies et des Arts in Paris. We chose the hotel from the previous Trip Advisor reviews, so we were fairly confident the hotel would be of a good standard based on what we'd read.Thankfully, the hotel was even better than described! The hotel has been open for only 3 months and this was evident because the hotel didn't seem fully booked - I can only presume such a new hotel needs some momentum to get the place fully booked. But because the hotel was new, everything is nice and clean, and pristine, making the experience even more enjoyable.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and spoke excellent English, but without being over-bearing like in some small hotels.The hotel is decked in various wall art and sculptures, and from the various reviews I feared it would be a bit 'arty' for us normal folk! However, it's very tastfully done and doesn't dominate the effect of this being an excellent hotel, with or without the art. It only goes to demonstrate the attention to detail. Even one side of the lift was clear-glass to view the art flashing past on the facing wall (our 1-year old doughter loved this bit!).We chose the largest type of room, but for those expecting space, you will be a little disappointed - however, all Parisian hotels have small rooms, so it's just something you've got to expect. We asked for a cot to be placed in the room, and there it was as requested - excellent. The bathroom was very fashionable with an all-over jet shower - it's a fantastic experience but floods the bathroom - watch out!A slight concern we raised with the staff was the opening full-length windows - whilst traditional railings prevent adults falling out, there's a small gap at the bottom which baby toddlers could easily climb out, which should really have an extra rail across. The best solution would be to keep the windows closed at all times if you have children. This was fine, as the airconditioning was effective and quiet.The location of the hotel is on the edge of the Latin Quarter, some 15 minutes walk from the Boulevard Saint-Germain. However, just 5 minutes walk from the hotel is The Jardin du Luxembourg - a fantastic family park with places to sit and watch the world go by, with a great children's play area. Nearby the hotel are a few of restaurants and bars, but not enough to cause a problem. The area itself is safe to walk about day or night.We looked at many many hotels in Paris and most looked either shabby or over priced. This stood out, and was definitely the best choice we could have made. If you're looking for a good, smart hotel in the centre of Paris with amenities fairly close by, choose this hotel - you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Pluses and minuses Wonderful rooms, great location, bad phones, okay service. Reccomended with a few notes...1. The ROOMS are brand new, clean, and have all the amenities. The only little complaint would be the phones are in nooks next to the bed that make them hard to access and dial. (more about the phones later) But they are a nice size, and pretty. In our room the bathroom didn't have a door, instead there was a curtain, with the toilet in its own room with a door. Not much privacy if you are with someone else.2. The LOCATION is steps from Montparnasse, so you have many metro lines, and SNCF trains to the suburbs/rest of France a few blocks away. The Jardin de Luxemborg is 3 blocks away, which is fantastic for a daily stroll. The neighborhood is like the Upper West Side, clean streets, great shops, cafes, places to eat, and is family oriented and tranquil.3. PHONES... do NOT stay here if you need to recieve messages at the hotel. The staff would consistently not give us our messages, tell us we had none when we did, there was voicemail in the room, but no one knew how to access it. A mess. The Wifi was not great, either.4. The room KEYS never worked!! Each time I returned to my room the electric key would not open the door and I had to go back and ask them to re-do the key. This being France, they blamed me for it saying I had lost a key causing some system problem. I don't mind a foul up, but it was a daily problem each time I came and went. It culminated in me being scolded by a man at the front desk in a rude way. I complained and they laughed it off, which was fine, but I never feel it is ok to be rude to anyone in any situation. OVERALLI don't know if I would stay here again. While it was lovely, with the trifecta of the wifi, phone messages and key issues it was a little bit too much of an effort to stay here.

<Content>Finally the right place Decorated with taste (modern but cosy), very quiet and lovely management. Plus, brand new adds up to the comfort. A 3 stars with a 4 stars room service. I am coming back soon
