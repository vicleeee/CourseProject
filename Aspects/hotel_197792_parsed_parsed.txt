<Content>Perfect for visiting Amsterdam on a budget I booked ITC Hotel on a whim after my holiday to Prague was cancelled so it all happened very quick. It was only after booking that it occured to me that I should check the reviews - when I did I wave of fear came over me as 90% of the reviews are unfavourable.I'd booked the hotel for myself, my boyfriend and two friends, I warned them that it may not be very good at all as I'd read the horrific reviews on here. But we were pleasantly suprised on our arrival. The hotel is very reasonably priced and travellers need to remember that it is a two star hotel, you can't go and expect five star luxury.The rooms are simple yet comfortable, warm and clean. The staff seemed nice and let us store our baggage at the hotel from 10am until the 2pm check in time which was very helpful.One thing that you may need to be prepared for - they asked us to pay 20 euros on arrival for tax for the four of us, after paying I checked my booking forms which stated that 拢4.99 was included in the price per person per night for tax and services. Had I known this before I would have protested.All in all a nice little hotel, nice views of the canal from the front. I wouldn't recommend this to anyopne other that students and young travellers, if you plan on going out for most of the day and night then its perfect but if you're looking for a romantic break or city retreat this hotel won't be for you.I hope this helps further ITC Hotel users.

<Content>amsterdam september 2008 stayed for three nights with friends.聽 Wonderful location, but that is really all I can say that is positive.聽 Vastly overpriced.聽聽 Rooms needed a good clean and new curtains and furniture.聽聽 washing/shower and toilet facilities inadequate. Breakfast not worth the extra money.聽聽 Go round the corner to the wonderful coffee houses.聽 The web site for the hotel is NOT up to date.聽 There is no bar, and most of the guests sensibly did not come and sample the delights of the breakfast provided.聽

<Content>Never again... ITC budget hotel in Amsterdam. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there in the past, so when my wife and I returned to Amsterdam we decided to stay at ITC. When we arrived, I was disappointed at the changes. While it claims to cater to the gay and lesbian travelers, it is owned and operated by a Chinese family.We made our reservations 6 months ahead of time. We were coming in on a red eye and would be arriving at mid morning. We emailed the hotel and asked if we could make arrangements to check in early. We were told there would be no problem; however upon our arrival we were not allowed to check in early. When we showed the desk clerk/manager the email granting us permission to check in that morning, he laughed and said, 鈥淥h she doesn鈥檛 work here anymore. Too bad.鈥?br/>When we finally checked in we were put in the smallest room in the back. The only window was in the shower which opened out on a construction site. To say the least we were very disappointed, as we made reservations well in advanced and even mentioned we were repeat guests. We did complain and we were given a much larger room at the same price, but both rooms鈥?beds were almost unusable they were so broken down and uncomfortable. Plus, we had to request for clean sheets for the bed, as the ones on the bed were obviously dirty.There web site (which is from previous owners of hotel) is now extremely misleading. There is NO bar. The internet access available to guest is dial up. The breakfast, which is 7euros extra, is not what is advertised at web site. No eggs. No Swedish crackers. No assortment of meats. The breakfast is a choice of 2 cold cereals, some sliced cheese and meat. Coffee and orange juice. The breakfast foods looked stale and left over from days before.They advertise 24 porn; however, it is one channel with the same boring, two men replaying over and over.While the staff is courteous, they don鈥檛 have a clue about being in the hospitality business. I am a budget traveler and have stayed in many budget hotels. I know what I can expect. ITC has a fresh coat of paint inside, but I have a feeling it鈥檚 going down hill from here. I wish I had not ignored the reviews I read before going. I had such a positive experience in the past, I was sure our stay would be just fine. All I can say is, 鈥淚 wish I had heeded the warnings.鈥?So dear traveler, I would strongly suggest you stay somewhere else. There are plenty of terrific hotels and hostels in that city.

<Content>ITC Hotel a find ITC hotel is a small hotel beside Prinsengracht canal in downtown Amsterdam. It is very conveniently located near a great eating area with cuisine from all over the world, the tram stops right outside and the price is very good for such a central area .Before booking over the internet we read several unfavourable reviews and hesitated ,however we were very pleased we proceeded with our booking. We found the hotel to offer all it advertised on its web site and were more than satisfied, considering the great location and compaable prices on the canals in Amsterdam The room was fine in all respects . Clean, good bedding and PLEANTY of hot water. If you want to stay in a typical Dutch house then expect typical Duth staircase.It is unreasonable for anyone to expect 5 star accommodation at 2 star prices. Be realistic. If you are a traveller make the most of the experience and enjoy..

<Content>Was 'okay' it was okay here at the ITC - we only stayed for one night.I didn't like the location - it was overlooking one of the main canals but was really far down the canal.There was nothing really wrong with our room - it was facing the canal and had two large windows letting in lots of light. I don't think I would stay again though.

<Content>Good location, average hotel I am somewhat surprised to see all the really negative reviews on here. In my opinion, the hotel was average--nothing more, nothing less. The staff was very friendly to me, despite their limited English (most spoke Polish, so if you know Polish, it can help). We had a room in the main building, with very efficient wireless internet (although it took a few hours to set up, since the receptionist didn't know how it worked, so I had to wait for the next shift...). The room was not spacious but it was certainly satisfactory. The location was ideal--near transportation with a very friendly bar just nextdoor and walking distance to Rembrandtsplein and beyond.While I wouldn't necessarily seek out this hotel again, I certainly wouldn't refrain from recommending it to a friend (which is how I found out about the hotel).

<Content>Okey if you're desperate Tiny little room and I bumped my head on the TV everytime I stood up in the first day. The city was quite full and hard to find a room so I booked two nites at the ITC. I thought it was very expensive for what it is so if you're really desperate stay here if not then steer clear.

<Content>Don't stay here - be warned I booked this hotel via their website 鈥?having previously visited it twelve years ago. It was listed as a Gay Hotel and on my last visit had been well run, clean with a pleasant atmosphere.The establishment has different owners now 鈥?How things had changed!On arrival this time I was shocked to see that standards had slipped, the welcome was cold, the reception area shabby. I was then shown to a room not in the main building 鈥揵ut in another house across the street above hairdressers.To say the room was dirty would be an understatement! The bed was unmade and had a huge bloodstain on the sheets. It looked and felt lie a room that is rented by the hour, not what I had been led to believe on the hotel website where I had requested their most expensive double.I returned to reception to complain, but had already decided to go to another hotel鈥ny hotel! The manager/owner made no apology 鈥?instead he said that he would charge me for three nights as he had my credit card details. He made no concession as to what I had booked or for the poor state of his establishment. The receptionist agreed that the place is not up to its two star rating out of earshot of the manager.I can鈥檛 tell you how disappointed I am - I have very happy memories of my previous two visits and had booked the place for my partner and myself on the strength of previous experience.It certainly is no longer a gay hotel 鈥?they are still trading on its past reputation and to charge 135 Euros a night for the dirty room we were shown and then insist that we pay anyway (the hotel wasn鈥檛 full) is verging on extortion!It was a very miserable start to our weekend in Amsterdam.

<Content>This hotel spoiled our holiday We booked three nights at the ITC Hotel online after checking their website (nice photos) and the location. Mistake number one was not checking TripAdvisor.On arrival, the side-street location overlooking the canal seemed great. But after checking in we were then led round the corner to a grotty ex-hotel on the main road, up some narrow, steep stairs and ushered into what can best be described as a space vaguely resembling a hotel room. Welcome to room no.23. Everything was there - walls, ceiling, bed, window, shower, toilet, sink, etc, but it looked like it had been put together by the local homeless people after a long night on the booze and weed.Our first night (Saturday night) was the noisiest night we have ever experienced in a hotel, and we hardly slept, if at all. Not a good sign.The following morning we went straight round to reception to ask to be moved to a quieter room, only to be told the hotel was fully booked (its the weekend ya'see - we're busy). We were offered a quieter room at the back of the main hotel building for the third night, at which we, relunctantly, agreed. During these high-level negotiations they constantly warned us that this new room was smaller than the one we were currently in. And we stupidly thought that was simply not possible! Oh, how wrong we were....The second night initially proved quieter (fewer drunks outside at 1 in the morning), although still in the room overlooking the main road, so we got to enjoy trams trundling past every 15 minutes until some time after midnight. That is, until about half past two when the fire alarm went off. Or rather, stayed on for about 5 minutes, which is a long time when a loud sounder is blasting you from deep slumber, scaring my wife half to death (not a good thing for a pregnant woman).Day three and we packed our bag, said goodbye to number 23, and looked forward to breakfast and a new room. We headed off into Amsterdam filled with a sense of hope. Oh, how innocent and naive.On return to the hotel we eventually found room number 19. There are photos and a description of this room already on this site in the review by Braxn. Suffice it say this room suffers from Inverse Tardis Syndrome - its smaller on the inside! Yes, this room _was_ smaller than the one we had come from. And the lack of any visible view from any kind of window was very depressing. Indeed, the view from the shower cubicle window is of a ventilation/light shaft.Overall, this hotel is the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. Don't be put off by the gayest hotel in Amsterdam line - its a cheap shot just to get web hits. The only recommendation we can offer is to stay AWAY from this hotel.

<Content>Disappointed - will not return The hotel's web page did not contain any photo of the rooms, but we saw some at easytobook.com that seemed nice.I made a reservation for 3 nights through the hotel's web and they inmediately charged me 20 euros (my bank instantly notifies me of any charges via SMS).The arrival day, at the reception, they asked us to fill a couple of forms, but we asked them to see the room (room #1) first. IT WAS AWFUL. It was at the basement, had two tiny windows to a back roof, smelled bad and was uncomfortable and unhabitable.We asked for another room and there was no one available. We complained about the assigned room against the ones saw at easytobook.com and told them that we were going to search for a room anywhere else.They told us about the cancellation policy and blah blah blah, but they finally said us that it was ok, that we had to pay nothing.What's my surprise when that day at 6pm I receive a charge notification from my bank with the amount of the entire stay (appart from the 20 euros they charged me upon reservation).Cancellation policy? I did not cancel anything. I just rejected that unhabitable room. I'm not going to pay for a room that I haven't even walked in because of the mentiones reasons.Finally my boyfriend and me stayed very pleasantly at The Goden Bear, only a few minutes away.Jose  Manolo, from Spain

<Content>Don't waste your money!! Don't be mislead by the website. This hotel is awful! It is in desperate need of a good clean and redecoration. My advice would be to stay elsewhere.

<Content>Very Pleasing The location of the hotel was perfect, and along with it's nicely presented rooms and friendly staff made this a very enjoyable stay. We spent 1 week there during mid-February.We found the staff to be very helpful and quick to tend to our needs. Everything we asked of them was attended to in a very timely manner.The stairs in the hotel were quite steep which might present a problem for some people, it was quite difficult to get our luggage up them.The rooms were comfortable, welcoming and fairly tidy. Granted they weren't the most modern rooms we've ever seen, but we were pleased nevertheless.Along with their fair prices, we see no reason why we wouldn't stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Yuck Please do not be swayed by the way this Hotel is presented on their website. The hotel is seedy, dirty, unkept and has the feel of a rent by the hour motel!!We arrived checked in went to our room and turned right back down to the reception area. The bedroom was damp, the bathroom was filthy and there was no soap. The decor was shabby. When we complained and said we would be checking out... all we got was attitude and told they would be charging us for 2 nights stay!!! We attempted to argue that the room was not what we had been sold on the website but the woman we spoke with would not hear anything we said. She kept saying you knew it was a 2 star hotel... well yes we did and we have stayed at some amazing 2 star hotels in Paris and Barcelenoa ... netheir was dirty and unkept like this place. For gay and lesbian travellers this hotel is not what it says it is. Instead stay somewhere that cares about the quality of the services they provide.

<Author>Mr_Sensitive
<Content>Should be shut down due to Health and Safety of Guests!! When myself and my friend arrived we were greeted by the overwhelming smell of urine in the reception area, despite the heated reception area making it worse as you can imagine - Sickening, so we asked to Staff and she told us the toilet may have not have been cleaned that day!!. I said it was a disgrace. Upon going to our rooms the stairs were a health and safety hazard banisters were coming out of walls (annex building) and ceiling were so low you had to get down on your hands and knees to get to the room on the top floor. The stairs were very narrow and winding for those whom have a fear of dizzy spell very poorly lite. Funny as it sounds it was true and a living nightmare. The room was noting like brochure and damp and unclean bed linen (E95. per night not including breakfast extra E7.). My friends room was on the 1st floor suppose to have a canal view instead looked straight on to a street of run down buildings. You had to leave the annex building and go down the street to see the canal. Straight back to reception and complained and the lady at reception laughed in my face and said that is what you booked and I said the brochure didn't indicate upon arrival to be greeted by the overwhelming smell of urine and other disgusting smells that would turn your stomach. Eventually it was too much and we asked to be switched to a different room having to pay (E100. per night p.p per room. again not include breakfast extra E7.in additional to E20. extra Tax). The new room was not much better insects all over the toilet walls and loo seat chipped and full of germs not even flushed and shower was not much better the door was wooden and rotten. (The toilet and shower  sink were all in separate locations tiny rooms adjoining bedroom and could hardly swing a cat in the loo it was very tight. The rest of room was spacious but there was dirt on the carpet stained floors and decor deplorable. The bed was very uncomfortable and hairs on the bed linen indicating not washed after the last guest and the annoying sound of the shower dripping all night would drive you spare. This room was located 1st floor back room hotel main hotel and front room 1st floor overlooking canal was dreadful noisy the electric front door was constantly opening and banging the whole night when people leaving and going out. The rooms were drab and cold despite there been heaters in the room luke warm 24/7 it was so cold you would have to wear as fleece in bed and scarf. On departure I asked to speak to the Manager there was none surprise surprise!! and I then asked to speak to the owner(s) whom were Mr.John Pats  Ms.Sabine Stetan - ITC Hotel . I was told they call in once a week to collect the takings and they couldn't care less about complaints or their guests welfare. The gent on reception said he was fed up getting the same complaints over and over again. He said the owners were only in the business for the money and that is how it stood. Outside the Hotel is suppose to be quiet and lovely canal etc.. The area at night is very quiet and must go around with caution. There are plenty of homeless people to keep you company!!The taxi from the airport was only meant to coat Euros 35. approx as per brochure information on the ITC Hotel guide. This was not the case it wasn't even peak hour and we were charged E68. euros, when questioned the taxi driver he pretended not to understanding and then he said that 3 years ago prices increased etc. I suggested to reception to update their guest info. on the their web-site but they ignore that too.As with all Hotels cleanliness doesn't cost much as it is a part of house keeping. The whole experience turned myself and my friend off Amsterdam and we will never again visit enduring this ordeal.I have no pictures of the the rooms but if you ask the hotel I'm sure they will send pics from some room that doesn't exist and you too will be a victim if you stay there. This particular Hotel is suppose to be gay and lesbian friendly and I consider the standards would not be found in a third world country they were so bad.

<Content>Would not return The web site for the hotel is very mis-leading.We had asked for a ground floor because of issues with stairs. We were assured there was a ground floor with only two steps. How bad could the be? Bad. There were five very narrow steps down and then three very narrow steps up. Almost impossiable with a handicap, the front steps had a hand rail so we managed that. The staff is kids, they close at 11pm and open after 9am. The room was small, smelled and needed to be cleaned. The bed and pillow were good, the sheets clean and the room warm. The bathroom was not nice, needed to be cleaned. We never saw any breakfest food except cereal and coffee was for a fee.We were so disappointed in yet another 3rd class hotel for Gays. We keep looking for a decent Gay hotel but have not found one yet. This is the last try tfor this senior couple.

<Content>great location ,terrible rooms we stayed in this hotel for three nights. It is in a beautiful location and in a great neighbourhood. The hotel itself leaves a lot to be desired. Though bedding and towels appeared clean the room itself was overdue for a clean and was quite dusty. it was exceptionally drab and had not been decorated for sometime. The shower worked but the cubicle was mouldy and the door frame rotten. The toilet smelled far from fresh and it was a real squeeze to get in there. There were no drink making facilities in the roomThe lobby and bar were similarly run down and looked quite different from the hotels website photographs. If you do decide to stay here, and have an early flight back home, pay the night before, we had to wake the night porter to check out at 9.30 am!

<Content>Don't go to this hotel I wish I had visited this site before booking three nights in November 2006 at this truly appalling hotel.I too was fooled by the hotel's website and the lovely photographs. To say that it doesn't live up to expectations is an understatement.How such a pretty house in such a good location can have been ruined like this is a mystery - it too reminded me of bad student hostels in the 1960's.We stayed in Room 8 - a small double with canal view at 90 euros per night (cash). The window didn't shut properly, thus the draught was so bad we had to move the bed and one of the bed's legs fell off.You couldn't shut the loo door when sitting on the loo (and the loo seat was broken).The room wasn't cleaned during our stay.This was my first visit to Amsterdam and I have to say that everything about the city was wonderful - except for this hotel

<Content>unbelieveable! Oh how i wish I'd just taken the time to read the reviews by the rest of you!This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.The room we were in was not cleaned in 4 days!The toilet had not been cleaned in a lot longer than that [ i.e. months!!]The curtain was half off the curtain rail.The picture of the bedroom on this hotel's website could not be further from the reality of the room we stayed in.Our window would not stay open and was therefore propped open with a Bible.I will never stay at this hotel again and I will certainly not be recommending it anyone I know.

<Content>Typical Gay hotel, but good location What is it with gay hotels?, creaky floorboards, slightly dubious decor, monosyllabic check-in staff? At least you definitely know what you're getting. The good thing about the ITC is that they can't mess up the location. On the Prinsengracht and charming with it.Rooms are basic, think plastic shelf about the sink and drawers that just, don't quite open. However, bed was big and comfortable and the tv worked.Would I stay here again, probably not, but I wouldn't completely warn everyone off

<Content>iTC - CHEAP but not CHEERFUL we last stayed at itc in 2000 and as we remember it was basic though clean and good value for money as it included breakfast. How things have changed!! unfortunately the decor hasn't changed - everything is exactly the same but 6 years older. This hotel is in need of a complete redecoration. Others have commented about the bathrooms; I can only agree the facilities were BASIC and UNCLEAN - the toilet was so small that you had to be seated before closing the door!... the toilet brush was ... well id better not go into too much detail... let's just say it had been well used and little cleaned. The room itself didn't look as though it has seen polish and duster in quite some time.The shower had damp patches on the walls and the effect of the shower on the wooden frames was such that they were in need of repair..NOISE!!! This has to be the noisiest hotel i have ever stayed in - the walls are so thin that you can hear toilets flushing, doors opening and closing, other guests conversations etc....Carpets throughout have seen better days.Breakfast (once included in the room charge) is 7,50 euros. This was okay but we had to ask for everything - it was not the extensive buffet as they advertise -rather disappointing.Hotel staff were friendly and polite - I must say that they were helpful when approached. Bedding always clean as were the towels that were refreshed every day.Also remember that the price quoted does not include breakfast, city tax or credit card charge all of which can add up considerably over the length of stay.All things considered there are much better deals around in amsterdam's other hotels. ITC offers nothing more for the gay traveller other than the cheap gay porn channels that repeat over and over again.Overall.... would we stay here again? A definate NO!

<Content>What a dump! When I saw the charming building featured in their advert I was looking forward with my friend to staying at this hotel. It is a typical old Dutch town house. But it has been ruined by the owners. It has been cheaply converted with worn blue carpet on the stairs and lots of plyboard. My room although of a decent size had a particularly bad damp smell and the tiny bathroom was too basic to bear. My friend's room was poky in the extreme. The beds were like cheap camp beds. I have stayed in basic hotels before and found them ok; this was VERY depressing. We parked our bags and went out the evening we arrived but every time we thought about going back to the hotel we felt depressed. So we booked into another hotel. I definitely would not recommend this hotel unless you are a student and used to youth hostel-style accommodation.

<Content>Don't write it off Less than 24 hours before my girlfriend and I were due to arrive at the ITC Hotel, I decided to check out the reviews. I then spent the time when I should have been packing hastily trying to find another hotel to stay at because what I read panicked me so much. But, as I struggled to find anywhere in our budget (bearing in mind we would have been forced to pay a cancellation fee to the ITC), we went ahead. All the excitement I had been feeling about a week in Amsterdam had vanished as I dreaded what was waiting for us. I am 44, I am past the point of hostels and roughing it, I like my little luxuries - like a comfortable bathroom, clean sheets and towels - and the reviews here did not fill me with a great deal of hope.Well, I am home again and the first thing I would say is, I'd go back to the ITC tomorrow. OK, perhaps the website is a little misleading... but, remember how much you are paying. Could you get a room in a boutique hotel for around 85 euros a night? I don't think so.The staff were friendly, our rooms was made up every day and we were always given clean towels. Yes, the room needed a lick of paint; yes, the bathroom was very small; yes, it is very basic.But, it is a cheap and cheerful base to explore a great city. If you are looking for something special, then look elsewhere... but if all you need is a bed for the night, go ahead and book.

<Content>Its still a dive with no service We have just returned home from staying at ITC Hotel Amsterdam from Thursday 20th to Monday 24th July. I have to say we are generally appalled and disgusted by the hotel standards. We were warned by friends not to use your hotel when they stayed in a basement room in February and they said it was cold, damp, smelly and shabby. Unfortunately we did not take their advice. The room we stayed in room 4 was advertised on their website as a luxury room and we paid 125 euros a night (cash as there was a 5% supplement if we did not). The following are the complaints: 1. The room was badly furnished and in need of refurbishment. 2. The shower was broken. 3. The sink was not en-suite but in the bedroom and did not have a plug 4. The room was NOT cleaned during our stay and one day the maid did not come in at all (Sunday) 5. The carpet and bedding smelled musty and the sheets were old and ill fitting. In all this has to be the worst accommodation I have stayed in since I was a student. The only ever time a hotel was as bad was a gay run hotel in Dublin. It strikes me that as a gay run and advertised establishment that tey are simply ripping off the gay market. Payment is made in cash up front before you get a chance to see the room...no wonder! We were unable to make our complaint at the time as the only person we saw at any time in reception was the maid, who could hardly speak English. We did finally manage to get some clean towels on the Sunday but the room was not touched.

<Content>had a wonderful stay at ITC-Hotel This was my first stay in Amsterdam at the ITC.Our room was relatively large and clean.The room was quiet and equipped with a television and telephone.The sheets were heavy and smelled fresh.There was good security. (A card had to be used for the outside door, and the room's door.) The breakfast room was very attractive. (Especially the tables at the windowfront)The breakfast was typically Dutch -- nothing special (cereals, breads, cheese, and meats), but the coffee was good .The staff was very helpful and friendlyFor anyone looking for something basic, clean, convenient, safe, and inexpensive, in the center of the city, I would recommend this hotelWe would return in a heartbeat. Ask for a lower floor room if you have trouble with stairs.

<Content>Don't Do It! We stayed at the ITC from April 30th until May 6th, as I had stayed there a couple of times in years past and it was okay. The only thing this place has going for it is the location. On this trip, we were put in the annex across the street. Even on the top floor, it was very noisy and difficult to sleep after 6 a.m. The carpets were stained and filthy and weren't vacuumed once during our entire stay. The sheets were never changed and we began itching within a day of being in the room - the day before we left we found body lice on us and eggs! Probably from the nasty douvet on the beds that the hotel evidently doesn't wash after guests leave. Not fun to fly back home with parasitic bugs on you. I will never stay there again.

<Content>Don't be fooled by the website Really disappointed with this hotel. Its website gives the impression of a semi-boutique hotel, but the reality is a Skegness guesthouse. Rooms were dirty, small and dark, and the staff were not at all friendly. The upside is that the location is very good, and the hotel is (slowly) refurbishing its rooms.

<Content>dont believe there web site booked this hotel after looking on there web site and i've gotta say they must have taken the photos years back, it was well tatty and the relaxing lounge bar does not exist, and breakfast looked well dodgy, so we passed on that, but on the plus side the girl on the reception was friendly and its near the gay scene, so all in all very basic bb and over priced.

<Content>disgusting I took my girlfriend to Amsterdam recently, her first trip to continental europe. i decided to look for a gay and lesbian friendly hotel for our stay and was impressed by the itc web site. I really thought the place looked nice. So wrong!!! I have never stayed in such a dive in all my life! The place was filthy. The carpets looked like they had not been hoovered in months. The walls were covered in stains. The corners were thick with cobwebs. The ensuite bathroom in the room was litte more than a toilet and a shower ( that did the hot,cold,hot,cold,hot,cold thing) stuck into a cupboard in the room. Thankfully the bedding and towels seemed to be clean, which is more than can be said for the toilet. The smell of stale urine was most unpleasant. I was amazed to see shoe shiners in the hall outside the bedrooms. To cleans your feet after walking on the carpets perhaps?? We had booked a small double room for 90 euros per night, but were informed on our arrival that we had been given a free upgrade to a large room which should have cost 125 euros per night. I have visited Amsterdam several times before and for the same room rate have had much better accomodation with breakfast included. Not that i would have eaten anything that had been prepared or even stored in this place! I can only imagine what my girlfriend ( an American ) made of the state of the place. Only fatigue made us stay there for the night. My advice to any gay travellers thinking about staying here would be to take your money else where. There is no problem with getting accomodation for same sex couples in Amsterdam and for the money that you would spend to stay in this hovel, you would be much better off in any other hotel. The only reason i have given the itc a rating of 1 is that there is no option available to award it less. I only hope that people do not fall in to tha same trap as i did and believe the very obviously outdated or fabricated photos and descriptions on the itc web site.

<Content>Best breakfast I've ever had I had stayed at the ITC Hotel back in 1990 when I got out of college. It was my first time to Europe, and the guys were very kind and considerate, even let us leave our bikes in the hallway.I was very excited to return in 2003. We did not this time have a canal view (thought the tram would be too loud). They were very helpful about letting us store our bags, with finding us a natural food store and storing my partner's special bread - she doesn't eat wheat. I was delighted to see that they had remodeled the common area into a lovely breakfast area, and that you can have breakfast overlooking the canal. Our room was good sized by European standards, and was very comfortable. Breakfast was wonderful (I'll always remember the ham and the great cappuccino machine), and was served later than any other hotel I have stayed at - until noon on weekdays and 1 on weekends. It has a great location, walking distance to anywhere in the centrum. I had always remembered Prinsengracht. I love Amsterdam and the Netherlands, and I hope to stay at the ITC again in the future.

<Content>Coming Back to Amsterdam After 3 years, I'm returning to Amsterdam, and looking for a nice BB to stay in. After my miserable experience at the ITC in 2002, I checked to see if things had improved. ( in the 80's and 90's I stayed here several times, and loved the ITC, it's wonderful atmosphere, and location).I see that two years later, according to reviews, they are still renovating the public rooms.I see that people are still as unhappy with the unfriendly new management, as we were surprised and disappointed by them in 2002.The last time we stayed, the breakfast room was torn up; everything about the hotel was worn and threadbare. Breakfast was no longer included, and wasn't served at the times posted. It was dirty, and noisy. When we decided to look elsewhere for the rest of our stay ( we'd booked 5 nights) the manageress threatened us, attempted not to give me back my credit card, then immediately charged for the full 5 nights stay (mastercard eventually denied their claim)Amsterdam is a wonderful place... the ITC, sadly, isn't any longer. Don't stay here.

<Content>Dismal and Depressing First, the pluses: a big room with plenty of space, a canal view, free internet access in the lobby, and a good location. Everything else about this hotel, however, was just dismal and depressing. The whole place needs a paint job and the carpet had reached the stage of worn out years ago. Likewise with the towels which made Motel6 quality towels look good! The hallways and stairwells have an institutional feeling to them, like a group home for recovering addicts. Our room was only marginally clean and the housekeeping staff seemed to get around to their duties when the mood struck them (on one day, it was 5 p.m. and the room still had not been cleaned). The design of the bathroom was terrible -- a room with a toilet jammed into it (which had to be ridden side saddle) and another with a shower; the sink was in the bedroom itself. It is clear that the owners just stopped caring about this place a long time ago as evidenced by the cheap Van Gogh print that was mounted crooked in its cheap frame. As other reviewers have noted, the photos on the website must be years old as they do not remotely indicate the true deterioration of the property. And that canal view -- you get too look at a houseboat that looks as though it could sink at any moment (similar houseboats are all too prevalent in Amsterdam). While some of the cheaper rooms in the hotel might prove to be a reasonable tradeoff for those who are on a very strict budget, we feel pretty sure that it is possible to do a lot better for the 125 Euros/night that we paid even in an expensive city like Amsterdam. What a dissapointment!

<Content>No sleep or fresh air at the ITC Was left without a place to stay at the last minute and found the ITC at the airport on the Hotel Reservation Kiosk. Bad sign. I called, they were friendly enough and had a room available. When I got there they were also nice enough, although when I caught sight of the inside of the hotel my heart dropped. A dive was all I could think of to describe this place. Although with no other place to stay I took it. I stayed at the annex across the street. The room was tiny. Although the toilet and shower were clean, as was the bed as far as I could tell. There was something that was used as an excuse for a pillow, the carpet was filthy and the walls were dirty and stained. DEPRESSING. Also too noisy from other guests. I got up after a sleepless night and immediately went to pay phone to get another room. FOR 10 more euros I got a gorgeous, quiet room at The Seven Bridges! Unbelievable! The difference was amaing. Don't waste your time at the ITC unless you are desperate! The location is great, but Seven Bridges is in the very same neighborhood.

<Content>Do not stay here!!!! This place is a pit! The pictures on the website are way outdated and you'd be better off sleeping next to a dumpster. The TINY rooms are the saddest excuse of a room, the bathrooms are appalling, and staff was super rude. Wasn't expecting a klassy Ramada, but c'mon, any one star hotel would be better by far.

<Content>The ITC experience My partner and I stayed at the ITC in August of 2003. The room was not very clean, and the bathroom was very inconvient to say the least. The breakfast at 7.50 euros per person was expensive considering what we got for it, and the staff not very friendly or knowledgeable. Also, we found the pictures of the hotel on the internet to be misleading. The place was just not that nice. The place needs a major renovation. The best thing I can say about the ITC is the location. It is excellent but that is not reason enough to stay there again. Needless to say, we will not be returning to the ITC. The reason for the late review is that we are planning another trip to Amsterdam and I just came across this site.

<Content>Good location, very basic rooms, better elsewhere Stayed here for 3 nights, friendly small hotel. The breakfast was basic, nothing special, as were the rooms, this cannot be classed as anything other than a bb really!Staff seemed fine, but I think this place needs a drastic modernisation program to bring it up to the standard of other hotels of very similar prices.I think the phrase you pay to be gay is operative here despite the fact much better straight hotels don't care that the guests staying are gay and provide much much nicer rooms/breakfast and much better facilities, even working tv's!!
