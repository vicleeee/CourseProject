<Content>good location me and my family really enjoyed the location, close to las ramblas and the city center.. the only problem was that our room was facing walls and at the first floor, so there wasn't much of air circulating in there. the breakfest is really simple but itéº“s okay.I would recommend it, just make sure you get at a room facing sant agusti square.

<Content>A Welcome Break We enjoyed our short winter break in this hotel. The ambience was pleasant, the rooms clean and the staff helpful and friendly.There were some problems with the air-conditioning but this was rectified swiftly when reported.We ate in the restaurant every night and though the menu was limited, it was inexpensive and appetising.During some evenings, a large party of French school students shared the dining room but they were well-behaved and we felt quite lonely when they left.Comments about the square outside the hotel being unsavoury at night may have been true but we saw nothing of which to be overly fearful and the square is well lit and quiet. Perhaps it may be different during the summer months.The hotel is well-placed midway on the Ramblas and well connected to tour buses and the Metro.

<Content>Good without being spectatcular We have just returned after a four day break. The hotel is on a small square two minutes walk from Las Ramblas so is very central. There are some vagrants hanging about but the police move them on very quickly.The rooms are small but very clean and the hotel staff are very helpful. The price paid reflects the standard but is more than matched by the hotel's location to Catalunya Square, Las Ramblas and the Port Area.Check our the bar next door - Rita Blue- for food and drinks, very reasonalble.

<Content>Reasonable hotel, fantastic location! Just returned from an amazing long weekend with my partner in Barcelona staying at the Hotel Sant Agusti. We decided to upgrade to one of the attic rooms for 20 euros each. The room was a good size with authentic beams, very clean and had excellent views over the Barcelona rooftops.Breakfast was rather basic, but there was plenty of it, buffet style.The location is simply excellent, very quiet and right next to La Ramblas and the Liceu metro station. We could walk from the hotel to many of the Barcelona attractions or take the metro if feeling lazy. I would recommend you do not go to the bars on La Ramblas as they are very expensive. There are plenty of side streets with much cheaper bars and restaurants around Plaza Catalunya or further afield.I would recommend this hotel, particularly because of the fantastic location and reasonable price.

<Content>Unfriendly staff I have just arrived back from the san agustin hotel. Myself and 7 girlfriends went for a girly trip for my Hen Do. The hotel was very central which was great and the rooms were clean and had everything we required. The man who greeted us on our arrival was very helpful and pleasant, all in all a great start! The first evening after our night out we were greeted with a very unfriendly, rude nightshift worker calledjohn, he screemed at us to keep the noise down (we are from glasgow and have loud voices but were in no way being noisy) told us we had no respect, which really offended us as we had done nothing wrong, we shrugged this off and thought be bigger than him and dont complain, so the 2 nd evening we came in the same nightshift worker was working he didnt look in our direction when we were waiting on the lift, a client of the hotel came in with a prostitute (we had passed them at the corner of the hotel and seen them agree a deal) it disgusted me so i went to the nightshift worker and told him i didn't feel comfortable with a hotel that allows solicitation, he told be in a rude manner that there was nothing he could do, he couldn't beat the client up and we had to put up with this!I began to feel unsafe in the hotel knowing that this was going on, outside the hotel there was lots of down and outs and about 6 prostitute's that stood 100meters away, openly making deals with punters, they were very intimating and a few of them stood in our way pushing against us, which terrified our group.On the last evening one of our group got her purse stole outside the hotel.Overall the hotel was very central to las ramblas, reasonable priced and clean but the cons out do the pros which was bad attitude from unfriendly staff and an unsafe feeling outside the hotel, we all felt pretty vulnerable.

<Content>Better than expected we travelled to this hotel on nov 13th for 3 nights. Wasn't easy to find, about halfway down La Rambla on right hand side near La Bouqueria Market . Look for a street sign on your right saying L'Hospital continue down this narrow street until you come to a square called PLaca San Augustin, the hotel will be facing you, typical 3* tourist hotel but very clean, cloose to La Rambla, Metro,bus stops ,Gothic quarter, Cathedral etc--- Good choice at breakfast, enough to keep you going till lunch, Pleasant elderly Gent at reception. The only negative thing I would have to say would be that we could hear everything in the room next to ours.

<Content>not as good as it could be !!! we arrived late at night, 1 lift being replaced, the other out of order, had to carry all luggage up 3 flights of stairs, no offer of assistance. we stayed 5 days, lift still not working when we checked out.We expected an old hotel with lots of feature's, everything has be modernised very dissapointing.there was dirty marks on the bathroom floor, thick dust on top of toilet cistern, towel holders, and shower curtain rail, the shower head also needed de scaling. the tiles  mirror above the sink was splattered with toothpaste. and a very strong smell of drain's. the toiletries provided were totally inadiquate for two people.One of the bedside light bulbs was not working, it still had not been replaced by check out day. the room did not have any tea/coffee making facility, nor did it have any bottle water  glass's, we had a late check in and the bar was already closed, two tired and thirsty guest's had to wait until breakfast for refreshments although breakfast is served until 11am, and was very simple, there was plenty to eat, the oj tasted as if it had been watered down, the staff 'hover' around which made us feel uncomfortable if we lingered longer to finnish the meal.However we were very close to the Rumbles and the metro

<Content>Completely lacking in character - very poor value for money Hotel Sant Agusti 18 and 19 September 2008: The Hotel Sant Agusti is very poor value for money. It is allegedly the oldest hotel in Barcelona and is situated just off Las Ramblas yet has absolutely no character whatsoever. It has been modernised into a featureless, anodyne block of bedrooms - you could be anywhere in the world. The rooms are modern but ours had very noisy air conditioning. The bathroom facilities are poor. The shower was only a dribble, the towels were less than white and thin. The breakfast was very poor quality - no fresh fruit and very limited choice of bread, cheese, meat and cooked items.  We stayed earlier in the year at the Hotel Principal in the next street to the Sant Agusti. That is a far superior hotel in every way. I would not stay at Hotel Sant Agusti again and would not recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Brilliant Hotel Close To The Ramblas We stayed at this hotel during August 2008. As recommended on another website we arranged to upgrade the room to an attic room. This room was very clean, spacious and had good views across the roof tops of Barcelona. The square outside did have some vagrants hanging around but the police presence kept them in check. A very clean, friendly hotel that is less than 2 minutes walk from Las Ramblas.

<Content>Great location This comfortable 3 star hotel is situated just off Las Ramblas in the heart of Barcelona. It is off the main street up a quiet avenue so is not noisy at night. The hotel is perfectly located near to the metro station and tourist bus attractions, as well as it being within walkig distance of many places of interest. It is only a short walk to the harbour of Port Vell which is perfect if you want to sit at a cafe/restaurant and enjoy the bustle of this city. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are perfectly air conditioned - much needed in the summer months! The staff are friendly and helpful and the food at breakfast is simple yet nice. Had a really enjoyable stay at this hotel and on my return to Barcelona I would stay here again.

<Content>Nice Hotel ideally situated- shame about down and outs in square Stayed here for 3 nights- Excellent situation just off Las Ramblas, not noisey- Very clean and tidy. Lovely feel to breakfast room which although quite modern has some nice old features felt very bright and airy.Very basic breakfast though- no good if you enjoy a full fry up !!Only shame was the square outside which had alot of 'down and outs' hanging around from early morning until late at night. Went as a couple and we were not too late home can imagine if part of a girlie group might be a bit intimidating going back to hotel on your own as apparently quite well known for mugging and pick pocketing. We had no problems but felt you did need to keep your wits about you, shame really as otherwise fab place to stay (better policing of the square might overcome the problem.)

<Content>Please get some soundproofing! Location of the hotel is great - extremely easy to find after taking the bus from the airport to Placa de Catalunia. Good location to see the sites from. No hassle from the homeless people outside the hotel whatsoever. Staff pleasant and helpful. Room clean. Breakfast good.The only downside we found was the complete lack of soundproofing in the room. It's a shame but we wouldn't stay here again because of that.

<Content>A great experience! 20th wedding anniversary, 5 nights, perfect! Clean room, quiet at night, good sleep, brilliantly adjustable air con. Free safe in room. Good range of help yourself breakfast. Friendly, helpful reception staff. Room to leave kit on last day. Aero-bus straight outside terminal to Placa de Catalunia, five minute walk to hotel down Las Ramlas taking in all the atmosphere! Plenty of people are towing a case at any given time, you don't stand out! Taking the bus means you see everything and overall the journey time is short (35-45 minutes) and cheap, 3 euro something each, each way. All but door to door!Rita Blue, the bar / restaurant next door vibrant, energetic yet welcoming with friendly staff.The square is used by less fortunate people to hang around in but we never felt unsafe or hassled whatsoever. A peaceful place with a church forming one side of the square. Seconds to Las Ramblas, minutes to the waterfront, 20 minutes to the beaches (on foot of course!). Would we go back again? A big YES!

<Content>Great and Cheap When i checked into this hotel the old man behind the counter was averagely approachable. Just asked for my passport and gave me a key. Had no idea where to go from ther so went up the stairs untill i could find signs for the room. Had room 122 which is on the first floor. Room was pleasant, kind of wished they put the bed in the bathroom becasue it seemed bigger than the bedroom. Very clean and tidy. Stayed around a cold tim so the bed sheet and ultra thin blanket did not go so well. Bed made me feel like i had been put up in someones lounge but there was a flat screen tv. Walls are thin and could hear someone in the toliet. If you get a balcony dont open up the door because the noise is very loud and goes on till late hours. Outside there were a lot of homeless people which most of the reviews mention. Dont be afraid of them walk around them. All the time I was there there was always a police car in sight. The Hotel is on a square but also on a road with lots of people walking around. I would imagine late night would not be a wise time to take in the sights. This Hotel is in the middle of the Ramblas and perfect for people who dont spend the day in hotels.

<Content>Take our advice and go somewhere else! We have just returned from 5 nights staying at Sant Augusti Hotel, Barcelona. The hotel is in a square, just off La Rambla, so good for accessing the sights. A dismal area which managed to escape the sun all day. The square was full of old vagrants from about 7am, swigging alcohol and at night the queue for the hostel opposite seemed to consist of male immigrants look for somewhere to sleep, quite intimidating. There is a heavy police presence day and night - I don't know if that is reassuring or not.Reported to be one of the oldest hotels in the city you would be hard pressed to find any old world charm left in this place. Whereas the facade gives a hint of what it was like, once inside it is a bland modern space with no atmosphere. The first room we were given was so dirty and cramped. The air conditioning switch and other electrical fittings were hanging off the wall, the bathroom walls and tiles were mouldy. We asked to be moved and we were put in a room which was kitted out for disabled travellers. A larger room, still shabby but at least it was clean. The walls are paper thin, we were treated to loud music all evening on our first night then shouting at around 4am as the boys in the next room to us returned from their night out. They disconnected our key at one point so we couldn't get into our room! The lift is scary, shakey and the doors take an age to open and is best avoided, particularly if you are not really fond of lifts.The staff were decidedly unfriendly. They never looked up from the reception desk when you came through the front doors - a little worrying at night as you could be anyone entering the building. Handing in our key on departure was met with a grunt!The breakfast - same every day. Stale croissants, bread, more bread pretending to be brioche, cake, 2 large lumps of scrambled egg in a metal container and hot dog sausages cut up into small pieces - did you see the programme Jamie Oliver did about mechanically recovered meat?! The coffee was absolutely disgusting and we tried every combination out of the machine to see if we could get a decent cup. The dining room was lit by what can only be described as industrial lighting - how many halogen spot lights do you need in a room? They must have got a job lot!Our advice would be not to stay here but choose another hotel in a central location, even if it costs you a little more. Barcelona itself is well worth a visit.

<Content>Good hotel, great location, vibrant city. The Sant Agusti is purported to be the oldest hotel in Barcelona. For all that it is of a good standard with the facilities of a hotel in the 21st century. The staff were friendly from the receptionist through to the breakfast attendees. Rooms - basic but clean and comfortable. Yes there is a little noise - mostly from cleaning staff on a morning but nothing to cause major irritation. Our room had a small balcony overlooking the street. This was great for watching the comings and goings of this lively, vibrant city. Because the room was double glazed and with shutters none of the street noise affected sleep during the night.The square in which the hotel is located does have its fair share of down at heels so those of a sensitive need to be aware. However we never experienced any problems or none that one would not come across in any large city.Location, close to La Ramblas and the underground is excellent for exploring. Close by and within a short walk are plentiful shops, restuarants and bars.This was my first time in Barcelona. A fantastic city. Be warned - you will hardly scratch the surface in a 2-3 day visit. I would recommend a week minimum and would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again.

<Content>Noisy and smelly We stayed in Hotel Sant Agusti for four long nights. As per other reviews, internal walls are paper thin (although soundproofing to outside was excellent). Our room on the 1st floor was small but clean. However there was regular whiffs of a nasty sewer smell which made the room uncomfortable to spend much time in. Bed and pillows were uncomfortable. The breakfast was very ordinary with sugar added to just about everything - bread, cornflakes, even the croissants. Eggs were made of powder and the sausages of sawdust. I wouldn't stay here again - there are lots of other hotels equally well placed.

<Author>Barcelonaexperience
<Content>got robbed in front of the hotel. Hotel locked their doors on us. It's a lovely hotel inside. However, they should use some of their profits and invest in a bellman or better yet a security guard. The hotel is indeed 50 meters off Las Ramblas but the passage to the hotel is a bit sketchy. Myself and 5 girlfriends (all staying at the hotel) were attacked and one was successfully robbed in the alleyway to the hotel and one was actually attacked again as she tried to get to the hotel for safety. The hotel locked its sliding glass doors on us as they saw the commotion and as my friend was struggling with 2 robbers on the ground over her purse. After beating on the doors and the robbers ran off, the reception opened the doors and afterwards provided very little help. It seems to me the hotel has seen this kind of thing rather often and may even have a policy of locking its doors. If I could give the hotel a negative rating, I would.

<Content>Horrible Seedy Square Don't stay here! The square in front of the hotel is extremely seedy and scarey. Criminals and homeless hang out in the square in front of the hotel. I witnessed the women getting attacked on New Years Eve and saw the hotel do nothing!! 6 American women were attacked within 10 feet of this hotel by 30 men who stood around in a circle. I have never witnessed anything like this in my life. Horrible experience!

<Content>Area surrounding hotel is unsavory - please read my review Myself and five female friends stayed at this hotel to celebrate New Years. In the square in front of the hotel we were attacked and the men hanging around the square made many violent attempts to steal our handbags. The night manager of the desk witnessed this happening, did nothing and kept the front glass doors locked until we banged on them, begging to be let in. The night manager would do nothing to ensure our safety and we got a typical mediterean shrug when we asked him to notify authorities, as two other women were attacked in the square while we were at the desk. Barcelona is a big city with big city problems but the treatment of the staff and proximity of the hotel to unsavory areas of Barcelona mean that this hotel should be avoided.

<Content>BRILLIANT LOCATION This hotel is located just off La Ramblas in a fabulous location; close to the fantastic food market, loads of bars and restaurants, and shops. The lobby and rooms and fully refurbished and in excellent condition being clean with modern decor. But, and there is a but [!!!], they refurb is cheap and they have used laminate floors and I would assume absolutely no sound proofing so THE NOISE LEVEL IS LOUD!!! Fine if you are not coming in until the early hours, but if you want an early night [which we did not] forget it! The other problem is in the morning, you can hear the plumbing, every flush, shower and bath emptying, and lots of other activities etc of all those in rooms around you. However, the staff are lovely and breakfast room large, spacious and sunny.

<Content>Excellent location We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights, it was very clean the staff were friendly. There are homeless people who vacate the square outside the hotel all the time but do not bother the hotel guests at all. I would have no hesitation in staying there again.

<Content>Not A Good Experience This hotel used to be a monastery. The lighting is activated by your body heat and lasts for approximately 30 seconds. This leaves you walking along a narrow dark corridor, dark beams in the ceiling. Many dark doors on either side of you reminiscent of the monastery cells. The room was quite clean and had french windows. Bathroom was nearly clean but not quite.Cold breakfast was ok - tea ok for one cup, coffee disgusting. Hot breakfast - scrambled egg that had seen better days. The hotel is approx 50 metres from the middle of the Ramblas - be careful when returning to it at night. There are homless and vagrants in the square outside the hotel from early morning. These guys keep themselves to themselves and don't bother you- I think the church in the square provides food for them. Hotel staff are very nice. We were overcharged for our stay - May bank holiday. Only reason I would go back to this hotel is if it was extremely cheap.

<Content>Great Location Just got back from a short stay at the Sant Agusti hotel, the taxi from the airport was 45 euros for five of us and only took about 20 mins. The hotel itself was plesant, clean and the staff were o.k...the breakfast was also good.The hotel was in a square were the down and outs seem to congregate but they don't bother you.It was literally a minute walk to Las Ramblas so an ideal central location.The Magic Fountains are a must they were amazing and getting the underground to get there was an experience!All in all we had a really good time.........

<Content>great location i had read some of the previous reviews which mentioned the vagrants hanging around the hotel and imagined the worst but there were literally about a handful and they caused you no trouble whatsoever - at night the square had a bar/restaurant open up next door to the hotel so it was just filled with people having a good time (you won't notice it though - the double glazing in the hotel rooms must be made out of something very thick!) - and very handy if you fancy a night cap on the way in! the location was perfect - minutes from the main strip if you wanted it and not far from the cathedral area which had loads of lovely tapas bars. the rooms are clean and the front ones have a nice little balcony overlooking the square - the staff were pleasant and the breakfast pretty good - although i wouldnt recommend the croissants! all in all good value in a great spot

<Content>City Break Husband and I stayed 3 nights end of November . Taxi to the door from airport a reasonable price. Thereafter, everything in walking distance but also close to good rail/bus links. Room and bathroom more than adequate and very clean. Excellent and plentiful breakfast. Hotel is in great location and the police do keep an eye on the needy who congregate at the church in the square. However, they keep themselves to themselves and didn't appear to bother tourists. No kettle in room but little cafe/bakers next door happily made great coffees for you to take away . Staff were friendly and helpful and it was good value for money.

<Content>Great Location and Lovely Hotel We stayed at the Sant Agusti Hotel for a 3 day trip to celebrate a 30th birthday with a great group of friends. The hotel was in an ideal location about half way down La Ramblas, very near the market too. The reception staff and cleaners were extremely friendly and very helpful and welcoming (breakfast staff not quite so). The rooms were small but really clean and done so every day. The breakfast was more than adequate with a good selection. I would recommend this hotel and would visit again. If you are looking for a fantastic meal out I would recommend Pla - beautiful food but worth booking ahead.

<Content>Basic but ok My friend and I booked two rooms for two nights in June. We had never visited Barcelona before and I found this hotel through a review in a travel guide which described the location as 'a quiet street off the Rambla'. In the day it did seem relatively quiet, but in the evening a bar next to the hotel put tables and chairs out on the pavement and this was fairly busy all evening till gone 1am. I had a room overlooking the square and although closing the balcony doors shut out a lot of general daytime noise, I still found the first night (a Saturday) very noisy. We retired early as we had had a very early start and were tired, but the hubbub from next door kept me awake - relief came about 1.30am but the respite was only momentary because some hidden nightclub across the road started playing *really* loud music then until gone 4am! Even with earplugs I could not sleep and complained at the desk that I had requested a quiet room, but was told that the hotel was full and person on duty had no knowledge of reservations. My friend was at the back of the hotel but she had trouble with noise from the drains and the kitchen. We were only there for two nights and presumed (rightly) that Sunday night would be quieter, so we put up with it. On the second day the bathroom door in my room locked itself so I couldn't get in (it was one of those locks in the handle) and upon reporting the fact to reception was given a straightened paper clip by the clerk, who then mimed unpicking the lock! We couldn't do it so the cleaner was sent up and she unpicked it expertly. My friend and I found breakast 'ok' - but we didn't want much after two restless nights - and we found the rooms clean and not uncomfortable, though small. I was on the 1st floor and my friend on the 2nd. We did not expect tea or coffee facilities but I took a travel kettle and adaptor which I managed to use by plugging into the solitary plug socket in the bathroom (although I was panicking at first because there didn't appear to be anywhere to plug anything in) - and my friend had to unplug her TV to use her hairdryer. They do provide a built-in one but it's rubbish. We were aware of a few drop-outs outside but they mostly congregated on the steps of the big church next door and did not cause a problem, although on night two I was aware of them talking in the middle of the night. Upon opening the balcony doors to see what the noise was, I realised they were actually talkikng quite quietly but the acoustics of the square amplified the sound in the quiet of the night.On the whole, if I had to, I would stay there again, but I think for the money I would try and find somewhere quieter. We were quiet unsure about where to stay before going, but after spending a couple of days there we realised that actually everywhere is pretty accessible from everywhere else with the Metro (which was great, once we had figured out that a T-Dia 1 Zona ticket was the all-day rider we needed - about 6 euros) and you don't actually *need* to be right on the Rambla.

<Content>Good location for sightseeing We stayed here in early June. The room was clean, breakfast was excellent and there was no need to get up early as it was available till 11am. Our only disappointment, there was no kettle in the room. There is a locked storage room for storing luggage at end of stay so we could spend time shopping/ having a final meal before being picked up by taxi in afternoon.It was an easy walk to Las Ramblas /Old Town/ sea front and the nearest metro for travelling further afield.The down and outs were no problem at all and kept to themselves, the square itself was hosed down every morning and was very clean.

<Content>Heavenly We stayed in the Sant Agusti over a few days in March 2007. I had read a few scare stories on Tripadvisor about hobos hanging around in the square at this hotel. Message to these folk. Have some charity ! The poor folk are hanging around waiting for handouts from the church. Never once did we get any hassle. Location of the hotel is ideal, just off the Ramblas and has a great bar / Restaurant next door called Rita Blue. Fabulous Food ! The hotel was very welcoming, clean and super quiet. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.

<Content>Good location A nice hotel in a good location, just 50 metres from La Ramblas. Staff were courteous, breakfast filling (choice of hot and cold food) and rooms clean. Bedroom and bathroom overlooked the square and although the bedroom was on the small side, it was fine for the amount of time spent in it. Nice sized bathroom with good shower. Safe available to rent in room, if needed.

<Content>Horrific Awful. Appeared to be building site upon first arrival General vagrants and homeless people with dogs on strings seemed to be living in the square near Hotel, and having a party. Wifi éˆ¥?what Wifi? Didnéˆ¥æª› work anywhere in the hotel, signal very low, and asked about it at reception éˆ¥?the person pressing buttons there didnéˆ¥æª› seem to know. Walls appallingly thin. Slightly worrying to hear someone talking in German whilst youéˆ¥æª™e having a shower Breakfast rubbish. Coffee was hot water with bean waved over the top. General std of room not terribly good, fairly basic

<Content>Great Hotel The location of this hotel is ideal - just off La Rambla. Easy walking from Pl. Catalunya. The hotel is extremely clean and very quiet. My room was only small, but as a single travellers it was more than adequate. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was ample with a good choice. Would definatley consider staying here again.

<Content>great central location Super location just of the Ramblas, so easy to get to everywhere.The square outside is usually full of street people, but we were never bothered by then. The one big problem we had was the laminate flooring in the rooms. The people in the room above constantly walked around with heeled shoes and the noise in our room and others adjacent was terrible. The breakfast was OK but very basic. I would stay again but would look at others.

<Content>Christmas Break Went to the hotel for 3 day break 27th - 29th Dec, thoroughly enjoyed it, brilliant location. Stayed on the 3rd floor, room was clean  quiet. You can use safety deposit box for 1.20euro, it's in your bedroom wardrobe - gives you piece of mind for your passport, money etc. Found the Ramblas very interesting  would recommend it. Breakfast was fine, found a deal that included it in the hotel price. Tourist bus at 22 euro's for 2 days takes you to all the hotspots that you want to see. Excellent value. No problem with the homeless, they were on the other side of the square that the hotel is in, and didn't bother us at all. We would stay here again.

<Content>Great value for money Booked this 3 day break with Hotel Connect who were amazingly efficient, even sent us details of transport to hotel from airport.3 young at heart ladies booked a triple room which turned out to be 2 rooms, one accessed through the other, and 2 bathrooms. We were mightily impressed. Beds were very comfortable and everywhere was very clean.The reception staff were exceedingly helpful, giving advice, directions and booking taxis.Not looking onto square but very quiet and peaceful.This hotel has brilliant location, approx. 50metres from Las Ramblas, 400 to Catalunya Square, 100 to Barri Gothic and 400 to Columbus's Statue.We paid around æ‹¢ 125 each for BB and this represented real value for money.We never felt threatened around the hotel, many homeless people do congregate and sleep there but no-one approached us and they were in no way a nuisance. Poor folk have to sleep somewhere and we guessed that they felt safe outside a brightly lit hotel.One small gripe would be that sometimes you had to wait for breakfast as the dining area was relatively small and the waiter allocating the tables was sadly lacking in 'people skills'!I

<Content>Remember 1972 This is a fine hotel in superb location BUT.. the square outside is frequented by down and outs and is very noisy when windows are open. The rooms are small notably the beds which are very small. There is a lack of local information in the room. Avoid eating anywhere on Ramblas. One of the best and most economical local coffee shops is located to the LEFT of the hotel. Make sure you obtain from the local tourist information kiosk a copy of the local transport network PLUS information about the Touristic Bus. Public transport is great value.

<Content>Clean but basic We stayed in the San Augustin for four nights. The hotel was always clean and well presented although the square on which the hotel sits is a little run down and seedy. The main advantage of this hotel is its location. It sits one street back from La Rambla around midway between the main square at the top and the harbour at the bottom. This meant it was only a 5 minute walk to either. The only really disappointing thing about this hotel was the breakfast. We had paid in advance for all our breakfasts and I am usually a big fan of continental breakfasts but the selection was very poor. My husband and I are both big eaters and enjoy a good breakfast but after the first morning we didn't bother going down to the breakfast room again.  Other than that this hotel was a god value, clean and well located place to stay in Barcelona.

<Content>Friendly but basic The hotel is basic. Staff is friendly - well as friendly as Barcelona can get- not exactly a city known for customer service and hospitality. The location is right off Las Ramblas which in my opinion is not a necessary thing for a wonderful stay in Barcelona. What is good about it is the short walk to Placa catalunya and the shops and the Metro station that is only about 200 metres away.The Ramblas is just a loud street with no good shops, just tourist haunts and restaurants, fast food stops and full of wandering tourists and con men trying to make a quick dollar. Be aware that is unsafe at night- I wouldn't recommend it for a single woman and any nice receptionist will tell you the same, as they have often told me in Barcelona. Our rooms were extremely tiny and extremely basic, but not ugly. Bathroom was tiny- could only be used with door closed. The rooms on the top floor are rumoured to be nicer but we didn't see them. Cleanliness was okay- though we all did have some ants in our rooms. But one of our group found bedbugs in her bed and told the reception about it who promptly apologized and moved all her things into a new room while we were out. When she wanted to retrieve something left in her old room she found that they had already moved a new guest into it- the same day! That poor fella.Breakfast is basic with toast, very dry rolls and pastries, scrambled eggs, sausages, yoghurt. Service at breakfast was very friendly.Internet access in the lobby was free.We moved to another hotel for the second part of our stay to meet friends, the Apsis Milleni- this was not as close to Las Ramblas as the Sant Agusti, but at the same price had a real 4 star quality to it and was completely modern and comfortable- read our review.All in all the Sant Agusti was a basic and clean place to stay with all the necessary amenities and a friendly staff trying to please, - located right in the middle of the tourist action without being affected by too much noise.Unless you need to be right on the Ramblas or are staying in a superior top floor room you can do better.

<Content>Excellent location and fantastic view We stayed in this hotel last September as we wanted a location close to the Ramblas. On other occasions I've stayed in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. The Sant Augusti is in a great handy location, just round the corner from the Ramblas on a small square. You do need to be careful in this area, especially at night time, as there are some less than desirable types who hang around. We had no real problems, thankfully.We were given an excellent room on the top floor which had amazing views of Barcelona. The ceiling had lovely oak beams, be careful if you are on the top floor , as you might bump your head on them!! Perhaps because we were on the top floor, we were not disturbed at all by other guests.Breakfasts were very good, however, I would avoid drinking the tap water provided at breakfast, as I got a very upset tummy after drinking it!Despite that I would recommend this hotel as a very comfortable and convenient location for a trip to Barcelona.

<Content>Great location, clean, good value. The hotel is brilliantly situated, just 50m from La Rambla and less than 100m from La Boquiera Market. Breakfast was good, with a selection of hot  cold options. The room was very clean and, although not huge, was modern and had a decent bathroom (with excellent shower). The little contact that we had with hotel staff was conducted efficiently on their behalf. The view from our window was of another wall just a few feet away. We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay.

<Content>Perfect place to stay The staff in this hotel gave us a warm welcome. The rooms were very clean and modern, with plenty of lighting. The bathroom was big and kept very clean. Our room had a balcony looking over a narrow street, which gave no end of entertainment watching passers by.The hotel entrance is off a courtyard with trees and a chapel so it feels special walking into it and not like all the other hotels that open onto the street.Only 1 very small block back from La Rambla (about half way down La Rambla) you get the excitement without all the noise and hastle of the main drag. The Liceu metro stop is where you enter onto La Rambla from the street the hotel is on. Very convenient.Breakfast was in a a room overlooking the courtyard and had a wide variety of meats cheese pastries and the normal breakfast things. There is a restaurant next to the hotel called Blue Rita, i would definately reccomend for dinner.Being in such a central spot and so close to the metro made it so easy to see this amaizing city.M

<Content>Wonderful Spring Break My husband  I just returned from a brilliant 4 nights break in this fascinating city. Hotel centrally placed just off La Ramblas , we were able to reach most sights on foot.Hotel very clean  comfortable, lovely buffet breakfast. We also dined there twice , found the food excellent value- E9.50 for tourist menu, E12.50 for an authentic Catalan meal (including large jug Sangria!) Shame about the downouts inhabiting the Placa San Agusti in front of the hotel though we did notice that the placa was sometimes hosed down (by the local council?)during the early hours which temporarily cleared it!A WARNING - beware of lost Greek tourist, he stopped us on a quiet street, asked if we were English and could we give him directions.Then appeared a smartly dressed man who produced a badge, claiming to be the drugs police. He told us we were in a very dangerous drug-dealing/using area and implied we were committing an offence.This was very scary! He then insisted on examining our wallets and wanted to see a credit card as identification.The Greek produced a card, the policeman then said he also needed the PIN for ID- to be keyed into his mobile phone! This the Greek pretended to do (by now we realised this was a scam)and the policeman expected my husband to do the same. My husband held tightly on to his wallet and insisted he had no credit card, I think the men then realised they had been rumbled and disappeared!This experience was most unsettling and we are now very wary when approached by strangers.Apart from this we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday and would certainly return to the Hotel San Agusti.

<Content>Great pre-cruise spot, friendly staff and near the Las Ramblas action My brother and I stayed here for one night to recover from jet lag before we boarded our cruise ship. The courtyard-square entrance to the hotel is charming, the rooms are comfortable (although we requested a move, due to a/c problems, which was promptly arranged by friendly staff) The bathroom was clean and modernized, and the breakfast was quite good.Highlights: Ambiance and historical feel, proximity to Las Ramblas and friendly, albeit quiky, staff. The gentleman at the front desk suggested a small restauraunt around the corner and down the alley for Paella... off the beaten tourist track, and obviously a place for locals. Our meal was reasonably priced, and the Paella was superb. I can still see the sizzling pan with fresh seafood and saffron rice in my mind's-eye... What a start to the wonderful family trip!Barcelona is a wonderful and friendly city, and this hotel is a great frist stop!

<Content>Great location The location is the best thing about the Hotel. It's just off Las Ramblas so you get very little street noise. It's also very close to a metro stop. Yes, the walls are paper thin but the only noise is at a reasonable hour in the morning. I didn't come to Barelona to sleep!! The clientel are older. Not a party crowd which would explain the morning noise and not the evening noise. Very clean and comfortable. Good continental breakfast which was included.

<Content>Nice hotel, excellent location We stayed at the Sant Agusti for three nights in October, and were entirely satisfied. The room was small, but fairly typical for a mid-range hotel in a large European city. At 140 euro per night it wasn't cheap either, but after a lot of shopping around we didn't really find anything cheaper.The room was very clean and the staff were nice enough, plus there was internet access in the lobby. But the main advantage is the location, essentially within sight of La Ramblas and the Liceu metro station. We had heard that we should be careful in that neighbourhood, but we felt completely safe and didn't see anything that caused us to worry.

<Content>Just back from Barca This hotel is really basic, and really small. If you do book it, I would hope you are getting a really good deal, because you get what you pay for. We on the other hand ended up paying quite a lot, for something that just wasn't up to scratch.Good:Really central location,We got a flat screen tv ( but only after we asked to be changed to a room with a double bed )Clean room and bed.A/CBad:Really small. I mean really.Very, very dated decor. It look like an episode of Kojak.All staff ( bar 1) were very unfriendly and just didn't give a monkeys.*For the price we paid*, this hotel just didn't cut it. If you getting a really good deal, go for it, otherwise I'd look around.

<Content>great location Although it has been a few years since we visited this hotel, i would definately reccommend it as a no frills but clean, friendly, and centrally located hotel, if you are on a budget. The location is the best thing about it and i have to say i did feel safe walking about on my own during the day, when hubby was having his siesta! Remember to visit guell palace which is 1 or 2 side streets away from this hotel, it is an amazing building that can be overlooked by many tourists

<Content>Good Hotel We had a lovely stay in Sant Agusti Hotel. Room cleaned every day. And the room was good. We stayed the week they have a market the whole way down the street it was fanastic (we heard no noise at all and it had started before we woke up) and are room was right above it. I would recommended this Hotel. And they have a computer in the lobby were you can send emails to your friends (it is easier than texting on your mobile) and it is FREE to use.I very nice stay we all had.

<Content>Fabulous This was our second visit to this spelndid hotel, right in the center of Barcelona, some 75 meters from La Rambla.A station for the excellent underground system is nearby.Rooms have plenty of space (especially in the newer part of the hotel), and come with nice furniture, beds with good matrasses (quite important), a television, private safe and a comfortable bathroom.Breakfast is a pretty large buffet, with plenty of choice. different sorts of bread, cerials, drinks, yoghurt, eggs, ands so on.Personel of the hotel is very friendly and helpfull. If you are looking for a nice tourist hotel that offers offers something extra, this is the place to go

<Content>Spend a little extra Just returned from a three day - two night trip to Barcelona. Absolutely loved the City - wish we had booked for longer. Recommend the turist bus - if you are there for a short time it guarantees that you see everything - worth every penny - and you can hop off and have a look around whenever you wish - they run every ten minutes so you can get another pretty easy. Get off at the Spanish Village - it's beautiful - you have to pay 7 euros to get in but it's worth it - we were there 3 hours - had a meal and a good look around - it was wonderful.We stayed in the hotel San Augustin which is situated 50 yards off the Ramlas. The Hotel is basic - but quaint. We like our luxury and almost always stay 5 star - but to me this was an adventure - it felt like 'camping out'. The only problem was the area - the hotel is near to the main drag - but its location is in a seedy run down square. Walking up the Ramblas from the Hotel, we spotted a couple of really nice looking Hotels - and with hindsight wished we'd payed the extra and booked in there. Still just be sensible if you do stay in the San Augustin - dont expect too much - it's clean and tidy - extra small and basic - I suppose it depends on how long you are staying. I didn't mind 'roughing it' for two nights but next time -I'm in the Metropolitan!

<Content>We were very happy with the Sant Agustin. We stayed at the Sant Agustin in Sept. of 2003. The room overlooked the square; people were sleeping on the steps of the building next door. They appeared to be tourists with backpacks. The room was old with ancient wooden closet; however, the bathroom was new and clean. The room was clean also. The proximity to La Rambla and price made it an ideal hotel for us. As for the walls being too thin, we are Americans used to American motels where we always hear water running in adjacent rooms so we really didn't notice. The breakfast was adequate. Another plus is having free web access in the lobby. The front desk was also helpful. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Fab location Stayed in the Sant Agustin in February. The hotel certainly wasn't at the luxurious end of the market but, catered for everything we needed and was in a very central location. I agree with previous comments regarding the noise in the rooms - the walls are paper thin!!The hotel is just within the Raval area which does have a bit of a reputation but if you don't advertise the fact you are a tourist (i.e. looking lost, wearing a bum bag, carrying maps - you get the picture), then you will be fine. It is in fact quite a funky little area with some fab shops. By the way the bar next door 'Rita Blue' is recommended as are the Mojito cocktails which they serve!

<Content>Too noisy! Great location but very noisy. You can hear the toilets and showers in neighbouring rooms. Also we were lucky enough to be there at the same time a hen party was!! Too much noise into the small hours. Rooms clean but basic. We wouln't go back.
