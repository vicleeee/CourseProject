<Content>great place to stay We stayed in this hotel for 11 days, and everythin was perfect. First day we were provided with a little bit smaller room, because all another 3bed rooms were ocupated - but just the day after , they asked us if we want to move in a better room - cause it was possible. They are all so kind and friendly - and the prise was also very good. I will recomand this hotel to all young people - and the families [--] well...

<Content>a dump They provided slippers in the room because they carpet was so filthy. When I pulled my bedspread back to go to sleep on my first night, there was a live silverfish bug wiggling around. Mildew all over the chords hanging in the bathroom. I was in Europe for 49 nights - this was the only hotel I stayed in that was disgusting.

<Content>Don't believe their pictures and publicity Booked this hotel through an agent who, as it turns out hadn't visited for over a year and thought the hotel had been refurbished. We were disgusted at the first room and contacted the agent who arranged another room. We were given the keys to two rooms. Both slightly better, if you consider that the wall socket was loose, the furniture was damaged and dangerous. the toilet roll holder was hanging off. The wall paper was peeling. The paint appeared to have been applied by a young child. The general aroma of the hotel was....The room had an ashtray when we expected a non smoking room. The breakfast was mediocre. Three stars, certainly not. Our next hotel in Rome was three star and like a palace by comparison. They both cost exactly the same tariff. The staff were friendly. The bedding clean. The website photos look nothing like the three rooms we saw, although our room was obviously used for the picture of the Duomo. The bathroom photo is misleading.Our advice - DO NOT GO THERE.

<Content>Great Location This was a good hotel in a great location. We walked there from the train station easily, pulling luggage. Staff was helpful, had an elevator, decent breakfast. etc. There was an internet cafe and a laundromat very close. There was construction on a street about 100 yds away, which made the area seem kind of bad, but that was temporary, and the area is fine.

<Content>Just Awful. Don't stay here. We arrived to find the lift out of order and the receptionist moaning about the fact that we didn't have the booking confirmation to hand (it was in my luggage which was being dragged upstairs by some unfortunate porter). He moaned about this on subsequent occasions, including once when we arrived back at the hotel late one night to find him and a number of his cronies clearly drunk. He was obnoxious and the atmosphere was intimidating.The room was dirty, cold and generally in poor condition with broken furniture and an ancient and noisy aircon system. Breakfast was inedible.The hotel is located in a an area of the city which has a somewhat seedy flavour with God knows what transactions taking place in dark corners.This is, allegedly, a three star hotel, however, it is also the worst accommodation I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world.Do yourself a favour - find somewhere else .

<Content>The best stay in Firenze We were recommended this hotel by an Italian conference organization group (Consultia Umbria) as we were attending a week long conference at the Fortezza di Basso. The location of this hotel could not be more fantastic. A 7 minute walk to the train station, minutes from the Duomo, San Lorenzo church, seconds from the world-famous open air market and a lovely walk from the Ponte Vecchio and the Boboli Gardens. It was a pleasant 10-15 minute walk to our conference center in the morning. It was safe, secure, and the breakfast was absolutely amazing. There is a woman who greets you with a buongiorno and asks if you'd like cafe. Say yes, and savor the most amazing cafe latte you'll ever have! The breakfast included orange juice, yogurt, cereals, meats, fresh fruit, croissants--an all around filling breakfast and was one of the highlights of our trip. We were greeted nicely by the desk staff (we stayed 8 nights total, one more night than originally planned--they were very flexible in letting us stay longer) and Olivier, the day manager, went out of his way to ensure we received a package that was to be delivered to the hotel. Unfortunately, there was a charge on the package and he could not accept the charges, so he did a ton of research, made us a map, and told us how to get the package. When it was redelivered the next morning, charges still affixed, he PAID for it out of his own pocket and we paid him back. The internet was included, as was breakfast, and you are able to access it from your room.Fantastic service, I will definitely be staying there on our next trip. One downside: each room is very unique and we happened to get a room with a teeny, teeny tiny shower. Most of the staff speaks some English, so don't be shy and give them a call if you have a special preference for a room.

<Content>Good location Stayed 3 nights in this hotel. If you travel by train, this hotel is located in an ideal location. You don't have to drag your luggages too far off from the train station. It's also very near to all the places of interest.The room is an acceptable size and bathroom, though small but it's acceptable. Served good breakfast and they are nice to serve us earlier as we have an early train to catch.Don't expect too much help from the front desk.

<Content>Grest, Except for the staff We stayed in San Giorgio e Olimpic for three nights; the location was very good, close to the train station, very good restaurants and the Mercatto Centrale. Main attractions in Florence were also at walking distance, like uffizzi, academia, Duomo, etc. Breakfast was very good, the room was large and clean, with a nice view. Our only complain is the staff; not friendly at all, the woman serving coffee in the breakfast room looked awfully depressed, and we asked for wake up calls that never happened. When we asked them for help with bus routes, they seemed to get upset, and told us to walk instead.Overall, good.

<Content>Loved this hotel Couldn't have been more pleasant, especially for the price! Good location. Courteous, helpful staff. Good breakfast, too. We had a triple room for the price of a double. The room was large and clean, with a frig. If I ever get to go back to Florence, I'll stay there. We really got lucky! As an aside, I was traveling with my 72 old mother--even she was pleased!

<Content>Greta Location but grotty and dirty Just returned from Florence which is fantastic, the only let down was this hotel. Although the hotel is fantastically located, it is so dirty. Several cobwebs hung down from the ceiling lamps, the wall paper is dirty, all in all this hotel needs to be redecorated and by no means be 3 star.

<Content>Left after the first night My wife and I traveled to Florence for our tenth anniversary. Having previously enjoyed trips both Rome and Venice, we were really looking forward to a nice stay in Florence.The hotel is conveniently located very close to the train station in Florence, within an easy walking distance. It is easy to find. The entrance was typical for hotels in Florence and elsewhere in Italy. We checked in just at sundown, and were shown to the room.When we entered the room, it was musty smelling and dirty. The furniture and bedspread were covered by dust, the carpet was in need of a good vacuuming. The bathroom was partially clean, but the tub/shower was infested with mildew. When I asked for another room, I was informed the hotel was full, but perhaps they could change the room tomorrow. As we prepared for bed, I could not get the air conditioner to come on. The first item I review for European hotels is air conditioning and this hotel advertised that they had it. I was informed that they had turned the system off, and did not have a fan to provide for the room. The advice was to open the windows, it got cool at night.Later, as my wife and I lie awake swatting mosquitoes all night, we decided to leave the hotel in the morning for better accommodations. Seriously, the mosquito population reminded me of the family camping trips to Florida!It turns out that very few hotels in Florence maintain air-conditioning starting in October, but we found some, and ended our mosquito slaying expedition.

<Content>In just the right place This hotel is in an ideal place, near the station and a stone's throw from the centre of the city. Little shops nearby where you can buy food and drink, good choice of places to eat as well. A pleasant building, nice sitting area downstairs where we often cooled off. Air conditioning in the rooms excellent. Comfy beds as well. Rooms were a good size, we had two which faced away from the street so it was very quiet, hard to believe we were in the centre of Florence. Hot showers variable, sometimes hot and sometimes not. Room 116 has a nasty damp patch on the bathroom ceiling and you do need to fix this please managment as it smells bad. Staff always courteous, breakfast in a nice room and plenty for our needs. We would stay here again, it was great to just walk out of the door and amble up to San Lorenzo, safe at night too.

<Content>fabulous florence travelled to florence in may '06 and stayed at the san giorgio hotel which was ideally located in the centre of the city close to the duomo cathedral,shops and restarants, the staff at the hotel were very nice and welcoming and spoke very good english, rooms were average size although the bathrooms could do with being a little bit bigger,no restarant in hotel but breakfast was nice and plenty to choose from, no need for any transport to get around the city from hotel as everything is only 5/10 minutes walk away,good hotel for short breaks and would return if i go back to florence in the future.

<Content>Great location A great centrally located hotel in the heart of Florence and within walking distance to all the major attractions. If arriving by train the train station is literally across the road and if flying into Florence Airport it takes about 20 minutes in a taxi and costs about 15 Euros. The rooms were of an average standard and very clean. The buffet breakfast was okay but nothing special. The staff were very friendly and spoke very good English. All in all a very nice hotel and I would recommend this to anyone wishing to go to this amazing city.

<Content>Wonderful location This was one of our favorite hotels during our trip to Italy. The quad room looked exactly like the picture on their website. The room and hotel were clean, the room spacious. The desk clerks weren't overly friendly, but I wouldn't call them rude either. Air-conditioning was a relief after going without in other cities. It is within walking distance of all the major attractions.

<Content>Standing Up for the Sanny G. Excellent value for money and a fine location. the breakfast is average but no worse or better than in any of the other hotels we stayed in whilst in Italy.The hotel location is why you book the Hotel San Giorgio as it is only minutes walk from all of the best sight seeing attractions such as the Duomo or Florence Cathedral, Santa Maria Novella and the Ponte Vecchio is the furthest away being a 15 minute walk.Reception, breakfast and house cleaning staff were pleasant and helpful.

<Content>Good location, odd aircon Good location, walking distance from train station. Easy to walk to most of the tourist sites. The street market, which was on every day during our stay, is well worth a visit. As is the nearby fresh produce market, open every day until 2pm except Sunday. There are many restaurants and bars within walking distance.The aircon was not working in the room, despite requesting this in advance. Reception said that it was connected to the weather? It was on during the day but not at night. Windows had to be left open resulting in being eaten alive by mosquitoes. Soap was not replaced in the bathrooom, they said they had run out. Cleaners knocked on the door at 9am on our first morning, needed a lie in due to late flight arrival. Asked for do not disturb sign 4 times, it never arrived, although a piece of paper was supplied to stick on the door with do not disturb in Italian. Didn't have breakfast so can't comment on this, rooms could do with redecoration but they are clean.

<Content>You can find something better! Hi! I stayed at the San Giorgio and Olympic Hotel, Florence, this July 2005 with my husband and baby. Its location is good,near places of interest as well as the train station. Breakfast is good. However, ALL RECEPTIONISTS are rather rude and not helpful at all!!!!!!!! You have to literally beg them to give you a map of the city (though they are free!). The hotel has no parking area, so think twice if you'll rent a car because you have to pay 20 euros extra per day!!!! The hotel is in a driving-restricted area, so it took us 3 hours to find the hotel! Overall our stay was not very pleasant at this hotel, I'd stay somewhere else if I visited Florence again in the future.

<Content>Simple but Kind charming 3 star hotel located minutes walk from everything... the reception staff were very accommodating and the local eateries they recommended were pure dead brilliant. Florence is a wicked city and from the Hotel San Giorgio you can walk to everything. The rooms aren't all that spacious but they were clean and we were grateful for the satelite tv station so we could catch up on a bit of cnn world news. the only slight criticism we had was that the breakfast wasn't all that great although on the second morning we did ask for a capuccino instead of using the coffee machine and it was like chalk and cheese the difference. Overall though we can have no grumbles as we paid roughly 105 euro a night for a 3 star hotel in the city centre of Florence with private ensuite facilities and satelite tv!

<Content>Safe and Secure at the San Giorgio Hotel in Florence this hotel is cheap, comfortable and enjoys a very comfortable location in the historical centre of Florence only a few minutes walk from the main railway station of Santa Maria Novella. The staff are friendly and helpful and their English is very good... we found the restaurants that they recommended were brilliant and excellent value for money... the rooms need a little redecorating and are average in size but clean and tidy. Breakfast wasn't anything to write home about but in Italy it hardly ever is... we booked direct with the hotel which meant we paid upon departure... the room rate was 120 euro per night for a double room including breakfast... excellent value for money but you can get it even cheaper if you book for july and august!

<Content>Excellent Choice quaint family run hotel where every morning the owner a young presentable lady would lend a hand to ensure check outs ran smoothly... independently owned hotels are hard to find these days particularly in the UK where 9 hotels out of 10 seem to be part of a large chain... not the case of the San Giorgio Hotel in Florence which has maintained its' unique hotel personality despite it's 3 star status. the rooms are very average and in need of a paint job in places (marks on the wall where suitcases have scraped the paintwork) however, the rooms are clean as are the bathrooms - I even watched the Champions League final on the TV which also contains BBC and CNN TV channels. The hotel's forte is not their breakfast which is mediocre at best but the reception staff who are very nice and helpful - both Olivier and Piero. Finally, the hotel location is ace as you are only a short walk (about 200 metres) from Florence Cathedral which is the epicentre of Florence and cultural and historical centre. I would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Hotel San Giorgio - Nice Hotel Florence this is a nice 3 star hotel that has an excellent location right between the Duomo and the train station both of which can be reached in just a few minutes walk. The rooms are a little tired looking but are very clean and contain everything you would expect to find in a 3 star hotel i.e. satelite television (just cnn and bbc), private bathroom with soft fluffy white towels, hair dryer. the floors are carpetted and are a bit frayed in places however, for 120 euro a double room including breakfast you shouldn't worry about a few signs of wear and tear. Before booking this hotel I check a few websites and in the end I ended up booking through the hotel's own website which is packed with useful information. I will certainly return to the Hotel San Giorgio if I ever go back to Firenze.

<Content>Cosy and Cheap i just returned from a wonderful time in Italy. In Florence the highlight of my stay was the Hotel San Giorgio because of it's location and the warmth of the reception staff. At first it was a bit strange because whilst the hotel is family run the reception staff are well groomed and very formal in the their appearance. However, once you get to know them, notably Piero, they are very helpful and only too happy to suggest restaurants, muesums and art galleries. Everything is within walking distance of this hotel which for 70 euro a double room (we went in the low season) it is worth every penny. On the downside the rooms are a little tired looking but they are spotless and our sheets were changed daily. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a cheap city centre hotel with personal service. I will be Back!

<Content>Please find an alternate hotel My husband and I went on our second honeymoon to italy and france this had been our dream vacation and when we got to our second stop (form rome) we were expecting a good welcome to florence. We arrived and the staff was nice they told us which room we were in and gave us the key. We went upstairs and they were taking our lugage up to the room when we saw the ugliest , dirtiest room ever. The bed covers looked dirty and the walls looked like they where never cleaned after they were painted. The shower was not realy a shower it was a tub. I walked down the stairs and asked to be moved to a clean room and one with a shower, after a few minutes they swithched us to a differnt room with a shower whose doors would not close and with no place to pue your soap or shampoo. by the way the plumbing was not working so it seemed like the water was going to comeou to the floor of the room and so there I find my self going again to the front desk to let them know that the shower was not working. the reason why I had to walk down the stairs was because there is no way to call the front desk from your room.I would not recomend staying in this Hotel at all. PLEASE don't stay in this Hotel It does not deserve a 3 star rating.

<Content>Simply wonderful Location Great location only a few minutes walk from the main railway station in Florence this hotel is the perfect base from which to enjoy the many sights Florence has to offer. The hotel is very reasonably priced (given the rates some of the other hotels in the area were charging) and the staff are very friendly especially Piero who helped us with suggestions for good restaurants, pubs and general sightseeing information. I will definately be returning here!

<Content>Disappointing  Our hearts sank when we arrived at our first location in Italy. The hotel was supposed to have been renovated - but that must have been 30 years ago. Our room was dark and dingy. The beds, linen and bathroom were clean - but the room decor was dark, dirty and in need of refurbishment. our friends room was darker - their bed-covers were worn and balled-up.Our 2nd stay in Florence - we will not be returning to the San Giorgio.

<Content>Generally run down Near train station in less than desirable area. The room and bathroom size were adequate but in need of updating. Staff was accomodating and hard working. Street very noisy at night. I wouldn't stay here again.
