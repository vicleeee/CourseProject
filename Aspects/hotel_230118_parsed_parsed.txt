<Content>new year events went with friends for new year holidays.The location-perfect,you can reach all places by walk,museums just round the corner.Ordered superior rooms with buffet breakfast.Rooms-comfortable,not large,interesting solution of joining the room with WC and shower separated by glass ,every time water flowed in to the room.Food at breakfast was very good,we liked it.Very helpful staff at reception,but room service was not careful in cleaning the rooms-we've found used condom between mattress and wall,somebodies slippers under the bed,doesn't check if there is enough tea or coffee bags for preparing hot drinks in the room,carpet floor not carefully vacuumed ,especially in the corners.In general,we liked our stay in this hotel and choose it for our next visit to Amsterdam

<Content>fabulous hotel, great location Stayed at the Park Hotel december 2007 - only writing review now as i have just returned from amsterdam again after a dreadful stay at a different hotel and am sorry i didnt book the Park Hotel again!This hotel was fab, great location, helpful friendly staff, gorgeous rooms which all seemed to be newly decorated, great service from staff, excellent facilities in hotel. The only thing i would complain about would be that the rooms were very small and very pricey however we got a great deal last year in a package including flights but that was not available this year hence the reason for going to a different hotel this time!Overall though fantastic hotel and i would certainly return again and again if the price was right!

<Content>Lovely hotel Great Location Just returned from this hotel. A really lovely stay. Great location, Close to Vondelpark  ideal for the Museums. We normally stay near Central station but this is a far better location. The staff were professional  friendly. I would stay here again when i return to the Dam.

<Content>Best address in town! This is a hotel with perfect location and low prices when booked through some booking sites like hotels.com or booking.comThe Park Hotel has finished it's renovation and the result is quite stunning. Very modern lobby with big library (mainly art books), friendly people at the reception, rooms (I had a Superior double which is a standard room) are a bit on the small side but have all the space one needs. I was first given room 121, on the noisy street side (where the tram goes) but could easily change to one on the opposite side of the corridor, room 214, which are totally quiet, also no noise from neighbouring rooms. Very modern style, which I normally don't like but this was quite wonderful. The shower room and toilet are in what looks like a cupboard, but narrow. Taking a shower by the big rainfall shower floods the toilet floor and the entry hall floor and I had to put a towel over it. Big flat TV (32 inch) on a wall right in front of the bed (at least in room 214 , in 121 it is a bit next to the bed). Very romantic is the ambient light behind the bed, which has 7 colours to choose from, creating a very romantic atmosphere when being in bed together (but I was alone). Bed was the nicest I have ever slept in, quite soft. Nice toiletries of the Dutch brand Rituals. Minibar has reasonable prices, no space for own drinks but enough space to move the water bottles out and then put own drinks there. Small desk, 2 chairs. Double glazing, double curtains that quite block out daylightBreakfast (till 10.30 AM) is pricey (23, 50 Euro) but abundant, the most elaborate international breakfast in town as the hotel says. I doubt that, but it surely is impressive, Eggs any style made to order. There were only young people eating when I took breakfast on a Sunday, in the modern, stylish restaurant MOMO. I think this is THE hotel to stay in Amsterdam.To reach it easily, take tram 2 or 5 from Central Station, get off opposite Rijksmuseum (one stop after Leidseplein) and walk back a little. If you also need quietness and booked the cheapest rooms (Superior Double) then ask for a room with numbers 109 to 115 , 209 to 215, etc.

<Content>Great Hotel with great service and fantastic renovation The hotel was obviously just finished as far as the new renovations were concerned, the whole service was superb. The room was very well appointed, clean and lacked nothing. The breakfast was excellent and the area the hotel is in is one of the better parts of Amsterdam for getting to either Museums or local night life. If you can afford the nightly price it鈥檚 a great place to stay.

<Content>Great, comfortable, perfectly situated hotel The hotel is well situated near the Leidseplein Square, fashion district, tramlinks etcThe hotel has recently been completely gutted and refitted with new high fashion style minimalist rooms, each with nice bathrooms, flat screen tvs, aircon etc. Beds are comfortable and the shower is great tooThe hotel has a great restaurant but its only downside is a hugely over expensive breakfast, even if it is great - recommend getting it included in the package because to buy on top of room price its 鈧?3 a day!!The hotel is a great stay over all

<Content>Great staff We knew the Park Hotel from the outside last year and just used the lobby at that time. This year we booked the hotel for our 5-day trip to Amsterdam and found the entire hotel had been refurbished. The lobby was not recognizable: it was vastly bigger and very stylish.The frontdesk people were not only very friendly but extremely knowledgeable and helpful.The room was nice and clean but we did not like the beds: they were too soft and used eiderdown comforters instead of regular blankets (which we obtained after requesting them anyway).We used the restaurant sparingly for breakfast because we are not great eaters and the only choice was a buffet, which was very complete indeed but rather pricey.In conclusion, we were happy with the hotel, can recommend it to others and we plan to return to it when we are back in Amsterdam.

<Content>The Park Hotel - Well, We Got to Laugh A Lot! Oh, the Park Hotel, what memories you have given us. This was not our first, second, third, fourth, fifth, etc. choice. But we chose to go to Amsterdam during the International Broadcast Conference, and really, it was nearly impossible to find a room. Because of the conference, the prices were ludicrous. The first night was about $500, with each successive night a little less expensive.The art deco lobby was cool, and you think, wow, this might be neat. Then you hear the directions to your room. You literally turn the corner and leave the art deco behind and arrive in a dinghy, scary hallway. Then the elevator is pretty much an old freight elevator converted for guests. Then it's another flight of stairs up to the fifth floor where our room was.Upon entering the hallway, the first thing I noticed was the smell. To me, it was like stale trash lingering in the hallway. It never went away.The room was ... interesting. The bed was amazingly comfortable, and it had funky lighting so you could sleep in your own private red light district, or blue light, or yellow, or green, or white. You get the idea. The bathroom area was cramped, and the shower -- yes, it's exactly as everyone says ... flood, flood, flood. We tried everything, but the most we got was ... less flooding.We had a room overlooking the road, so it was very noisy. And, it just didn't feel clean, I wanted to walk through the room with an antibacterial wipe, and believe it or not, I am decidedly not a germaphobe.The location was extraordinary ... you can't fault that, and if you don't mind the smell, the shower, etc. this is a good place. It is kind of funky. But weirdly, this was our last stop on our European honeymoon, and this was the only place we met rude staff. But we laughed it off, things like, you can only get the full breakfast buffet in MOMO, you can't get just a coffee, well, you can, but they'll only serve it to you in the lobby. But did I mention the bed was super comfy? I can't say this place was horrible, only that we would never stay here again. But it was kind of funny.

<Content>Okay hotel Stayed in Park Hotel when we eventually found it! Walked from Central Station which is not a good idea...We paid 拢130 p/n - the special weekend package from their website (was a better offer than any of the other hotel / travel websites). We were disappointed to be shown to a dark room at the back of the hotel overlooking containers, the room just about big enough to accomodate the bed - felt like we were in a broom cupboard! We upgraded (additional 拢50 p/n) to a studio room which was alot nicer on a split level overlooking the canal. The bed was one of those electric ones with remotes which was very amusing! The room itself was nice and airy, although it did have a distinct smell of a dead rat! I am not joking!The hotel is not as contemporary as you expect it to be - they haven't quite got it right.On the other hand the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. The hotel is in a good location to explore nearby attractions and coffee shops! Try to master the tram system sooner than later - it's well worth it and easy when you know how! A MUST to get around Amsterdam! Enjoy!

<Content>mediocre - not at all what I expected I have just returned from the hotel, my overall impression of the hotel is average. From the outside of the hotel, it looks like a mix between old  new as all the other reviews have mentioned the hotel is currently being renovated. My husband  I arrived an hour before check-in, are room we ready when we arrived. Checking in was swift, finding the room at first was fairly confusing we had to use two lifts, when we finally got to the rooms the first thing I noticed was this bad smell. Kind of like uncleaned toilets, this smell stayed with me throughout my whole stay. The restaurant was expensive, the staff were pleasant. But for what was advertised to me as a 4* hotel it was more like a 3*  for that reason alone not worth the money I know some people have paid for it. I paid 鈧?20 for a 2 night stay including flights from London (lastminute.com), reasonable price I know however I would not stay the hotel again.

<Content>Very Good...but Booked the hotel on easy book to 175.00 CAD per night. A good price for this hotel. It's extremely clean, the staff are friendly, the rooms are very very nice, and the beds are super comfy. But...everything you have read on here before about the showers backing up is 100% true. Ours backed up and we had water all over the bathroom floor that made it's out the front doorway and into the hall. We let the front desk know and they sent up the mais who just gave us some extra towels???? Whatever. Anyway we aren't the kind of people who make a big stink about things, so we forgot about it. We only stayed one night anyway. Had we stayed another night, we would have requested another room. Aside from the shower, everything else was top notch. Would stay again, but would make sure the shower worked first.

<Content>Great Location We really enjoyed this hotel as it gave us a good laugh!I have to agree with most of the recent reviews , it's location is it's biggest selling point. You could easily walk to anywhere within the central area.Beware if you are under 5 foot tall you will have problems reaching the check in desk , wardrobe and breakfast items !The new restaurant MOMO is suffering from style overload , watch out for low swinging lights over tables! Breakfast was excellent if not a bit pricey . The evening menu was totally weird and overpriced - still there are a huge number of excellent eateries within 5 minutes walk so we didn't use it !.The room was a little small for a superior room and beware the shower does flood the room ! Again style over practicality is the word here. The bed was rather soft with it's three ( yes three) mattresses! The coffee / tea making facility was a bonus. Nice toiletries and towels ( which you need for mopping up the floor).The refurbishment is still ongoing which led to an interesting route to our room on the 4th Floor- but we soon got used to it !Beware if you have kiddies our windows opened to a shear 4 floor drop which was a bit scary !Overall a good hotel , in a great location . We would stay here again - just for the laughs!

<Content>Grat Location but not worth the money Although we arrived early morning our room was not available until 3pm (check in advertised 2pm) we were on the 5th floor SO we had to get in one lift to the 2nd floor exit walk down a corridor and a flight of steps to a very old service lift up to the 4th floor up two flights of steps to the room, try doing that after having a drink!!!! Like the other review our toilet n shower were next to the bed and leaked on the floor everytime.On the plus side it was in a good location but i would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Lovely hotel but didn't like the lifts We have just spent a weekend at this hotel and we were on the 3rd floor. We thought the hotel overall was very good but a big criticism were the lifts which we disliked immensely. Having to change lifts just to reach the 3rd floor /go downstairs several times a day was a real hassle - we weren't too bothered about the refurbishment though - I know it had been a lot worse prior to our visit. Our room was really lovely and even though it had quite a bit of street noise going on outside well into each night we didn't find it too much of an inconvenience - you are in the City after all!We didn't like the shower and toilet cubicles. You could regularly end up with your feet and clothing drenched each time the loo was used which was a real nuisance.Overall, a well positioned hotel with nice canal views but it was the Staff and the food which made it extra special. Would stay there again without hesitation and would recommend.

<Content>Great location - will use this hotel again Just returned from a long weekend in the Dam. My hubby has stayed at the Park previously and was very impressed with the refurb. We had room 416 on the fourth floor (obviously) which was a very modern double room with LCD tv, ultra modern black tiled bathroom with chrome fittings, very comfortable double bed, air-con (thank goodness, it was very hot that weekend), mini bar, hairdryer etc etc.Check-in was quick and easy, and a porter took our luggage to the room. I had requested a quiet room and this is exactly what we got - the view was over the roof tops rather than the canal/road which meant that there was no traffic noise at all.We stayed on room only basis. As the hotel is finishing off the renovations there was a little bit of work going on but nothing to disrupt our stay apart from the lift breaking down on the morning we were leaving, so had to carry out luggage down the stairs. Could not be helped.The location of the hotel is great - just over the road Vondel Park, and some good bars and restaurants. Leidsplein is a 5 mins walk away and there are many shops, restaurants and bars there to try.We had a special price for this hotel which was why we chose it, but will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Perfect Amsterdam Hotel Stayed for 2 nights with friends on a weekend trip to Amsterdam. The location is great - right by a canal where you can pick up boat tours, Van Gogh Museum, the Vondelpark, and about 5 minutes walk from the bars / restaurants around Leidseplein (much nicer than Dam Square / Central Station area). The Red Light District / Dam Square are about a 20 minute walk or a short tram journey, but to be honest it is great not to be right amongst the hordes of tourists (especially the stag/hen parties). There are lots of nice streets to explore on foot around the hotel with bars/cafes/restaurants where you can experience a slice of real Amsterdam life. The reception area and rooms have been recently refurbished and are modern and stylish. The breakfast room has not yet been done, and is a bit shabby compared the the other parts of the hotel, but I assume it is next on the list for the refurb! All in all a great base to explore Amsterdam from.

<Content>Free upgrade... I think it was a downgrade!!! We only booked this hotel because it said on the website that it had been re-modernised, we stayed here 2 years ago and the room was terrible so this time we were hoping for better.We booked a superior room which was advertised as all brand new with plasma tv open plan bathroom new beds etc but when we checked in the receptionist said she had upgraded us to an executive room which was good until we got to the room to find it was an old style room that had not been modernised, i rang recpetion to ask for our original room and was told that they had already filled it, what between us checking in and going up 3 floors to the room they had let it out i dont think so.The hotel was still undergoing major works when we stayed we had not been informed of this and to get to our room we had to walk up a dust filled corridor with workmen everywhere.The room was dirty, the maid service was terrible one day we didnt leave the room till 11am an eventhough the maids were still doing our floor they did not attempt to clean our room, on the days they did clean all they did was make the bed and supply new towels, they never topped the coffee/tea up we had to ring reception for some more and it never turned up along with the non slip bath mat we rung them for twice which never turned up.They have no ice machines and charged 3 euros 50 for ice to be brought to the room i wouldnt of bothered if they had told me the charge before i rang up to find out where the ice machine was.And to top it all off upon checking out even though we had paid in full on arrival for the room they decided to put the price of the room up and wanted an extra 100 euros a night plus charges for pay tv which we had not had, it took nearly an hour to check out and get sorted i had paperwork to prove all the costs but they would not accept it at first.The location of the hotel is good but thats about it the service and staff attitude is extremely poor abd the quality of the hotel itself should be downgraded to 3 star.Would we stay here again.....NO DEFINATELY NOT.

<Content>A brilliant location It was 18 years since our last stay at The Park and we were definitely not disappointed with our recent vist. The hotel has just been renovated to the highest standard. The rooms are spacious and the bed has to be the most comfortable we have ever slept in abroad. The standard of cleanliness was excellent too.The fixtures and fittings are very good. From the moment we arrived the staff were so very helpful. There was a problem with the electricity in our room but within 10 minutes of reporting it the electrician had rectified the problem. Added to all this the location is brilliant. We look forward to a return visit.

<Content>Great location, however... ...all in all above average experience with a few downsides. Firstly, the room we stayed in was really stuffy and we weren't able to open the windows and the air con added to the stuffiness. Secondly, we had a bit of trouble in getting a room that we had booked (admittedly through lastminute.com) with a double bed instead of two twin. The receptionist assumed that we, as a young couple, would be ok with separate beds without confirming this first when there was no preference stated on our booking form. She also seemed a bit annoyed when we tried to change this.

<Content>Classy and comfortable hotel Upon arrival at The Park Hotel, the staff could not have been more helpful, friendly and approachable. The hotel itself is in a prime location for the canals, museums, and some great bars and restaurants. The decor was fantastic, and our room was very well presented.Very clean, very modern and very comfortable...the bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in!  We found that our basin did not have running water, and so contacted reception...the general manager came to deal with this problem within 5 minutes, it had simply been switched off from beneath the basin...a simple problem. Yet that evening we returned back to the room to find a letter of apology for the inconvenience....this was a very nice touch considering what little inconvenience it had actually been! I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody.My one gripe was that there was a slight sewage smell in our room, but we thought this was simply a smell in the air rather than a problem with the hotel.

<Content>Class Hotel  Stayed at this hotel on the weekend of the 10th of May my partner  I. Firstly the location regarding public transport is excellent via train  tram, once I stepped inside it didn't disapoint nice appearance  decor, we arrived approx. about 10.30am so we though we would have to wait a while to get our room but alas no  another bonus was our room was upgraded from a superior to an executive room with an excellent view across the canal. The staff were excellent a provided us with maps etc., on searching for our room we did notice there is some building work going on it did not make our stay any better or worse. Facilities in the room were good, quality was also good. All in all I would have no hesitation to stay again  would recommend.

<Content>Good Position, but Undergoing Renovation I have recently returned from a 2 day stay at the Park Hotel, Amsterdam. The hotel is situated near the museums of Rembrandt and Van Gogh. It is also adjacent to one of the many Canals, providing Lunch and Dinner Cruises which is very handy!The Hotel is a 5 minute walk from the main Rembrandt Museum and 10 minutes walk to the centre of the Amsterdam shopping district. It has many restaurants surrounding it, a sample of those are: Indian, Thai, Steak Houses, Chinese as well as fast food like MacDonalds and Hard Rock Caf茅. The rooms are very compact and bijous 鈥?providing a double bed, toilet, shower, dressing table and Flat Screen TV. All you could need really for a short stay. The only down side to the Hotel when we visited, was that there was quite a bit of refurbishment going on. The hotel鈥檚 main Restaurant is closed and buffet breakfast is being held in one of the conference rooms. There is no on-site dining, other than snacks and room service. Apart from this, the hotel was just what we were looking for. I would recommend this hotel if you wish to be near the Museums and some nice restaurants and don鈥檛 mind the 鈥渟maller鈥?style room.

<Content>Great rooms  The check in was extremely fast and friendly and we were even given a room upgrade which was a lovely surprise. There was some building work going on to the outside but other than a bit of dust there were no issues with thisThe room itself was immaculately clean and had a very contemporary and well thought out feel. The rain shower was lovely and the bed was extremely comfortableThe location was great, with easy walking access to all the major parts of the city. Would definately stay here again

<Content>great staff, weird bathrooms Stayed here after being double booked at the American Hotel and they booked us out to here. At first was very dubious on approach to hotel as there was building work going on but the welcome we received at reception was truly first class.Staff here are really helpful and could not have done more for us.Bedrooms are fine except for the very strange bathrooms. Strange in that the bathroom is actually in your bedroom and your modesty is protected by only frosted glass.Fine for my wife and I but if youwere travelling with someone you did not know intimately could be very embarrassing

<Content>Great Hotel - Good Location We have just spent a weeknd at the Park Hotel - and could not fault it. The renovation work is almost complete (very impressive), and it did not affect our stay in any way. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpfull. We had booked a superior room but were upgraded to an excecutive room on arrival without asking and at no extra charge. The room was excellent, clean, quiet, comfortable and a good view from the 6th floor. The hotel has a left luggage facility, which is ideal if you have a late flight after checking out at midday. Easy to find, if you get the train from the airport to Zeud station and then tram 5 (8 stops from Zeud). Literally 100m along the tram track. It's only 20mins in a taxi, however the taxi will cost you at least 20euro more each way.We hope to return later in the year.

<Content>A great hotel - would stay again Stayed here for 2 nights last weekend. We stayed in the new part of the hotel which has recently opened. To get to our rooms we had to walk through a building site to get to the lifts as work was still on-going and I had a feeling of dread - until I walked into my room. It was a lovely size, nice decor and a very very comfortable king size bed. Flat screen TV, fab bathroom - very clean and comfortable. Staff were very friendly - always seem to be in Amsterdam. Breakfast was very good but would not recommend unless your hungry as was quite expensive especially if like me you just have coffee, toast and a bit of fruit. My companion got his money worth though! All in all if you want a tasteful, comfortable and quiet hotel I would recommend the Park.

<Content>THe people are so welcoming! My wife and I stayed at the Park Hotel this spring. From the moment we walked into the hotel the clerks and bell staff were excellent. They made us feel so welcome and comfortable. The amenities were perfect. We had a Jr. Suite. The room was clean and spacious. The room features a full size bathroom, studio sitting area and very comfortable king size bed.We had room service a few times and the food was excellent as was the delivery. We could not have found a better place to stay. I highly recommend this as a central location to the shops and the museums. The staff will assist you in finding anything you need.

<Content>great hotel I cannot fault this hotel. It was my second visit to the hotel and both times I was more than pleased. It is well located for the shops, bars and restraunts and also next to the best museums in Amsterdam. The staff were friendly ans welcoming. the room was one of the best 4 stars I have stayed in, unlike some hotels in Amsterdam that are not even 3 star quality, The absolute clincher for me was the breakfast though. The buffet style breakfast was vast and you could choose anything from a light breakfast to a plate full of what we English like.. bacon sausage, eggs. All in all a wonderful experience and I would return there without hesitation.

<Content>Quite good Excellent location but very limited parking and unless you can get something at the hotel it will cost you about 拢40 per day to park in the public one. (Attendants may be prepared to do a deal on cost!!!)We stayed there whilst it was under major refurbishment, but this didn't adversely affect out stay.Room was good with all amenities (except tea/coffee making). Breakfast was fine but b/fast room had no windows.

<Content>Nice Rooms While the rooms are remodeled, and beautiful, the construction continues. Loud hammers and construction noise was heard throughout the day. Our check-in was very complicated and the front desk staff was, at times, very unfriendly. We actually had to call our credit card concierge for dining and shopping suggestions because the front desk staff seemed unapproachable, bothered, and short with their responses. An unwelcoming experience...but the rooms were nice.

<Content>Nice Stay... Tourist-Trap Pricing Great location and helpful staff that provided tram schedule and directions.Wonderful location right by Museumplein and swanky retailers... Leidseplein is just a short walk away. You'll pay for the location, especially if it's summertime, but worth it.

<Content>Comfy but Pricey Located a few minutes walk from Leidseplein and the Rijksmuseum, the Park Hotel is a reasonable four star hotel. The hotel is currently going through a phased renovation programme and although some disruption is experienced it seems to be managed quite well. The renovation means banging etc during the day which was of no concern to me as I was working away from the hotel during the day.The room was quite spacious (for Amsterdam Hotels) with comfy bed, plasma TV and well appointed black tiled (not my style) bathroom . The internet connection was not working which was a bit inconvenient.My big problem with the hotel was the price at well over 200Euros per night. Breakfast in the hotel was ok but again quite expensive for what it was. Given the location of the hotel eating out is easy and much more cost effective.Tram 5 gets you very close to the hotel from Central Station or you could walk it in about 20 to 30 minutes.The completion of the renovation works will make this a good 4 star hotel and I would certainly stay in the hotel again but only if I could get a decent rate.

<Content>Loved the location Amsterdam, The Netherlands: the Park Hotel: Perfect locationDate: January 2008Reveiwer: a Canadian from Edmonton, Alberta, CanadaThe location was perfect, within walking distance of museums and restaurants and other top sight seeing destinations within Amsterdam. It was also on a major tram route that was easy to use.The hotel rooms were small but very efficient. Every bit of space was used effectively. They were very modern and very clean. Our experience with the staff was wonderful. The maitre d' made our breakfast experience very pleasurable.A great little hotel for a homebase at a great price!

<Content>Park Hotel Rebuild On arrival taken by lift to 4th floor. Had to carry our bags from there to the 5th Floor. Opened the door to the room to find the TV blaring and the temperature at 45 degrees centigrade. The smell of effluent which greeted us in reception was 5 times stronger here in the room. The non smoking room had been smoked in which compounded the problem as my wife is an asthmatic. We complained and were move to room 233. Whatever greets you do not accept this room! Modernisation at the Park Hotel does not extend to 21st century double glazing. The noise from trams, all night buses and drunken revellers was extreme. Add to this a hairdressing salon directly below which had its music speakers mounted six inches below our floor and the stay became a nightmare. The work going on at the Park is now in its 3rd year apparently and the management admits there are problems. I agree there are and the facts should be made clear to prospective clients. The worst hotel stay I have spent for some time espite an effusive written letter of apology from the General Manager.

<Content>Park Hotel was Brilliant My stay at the park was absoloutely brilliant. As we walked up to it I was slightly worried as there was a lot of building work going on around it, but when we entered the reception was lovely and the staff very helpful. Our luggage was transported to our room on a trolly by the porter and when we entered it was beautiful.The room was rather small but as there was only two of us the room was a good size, the decor was beautiful, the room was clean and all our needs were catered for. The only problem we had was that our shower leaked and we had to use a towel to stop the floor flooding, there was also a strange smell in the shower when we went to use it in the morning, but other than that our stay was wonderful. The location of the hotel is perfect, a 5 minute walk from the Leidseplein, (definately go to boomchiago, a comedy club on the leidseplein) surrounded by hundreds of places to eat, and there is a canal ride point straight across the street. Also only a 2 minute walk to the nearest mac bike outlet where you can rent bikes. Mac Bike were also very helpful and i would reccommend them.

<Content>Fantastic Winter Break My partner and I have recently returned from The Park Hotel Amsterdam.It was a fab trip that we both really enjoyed. We stayed in a room which was not one of the newly renovated ones, that you see advertised on the website but we were both plesently surprised to see how nice it was. (Slightly worried after reading a couple of the others reviews before we went)The bed was huge and very comfy, the room was cleaned every day and it was an impressive size with lots of storage and a flat screen TV.We did not eat in the hotels restaurant but did order room service that was lovely and moderately priced. Alcohol was not expensive, compared to other bars outside the hotel. Although breakfast seemed very expensive at approx 25Euro, needless to say we didn鈥檛 order it.Overall it was a fantastic trip in a great hotel, the staff were very friendly and I couldn鈥檛 say a bad word about our stay at The Park Hotel!

<Content>Be careful I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in Oct 07. While i was there, they were in the middle of renovation, therefore some rooms were renovated while others were not. When booking, I made sure to select a renovated room. Upon arrival, check in was fine... things started going wrong when the man who helped us with our bags took us to a crate elevator to get to our room.... already there, I was thinking that we made a bad decision with this hotel. To get to our renovated room, we had to go through the old hall (which was very old and ugly). When we got to our room, i was in shock. Imagine this... a bed, a night table on one side, a sink on the other side... a toilet and shower next to the sink, only being seperated by glass partitions that don't even reach the ceiling.... no walls. Not a very comfortable situation. I had gone with one of my friends and i was really not comfortable staying in this room with her, but i don't think i would be comfortable staying in that room with anyone at all. We immediately went back to the front desk to speak with the hotel manager. We explained to her exactly why we were unhappy and she kindly upgraded us to a suite that was a lot more spacious with a closed bathroom.... the best part is that we were able to take the regular elevator to that room. Other then that the hotel was fine... the location was excellent. we were able to walk everywhere.

<Content>Not very impressed I organised a trip to Amsterdam for a hen weekend and there were 10 of us ranging from mid 20's to my mum who was just hitting her 60th birthday.We were upgraded to this hotel shortly before our holiday was due and were happy as it was a higher star than we had originally booked.Unfortunately upon arrival the receptionist informed us that we had to put a deposit down of about 50 euros each - can't remember what this was for, something silly like the mini bar or something but even so it was extortionate so I flatly refused, as it would have been a total of about 500 euros and they wanted it from one credit/debit card !!!!!!! In the end they agreed to let us off but baring in mind we landed fairly late it wasn't really a warm welcome.We then went to our allocated rooms and there was a mix up with the smoking and no smoking rooms so we ended up moving rooms before we finally settled down for the night. The upshot of this was that half ended up on one floor and the other half on another floor.We were booked for bed and breakfast and the food was nice but the hotel had a rather stuffy feel about it, the staff seemed to look down their nose at you - not sure if it was because we were a hen party and 1 of the nights we did the hen thing with t shirts etc but we weren't offensive or loud as we knew we weren't in magaluf !!!!!!The hotel is in a good spot, short walk to bars and restaurants and a short tram ride if you want to see the sights associated with Amsterdam, brilliant street entertainers, red light district (which isn't for the faint hearted !!!)Overall we had a brilliant weekend when we were out of the hotel but probably wouldn't book to the park hotel again - oh and we had a view at the back of the hotel looking onto a disused warehouse or something - not pretty at all and lots of pigeons !

<Content>Reasonably priced older hotel At the time when I booked it was the only place open. Right across from the Hardrock cafe, at the ferry dock, the hotel has a reasonable location for both business and pleasure. Internet was expensive and the bar was not very nice. My room was a bit dark and there was a large window which opened onto the street below. Noise would be a problem on lower floors. I came to the hotel by a short tram ride from the central station. Hertz is just down the road and I collected a rental on my departure. Restaurants are all around the hotel and transport is no issue.My room was Smokey and a bit dingy. In need of a refresh.The bed was of an acceptable standard and the pillows were somewhat stiff.I did not dine in the hotel.

<Content>A very pleasant experience We booked our trip through United Vacations and chose the Park Hotel for it's location in the Museum District. The location proved to be excellent. The very high end shopping is a block away as is a tram line. We walked just about everywhere. The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating from beginning to end. There is a bountiful breakfast buffet also. The room was fine though not luxurious, but were very clean. We would definitely recommend the Park Hotel.

<Content>friendly and helpfull staff On arrival we found a friendly and helpfull staff, a nice and clean room with coffee and tea for the exhausted travellers who didn't want to go out immediately, an excellent restaurant in the house. Next morning we woke up in the very center of the town, near Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum, Leidse plein, PC Hooftstraat and Spiegelstraat, but before visiting all this we had a nice breakfast in the restaurant. It is a very good idea of Coop Forum, Sweden, to cooperate with this hotel.

<Content>Great Location I would say that the big plus for this hotel is its location. It is close to the Museum Plein with the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum, and boat trips around the city start just across the road. There are plenty of restaurants nearby including the Hard Rock Cafe just across the canal. The city centre is a short walk away along a pedestrianised street or you can take a tram.The hotel has been partly refurbished and the rooms we staying in were very modern but on the small side. The rooms didn't have a separate bathroom; instead there was a partition with the wash basin, toilet cubicle and shower cubicle.The staff were friendly and helpful, and the bar service was good. It's not the best hotel in Amsterdam but overall it's good value, and I'd probably go there again.

<Content>Great location and friendly staff We were greeted by very smart and friendly staff at reception. The room was very clean and the facilities spot on. We had a double bed in one of the new superior rooms with ensuite facilities. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly throughout our 4 day stay. We dined twice in the restaurant and were very impressed with the food and service. The location of the hotel was perfect, walking distance of all of Amsterdams attractions which we took full advantage of. Although the hotel is close to a busy road and the famous Holland Casino, we were not disturbed at all during the night and slept well. We had breakfast included and there was plenty of choice and it saved rushing around for something to eat early in the day. We plan to go back to Amsterdam soon and would most definitely stay in the Park Hotel again.

<Content>Old run down hotel. Not value for money. Stayed at the park hotel for four nights. Booked a run of the house type of room. The room i stayed in was not the modern lovely looking room featured at the website. My room was rather old and badly needs a revamp. The room definitely does not feel 4stars at all.Location was not as fanastic as i expected from the other reviews i read before my trip. To get to Leidseplein, its a good 10mins walk. Form Leidseplein if you want to go to the dam, its another 20mins walk. Tram stop (no 1,2,5) also does not stop very near the hotel. The tram stop is about 3blocks away. But if you are intending to buy luxury goods, the hotel is very near to the PC Hooftstraat. However, i have to compliment the friendly and polite staff who were always ready to help with a smile.

<Content>It does not look like the web site! The room was a nice size however very tired. The walls were dirty and had gouges in them. The comforter, drapes and furniture were in need of replacement. The first room we got overlooked the backside of other buildings. We then moved to a room facing the canal which was a nice view. The bathroom was updated, clean and other than the tub that was difficult to get in and out of was fine. The breakfast was an average buffet - not worth the steep price. After one breakfast ,we went to pancake houses for a more reasonable and better breakfast. The bar and lounge had been updated and was very attractive. I was told the rooms were scheduled for renovation in December of 2007 - not a minute too soon. The lobby could use a little work as well. For the price and rating as a 4 star hotel it was definitely lacking. With renovation it may improve because of the location but our stay left something to be desired.

<Content>Worst hotel experience ever I was staying here on a business trip and booked it based on the website photos, which all show lovely renovated rooms. When I checked in I was given probably the one of the worst rooms in the hotel. A single bedded room in the un renovated part of the hotel. The bed was sagging in the middle and my bed cover had a cigarette burn. I could not change the rooms and was told I could not cancel them either. I eventually ...after lots of discussions.....got moved to the renovated part of the hotel but on a smoking floor so had to keep the window open to eliminate the smell and it was cold outside! Also the restaraunt is dark and dingy and the breakfast cost a whopping 22 euros each. The head waiter scolded one of the waitresses in full view of the customers. The staff on reception were not helpful and did not seem to realise the customer came first. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone

<Content>Badly designed! The good points of this hotel are the staff (particularly Dennis and Kris in the bar) and the location. The bad points are the badly designed, newly renovated rooms which look great but are not useable or practical. The shower has a huge head, but floods the entire tiled area of the room (there is no bathroom) after 2 mins. The air conditioning didn't work making it cold all the time. The bed is like sleeping on a marshmallow and the duvet is too hot. All the lighting is downward and not powerful so you can't put your make up on properly. You need to ask for a hairdryer, but when you get one, there are no power sockets anywhere near a mirror. You can't switch the lights off from the bed, you need to get out again. It is noisy as the traffic is right outside the window. There is no plug in the basin to keep water in. There is only 1 bedside table, no clock visible during the night and no soap dish. These last 3 things may sound trivial but they caused damage to my new Cartier watch which I am very annoyed about and just emphasises why attention to detail is very important.

<Content>Dissapointed I have just returned from spending 3 nights at the Park Hotel in Amsterdam (4*). As many people have said the location is decent鈥?not too far outside the main attraction, but then again not too close to hear noise etc. We turned up hoping for a lovely modern room as the website suggests but when entering our room it was pretty dated and not at all modern. We also had a few problems with the room. I had to complain about the iron / trouser press that was hanging off the wall, eventually it fell off missing my foot by inches. This wasn鈥檛 helped by the light not working directly above it. The next morning we received a letter to apologise for the inconvenience and everything was fixed but in fact the light was dangling dangerously from the ceiling and the iron / press was in the same condition!! Joke! I nearly fell off my bar stool when I ordered 2 ameretto and cokes when we were charged 20 Euros!! We didn鈥檛 order from there again!! Room service was no good鈥hey state a 24 hour service but that is only for a few items鈥ven then you get charged extra!! Brekkie cost a fortune also鈥?5 Euros for a bit of bacon and some eggs!! No chance!! The bathroom was fine 鈥?no complaints about that鈥hower was quality but then again the curtain and the rail fell down once when I was having a shower!!  The customer service was pretty poor 鈥?upon checking out they mixed my bill up with another persons and they couldn鈥檛 give us our receipts cos she was doing too many things at once and got them muddled up in between answering 4 phone calls!!  This may sound very moany but all is true. Book very carefully and read through all these comments!!!

<Content>Great stay at the Park Hotel! We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Park Hotel and are really pleased. We booked an executive room which was not that much more than a standard. The executive room had the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, mood lighting, a gorgeous rain shower and a nice big TV. We did request a smoking room and expressed concern on check in, but were told that no alternative was available. We decided to smoke by hangng out the window and using clips to keep the curtains shut behind us. From the pile of cigarette and joint buts outside the window, we were clearly not the first guests to have the idea! We did walk past the rooms that had not been updated/refurbished and the hotel website does say that some rooms have retained 'old english style'. It is well worth the upgrade to an executive room. We did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment on this but the staff seemed happy and were helpful when we needed them. We arrived at 10:30 and were told the room would not be ready until 14:00 so we left our cases with the hotel and went exploring - this actually worked well and we ended doing so much more on our first day than we would have had if the room had been ready. The location was good although as my partner insisted on walking to Dam Square (and back!) every day, my feet and legs paid the price. That said, it probably did my hips a favour taking into account the huge number of delcious cakes I ate!!!I would definately return!

<Content>Nice location but the rest was pretty bad... We spent our first anniversary in the Park Hotel in Amsterdam. The location is very good, right in the museum district with easy access to the centre by tram or river boat. But this is were it ends for us.The hotel is obviously under refurbishment with some rooms being ultra modern and others looking like they have not been touched for 20 years! The hotel pictures on this website are very misleading, so you have been warned! They are all from the refurbished part of the hotel and are all from rooms that are bigger then the 'average' superior room. We arrived Thursday evening, was given one of the old rooms (which was ok but very worn), however we were given a smoking room (had requested non smoking) and with people smoking joints next ddor out the window it was not ideal. We asked to change but were told they were full (which was ok), and they told us to ask again thenext morning. The next day we were eventually given a new room (one of the refurbished ones) and they moved our suitcases over to the next room which was nice. The new room was nicely decorated but so small you could not swing a cat! There is no bathroom, only a white see through curtain seperates the bed from the sink. There are stained glassdoors to a seperate shower and toilet, but unless you like being in full view whilst going to the toilet this is not great.The water from the shower leaks out on all sides when using it so make sure you go to the toilet before you have a shower (unless you want wet feet!). On the second day our room was not cleaned until 16:30, even though we had left the room at 11:00 and putting the'please make up my room' sign up. When we returned they were still cleaning all rooms in the hallway on two floors so we had to sit outside and wait. The next morning (on our checkout day) the maid entered our room at 08:30 to clean!! We were still asleep and were shocked when someone came in that early. We could hear them going down the hallway immediately after knocking on all the doors. So if you like your sleep, make sure you use the 'do not disturb sign'!Theyobviously need to communicate better and get their cleaning staff sorted out!! All in all, we were dissapointed after the stay, it was not worth the money and we were not impressed by their service either. We loved Amsterdam, but will definately not be returning to this hotel if we ever go back!

<Content>Comfy at the end of the day I was very happy with my choice of the Park Hotel, especially after finding that the centrum of Amsterdam had more construction than it had in 2005. This location is close to so much,the museums, the park, Leidseplein and Albert Cuypt Market and it has easy access to the rest of the city, the trams and the canal boats are right there. I also felt more relaxed in this area than in the centrum of the city, good for a woman traveling alone. The staff was kind and fun, and the evenings i had having dinners and drinks at the hotel were like being home after the long days being a tourist

<Content>Not a happy customer The executive room we booked was simply like stepping into a MFI show room. poorly put together, bits coming off, bed board was well worn. Noisy next to the room. We duly complained and were upgraded to a suite. The suite was a little bigger, but I would have not been happy to have paid full price for the room. Glasses/tea cups were not cleaned out on a daily basis. When we complained the head housekeeper said that some guests prefer us not to clear. Ordered something of the night menu and only one item of two arrived. In summary, go there, complain, get upgraded,complain,get a few quid knocked off the bill and you will be a happy guest with value for money..

<Content>Very poor response to a theft Stayed at the hotel on a business trip. Was very pleased with the quality of the rooms - in the upgraded section. Stay was spoiled by the theft of my laptop. I stupidly left it behind when I checked out and went direct to a meeting. Three hours later I realised I had left it behind, phoned the hotel, fully expecting them to tell me they had it at reception. They handled the whole thing very badly. Didn't believe me when I said I had left it behind. Made a great show of bringing me back to the room to point out 'Look, no laptop'. Told me they'd take a step right back if I phoned the police. Subsequenly a senior manager phoned and apologised and explained that they can't outright accuse hotel staff..which I understand. But the whole experience was made so much worse by their initial handling of it. The impression given to me was almost like I was attempting some kind of scam. There's clearly a problem there. So I would never stay there again. The laptop was close to worthless, very old model, but I had years of personal stuff on it. I was foolish to leave it behind but I was extremely shocked that it wasn't handed into reception by one of the two staff who had been in my room after I checked out.

<Content>Great location. My favorite while in Amsterdam. I stayed in 3 hotels in 3 days while in Amsterdam from Sept. 3-5 and The Park Hotel was my favorite. I booked a Run-of-House room which means I had no idea where they'd put me. I was pleasently surprised to find my room was overlooking the canal and was one of the larger rooms I stayed in while in Amsterdam. I got a great deal on the hotel website, so I didn't pay full boat. About 89 Euro. Great location for seeing the museums. Friendly staff. Really cool bar attached. Overall I loved the place.

<Content>Hotel from Hell . . . We had booked a 'split-level suite' at an exorbitant, non-refundable rate. A steep staircase connected the upper and lower tiny rooms. There were no reading lights, a non-working TV, no door to the toilet, no carpets, etc. We complained and were switched to a smelly smaller room (same price). As we went to bed later that evening, we discovered that our feet were now wet from vomit next to the bed, vomit which had not been cleaned up by housekeeping. We were switched to a third (clean) room the next morning and given a 25% discount and free breakfast. The breakfast room was dreary and reminiscent of Soviet-era style service and food. To add insult to injury, when we came home we realized that we had been double-billed on our credit card. Our advice: stay away!

<Content>We LOVE the Park We had a beautiful renovated room with a balcony- it was fabulous! Although the room was fairly small, the amenities were great: down comforter, good quality sheets, rain shower! The staff was great and very responsive to all of our needs.The location of the Park is fabulous- seconds from Leidseplein, Museumplein and beautiful Vondel park. Catch a canal cruise right outside the hotel or rent a bicycle from Mac Bike, just steps away. The hotel bar is a pretty lively place, although it closes pretty early. Plenty of nightlife to be found in nearby Leidseplien.

<Content>Well situated but we felt unconfortable The hotel is correct, has a very situation near the city center and in a zone full of restaurants and services for the tourists (bike-hiring, boat tours...). We didn't like at all the way the receptionists treated us. It seemed they were judging people by their look. They asked us for a deposit when they weren't asking other better looking customers for it. Why? If our room didn't even have a minibar! They didn't help much when we asked anything and seemed more interested in other people who should leave tips.However, the staff in the breakfast room were very nice and helpful.The hotel is also divided in two parts, the older one and a reformed part. But the older one seemed to be of high standing, and we felt unconfortable with the differences.The room was correct and there wasn't parking available (at least for us) and we had to park 2 streets far from there for 36 euro a day.

<Content>Great Stay at the Park Hotel My husband and I have just returned from a two night stay at this hotel. We had one of the new refurbished executive double rooms on the 5th floor. While I was a little disappointed with the size of the room (quite small) and the view was to the back, the room itself was extremely clean and contemporary with a very comfortable king size bed. The bathroom was gorgeous with a rain shower (brill). The location was also excellent just five minutes to the Liedlesplain and right beside VondelPark. We didn't eat at the hotel as it was quite expensive relative to what was closeby. The staff were very efficient and couldn't have done enough for us. I would definitely return to this hotel.

<Content>Strange experience The location in the very center is nice, but the hotel has been around for a long time and it shows. Finding ones room is not easy, since the place has sprawled out over time and with construction going on, getting the right room may not be easy. We - I travelled with a partner - both ended up in handicapped rooms, without being told, which had interesting plusses and minuses - the shower was big enough for an entire soccer team, with 2 giant shower heads, but little water pressure. Shaving was a problem, with the mirror at waist hight. The room smelled a bit (maybe a dead mouse?) and the bed was awful - very 'springy'. Service throughout was pretty rustic, if not just plain bad. There are much better choices in this area, although as said, the location is great.

<Content>Lovely Hotel We found this hotel to be wonderful! I couldn't say anything bad about this hotel, they were very accomodating and helpful! We had a slight problem with our internet connection in the room and they practically bent over backwards trying to make it up to us - even though we protested it wasn't neccesary! Lovely, lovely hotel! Beautiful views, easy to find, the staff were so friendly, very clean room and huge bed!! :)

<Content>Very nice stay at the Park Great hotel took shuttle to and from hotel and airport it was handled well on both ends. Executive room, double shower with large rain fall shower heads. Very nice! Excellent bed newly remodeled room with artwork, safe, mini bar. Room looked like pictures on Website. Had to walk up one flight of stairs but it was worth it pretty view even though not toward Leidseplein. Excellent location bought tram tickets and Van Gough tickets from desk clerk very convenient. Breakfast buffet was of good to great quality although expensive. Nice staff, who are very helpful. Would definitely return again.

<Content>good location, we stayed in an executive room on the 6th floor, ( great veiws ) I booked the park hotel for my husbands 50th birthday, the pictures on the web looked great, the location was good, we stayed on the 6th floor in an executive room !! there was nothing executive about it, the king size bed was comfy, but the rest of the room ( it was very clean ) was in great need of an update, the bathroom (lovely thick white towels ) would have been excellent if the mildew had been cleaned from the tiles and a fresh shower curtain had been hung, we had a great weekend all the same,

<Content>Absolutely cracking hotel We stayed for a couple of nights in mid August, arrived expecting a standard double room as booked on line and were provided without asking a free upgrade with a suite on the third floor overlooking the canal, Irish Bar and Hard Rock cafe - this was a recently refurbished room, it would be difficult to imagine a nicer room with a better view , absolutely outstanding.Superb location - within walking distance of Vondel Park, the Museums, Leidseplein, and try the PC Hoofstraat about 100 away for the designer shops.The large room was superb - huge, comfortable queen bed with flat screen TV at your feet. Good mini bar, although I am always a little scared to sample the treats so could not comment on the cost. A superb bathroom of black ganite with fantastic shower, bath, excellent array of soaps, shampoo etc.The room was very stylish, with pretty fresh flowers.Would I recommend - certainly

<Content>Excellent Hotel and Staff Hi - I have just returned from a trip to Holland for a week. It was my hysband, myself and 2 boys under 12 years. We had a fabulous time. We stayed at the Park Hotel on Friday and Saturday evening and this was just great. The staff where so pleasant and helpful and the hotel was perfect. The rooms where spacious enough and the bathrooms where immaculate. Even though it is situated on the main road it was a relaxing hotel to be in. I'ts about a 15 minute walk to Dam Square and only minutes to lots of other shops, gallaries and canal trips. Loads of good restaurants, bars and coffee shops within minutes from the hotel. I would definately recommend this hotel and recommend anyone to visit Holland it was fab.

<Content>Excellent Everything We chose this hotel from a website agency, because we liked a review that we read about it, which called it their 'favourite hotel in Amsterdam'. Well, as it's the only hotel we have stayed at in Amsterdam, we cannot compare it, but can only say that we thanked our lucky stars that we chose to go there.The situation was PERFECT. A few minutes from trams going to everywhere, a few minutes walk to the museums and the famous park, overlooking a canal, where the passenger boats stopped and a few minutes walk to restaurants and the shopping centre.The hotel itself was spacious and comfortable and offered a 'banquet' for breakfast every morning. The staff were very friendly, kind and most helpful about anything that we asked for or about.. We recommend this hotel most strongly, for anyone who wants a happy comfortable visit to Amsterdam.

<Content>Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Park Hotel We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Park Hotel. My wife and I had one of the superior rooms whilst 2 of our sons shared one of the classic rooms. Both were more than adequately equipped for our stay.The superior rooms are recently refurbished and include all the usual amenities (the air conditioning was particularly useful as the weather was very warm). Whilst a bath would have been nice, the open plan shower was superb. The classic room was less modern but bigger and very comfortable.Despite its' proximity to the Leidesplein the hotel is surprisingly quiet. Less than 5 minutes walk from the Museum quarter and adjacent to both Vondel Park and the No's 2  5 tram line the Park is ideally positioned.Staff are friendly and extremely helpful and we are happy to recommend this hotel.Didn't sample the restaurant fayre although the breakfast was comprehensive in its' selection. Whilst there are more luxurious hotels in Amsterdam, the online price represented extremely good value; we will be returning later this year

<Content>Avoid it We stayed at this hotel for one night. It was terrible, i never thought that 4star could provide such service.The room was too small and tiny, it was very very cold. Only one good thing that we didnt spend much time in the room.The room price was 70 euro per night, but when we were leaving they blocked at my credit card 200 euro plus that sum i payed cash. The staff was unfriendly, so we never come back to this hotel. I think its star rating must be as a 2* hotel

<Content>Enjoyable stay at The Park We booked a 'Run of the House' Double room via reserveahotelonline.com and managed to get a very good deal including breakfast.On arrival, we were informed that they had a shortage of twin rooms (which we had been allocated) and were offered a newly refurbished Superior Room instead, which was very nice. The only downside was that the room wasn't ready and, despite being told at 12 noon that it would be ready by 3pm, it was in fact not available till 4.30pm, which was a little irritating as we had wanted to change before heading off to explore Amsterdam. However, the hotel provided some free drinks in the bar by way of compensation.The Park provides a good location from which to explore the city, convenient for the trams, canal bus etc and is within easy walking distance (5 mins) of many of the main museums and galleries.Overall, a good place to stay.

<Content>City Gem After reading other comments at the travel agents we decided to book the Park Hotel in Amsterdam. Not having stayed in Amsterdam before we did not know what standard to expect.All I can say is the Park Hotel was excellent with friendly staff, spotless accomodation and beautiful food. The staff were happy to book tickets for us for any excursions we wanted and provided us with any directions when asked in a extremely helpful manner.I would recommend the Park Hotel to anyone. Excellent overall and in a great location.We hope to return ourselves next spring.A  E M

<Content>I give this hotel 9/10! My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights this summer. We were VERY happy with this hotel! I think the reason for our great price is because the interior of the hotel is being renovated and some floors are under construction. The Good:- Nice location, not *too* touristy. Within walking distance of museums in one direction and tons of restaurants/shopping in th other direction. Also very close to several Tram lines in case you need to get to a different part of the city.- Room was very modern looking, very clean, and very comfortable. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. - The shower is AMAZING. Our room had of those downpour shower heads AND another shower head to choose from. - The hotel staff is very helpful and accomodating. We were looking for a nice Restaurant to visit one night and asked at the front desk for ideas. She gave us several suggestions, then called the restaurant of our choice to make a reservation, and gave us a map of how to get there. - The hotel restaurant, called The Inn At The Park is very tasty and affordable! The Bad: (not much was bad, really!)- Our room was on the backside of the hotel, so we didn't have the greatest of views out our window.- There is not much privacy from the bathroom  shower. They are very much a part of the room, but behind this modern looking frosted glass. A little embarassing if you're using the restroom  there's people in your room! : )Overall I would give this hotel 9/10!

<Content>Not that impressed After having read through various reviews I decided that The Park Hotel looked a fairly decent option for the two nights that I was to be in Amsterdam. Having booked through Expedia, when a fourth member was to join our party I phoned them to upgrade one of the rooms from a single to a double. They told me there would be a charge of 拢111.00 to which I was shocked and phoned the Hotel directly who said that there would be no problem sorting out an upgrade once we arrive.When we arrived at the Hotel ( there are now 4 adults in our group ) I mentioned that I had spoken earlier to someone about the upgrade which they confirmed. Two of our party were going to share a room ( the double ) whilst myself and another colleague decided that we would spend a little extra and upgrade to a Superior room. This however seemed a little to much for the receptionist to cope with and after calling her manager for help they both struggled with the computer screen in front of them and finally turned round and said that we would all be upgraded to a double room! Not what we requested. ( and we were to be charged...no free upgrade here, not that we were looking for it ) Rather than confuse them any more I just agreed and said that I would pay the upgrade fee for all the rooms on departing. As most people feel after arriving by plane and then travelling by Taxi all you want to do is retire to the room, drop off the bags and venture out!Well the first night was hell, the double room that I had been given ( no. 153 ) was the noisiest Hotel room that I have ever stayed in. The heating pipes clattered and banged all night, there was one thick pipe that must have been supplying the whole hotel through my room, there was no heating control for the room and with the window open the noise was a little too much to sleep. In addition to this I think I was located next to the service elevator as ever few minutes there was a loud electrical hum that vibrated through the pillow.Well after no sleep and seeing that the clock said 6:30am I decided to have another go at upgrading to a Superior room. Got dressed and ventured downstairs, this time there was a different face at the reception and this face was able to give me what I had originally asked for. zzz...Better room, newly decorated and had a minibar ( ah, cold water! ) after getting up and out for a lovely walk around the Leidseplein Square area I started to itch....yes I had been bitten three times on the left shoulder and upper arm by flees. I cant say whether it was room 153 where I had initially been put or the new one ( 440 ) but it did annoy me as for the rest of the day all I was doing was itching.When it came to checking out we were all charged for the upgrades and myself I was charged twice also charged 鈧?4 for a breakfast I hadn't had and 鈧?6.50 for three bottles of water and a tube of Pringles. There was no deductions offered from the bill not that I was asking and I was just glad to get out of the place to be honest, I'm sure if it had been a different trip on a different day in a different room things would have been completely normal...

<Content>Well Recommended - Excellent! Stayed at Park Hotel, Amsterdam for 2 nights and cannot fault either the hotel or the staff in the slightest. Slightly outside the busy centre of Amsterdam but for us the location was superb being close to the Museumplein and also the canal boat terminus so it was extremely easy to get about. Facilities were well up to standard, the rooms and public areas were very clean, the breakfast choice and food quality were excellent and every member of staff was extremely friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble. This is one hotel I would recommend without hesitation.

<Content>One word sums up our stay at the Park Hotel - Excellent We stayed at the Park Hotel in Amsterdam for a short break in June and found the staff very friendly and extremely helpful. Our room was lovely and the breakfasts' to die for. We also ate at the Brasserie and in the Restaurant and the standard of food and service was excellent. We would like to revisit Amsterdam some day and would come back to this hotel, we highly recommend it!

<Content>Generally good (but not in a Junior Suite) I've stayed at the Park a number of times and it has improved greatly over the years and is certainly one of my favourite mid-budget hotels in the city.Its location near the Leidseplein makes it a great location for the museums and pubs, jazz bars and restaurants (so you can walk back to the hotel at night) and close to the tram network for quick and cheap journeys to the rest of the city.The hotel is generally good, everything works well and it is clean and well maintained.BUT... due to having to make a late booking I ordered a 鈥楯unior Suite鈥?which was disappointing. The room was large but due to having one tiny window in the corner it was dark and the layout made it look half built. The bathroom was a good size but VERY dark (making shaving a very difficult matter). There were three small chairs where there should have been a settee, a good bed but in a really strange place, a lack of sockets meaning you have to put the kettle on a little bed-side shelf, a TV which you have to turn around without knocking over and an overall lack of space. In fact they have somehow managed to take a decent size room and made it feel very cramped.The problem is that when the hotel was being renovated they expanded into other buildings. This room was not designed, it just happened to be the best they could do with the available space and they made a very bad job of it. Rather than classing it as a double (which would have been fine) they tried to do some clever marketing and make out this was a superior room. I feel a little ripped-off.

<Content>overall, a very nice hotel Our stay at the Park Hotel was quite enjoyable. Our baggage was unfortunately lost by the airline, but the hotel staff was so accommodating and eager to help us in any way. The staff at this hotel was so incredibly friendly and helpful. I went to the desk to purchase some internet time, and they gave it to me free of charge for our trouble (and it wasn't even their fault!). The hotel has a fabulous large breakfast buffet...not simply the traditional continental style. The lounge is very cozy and modern with a simple but tasty menu, and the restaurant has fabulous gourmet food. The hotel couldn't be in a better location...right on the canal, a 5 minute walk from streets and streets of amazing restaurants. On one side of the street is Vondel Park, on the other side the Hard Rock Cafe. You are so close to all of the famous museums, great shopping, and restaurants. Our room was just okay (kind of like a run-down Sheraton), but I understand the hotel is undergoing rennovations. Although a bit older, the room was very clean and the bathroom was newer. We would definitely be willing to stay here again.

<Content>great hotel I received a letter asking for a read and write reviews on the above hotel. I always stay at the Hotel when in Amsterdam. It is located in the center of town and easy to get around to see different things. It has excellent meals and a generious breakfast. I recommend it to all my friend (both of them). Adam

<Content>Excellent Location! This was a fab hotel in a great location. Staff were very friendly and helpful on the whole. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We were in the heart of great places to eat and drink. If you like clubbing forget Jimmy Woo's- door staff had the biggest attitude ever- head straight to La Rumba a few min away. The music is great and the atmosphere v chilled. Best thing is we stayed til 5am and strolled over to our hotel in a matter of mins. The Hard Rock Cafe near the hotel is nice but watch out for the mice! The tram to Centraal Stn and the like is minutes away too. A great weekend and a great place to stay!

<Content>A nice spot Right at the edge of Vondel park, next to the Rijk's and very close to the end of the major shopping street this is a good place to stay. Highly recommend getting a bike for the entirity of your stay. You'll still get lost in the city, but you'll be able to cover more ground and find your way a lot quicker on a bike. Staff was helpful when I had issues. Room was clean and nice, great view with a balcony in mine. Front desk sells museum tickets which kept me from standing in two ques. Reasonable shuttle service to the airport, and reasonable internet fees. Very much enjoyed staying here, but really wish I had rented that bike for longer.

<Content>Not quite up to scratch I booked a triple room at the Park Hotel in Amsterdam, for myself, my husband and our 7-year-old son. On arrival we were shown a smallish double/twin room with an extra put-you-up squeezed in. Therewas no alternative room to be had, so furniture was removed to enableus to move around the room, and we were given free drinks. Some of the staff were delightful, very friendly (in particular the maitre d'in the restaurant. Others, however, were unhelpful (bar staff very snappy, even when not busy) and on one morning all of our breakfast things were cleared away after we had had some cereal, while we were at the buffet choosing eggs  bacon - cutlery, half-drunk juice, fullcoffee pots - the lot, even though we clearly hadn't finished eating!Two days into our 4-day stay, we returned to our room after breakfastto find that Housekeeping were removing one of our beds 'to make the twin beds the same size'! We hadn't requested this, and were rather put out to find three people moving all of our things in order to getthe bed out. Over all the hotel appears tired, ceiling tiles are stained and broken, the room was very dusty and the bath seal was black with mould. We had a great stay - lovely weather in Amsterdam and enjoyed ourselves, but we would not recommend this hotel... a 3-star, definitely not a 4-star place.

<Content>Pleasant Experience Overall, a pleasant experience. The hotel is in a great location, and the personnel was very helpful. We did have a bit of a problem as an American learning the phone system, though. The restaurant within was excellent, and again, in a very good location to shopping, eating, etc. I would definitely stay there again.Ray O'Brien

<Content>An excellent place to stay We stayed for three nights at the Park Hotel and found it to be really good. The staff were friendly, efficient, knowledgeable and helpful. The room was generally clean and comfortable. We asked for extra toiletries which they swiftly provided without fuss. We were very pleased with the location (next to Vondelpark), away from the touristy part but within walking distance of key attractions. It is also serviced by a number of tram routes. Our room was on the first floor (non-smoking) facing the street but we didn't really hear the traffic. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant ourselves but met people who had and they very much recommended it, commenting particularly upon the friendly staff. I would only have two small points of quibble. The first was the slight whiff of cigarette smoke that we detected when settling down for the night. However, it was very slight and given some of the harsher smells coming from the Smartshops of Amsterdam, we can hardly complain! The second would be that the tea cups in our room were stained on the outside and had not been given a good wash. We could have asked for replacement cups but didn't really need them so didn't ask. All in all, a really good hotel that I would definitely stay at again.

<Content>Park? Large Hotel with all the amenities across from Vondel Park. Vondel Park was closed  under construction. Knowledgeable desk clerks.Quiet. Canal cruise boats across the street. Museumplein nearby. 10 minute tram ride from the Dam. A bit out of the way, so not that congested. But that's what we liked about it. There are other hotels closer to town center.

<Content>great location Stayed three nights - superior suite, standard size room, fantastic bed, amazing shower (couldn't figure how to work mood lightening). Location is very good near a lot of restaurants, shops, museum and park. Paid 215 euro approx per night - Amsterdam is expensive found it difficult to get a better deal on websites for this kind of standard hotel. Also found it very easy to arrive from airport to hotel - probably much quicker than taxi/shuttle bus. Check hotel website for direction.

<Content>Got Euros Read On In planning a 5 day trip to Amsterdam, our main hotel could only accomdate us for 4 nights, so out of last minute planning we could find a room at the Park Hotel. Well got a nice room: very modern, sleek, and comfortable. And then the troubles began:  1). Temperature: the room became very cold and there was no way to turn up the heat. So, an hour later, the staff provided us with a space heater that warmed the room.2). Leaky shower: the shower had a glass partition from the toilet that let water leak onto the floor. We had to use 5-6 towels to mop up the mess. 3). Sewer Stench: for some reason, we notice a foulstench in the bathroom that began in the morning. Did not dare determine if it was coming from the toilet or shower. In summary, this was not what we expected for the $300 price.

<Content>I agree with other reviews but I thought it to be rather "Pricey" I agree with other reviews that the Staff and service was quite accommodating, and the location really is second to none for an Amsterdam visit.And yes they are in the process of renovating, however my room was really quite Threadbare and worn with a view of the back alley...all for $275.00 per night for 2 nights....Not quite value for money, it is not so much the amount but what you receive in return...And one would expect more than a stiff single bed, one pillow and 2 towels鈥?br/>But then location, location, location!!

<Content>Well Located and Priced At the outset, please note that I stayed in a basic room. Please keep that in mind when evaluating my description of my guest room.The staff at this hotel was friendly, which always sets a good initial tone. It is located close to Vondelpark, the Rijkmuseum and the Van Gogh museum. For some reason, I was surprised to smell pot walking to my guest room but, hey, its Amsterdam. The ominous warning on my door to double lock and check staff credentials through the peep-hole made me a little nervous. However, I encountered no trouble while at the hotel.My room was small. Not the smallest of European rooms, but pretty close. It was fitted with a single bed that was pretty comfortable. The bathroom was adequate; not luxurious but clean. The room had a safe and, all in all, met all basic needs.If you are looking for a cheap and clean place to stay, a basic room at the Park will fit the bill. You will not be spending too much time in it anyway.

<Content>fabulous location the accomodations themselves were not fabulous, or even great, but i gave the hotel an above average because of the location. housekeeping is horrible! they would leave our dirty glasses, and not give us new ones. our sheets were not changed until we specifically asked and then they were dirty (we stayed 5 days). the hotel is quite shabby and dated in it's appearance. the shower has a curtain that flies onto you as you shower (great pressure though). when we first arrived it was very warm as the sun came directly into the room, but there was no air conditioning to cool it off. once the sun went down, and we kept the shades drawn while out of the room, it stayed cool. but...it is right near the museums, parks, a canal, and leidseplein. the location really is perfect. we walked to heineken, rijks, van gogh, vondel park and shopping. the staff was nice and sent letters after each call to them. they did arrange for us to go to keukenhof gardens with a local tour bus. i would stay here again for the location, but i wish they would consider updating the bedding, curtains, funriture, and shower curtain.

<Content>Beautiful Place to Stay Great place to stay! Extremely helpful and professional Hotel Staff, and the executive room overlooking the Canal was very beautiful and spacious. Very clean bathroom with great rice milk shampoo. Very close walk to all major museums and restaurants. I highly recommend the Arans Irish Pub conveniently situated across the street, for their delicious bar-b-cue ribs, and the Pancake House for the tasty Canadian ham pancake for breakfast. If you love cats, a visit to the Kat Kabinet Museum is a once in a lifetime experience, with six resident cats!

<Content>Great location at the Park Hotel The hotel is well appointed and just a short tram ride from the centre of Amsterdam. We stayed for 2 nights in a superior room , which was very comfortable. Our room overlooked the canal. The staff were very friendly and helpful and spoke many languages. Apart from a slight problem booking the airport transfer because the receptionist was new, they were usually very efficient.The hotel is situated near the Van Gogh museum and the Heineken experience. It is next to Vondelpark( which was closed at the time of our visit).The only meal we had was breakfast and it was excellent; catering for most tastes.I cannot comment as to value for money because I won this short break in a competition, so for us it was excellent value!

<Content>Perfection at the Park Hotel A one night stay for four booked through Superbreak which included overnight PO ferry from Hull. A recommended experience to anyone who has not used this service as it included free car parking at the docks which is a bonus that you normally don't get at an airport! The hotel we selected was the Park hotel in Amsterdam we found the service and hospitality here second to none. All the staff encountered spoke perfect english and were justly proud of their hotel. We selected the standard 30 Euro evening meal which turned out to be a superb 7 course banquet which is changed at monthly intervals. The hotel is situated by a canal and is close to a waterbus stop, Most of the city's attractions are within walking distance. We certainly would stay here again when in Amsterdam.Watch out for pedal cycles that come from all angles !

<Content>very nice stay We took our canadian friends to Amsterdam for a short 2 days stay. Frankly, I was a bit worried given the previous reviews, but we got an unbeatable rate on internet, breakfast included and we decided to try it, since the location is great. Problem at check-in : no parking was available but we were directed to a nearby public park. Expensive but secured. Clean rooms, fair size with a nice view on the canal. A bit noisy since there was no double glazed windows. Nice and clean bathroom. Rich breakfast. Overall, we had a very nice stay. We would definitely go back.

<Content>Going Dutch. This is a well managed and stylish hotel very close to the three cultural landmarks of the Van Goch Museum, Rijksmuseum and the world famous Concertgebouw. Canal tours start just over the road and there are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby.We were particularly impressed by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, not only as to the proactive provision of what's on information but providing and telephoning to reserve tickets etc. Outside France we tend to be dismissive of hotel food and look for the delightful little restaurant nearby. But fortunately on ourlast night we dined in the hotel and had a reasonably priced and exquisitemeal served by friendly and humorous staff. I assumed the chef was French but was told he was a Dutchman -another example of this nation's astounding talents.Around the corner in the Concert Hall direction is a street of luxury shops, to be enjoyed or avoided according to your perspective.The main centre is about a half hour walk away though for the less active there is a tram route nearby- I seem to remember it was no 5- but don't worry, the staff will advise and sort things out for you. We very much enjoyed our stay at the hub of this most vibrant city.

<Content>Our Amsterdam mini break 14/03/07 The Park Hotel Amsterdam is an excellent place to stay only 10 minutes from central station by tram. The building is clean rooms are spacious with unsuite ,Televison, phone also tea and coffee making facilites.It is situated along the cannal with tour boats directly facing the hotel. You can travel to the city center by canal or tram. The hotel staff are excellent , it's freindly quiet and the staff will help in any way so your stay will be an enjoyable one. I would highly recommend this hotel and I will deffinetly stay at this hotel again. The location is right for walking to the town centre 15-20 minutes away. We have stayed in many hotels throughout europe but this hotel is up there with the best of them.Joe and Eileen Belfast, Northern Ireland.

<Content>warm,welcoming  I booked the long weekend via a shortbreak website and had no contact with the hotel until our arrival,but our check-in was no problem and welcoming.It was snowing outside and very cold but the hotel and room were always beautifully warm.Our room,which faced the canal and an inner ring road,was clean comfortable and well appointed.There was no problem with traffic noise,though after a full day walking the stunning city we were always ready for bed.Breakfast was a buffet with vast choice of both hot and cold food.Situated in the museum district the whole of the city is within walking distence and the particually lively area around the holland casino is great in the evening.We never used the hotel restaurant due to the huge choice in the city.Things we enjoyed -The atmospheric bars and restaurants,The Boom Chicargo Comedy Club(all in English),Anne Franks House,The canal boat ride and don't miss the wild Ring Necked parakeets in the park adjacent to the hotel.

<Content>Relaxing, friendly all round We loved our 3 days away in amsterdam. My boyfriend (33) and I (26) arrived at the hotel at 10am where they were extremely helpful and allowed us into our room 4hours early. This was great after such an early start. However we found ourselfs in a lovely, clean newly furnished bathroom TWIN ROOM!! A romantic break in separate beds was not what we had planned. We went down to reception to discuss this but they explained we only ask but they can not guarantee??!! I will be complaining to our travel company. They did however send a member of housekeeping up to our room to place the beds together and have double sheets placed on the bed. The breakfast was lovely!!! Complete choice, you couldn't ask for anything more. Cereal, cooked breakfast (eggs cooked to your liking, fried, boiled, poached), fresh fruit, croissants, bread and jam, tea coffee - all varieties. The waiting staff couldn't be more helpful. Location was fantastic. We walked everywhere. Around the cornor from Leider Square which is busy, loads of different restaurants, bars, coffee shops etc. We walked to the dam square, red light district which were all easily accessible, van gogh museums. The canal boat trip was beautiful just like to city its self.From the airport it only costs 拢1.50 for the 20mins journey by intercity double decker train, fantastic!! We will definitely go back!!!

<Content>Excellent Me and 7 friends stayed at this hotel over New Year. I had some reservations about the hotel but was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is in an excellent location for exploring Amsterdam. The tram line goes right outside but most of the sights are within walking distance. We stayed in 4 of the hotels standard rooms, although they could do with some modernisation they were clean and comfortable if not a little small. The hotel has a nice bar for pre dinner drinks and i would recommend the Irish Bar over the road for breakfast! All in all a great city to visit especially for New Year

<Content>excellent service We stayed at the Park Hotel over the new Year . We had mixed reservations as we had read different reviews on this website. We were very pleasantly surprised. The room was excelent and very clean.We also felt that the staff throughout the hotel were more than helpful. We asked for additional pillows and they appeared like magic.Also on New Years evening we popped into the hotel bar for a quick drink and was then offered complimentary champagne and canapes.I have stayed at the Renaissance and the Radisson in Amsterdam and the Park Hotel was far superior.

<Content>Great hotel! My husband and I stayed here in December 06 for 5 days. Given the mixed reviews this place has had over the months, we were a bit worried but booked it as the location of the hotel is universally agreed to be great. We need not have worried, our experience of this hotel was great! Reception staff were really helpful as were all other staff we met. Our room (an executive room on the 4th floor facing the front) was lovely - nothing out of the ordinary but with everything you would expect (tea/coffee, safe, iron, hairdryer etc). The room was of a reasonable size with a couple of chairs and a large comfy bed. The bathroom again was as you would expect from a good hotel: clean with a good shower, nice toiletries etc. The front facing rooms have a small balcony and a great view. The hotel bar is nice, with subtle lighting and again with great staff. Breakfast however is really expensive (we were on a room only deal), and while its a good spread, its just not worth the money - go over the road to the Aran Irish pub and get a better breakfast for a lot less money. From this hotel you are only a short walk to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum - book tickets online before you go to avoid the queues. Both are excellent. We loved it here and will be going back.

<Content>Good experience Apart from the general quality of the hotel, responsiveness of management has been excellent: after the first night I complained about the noise, and I was immediately upgraded to a suite on the last floor, with apologies. It is rare to find a hotel that really cares about customers.You really feel supported in this hotel: they call for your taxi; they inform you of the status of your bill; in general, there's a good feeling about the place.

<Content>New rooms are great for late 20's / early 30's couples I decided to take my girlffriend away for a short break, and was pleasantly suprised by the efficency, polietness and general cleanliness of the hotel - after reading some other reviews I was expecting the worse.We were given one of the new rooms to try out - and I must say it was very stylishly laid out with a modern walk in bathroom (although privacy in the toilet was debatable between those sharing the room - but as it was my girlfriend it was fine), and comfy double bed.The noise of the trams outside can be heard early in the morning, but it wasnt bad enough to ruin our lay ins at all.also the plasma screen was nice with a good choice of channels to view (watch out if your taking kids as some of the channels show free uncensored harcore porn 24/7).The location is superb - and from Amsterdam central station its about 17 euros in a cab, but the hotel is right by the best of three squares with loads to see and do - the canel trip is directly opposite.Overall I really cannot fault this hotel from my short stay and would recommend anyone looking to treat that someone special to something a bit classier than a night in a travel lodge to definetly give this hotel and Amsterdam (its alot more than pot heads and porn) a go.

<Content>Nice Gallery I spent some time with my family at the park hotel. The hotel is beautiful and the service is very good. The location is perfect to discover Amsterdam. The breakfast is continental and very tasty. My little daughter was playing with the staff the whole day. They really took the time to care about children. Great. The rooms are very elegant. The charming atmosphere of the historic building makes a stay very pleasant.

<Content>Always excellent We have stayed here numerous times over the past ten years, and it is always excellent. The staff personnel are friendly, and the location couldn't be better. The classic and executive rooms are great, and the included breakfast buffet is always good with a nice variety of food. It couldn't be a better location as it is between the Rijkmuseum and the Van Gogh and only a few minutes' walk from the heart of the city, tourist attractions, cafes and restaurants, and shopping. We look forward to returning in January.

<Content>Good but overpriced I stayed for 3 days. Good but overpriced hotel. Very good breakfast and breakfast room. Service staff not so friendly. The rooms are small. Some of them good some others disappointing. A lot of noise. In some rooms the WC are renewed in some others not. Good location.

<Content>Fascinating hotel We saw all the negative reviews but we were staying there for a conference so had no choice. The key points are as follows -  - Pros - Fantastic service from the front desk, restaurant staff, the doorman and even the cleaners. Everyone amazingly friendly and willing to helpRestaurant was great. Breakfast (included in rate) was extremely generous.We had a problem with our tv, and the speed of service from the front desk and engineer was commendableThe bathrooms seemed recently refurbished (over last couple years) so were quite comfortable.Location was unbeatable. Close to up-market shops, park, trams, cool restaurants (especially the Indonesian one at street level) and night-life.- Cons - All rooms were 'tired'. From the lobby, to the restaurant, bar and actual bedroom. Carpets ripped and stained. Furniture very shabby. There is no way this could be considered a 4 star on this planet. And this was after we were upgraded (another trick?) to their Executive suite/floor.Weak back office systems. Like many other reviewers, we had our reservation confused. While we were (trying to?) check in, next to us, a US hip-hop group (Dilated Peoples?) was struggling to get their reservation sorted. Even the final bill had a couple errors plus a surprise tax. Look over your paperwork carefully. ---Overall, this was a decent hotel in a fantastic location. The pros definitely outweigh the cons. These guys are trying hard. But the hotel owners are obviously reluctant to invest in some refurbishment. Hopefully if they understand the impact that poor reviews have on their bottom-line, commonsense will prevail.

<Content>Dreadful This is probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. It was drab, dreary and depressing. The bedroom was a disgrace. It looked as if it had been furnished from a clearance sale, right down to the old wooden wardrobe with a massive total of six hangers for two people. Even the pot plant had lost the will to live. The bathroom fittings were old and did not match, and the bath was marked with cigarette stains. Lovely! The room was accessed by what appeared to be an old service elevator which, when it was working, went as high as the fourth floor. We were on the fifth.On the one occasion we tried to eat in the hotel, we gave up after being ignored by the serving staff, even though there were almost as many of them as there were customers.A truly miserable experience altogether.

<Content>Great location I have just got back from my first visit to Amsterdam. What a great city! The Park Hotel is within walking distance of all of the major attractions (as long as you are reasonably fit). We had a few nights out on the town and walked back to the hotel in about 20 - 30 minutes. We got lost a few times but everyone seemed very friendly and keen to help the lost tourist!I had read some of the other reviews about this hotel before I booked it. Some were quite negative but as far as hotels in European cities go I think this one is great. The staff were very polite and friendly. Our room was clean and had a great bathroom with a power shower. The bed did have a bit of a dip in the middle but after a few nights on the town can't say I noticed anymore.....! You wouldn't get anything this good in London at this price.There are lots of restaurants and bars close to the Hotel and there are trams nearby. We really enjoyed our stay.Soon after we arrived in Amsterdam we saw a walking tour of the red light district mentioned in a free magazine. It told us to meet the guide outside the Victoria Hotel across from Central Station at 8pm. We went along last Friday and it was great. The guide was excellent and gave some history of the area. We went down narrow alleys that we wouldn't have dared to without a guide! I would highly recommend the tour for anyone, particularly women who might otherwise feel uncomfortable going in to the red light district.

<Content>Fab Hotel Stayed here for 1 night on 30th September 2006. Hotel staff were very friendly and although rooms were quite small they were clean and had everything you need. Bathrooms are gorgeous with fab power shower. Trams run until about 12.30 so you may experience a little noise outside but apart from that everything was great. If you are taking kids please hide the remote control.....i know its amsterdam but the 'adult movies' are the norm over there. Location was fantastic - walking distance to all atttractions.

<Content>A fab Hotel We arrived back today and I wouldn't hesitate in using this Hotel again. The location is excellent right next to the Vondel Park, canal cruises and Hard Rock Cafe. We went with friends and two teenagers and we all had a great time. It was also in a more upmarket location but close enough to walk to seedier areas. The staff are very friendly from the Reception to the cleaners, we loved Amsterdam.

<Content>Where did they get their 4 stars? Arrived in morning having left home at 3.00 a.m. to find room not ready for us. Receptionist utterly unhelpful. Kicked our heels for about an hour, wasting time that should have been spent at the RAI, before chambermaids finished cleaning the room. Tiny room and not clean. Three sachets of decaffeinated coffee, one proper stuff! Not good after a 3.00 a.m. start. Food good although breakfast very expensive. How can a hotel with such small rooms and surly reception staff possibly be 4 star?

<Content>Great hotel and location We had one night here in March 2005. We paid about 拢55 each at the time of booking and on arrival, we upgraded to a Club room at half the normal upgrade price. The room was small, but couldn't be faulted. The facilities were great.Because of a fire at the nearby Rijksmuseum, we were advised to stay inside the room with the windows closed as they thought the smoke might have been toxic. Because of this, we decided to order room service, which was a little pricey, but very good.The following morning, we went down to breakfast, which was included in the price of the room. We took our time over breakfast, which was very good and included a large selection of cereals, breads, fruit etc. As the time approached for the staff to stop serving breakfast, one of the staff came round to everyone in the restaurant and told us that they were about to clear the food away. They said that if we wanted any more breakfast, we should take it then. That's never happened in any of the other hotels I've stayed in, the staff have just cleared the food away.Park Hotel is in a great location. Just across the road is one of the canal boat tours, the tram stop to Centraal Station isn't too far away, Vondelpark is just at the side of the hotel. After the canal cruise, we walked towards Dam Square and Centraal Station, had lunch and then took the tram back to the other side of the park and walked through the park and back to the hotel.

<Content>The internet 'good value' rooms are lousy I had a bad experience cause our room had a communication door with the room nextdoor and our neighbours spent their time doin strange noises, banging the door and smoking dope which almos intoxicated us,,,Awful. The hotel is well placed, but the rooms and the beds need an updating. The staff was correct but I didn't like being secured 115 euros from my credit card for 'possible' expenses. It's a mistrusting policy.

<Content>An overpriced disappointment! Booked this hotel via Continental. Stayed two nights in June 2006. Was very disappointed to find they had dropped the Le Meridien brand, but wonder if it wasn't the other way around! I paid 鈧?169 per night (over $200/night) for a room with two skinny single beds. Unfortunately Amsterdam in June is well overbooked and didn't have much choice. Needless to say, that price didn't include breakfast. Also housekeeping NEVER changed my towels/sheets despite repeated requests at the front desk. The desk also forgot about my wakeup call which I requested in person. The street noise was also very loud until the wee hours and they wouldn't let me smoke in the room! The staff seems to have given up on making this place hospitable. So why bother staying here? Until this place is overhauled, look elsewhere. Two stars at best...

<Content>Disappointing Several problems found on the hotel (we stayed in room 451 facing the roof of the hotel):- We booked the hotel from Portugal through a travel agency. There was no info about diferent rooms, no info about diferent prices or even no info about diferent features of the rooms.- At check in they gave us a, what they called, standard room, that means it has no air conditioned, no locker and they are tiny rooms.- We complaint at the reception and it was told us that we could have a, what they called, executive room for an extra 50 鈧? Or else we had to stick with our tiny, dusty, hot room.- We took a look at the new room... it doesn't worth the 50鈧?per nigth, but what the hell, we took it.- The beds were terribly uncomfortable. One of them had a big whole where should be the mattress.- They left dirty towels in the bathroom in 3 diferent days. In the first day we complaint, but nothing was done.- On the last day, even a ripped towel was left on the bathroom- The room was extremely dusty.- The shower switcher was broken and always fawlling off.- The eyespy on the door was covered with paper left there by previous guests. There was a warning on the door that says always look through the eyespy and be sure when you open the door. The room service is always confirmed by phone. This doesn't give the guests any security warranty.- In the breakfast when it is near the closing time for the breakfast buffet the waiters make some ultimatums to the guests: The buffet is going to close in 10 minutes. If you want anything else you have to go there now and take it from the buffet.- We found in 2 or 3 days all the dirty towels from the rooms through out the corridors on floor. No wonder if they get dirty....- In the breakfast buffet, on the last day, the ice used to keep the fruit cold started melting e falled on the floor. The maintenance was called right away. No problem until here. The problem starts when some of the waiters start trying to dry the floor with the table towels.Has a conclusion:If i was expecting to stay in a youth hostel all this things were minor problems. But we stayed at a 4 star hotel, on a called executive room. From my point of view this is unacceptable. I agree with one of the reviews here, the hotel deserves a 2 star at the most. The location of the hotel isn't everything. The city has very good public transportation. It is probably a better choice to stay in a hotel outside the city center and use the tram and other public transportation.

<Content>disappointed in the park Booked this hotel as a surprise to take my boyfriend away for his birthday but on arrival was disappointed. Had booked and recieved confirmation for a double room with canal views. On arrival was given a very small twin room on the first floor over looking a roof! When i went back down to reception they said there was nothing they could do and were quite rude. They said that they didn't have to give us the room we booked and were even entitled to put us in single rooms if there was no twin room available. I was offered a double room at an extra 60 euro per night which i went to see and it was tiny so i declined. This hotel is in a great location, however and is within walking distance of everything, which attracted me to it in the first place. House keeping barge in un announced early in the morning with their master key so be sure to put up a do not disturb sign if you want to sleep. Great pity about the service cos this hotel is well located and could be very good

<Content>Good HotelExcellent Breakfast Stayed for 4 nights with my partner and we were given a room with twin beds when we had booked double bed. Receptionnist was excellent - could not move us the first night but arranged for our luggage to be moved the second night. Were given a great room with an excellent view over Amsterdam and the canal. Booked this hotel because breakfast was said to be good. Was not disappointed! The hotel itself is a bit tatty and needs a refurb but the staff were all very friendly and helpful without exception. Would stay again at that time of year - prices are attractive but it is a bit expensive later on in spring or summer. The location however is excellent. Definetely worth considering!!

<Content>Superb Hotel - Deserves 4-Star Rating We spent 6 days at the Park Hotel, from 30 March to 5 April 2006. Came from the airport at 9:00 AM after an overnight flight and check us right in. Location is superb, near the museums. We had a large room overlooking the canal with 2 comfortable chairs and a queen size bed. Fresh fruit and sparkling water in our room each evening. Great breakfast. Attentive and friendly staff. Would stay there again when in Amsterdam.

<Content>Friendly staff, good location My husband and I stayed at the Park Hotel Mar 27-30. We were very pleased with our stay. Upon booking the hotel, we requested a double bed, but upon arrival we were given a first floor room with 2 twin beds. Although the room was adequate, it was not 4 star and not what we requested. When we went to the front desk they said that they could not change our room that night but would for the next 2 nights. We were switched to a larger nicer room with a king bed on the 6th floor for the last 2 nights. We even received a lovely letter of apology. This kind of service is appreciated. The breakfasts were great, lots of variety, everything was fresh and tasty. The location was good, right near a canal stop, 1/2 block from the Rembrandt museum and within walking distance of stores and restaurants. As a travel agent I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Excellent Location and Hotel .. We really enjoyed our stay here .. Good size, really clean room, very friendly staff, nice breakfast, good bar .. great value we thought. We didnt eat Dinner at the Hotel Resturant .. so I have no idea what this is like.The Location is brilliant, right next to the museums ... and with plenty of bars and diffrent types of resturants across the canal. .. There ars 2 very regular trams (every couple of minutes) that run right to the central train station and the middle of the town .. The canal cruize goes from just outside the hotel .. recommend you take this .. its good fun .. Whenever I go back to Amsterdam I'll stay here again ..

<Content>Amazing How can the Park Hotel's location be any better? With the canal, Vondel Park, casino, Hard Rock Cafe, and museums all so close, how can you not love it? The bar downstairs was nice, as was the room. I've been to 3 continents and 12 countries, and this ranks among the top 3 places I've stayed at. Oh, and its being in an amazing city doesn't hurt either.

<Content>Fantastic Place I stayed at the Park Hotel for a 3 days business trip. It is in an ideal location, I walked absolutely everywhere from the hotel, it is very central.The Staff was very friendly, keeping my bags with them for the last day was not a problem. They even sent me a thank you letter later on in the mail for my business. It was a nice touch.Fantastic Spacious and Modern washroom. Why not 5 stars? I think the only thing holding it back was perhaps the room decor (mostly just the conforters) are a bit old school, but other then that A+++ You'll be hard pressed for a better hotel for this price, I will definitely come back...

<Content>Great value in a perfect location! This hotel is perfectly located, a short walk to anything a visitor to Amsterdam would like to see really. Close to various museums, squares full of restaurants, a lovely high-end shopping strip (I can recommend Shoebaloo if you are looking for well priced designer footwear) etc etc. A little further, but still within walking distance, is the Red Light District if that is your thing. I won't rave about the decor as there is nothing to rave about, it is a fairly typical 4/4.5 star hotel setup. But there is nothing to complain about and the bathrooms are quite nice. I was also very pleased that my hotel room in Amsterdam overlooked a canal!Our booking was made through Expedia - and I must say, for the price (under 50 pound per night) this hotel was EXCEPTIONALLY good value.

<Content>Great Base The Park wasn't my first choice, but getting a decently located hotel in Amsterdam for under 拢150 a night is pretty tricky. I advise you all to do your research and book as early as possible - Amsterdam isn't a last minute city. I stayed over with my sister - the first time in the city for the both of us - and I was more than happy with the location we found ourselves in. It's easy to get into the centre, and just next to a beatiful park (wish I'd taken my skates!)Handy for trams and the waterbuses. The hotel itself is nothing special - our standard room looked like an urban grandma's version of country style decorating, without the knicknacks. The room was clean and had everything we needed, the staff were exceptionally helpful. Would book again if I wasn't looking for a romantic weekend.

<Content>Clean and decent value We stayed at the Park in April (Tulip season). The location was convenient and the hotel was offering a special room rate at the time. The only complaint here was that we had requested connecting rooms when booking but found none to be available. Other than that, our stay was nice, with an included and bountiful breakfast each morning.Next door to the hotel is an excellent Indonesian restaurant. Having travelled to Amsterdam many years ago, I was looking forward to reacquainting myself with that type of cusine, as Indonesian restaurants are quite rare in the states. I was not disappointed.All agreed that we would consider staying here again should we return to Amsterdam.

<Content>Friendly staff, great location My husband and I stayed at the Park Hotel and enjoyed our time in Amsterdam. The hotel is in a great location! The staff was so friendly and helpful, and our room was above average, considering the norm for hotels in Europe. The prices were high, but the location can't be beat.

<Content>top location...friendly staff...great value We just had a great stay at the Park Hotel in Amsterdam. This hotel is really in the best location of the city. All the museums, canalboats and best shopping just around the corner. Furthermore excellent equiped rooms ( love the tea  coffee making facilities ) and especially very friendly staff. To be short, great value and all you need for a pleasant short-break in Amsterdam. What a fabulous city indeed!

<Content>Very Good Hotel I stayed at the Park Hotel in Amsterdam, and in my opinion it is a very good hotel, and normally I stay in 4* or 5* hotels so I know what standards to expect from a 4* hotel. To be honest we were put in the Park Hotel by accident because of a booking error but I'm quite glad we did because we had a great time. Amsterdam is a brilliant, quirky, and unique city and Stadthouderskade, where the hotel is located is right near Vondelpark, and also the museum quarter. It's well away from the red light district and is on the nice side of Amsterdam. It's right near one of the canals and you can hop on a canal barge more or less right outside your hotel! The views of the canal are fantastic, but you have to be careful to try and get a canal view because at the back of the hotel all you can see is buildings. Contrary to what was said in another review, the beds aren't any lower than other beds in hotels and the rooms are cosy and attractive and the fact that there are tea and coffee making facilities is absolutely brilliant! The best thing about the hotel is it's breakfasts (there's everything!) and it has a warm and friendly atmosphere. In fact Mrs Warboys off One Foot In The Grave was staying in the hotel at the same time as us (so it can't be bad if somebody off the TV is staying there!) And trust me, it isn't... if you choose to go to Amsterdam, the Dutch people are amazingly friendly and so are the hotel staff! It's the best hotel in a city location that I've stayed in!

<Content>We'll be back... My wife and I moved to The Park Hotel Amsterdam after a couple of days in a nearby hotel we could not stand. We found the hotel to be everything we could ask for. The front desk staff and doorman were nice, when we reported a problem with the light in our bathroom a very courteous maintenance man fixed the problem within minutes. Our spacious room faced the canal and Hard Rock Cafe across the street but was quiet nonetheless. We paid 150 Euros (about $180), which included an expansive breakfast buffet of hot and cold foods. We'll definitely stay here the next time we're in Amsterdam, which we hope will be soon. The city and its people are so charming.

<Content>Great But No Cigar I stayed at this hotel back in 2002 for my 2nd visit to Amsterdam. On arrving i was really impressed. The reception was really nice and the staff were really helpful and friendly.The room was clean and of decent size and in my view good value for money.However the bath was way too small. If your 6 feet tall forgot it. Also the connecting door to the room next dor was paper thin. You could here the occupents next door talking for god sake. Also didn`t help when they got up to leave at 4am the next day :-(My last grumble was that housekeeping staff started at 7.30am!!!.On the whole i would give this hotel 3 out of 5. A vast improvement on the Hotel Atlanta which i stayed at in 2001 but not as good as the Hotel Amsterdam De Roode Leeuw where i stayed in 2003.I will be staying at the NH Schiller this May so will write a report to see how they compare.RegardsRyan K

<Content>Friendly staff, but..... My family and I booked three seperate rooms in the new wing. When we arrived, we were told that section was for some reason closed and we were booked into the older section of the hotel. The rooms were extremely small and cramped and the beds very low to the ground and smaller than a normal twin sized bed. The pillows were lumpy and uncomfortable.On the plus side, the hotel staff were all very, very friendly, the location was excellent and the breakfast buffet outstanding.

<Content>Terrific location, great room We just returned from a trip to Amsterdam and really enjoyed this hotel. We upgraded to the Executive room upon arriving and loved it. King size bed, balcony overlooking the canal, and - this is the best - terrific bathroom with big tub. Truly enjoyed chilling in a big bubble bath (thank you Lush) every night. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Only one minor complaint - there is no wirless internet access. From the write up on hotels.com we expected it but it wasn't there - a bit deceiving.Besides that one small tribble it was a very pleasant experience. The location is ideal - the Leidsplein is only a 5 minute walk and there are dozens of restaurants there. Also within 5-minute walking distance are the Museumplein and PC Hoofstaat - chic shopping area. Walk about 10 minutes to hit the Albert Cuypmarket. This is not on top of the Dam (Square) or Red Light District but if that's where you plan to hang out then simply take the 1, 2, or 5 tram then walk for a few minutes.

<Content>Very Good, excellent value The location of this hotel is superb - right in the middle of everything, and opposite the brilliant Casino. The lobby was average, reception staff friendly enough - we had 3 adjoining rooms overlooking the canal, no problem, even though we were on a cheap offer through expedia. The hotel rooms were of average size, excellent clean bathroom, although all of us agreed that some updating is required as the interiors are getting on a bit. All in all, a good stay - would give this 7/10.

<Content>Club rooms more than adequate Hubby and I have just returned from a two-night break in Amsterdam. Stayed at the Park (great deal booked very last minute through Last Minute!) As per other reviews the Park is in a great location and is convenient for trams/canal boats. We initially checked in at approx 14.30 hrs and were offered a free upgrade to a club room providing we could come back at 17.00 hrs. Bell hop took our luggage and we took off for a whistle stop tour of the sights. Later when we did check into our room we were perfectly happy with its facilities and standard of finish/decor. We had a 6ft double bed (although matress could have done with replacing) topped with a duvet. The bathroom was clean and bright with granite vanity top, great shower and spotlessly clean shower curtain and all the usual toiletries including shaving kit and disposable toothbrush/paste and plenty of large white towels (with not a hint of stale cigarette smoke). The room had a small balcony, over-looking the canal. Duty manager called by on the second day to check if we were happy with everything or needed more towels(?) Although they describe this room as Club I would expect this level of finish/decor to be standard for a 3+/4* hotel of a reputable chain. Had we been allocated a Standard room this review might not have been so favourable. No complaints with their Club room though!

<Content>Park Hotel My boyfriend and I have just returned from this hotel iver new year (Dec 31st to Jan 4th.) After booking it in september we were a bit wary of the hotel after reading several really bad reviews about it. We are used to nice hotels and having stayed at the Crowne Plaza in the city centre we thought The Park would be a big let down.When we arrived, the reception was very modern. We got to our room and it was perfect...just what we wanted except twin beds instead of a queen bed we had booked. After complaining to the reception staff, they advised they had a room coming available the next day with a queen bed in. When we went to get the key to this room they had upgraded us to a club room. The room was quite big with a massive bed, balcony, television and a gorgeous marble bathroom. We visited the bar a few times and the staff were really friendly, they have really cosy couches too. We have both said that we would definitely stay in this hotel again, perfect location just 2 minutes from Leidesplein, Hard rock cafe across the road and an Irish bar and the largest casino in Europe. They also gave you free entrance into the casino. Brilliant hotel!!

<Content>Great location with nice breakfast in a good basic hotel I read the reviews of this hotel after I had booked it in a package. I was wary of what awaited me. It was a great basic hotel. It could not have been in a better location. It is near a major transportation stop. It faces a canal. It is even across from the Hard Rock Cafe. People like to criticize the Hard Rock but for families, it is a place with a predictable menu and drinks that can be refilled. The Rijks Museum and the Van Gogh Museum are a short walk away. Behind the Park is the elite shopping street for Amsterdam. A short walk to the front gets you to the Leidse Square and a good location for drifting through some of the best and most convenient shopping I have experienced in Europe. It might not be the Ritz but when we travel to Europe we look for clean, convenient, near transportation, and a breakfast other than just stale bread. The Park fits our bill. I would definitely use it again.

<Content>In No Way a Four Star Hotel This hotel is really not what it claims to be.It has ended up as part of Le Meridien as a result of their various mergers/demergers but it is in no way of international 4 or even 3 star standard.Reception were friendly and efficient but the decor is very dated and the rooms are horrible - small, tatty, very badly furnished. Even the bed would disgrace even a modest hotel.Le Meridien should either sell or sort out this hotel. At the moment it lets down their group.Location is good so if u get a VERY cheap rate u might risk it for leisure. But after a hard days work you will want somewhere better than this which is barely of tourist class.Must do better.

<Content>Don't stay here for business Foolish me, searched the Le Meridien Web site for a convenient hotel for two nights in Amsterdam. Booked what was advertised as an executive room for E185 a night. What a disappointment ... check-in was awful and disorganised, the room was the worst part and they should be prosecuted for using the term executive. Only one telephone line that was no where near the desk, no internet conneciton, they charged for local calls that were supposed to be free. The general state of the room was shabby and it was very small.For location it's OK, but in every other respect (apart from the friendly barman) a disappointment - particularly hopeless if you need to work!

<Content>Distinctly Average Having read the posted reviews, I was somewhat anxious about staying at The Park Hotel. I can only reiterate what others have said: it is certainly NOT 4*, particularly if you are used to North American or British 4* hotels. The standard room we had was adequate but small and would scrape a 3* rating in other countries, while the club room was better, but still only what one would expect of all rooms in such an establishment. We had a problem with very lightweight and unattached bathroom ceiling tiles lifting and the bathroom door opening spontaneously when we had the window open (central heating was stifling) and the duty manager did her utmost to help, finally accepting defeat and offering a room upgrade for our subsequent final night (the hotel being full to capacity and only a very smoky room was our other option). The location is ideal and is only a very short walk from a tram stop served by lines 1, 2  5 which terminate at Central Station. We also encountered staff who could not advise on where to buy a tram strip ticket in the evening: we were told the (closed) tourist office was our only option, while a nearby newsagent sold them.In all, a perfectly decent place to stay, provided you're not planning on spending too much time in your room. I would return, but only if I knew that Le Meridien had engaged in some upgrading of facilities.

<Content>Hotel good, but bedroom not 4* My wife and I spent two nights at The Park Hotel with another couple, and had a great weekend trip, the hotel is in a good location for all the interesting places, it has excellent friendly service, and all the communal areas,(bar, restaurant, etc) are very good. The bedrooms we had were very disappointing, they were clean, but very dated and small, if we had been staying any longer than two nights, we would of asked for a different room. In short, a 4* hotel but 1* bedrooms.

<Content>Disappointing We stayed in May, and had booked a Club room, which turned out to be very ordinary, and a disappointment. If that is Park Hotel's idea of luxury, I wonder how the standard rooms must be like.I do agree with the other TripAdvisor users who say that this is no four star hotel.Location is very good for the Reichsmuseum. Front desk staff was okay, but had no knowledge when we asked about train communication for our departure airport. All in all: Stay somewhere else.

<Content>As somewhere to lay my weary head, it was absolutely fine! I had decided to visit Amsterdam again. What a fabulous, and fabulously entertaining city! Last time I went, about three months ago, it resulted in a somewhat euphemistically pre-anaesthetised broken ankle. This time, I determined to keep myself just that little bit more sober. I booked flights and then turned to the infamous Priceline in order to book accommodation of some sort. For the centre of the action, you really can't do an awful lot better than the Crowne Plaza City Centre or, say, the Golden Tulip. For the Leidesplein, Rijksmuseum and a spot of culture, you'll certainly enjoy the Park hotel. And that's exactly where I was allocated. There are a load of very decent hotels in this particular region. Don't get me wrong - I adore art. The Rijksmuseum, next door, is, however, apparently closed for the next 18 months or so due to major refurbishment and my agenda meant that planned entertainments - nothing terribly untoward, you understand - meant a tram ride into the real centre. Tram lines 2 and 5 will certainly do the trick. I messed up, however, and ended walking both ways. Probably 20-30 minutes. No real problem. I'm amazed at my sense of direction. I needed it! I'd hunted down 5-star hotels on Priceline. No luck. Similarly, I fruitlessly checked out their selection of 4-star hotels. So I opted for the 3-star level, and got a night at the Park Hotel for a very decent rate of 拢45 per night. Something of a steal as, for once, I would actually take issue with the 3-star rating. If nothing else, the rating is certainly somewhat marginal. Located next to one of Amsterdam's canals (where you can buy tickets for canal tours) it is an impressive building and I entered through the revolving door to find that the reception area was spacious, reasonably luxurious and well-staffed. It was a quiet and peaceful haven. The receptionist really could not have been much more friendly nor helpful and it was not long before I had the key - and it was, indeed, a proper key - to room 221. I also had a welcome letter given to me, inviting me to enjoy a half-price breakfast in the morning. The offer price of 9.50 Euros would have been an exceptionally good deal if I had not preferred the alternative option of a post-very-late-night-lie-in to the American buffet breakfast that was on offer. Check-out time was 11:30am and I just about made it! I had a meeting with some friends and despite hunting down the venue the night before, could I find it? Nope! Probably because it had actually closed down two years previously. But soft! We did meet up. After checking in, at any rate, I was offered help with my luggage, but I was only carrying a small case and, having declined this, was pointed in the direction of the lift. The bar and restaurant, which I passed en route looked really welcoming. In Amsterdam, however, I think that there are better places to drink than hotel bars, so - for a change - I can't share my experience with you. I used neither. They did, however, look inviting if that's your thing, and the menus were interesting. Room service was also available 24 hours per day. I reached the lift. It was at this point that I realised that I was not staying in a terribly modern hotel. I pressed the button to summon the lift. It arrived. The doors don't slide open like in any normal 20th or 21st Century lift - nope - you pull them open like a room door and step inside. Select your floor and up you go - no internal door at all; just watch the wall slide down below you! Stand back! I've seen this once before in a budget hotel in Prague, and was truly amazed to see it again. Still, it got me safely to the second floor and my room was only a few steps away. I unlocked the room and ventured inside. I worked out how to use the lighting. Interesting room - yellow painted walls and blue carpeted floors, with two single beds pushed together to form a double. These were extraordinarily low-level and very soft. They actually provided a great night's sleep, I have to say. Standard hotel-issue remote-controlled TV with personalised welcome screen. The bathroom was reasonably large, was white and was spotlessly clean. The toiletries were decent, and the bath / shower combination was efficient; plenty of hot water. I just don't know how to sum up - it was very comfortable, and it was certainly more than adequate. It was, at the end of the day, somewhere to lay my rather weary head, and it was clean, comfortable and moderately luxurious. There was 24 hour room service. That's all you need in an Amsterdam hotel - in fact, it's probably more than you need. What probably stops me raving about the place is simply the fact that it just struck me as being somewhat tired. The reception area had an air of elegance about it yet, once out of the lift, the place had a certain shabby feeling about it. A water pipe, for instance, ran down the wall of my bedroom. Small point, but I just don't like to see such visible plumbing in my hotel room. Perhaps I'm just too picky! Check-out in the morning was friendly and efficient. Yes - I'd happily stay there again, but there are certainly better places to stay in Amsterdam - if only for the location. If you're more intent on doing the Art thing, however, this would certainly be a contender. Priceline have it down as a 3-star. Le Meridien have it down as a 4-star. I'm finding it quite hard to judge, to be honest. Customer service gives it a definite 4. The somewhat jaded fabric of the bedrooms leads me towards a 3. As a place to stay, well - it was more than adequate and I couldn't complain at the price; perhaps a star-rating is irrelevant - which is a cop-out. I guess that, whilst it would never be my first choice in Amsterdam for a variety of reasons, it suited its purpose pretty well and I've no real right, or need, whatsoever to complain.

<Content>major works outside the Park Hotel Amsterdam We stayed at the Park Hotel Amsterdam from 2nd Oct to 5th October last. We had read the reviews on Tripadvisor and as a result decided to upgrade our room. This cost an extra E105 for the 3 nights. The street outside the hotel is completely dug up with major works being undertaken at the front of the hotel. We felt we could have been told this when we spoke with the reservations clerk. She had no problem taking extra money from us for an upgrade but did not advise of the works being undertaken. We found the staff very helpful and the hotel good - though not 4 star. It is a little far away from Dam Square - 20 minutes walk but located in a nice place if you do not wish to be in Dam square every evening. Plenty restaurants and bars around.

<Content>An excellent hotel Have just stayed for 2 nights at this hotel. I was with a disabled friend and we both enjoyed our stay there. Position was excellent as it was minutes away from great shops, museums and canal trips.Front line staff were ALL helpful and extremely friendly, in fact NO member of staff let the hotel name down.A very good experience. Some areas of the hotel need upgrading but nevertheless I would recommend staying here

<Content>Nice Stay at the Park Hotel We had a nice 3-day stay at the Park Hotel a couple weeks ago. We got a good price of $150 U.S. per night for a club room double through expedia.com. However, we were upgraded at no cost to a two-level suite due to some apparently unanticipated need to close a wing of the hotel (they never told us why). Although the suite was very nice, we were still a little bothered because it had only one bed (we needed two) and it did not have air-conditioning, which the club room we booked was supposed to have. To apologize, the management sent us a bottle of wine, which was a nice gesture.Overall, it was a comfortable hotel with all the amenities, although it's a little worn around the edges. The front desk staff were very friendly, with the exception of one sourpuss. However, they gave us misinformation on two occasions, regarding the opening hours of the Rijksmuseum and which tram to take to the Resistance Museum. The location is excellent -- the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum are right around the corner, along with trams and buses to the city centre. There is massive road construction going on outside the hotel and expected to last for at least a year, but we didn't hear any noise from it during our stay. Overall, we would recommend the Park Hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>Not 4 star quality My husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights in August. FIRST, we were given a room with two twin beds, we had reserved one larger bed. When we wanted to change rooms, we were told the hotel was fully booked and they would put the beds together. The room was dreadfully hot (at least 30C) with a small window that wouldn't stay open. Also, the small bathroom was difficult to move around in and the shower head only dribbled water. The SECOND night we were able to move into another room. This room was much better. We were able to open the balcony doors to allow a cool breeze. The bathroom was large and newly remodeled. The hotel is in a great location. The Hardrock Cafe, Boom Chicago and loads of pubs are nearby. Also, the Van Gogh and Rijks Museums. The canal bus stops in front of the hotel and the tram stops are close by. Its not 4 star quality but if you are looking for a place to lay your head look no further.

<Content>Bad eggs and ear plugs Myself and two friends stayed at The Park for 2 nights in August. It was a very disappointing experience from an accommodation point of view. My friends requested a room move on day 2 as they could not sleep at all due to the noise from the street below and lack of air conditioning (their window was tiny). Their request was granted but their sleep was further prevented by noise from adjoining rooms and from rooms above/below -the walls are paper thin. If you do stay here, take along some effective ear plugs as you'll be needing them. Most off-putting of all was the smell of bad eggs that permeated the corridor early in the morning - it was possibly a stray stink bomb. The hotel overall is functional but impersonal. I agree with the other reviewers in that it is certainly mis-placed as a four star -it is possibly a 2 star at most. Very over-priced indeed.

<Content>4* my hat ! My partner and I just returned from 2 nights at the Park Hotel and we were very disappointed with the hotel considering what we paid for it. I don't know how they get away with marketing it as a 4*, more like a very average 3* as it's very drab and dreary. Breakfast was EUR19.50 which is a joke, the cooked breakfast was awful and neither of us ate it.Anyway this hotel is definitely not value for money and we won't be staying there again.

<Content>Great Stay at the Park Hotel Had a great three-night stay at the Park Hotel in Amsterdam in April 2004 following a few days in London. The hotel is situated right on a canal and next to Vondelpark. At first we were put into the old section of the hotel and the rooms were VERY small, but we requested to be moved and the hotel management then switched us to the new section where the rooms were much larger.They were quite comfortable and had all of the necessities--cable TV, direct-dial phone (so I could hook up my laptop), coffee-maker, nice bathrooms, etc. The food was also good and we usually had room service in the evening rather than going out since we enjoyed the vegetarian pizza and caesar salad!The location was also convenient as it was only a few minutes to the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum, Leidesplein Square (very cool restaurants, bars and coffee shops--we enjoyed the Bull Dog Cafe), Vondelpark, and many nice shops.Walking to Dam Square only took about 20 minutes so that was nice also, but when we were lazy, we walked over to Leidesplein and hopped the tram. Be careful of the trams and bikes!Overall, it was a great stay in one of my favorite cities and I'd definitely return to the Park Hotel--to the new section anyway!

<Content>location fabulous The hotel is in an awesome location-that is the best thing about it. I was there with a group of friends, and I stayed in the older portion of the building. Room was small, but adequate-no great view, but it was nice to have 2 balconies. Some friends stayed in the newer side of the building-their room was smaller, but they did have a view of the canal and city. I liked the hotel, thought the staff was very pleasant. Bottom line is, how much time are you going to spend in the hotel anyways? It was clean and served it's purpose-a bed to sleep in, a shower to bathe in. The rest of the time I was out exploring this facinating city, and the location of the Park Hotel made it very easy to do this.

<Content>Had to make a fuss First room we were shown was extremely shabby  dirty plus the bed was extremely small  we had booked a queen size over the internet. I called reception  they were rude  unhelpful so my partner went down to make a fuss. We were shown a second room, a triple with a double  single bed  advised to push them together to make a queen size bed! As this was unacceptable to us we made more fuss and were eventually offered a club room upgrade. This room at least was 4 star standard but still had problems (the hairdryer did not work and the plug on the keetle looked unsafe). Despite the fact that the location was good I would not stay at this hotel again as the initial disagreement with unhelpful staff took the shine off the first day of our holiday.

<Content>I just returned from 2 nights stay here. I just returned from 2 nights stay here. As stated in all previous reviews, try to get a room in the Executive area - as this has been refurbished. In the older part of the hotel, the rooms are a bit run down. Not too bad, just a below average. The location is great.

<Content>Excellent stay We atayed at the Park on a three night break for my 50th birthday. When we arrived by taxi the hotel porter was there like a shot to help with the bags. (If you arrive at Centraal Station it is much cheaper to take the number 2 tram to the Leidsplein and double back across the bridge - anyone would give you directions). Reception staff were very friendly and efficient and showed us on a map all the places of interest in conjunction to where the hotel was placed. Our room was a standard room at the front of the hotel overlooking the canal. The road outside is a main road so some traffic noise is to be expected but it wasn't that bad. The room was fresh and bright with a small seating area, t.v., hairdryer, hospitality tray and a free safe which was a bonus. There was more hanging space than we usually find in comparable hotels. The bathroom was beautiful - black and white decor and spotlessly clean - as was the rest of the room. The outside corridors and stairways were also nicely decorated and spotless. Our only complaint was the sofas and armchairs in the bar which were very shabby and in dire need of replacement. However, the bar itself was atmospheric and the bar staff extremely friendly and funny! We didn't eat in the hotel but made use of the Irish pub, Aran which was just across the bridge on the other side of the canal. Their breakfasts were to die for and the menu reasonable. We also ate in a really nice (quite small) Italian restaurant round the back of the hotel - also reasonably priced. The best thing of all about the Park tho' is it's position. It is in the Museum District - five minutes walk from the Riks and the Van Gough. Canal boat trips leave from just across the road and all the other major attractions, restaurants, bars, shopping, flower market, Dam square are within an easy walk. Perfectly placed ! Another good thing was that you are able to leave your luggage in the luggage room on day of departure and call back for it later. I wouldn't quite give this hotel a four star rating - I would probably describe it as a good three star but it was absolutely fine for our requirements and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for a city break.

<Content>Excellent location and facilities An excellent hotel in a perfect location for all the Museums and if you like a gamble - right opposite the Casino !!! We had a Club Room which I would recommend, as I believe the standard rooms are fairly small. The room was adequate but not exactly plush for a Club designation. Still you don't go to Amsterdam to stay in the room. Staff were friendly and polite.

<Content>Fantastic hotel, great friendly staff - seamless experience We stayed in this hotel for two nights and found the staff lovely and friendly, the food fabulous and the situation great! In a desparate bid to find something wrong we noticed that the carpet was frayed around the radiator pipe! That's it! A great hotel and we'll definitely be going back there.

<Content>great location  The Park Hotel was a great choice! the location was great, the hotel staff was friendly, and the rooms were nice and clean!The location is very close to the the Leidseplein. A 5 minute walk! Also near by the hotel were other high end shops and art galleries. Which was great!The hotel staff was very friendly! They all spoke english! Which always helpful. The BEST thing about the hotel was the size of the rooms! They were very spacious. I can actually leave my HUGE suitcase wide open in the middle of the room and still have space to walk around! Visiting from Los Angeles (where hotel rooms are much larger than typical European hotel rooms), this room was perfect for 4 days! The room was very neat and clean! the bathrooms were updated and new as well! The bed sheets were clean and the bed was very comfortable. I was very pleased with this hotel. i will definately stay here again the next time i visit amsterdam.

<Content>Excellent Location - But Hotel Could be Improved! First things first... the location of this hotel is excellent. Plenty of bars, shops, restaurants and activities nearby and about 20 minutes walk from the Centre of Amsterdam and the Red Light District (If you are interested in having a look there!)...The lobby area is nice and the staff were friendly and checked us in quickly but upon approaching our room i became very worried... The area of the hotel we were in was the older part and can only be described as poor condition and very shabby. The carpets were dirty, the walls had paper hanging off them and there was a really bad smell of stale smoke, drink and food (onions).... and this was BEFORE we even entered our room!Our group consisted of two married couple and the rooms we were given were abysmal. They were dirty and smelly and definately not of 4 star standard. This part of the hotel needs some serious refurbishment.. and the sooner the better!... The bed was a three quarter size double (just enough room for 2) and was barely off the floor!....There was about a foot at the most around the bed to walk on all three sides and the furniture was old, shabby, badly damaged and looked like it had been selected from a junk shop. I actually felt quite insulted to be given a room of such an appalling standard and there was absolutely no way on earth I was prepared to spend a night in there!So, as you would expect, we complained! We told the receptionist not only was the room disgusting, but i we were more insulted by the fact that they clearly expected us to sleep there!... By way of an apology, we were then offered an Executive room in the newer part of the hotel (at a discounted rate of 25 euro per night per room - apparently it is usually 45 euros extra per room per night). This was a VAST improvement and as you would expect the standard to be. There was a decent sized bed (king), matching furniture, tidy bathroom, nice decor and plenty of room! It was bright, airy and clean. (looked fairly new to me)If we have been given this room in the first place we would not have had cause to complain and I would have rated this a 4 star hotel. The newer part of the hotel is lovely, there is a very pleasant bar area. The staff were very friendly and overall you would be hard pressed to find a better location.So, please note, if you book here - MAKE SURE you are not given a room in the old part of the building otherwise you will be very, very disappointed.

<Content>Would stay there again Have just returned from 3 nights at the Park Hotel. We'd booked a Standard room, which was quite small. The decor was a little shabby but it WAS clean. The bathroom was small but more modern and spotless. Even though we were in the back of the old part of the hotel, the room was pleasant, quiet and comfortable. However, the double bed was very saggy in the middle and, as we're both overweight and with back problems we opted to upgrade to a twin-bedded Club room at 35 euros a night extra. The beds were still a bit squidgy but at least we didn't keep rolling together! The staff were courteous, friendly  efficient. We were allowed to view a couple of rooms before we moved. The Club rooms are bigger (not huge) and in a better state of decor. On a couple of occasions, we could hear the muffled sound of voices from next door, but that's the case in most hotels I've stayed in (Hilton, Holiday Inn, Copthorne), it depends on your neighbours! The location of the hotel is EXCELLENT. It's within walking distance of most of the popular places (and we're unfit 50+!). Trams run regularly a couple of 100yds away; there's a shuttle bus to  from the airport but not before 7.00am; there's a taxi rank opposite (pricey); the canal trips are also opposite. The Irish Aran Pub opposite does great food (inc breakfast) at reasonable prices compared to other places in Amsterdam; I recommend their Beef  Guinness stew. We'd definitely stay at the Park Hotel again.

<Content>Absolutely lovely My partner booked this break as a surprise for my 40th birthday! The hotel was lovely, staff very helpful and friendly and location perfect.I received a lovely letter and present when they were aware of my birthday, and all members of staff were at all times pleasant and friendly. Having read the reviews of some of the others, i am wondering if this is the same place?We had a terrific time, lovely room,lovely setting, lovely staff, no complaints whatsoever!!Would definately use this hotel again.

<Content>Great Location Initial teething problems checking in to the right room and we ended up sleeping on two twins pushed together the first night. We were staying in the old part which I wouldn't call luxurious but it was clean and very comfortable and you couldn't be in a better location - within walking distance of everything you want to see. We got an online deal for EUR35 per room per night and it was well worth it.

<Content>Terrific little hotel with a great location! We just got back from a 1-week trip to the Park Hotel in Amsterdam. We had a Club room (7th floor) for under US$175/night including tax (EUR$135). I would say this is a very good value considering the room quality, location, and holiday rate period (New Year's Eve). We travel very often (every other month or so) and enjoy going out to eat and going to museums. For our interests, the location was ideal. Jordaan, and other activities are easily within walking distance as well. I felt safe walking alone outside the hotel. The staff was never rude and I had a lot of dumb questions. We used both the business center (a little room with one computer for internet access) and in-room dining. Both were fine for a small hotel. I can't comment on the standard rooms, but from what I experienced, reasonable travellers will not be disappointed by this hotel.Pros: Friendly staff, larger bed by European standards (large full-size), good pillows, good size bathroom (for 1 person, that is), radiant heat works REALLY well, great view from little balconette (you HAVE to stay here over New Year's Eve - WOW!! What a view!), easy access location, right on Conexxion bus line to airport, cute, clean room, good storage space, cable TVCons: SMOKY like all of Amsterdam (even in a non-smoking room, how gross), radiant heat works REALLY well, cable TV can be quite graphic (cover the kids' eyes!), toilet takes forever to refill, Club room is still a little small (I actually spend a fair amount of time in my room, though), room service has a limited selectionAll in all, I highly recommend Club level rooms at the Park Hotel if the price stays at a good value.

<Content>Average I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights around Easter.I found the front desk extremely rude and unprofessional. A lot of training to make them 5-star quality.The room was fairly small (common for European hotels) and facing inside with above-average noise levels (from adjacent rooms). All other features of the hotel were acceptable.Location is great - across from HardRock Cafe and adjcaent to trolly to downtown.. Within walking distance of various destinations.I would stay at this location again but at a reduced cost as I didn't feel it was luxurious by any stretch of the imagination.

<Content>HATED the Park Hotel I booked this hotel as I was on a business trip.I had to stay there for 4 days. The first room I was given was appalling, crampt, dirty with holes in the curtains and bed sheets, NOISY and as already commented - I had to put a foot in the bath in order to use the toilet!!I can't believe that this hotel has been awarded 4 stars. There was so much noise on the first night, that I had to move at 1 am. The second room was just a bad. After complaining to the management I was given an upgrade to a 'club' room. The club room was ok and of 4 star standard.I would not recommend anyone to stay there, the only positive comment would be the location. I complained to Le Meridien about this hotel and was offered a free night's accommodation there if I used it within 6 months HA! NO CHANCE!

<Content>Pleased with the Park! Having read the negative reviews of this hotel, we were a little worried about staying there with our 2.5 year old son. We were therefore very pleased to have extremely friendly and helpful service and a large comfortable (club) room all at a very reasonable price. The location is excellent. I do agree with some reviewers that this hotel is a little shabby and probably deserves 3 stars max ... but we think we got good value for our money.

<Content>Good value, excellent staff My friend and I wanted to go to Amsterdam for a couple of days. We were looking for a 4*hotel, centrally located and The Park Hotel had a very good offer which was within our budget. We heard that the location of the hotel is the place to be as it is within minutes walk from the Leidseplein and all the musea. Very convenient! The building suits nicely in the Amsterdam architecture and the check- in was smooth and friendly. We were lucky to get one of the refurbished rooms and they looked clean and bright. The hotel has not the latest modern amenities and businesslike atmosphere like most of the airport hotels but it is definitely cosy and the staff is really friendly. After a long day of shopping (just around the corner!) we had a very tasty dinner in the typical Dutch restaurant and some drinks in the bar that gives great views. We had a fun weekend in Amsterdam and the good deal with the hotel made it a memorable experience.
