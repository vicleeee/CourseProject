<Content>beautiful, characterful hotel To echo most of the reviews, this was one of the most beautiful, characterful hotels my wife and I (and her parents) have ever stayed in. Our sumptuous room had a chandelier hanging from the pressed ceiling, walls of soft blue and white, and a separate antechamber with a weeping fig plant and two chairs and a table at a large window, with the busy Berlin thoroughfare, almost unhearable, below. The bathroom, with classic, circular, chrome water meters, was sparkling clean. The hotel staff was as friendly as one could ever hope to encounter. The nearby square, Savigny Platz, teems with restaurants: Mr Hai and friends, a Vietnamese place, was great; as was Zwiegelfisch, a memorably atmospheric bar from the Sixties, with good, honest food. We would recommend against the extremely popular tapas place, Mar y Sol. The waitress, who was perhaps the manager, was brusque to the point of barely looking at us while we ordered. She gave us wrong dishes, forgot dishes, and allowed us only one glass of tap water each, snatching away the jug of water we had asked for.

<Content>Olde world with character Our initial reaction was what have we done, as the decor is certainly old fashioned and cluttered. Felt we were in someone's home, but we were pleasantly surprised. Our room was large and very clean, although uncomfortable european pillows. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfasts were fantastic! The location is also excellent in a very nice part of Berlin. Could have spent longer in this great city. Next time we would hire bikes as the bike baths look very safe, however public transport was a breeze.

<Content>Another thumbs up Yes, another positive review for this fine wee hotel in this marvellous city - it's a doddery sort of old-worlde place that's maybe not perfect for wild clubbing kids perhaps, though they might appreciate it in a kitsch sort of way, but otherwise it's a great place to relax after another exhausting day of sightseeing, the rooms are indeed spacious and sprawlable, and the breakfasts are of a suitably Germanic substantialness. Only two very minor grumbles: when I ask for a double room, I like a real double bed, not two singles in a double frame, so that every time I roll over to kiss the wife I get stuck like a shoe in a tramline, and when I ask for local restaurant advice I don't want to be told oh,they're all good when the first night's mediocre fare amply disproved this. But all in all a great stay.

<Content>Excellent Central Hotel Just returned from a week stay at the Askanischer Hof. It lives up to it's reputation as a classy hotel, in a classy area of Berlin. Outlook from my bedroom was Chanel  Cartier. Dining room very comfortable and spacious with a good selection of breakfast options. Hotel staff friendly and helpful. An hotel with real character and style. Thoroughly recommend a stay there.

<Content>Tripadvisor advises well! We used Tripadvisor to help select this hotel for a short stay last month, and it was the right thing to do (again). Our room was a superior one overlooking the street. Noise was not a problem, but if it had been then we would have just shut the door to the little study (which was on the street side of the bedroom). The room was tall and elegant, immaculately clean, and bright with pleasant classic furnishings. Superb bathroom.Staff were attentive, English-speaking, and nothing seemed to be the slightest problem to them. Lovely breakfasts too in an interesting room with photos of what appears to be old cabaret stars adorning the walls.It's worth noting that you can take one of the frequent S-Bahn trains direct from the main airport (Schonefeld) to Savignyplatz, which is about 500m of easy walking from the hotel (or a quick taxi ride).Also, the hotel is accessed via a shared door (the reception is staffed at all times so there's no problem), then a lift (or stairs) takes you up to the hotel itself.The shops in the vicinity are mostly top designer shops, which gives an indication of the type of area! Head back to Savignyplatz for a selection of great restaurants.

<Content>old style grandeur we recently returned from berlin, having stayed in the askanischer hof hotel for 3 nights. this hotel is is a great location in the middle of k'damm. there are 2 underground stations nearby, and the bus service is handy.the hotel itself is something out of the ordinary. my first thought was that it was a touch of faded grandeur- but in fact the hotel is a touch of class. the room we were given was right next to reception- yet we never heard a noise. the room itself was enormous- and very comfortable. the bathroom was modern and spotless, with a better shower than we have at home!. there was even a little library in the corner of the room . the staff were extrememley courteous and the breakfast was great- its worth asking for a boiled egg just to get the little egg cosy it is served with.berlin is a fantastic city- and really friendly- which i wasn't expecting. the highlights were the holocaust memorial and museum, the reichstag, brandenburg gate and the topography of terror- which would make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck.eating out was reasonably priced and delicious. i would recommend reinhard's restaurant particularly.

<Content>Kurfurstendam gem We stayed 3 nights at the Askansicher Hof, on recommendation of other TripAdviser users. Agree with everything I had read. The hotel is right on the middle of the Ku Dam, nearest underground is 1/4 mile walk. There was no traffic noise, and no noise from reception despite our room being beside the reception hall and breakfast room. Beautiful feel to hotel - it dates from early 1900s and is decorated and furnished in this style with antique furnishings, loads of atmosphere. Beds very comfy, and our room was absolutely enormous, very clean and had a view over the KuDam. Breakfast served from early until 11am, and apparently you can even have it later in your room. Breakfast very plentiful all fresh and lovely rolls, fruit, cheese cold meat as well as various cereals, fruit juice coffee etc. There was some limited room service, very reasonable price eg small pot of coffee for 鈧?. 24 hour reception. Nothing too much trouble. The whole hotel just had a lovely welcoming atmosphere. Don't go there if you want some anonymous modern Holiday Inn type experience, but do go there if you want to experience a snapshot of what a hotel would have been like in the roaring 20s (but with modern comforts and a warm welcome). Very good value for 130鈧?per night inc breakfast.

<Content>Something Different I booked a 4 night trip to Berlin for my girlfriend's 30th and after getting a good deal on Easyjet flights from Glasgow to Berlin Schoenfeld, I decided to try and splash out for a memorable hotel. Rather than choose the rather expensive city centre chain-hotels option I read the reviews on Trip Advisor for Askanischer Hof and checked out their own website for pictures and further info, to discover that this would be something memorable without paying silly money (about 拢90/120Euros per night for BB). One warning about flying Easyjet is that Schoenfeld is a fair bit out of the city. Although I'm sure there are bus and train options we just wanted to get to our hotel so got a cab, which cost over 40Euros. Once we got to the hotel it was immediately clear that this was something different. 15 rooms spread over the first floor of what looks from the front like a nice office building.. Once inside you immediately step back 100 years, with traditional decor and loads of memorabilia in the hotel reception. The reception is small but the staff very friendly and willing to assist. Quietly helpful best describes them. Also very safe because there's someone on reception 24hrs and you have to buzz-in every time you enter the building (even when you stoat home at 4am after a cracking night out at Berlin Club Felix!). Our room was opposite reception next to the breakfast room and everything about it was great other than the bed. A huge room done out in old-fashioned styling (even with a traditional radio that picked up loads of random stations!), but with a really small and a bit uncomfortable double bed. That was my only criticism as a lovely big double bed in the room would have topped off a great hotel room. Hotel is right in amongst the designer shops area of Ku'Damm where there are clearly many Berlin residents with lots of money. You need to walk to the left as you exit the hotel to reach the more mainstream shops and restaurants. And talking of restaurants the best bit of advice I can give is that there is an Italian restaurant just along the road towards the main shopping area, called Petrocellis. Run by Italians and superb food and wine, with a great atmosphere. Other than that I'd recommend Berlin as a great city to visit, and most of the tourist sites are well worth a trip - best probably the zoo, brandenburg gate, reichstag  checkpoint charlie museum.

<Content>very nice very nice hotel. the room they gave me was fantastic, much nicer than I had any reason to expect based on the price. an argument could be made for staying in east berlin where the action is, but there's a s-bahn stop near this hotel that gets you there in ten minutes.

<Content>Great value, great location, great staff Good mix of european and north american guests. Very large, comfortable rooms. Very large breakfast. Even with the ascent of the euro which made this trip a bit more dear traveling on the dollar, the AH was a very well priced and delivered exceptional value.

<Content>A Five Star Experience I had just spent seven days in Berlin in an excellent commercial-type hotel, and I wanted something different for the four nights remaining during my visit; some small place with old-world charm, with the flavor of a pension. I searched the Internet, found the Askanischer Hof, and then walked there from my high-rise hotel, and toured the premises with the very helpful and friendly person at the Askanischer Hof small front desk. I was immediately sold. I particularly liked that my reservation was recorded by hand in an old-fashioned ledger book; no computer programs involved, and no deposit or prepayment required.The Askanischer Hof is located in a posh neighborhood on the upper Kudam. Yves St. Laurent is next door, and both Cartier and Chanel are directly across the street. The hotel is about halfway in between two bus stops (the airport bus serves both stops and is a 20 minute ride away). The Askanischer Hof is on the second floor of a building that was built in the 1890鈥檚, according to one of the tenants I met in the elevator. Originally, the hotel was one large apartment, and then it was expanded to include a second apartment. Now it comprises about 16 rooms, all different, but with high ceilings and plaster decorations in each. My large bathroom had plumbing fixtures manufactured by Villeroy  Boch. My single room was really three rooms---an entry foyer, the bedroom and the bath. In short, the Askanischer Hof is comfortable and reeks of charm.The breakfast, which is included in the daily rate, is served in a large room, which must have been the formal room for receiving guests and entertaining. The breakfast was very good, consisting mostly of a buffet of cold breakfast foods, breads, fruit, plentiful coffee and tea, and eggs cooked to order. I appreciated that breakfast was served until 11:00 AM, because I loved sitting in this elegant and spacious atmosphere, reading the newspaper and planning the day鈥檚 tours, for almost two hours each morning.The front desk is staffed 24 hours a day, and guests can come and go at any hour. I was sorry to leave this wonderful hotel, and I鈥檒l most certainly stay there again upon my return to Berlin. I don鈥檛 know why it is rated only three stars, because for me it was a five star experience.

<Content>Askanischer Hof. What a hotel!!! My family and I stayed in the Askanischer Hof for 5 nights. In summary, we found it excellent value, friendly service, well positioned, and had a relaxing environment.The hotel was centrally located on the Ku'Damn, one of Berlin's main shopping streets. A Louis Vuitton outlet was next store for example, and 100's more either side. The nearest bus stop was 100m away. M19 and M29 were the most popular routes, running every 5/10 minutes, taking one right along the Ku'Damn. The nearest underground stop was Uhlandstra脽e the on the U1 line (5/10 mins. away), following by the Adenauerplatz stop on the U7 line (10/15 mins.)There were four of us in total, including our 11 and 14 year old children. We had a large suite, number 30. This looked down into a quite courtyard. It was beautifully decorated in a classical style. The entire hotel was full of antique furniture and had high ceilings through out. There was a large selection of books too, in English and German.The staff were most friendly and helpful. For example, one of them actually volunteered to post some postcards, when we asked her where was the nearest postbox. In addition, they all had excellent English. The breakfast was a large and a typically German affair. It was served between 06.30 and 11.00am, or in one's room afterwards. Everything was fresh, tasty and well presented. Would definitely stay again!

<Content>Wonderful old style hotel Beautiful old style hotel, lovely big rooms with high ceilings and antique furniture, helpful English speaking staff., wonderful breakfast.I would agree with previous comments - if street noise is likely to disturb you (it didn't bother me) then ask for a courtyard facing room.

<Content>Time Capsule We stayed at the Askanischer Hof for two nights on our first 'toe in the water' visit to Berlin and were as delighted with the hotel as with the city itself. The location on the Kudam is hard to beat. The hotel is tucked away between designer shops (Chanel etc) just west of the Uhlandstrasse metro station. The hotel building appears undistinguished but as you climb the stairs (or take the lift) and open the ornately carved first floor door to the hotel itself you enter into a haven of quirky charm. 1930s is the stylistic watchword and calm prevails. The public areas are relatively limited: A lobby and reception area well stocked with interesting Berlin literature adjoins a bar/breakfast area the walls of which are covered with interesting photographs of old Berlin and its people. Breakfast is huge (well, as big as you want it to be) and can be taken in the breakfast room up until 1100 or in your bedroom at any time. Fantastic! The hotel does not serve dinner but has a good relationship with a restaurant/brasserie across the street (Austria Brasserie) that stays open late and offers good - if somewhat pricey - food.The bedrooms are large and airy and are full of antique furniture and prints. Comfortable beds and a modern ensuite (shower, no bath) plus all you would expect to find in a 3 star hotel bedroom make for a relaxed and easeful stay.All the hotel staff we met were charming, polite and helpful. I was able to check-in for our return flight online and print boarding cards using the hotel's reservation PC. Nothing seemed too much trouble.We would certainly revisit this hotel if we were to return to Berlin as I am sure we will.The room rate we were offered was something like Euro 145 per night, breakfast included. Good value indeed.

<Content>fantastic place Our 2nd year in Berlin and we stayed at the Askanischer Hof for 4 nights during the Berlin Marathon Weekend. What a place! It had so much character, the staff were brilliant nothing was too much trouble The room we stayed in was spotlessly clean and breakfast was excellent. They served from 6.30am until 11am so plenty of time for a lie in if like us you have had a few too many the night before. Maybe not so suitable for children as it was rather quiet but I'm sure children would be most welcome there. The year before we stayed in a hotel nearby which was double the price but there was no comparison. An absolute must to stay in, cannot fault it in anyway. Excellent and 10 out of 10.

<Content>This hotel has everything - even a scale in the bathroom I loved this hotel for its down home comfy style. Our room was large and spacious. It had a TV, mini bar, desk, armoire, table and chairs...even a hat stand in the bedroom portion. The bathrom had a hair dryer, lighted mirror and the usual amenities of soaps, shampoos, shower caps, shoe shine cloths and body lotion. It even had a box of kleenex in the bathroom. And the scale measuring your weight in kilos. I loved it!Breakfast was expansive and even cooked eggs were prepared if desired. The breakfast hours were long - I believe from 6:30 to 11:00. The hotel was close to public transportation and many cafes and restaurants. I would most certainly stay there again and recommend it highly.

<Content>More like a 5 star hotel!! Overall a very relaxing experience staying in this hotel, the staff are very friendly and make you feel at home. Believe me this feels like a 5 star hotel compared to a 3 star, and has a great 1930's quality about it. The rooms are also spotless and the location is great. I've stayed in more expensive hotels and the service has been pathetic compared to the service provided by this great hotel! Highly Recommended!!

<Content>Stay Here in Berlin!!! What a fantastic hotel. The staff are fluent in English and seem to enjoy speaking English to you and are happy for you to try out your German.I appreciated the reviews I read before going to Berlin so much that I felt had to bring my own opinion to everyone.We stayed in room 15. When we walked into the room just like from when we walked into the hotel we were stunned. I knew I had arrived in an authentic Germany with authentic style. Right down to the old style radio, the lights and the sofa. It was such an amazing experience.A lot of reviews mention the breakfast. I looked forward to breakfastevery morning. You have a range of choice such as cereals, (I assume it is custom for German people to have) meats and cheese, basket of bread and the good old egg. Maybe others didn't realise but you have the choice of freshly boiled, fried or my favourite scrambled egg. I loved how the breakfast waitress knew in the mornings I would like scrambed egg and some lovely coffee. The breakfast room in itself is an experience, the decor is so original and some of the big chairs...well I felt like a king.We took the opportunity during our stay to have a few sneaky peeks atsome of the other rooms whilst they were vacant and open for airing.They were all amazing and no two rooms I seen were the same. So I guess I will have to go back another 15 times to experience staying in them all.The location of the hotel is great. A stroll up the Kudamn to wonderful cafe's, restaurant's, buses or train give you access to everywhere and everything with ease.After a few days I thought I could live here.All of the hotel staff were great, the waitresses, room cleaning staff, reception and night porters are just wonderful people. I can't thank them enough.What other hotel has fresh coffee and tea made for you when you are checking out at 4am for an early flight and offers to cook breakfast too? Thankyou cheerful night porter :-)P.S. We realised we forgot to tip guy from reception after he delivered fresh coffee to the room after a long day of sight seeing.But when we're back we'll fix that!!! :-)I think I have some photo's which i'll post later.Who wants to stay in a massive hotel where you are just a number?? Not me!!

<Content>wonderful hotel, would definitely stay there again This hotel is located on the first floor of a building on Ku'Damm. I was a single room, room 22, which faced the courtyard. The room was quiet and comfortable and quite large for a single room (it is always nice to have an armchair as well as the single bed). the bathroom was massive with bath. As metioned in the other reviews the easiest way to reach this hotel is probably the 109 which runs from Tegel airport to the Zoo via Ku'Damm. The 109 also saves the 15 min walk from the Zoo station at the end of a long day of sight seeing. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was very good a good spread of all the usually continental breakfast fare plus a boiled egg.

<Content>look no further Wonderfull place to stay. Especially for romnantic weekends. All the other reviews are right; super atmosphere, high ceilings, delicious breakfast and small-scale charm. Very nice, safe part of the town. Good connection to by Metro (5 minutes walk over the Ku-damm).

<Content>Trip advisor reviewers find another little gem Cannot add much to all the other glowing reviews except to agree. From the moment you ring the front door bell you enter an old world of charm and quiet. We stayed for three nights in a suite. Loved having breakfast served in the room overlooking the little inner courtyard. The staff were helpful friendly and unobtrusive. There are many nice restaurants close by. If designer shopping is your thing you are surrounded by high end shops. One tip for visiting the Reichstag book tea or lunch to avoid the queue. The staff at the hotel have the number and made the reservation for us.

<Content>1st Class This is just a great place to stay. Our double room was spacious, spotlessly clean, with lots of hot water and a power shower. We were facing onto Ku'damm (West Berlin's principal shopping street), but the room had a conservatory (!) between the bedroom and the on-street windows and so we were completely oblivious of any road noise. Breakfasts are ample and served in a wonderfully eclectic room in which Sally Bowles might have held court. The staff are unfussy, but very friendly and extremely helpful. The hotel is on the bus route from Tegel airport (nearest stop 200m ), between two U-Bahn stops (for lines U1 and U2), and a short walk through an up-market residential area (with plenty of bars and restaurants) from Savigny-Platz S-Bahn station. So, with Berlin's excellent public transport system (a travel pass is a great buy), anywhere in the city can easily be reached day or night. Highly recommended.

<Content>Return visit... I had previously stayed here and made it a point to make reservations to stay again on my return to Berlin ! Small hotel that is perfect in every way... helpful, courteous staff. Well worth the price. With the location of the new Train Station in Berlin, this hotel is a little harder to get to (you formerly could walk from the Zoo Station) but I wouldn't stay anywhere else! After all, if I stayed anywhere else, I would miss the honking wedding cars on the Kurdam and it wouldn't be really Berlin !
