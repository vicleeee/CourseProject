<Content>Great ambience What a great hotel. Situated in a very quiet residential street within easy walking distance of most of the major tourist sites in Central Amsterdam. The welcome at reception was very warm and amusing (being told the room was the only one where it is advisable not to be drunk upon entry!). The room was immaculate and very comfortable but a little cold to begin with due to the heating not having been switched on, but this was soon rectified. The bar is very pleasant and spent a very agreeable late Saturday evening in the company of the barman and a Norwegian engineer. The tranquility is marvellous compared to some other Amsterdam city centre hotels I have stayed in. I will definitely use this hotel in future.

<Content>Great base for seeing Amsterdam We stayed here for 4 nights and wanted a nice hotel to use as a base when sightseeing around Amsterdam. It was ideal for us!We got a tram from the central station and then a short walk to the hotel. The hotel is tucked away on some residential streets, so nice to be away from the hustle and bustle. Our room was a good size - big, comfortable bed, ensuite shower room (small but newly refurbished).We were out and about sightseeing so only came back to our room to sleep, but had a good stay and would definitely recommend it. The bedrooms are nice and fresh as have been recently refurbished. It was good value for money.

<Content>Great hotel! We stayed two nights at the Arthur Frommer Hotel over the August bank holiday. The hotel is on a quiet street and is easy-ish to find. The reception area is average but the staff were great and very helpful in finding us places to go, give directions etc. We booked a double room which we thought was fantastic. Really spacious and you could tell the rooms had been recently renovated. The bed was amazingly comfy and we liked the prints on the wall, plasma screen tv etc. The bathroom was on the small side but was fine for us. Breakfast was the standard continental fare with croissants, ham, cheese, fruit juices etc. All in all a great stay and we would definitely recommend it in the future.

<Content>newly renovated hotel the Mercure Arthur Frommer hotel was fantastic.....we booked a triple room which had 3 single beds.the room itself along with the hotel seems to be newly renovated, the bathroom was really nice and the beds were extremely comfortable. the location wasnt the best as it was around a 15-20 minute walk into central Amsterdam but the area itself had some nice cafes and bars where you could relax.

<Content>Great location, very nice room Made my reservation on Accorhotels.com. If you have a firm schedule you can save some money (non-refundable fixed date).ROOM:Reserved for a 3-person room (#108). 2 twin beds plus a third folding-bed ready to sleep. Space is limited for 3 people but that's fine for us to save $$$. Our room faces the little street, which is very quiet at all times despite being on the first floor.Bathroom is huge with a shower. Big mirrors and plenty of bathroom accessories. Only wish they had a shower curtain. But it's still awesome.It has a LCD TV with remote. Fridge with drinks in it. A desk with lamp. Big closets and an extra pillow in it.LOCATIONLocation is just fine. Amsterdam is smaller than it looks on the maps. You can walk to the Central Station easily in 20mins. Or you can take any tram that goes to that direction (#16, 24, 25). Tram station is just outside, right in the middle of stations Keizersgracht and Weteringcircuit. Trams are always available. Never had to wati for more than 15mins.STAFF/INFOThe room was reserved under my name but I arrived late. They let my company check in first without much trouble. Staff have been helpful and there are resources for tourists at the front desk. Hotel has wireless available with credit card, unless you have subscribed to T-mobile's hotspot program.SURROUNDINGSIf you get off from Tram at Weteringcircuit there is a little diner that opens until 12am. Try it's Doner sandwich, it's really tasty and cheap :)Overall we are very happy to have found this cheap(er) option of lodging in Amsterdam. Because everything is not too far away, it's well worth it!

<Content>Perfect I booked the hotel through flying blue miles for 3 nights for me, my wife and my 16th months' son. Everyone was really very friendly, the rooms are extremely clean and nice, breakfast rich and of very good quality and the area, where the hotel is, very quiet. Also it is located close to the centre of the town and we could reach all the places we were intereseted to visit by foot, which was very important especially considering that we were travelling with a small kid.End of the day we were very happy about it and, in case we are back in Amsterdam, this hotel will be our first choice.

<Content>We liked this hotel. We just returned from 8 days in Amsterdam, and we stayed at the Mercure Hotel--the one downtown, not the fancy new one out by the airport.This hotel is old and looks it here and there, but it's clean, most of the staff are quite friendly and helpful, and it's an easy walk to the tram. We found the bathroom quite nice, tho a shower curtain would have prevented water going all over. Our room had a little closet with good hangers and several shelves. The bed--oh, that bed!!! SO-O-O-O comfy!! Fluffy pillows and a duvet contributed to a good night's sleep. We got clean towels every day, the carpet was vacuumed daily, and the bed was made daily.The breakfast costs E15/person. There is a good variety of American cold cereals, granola, several kinds of juice, rolls, the usual beverages, and you can have your eggs cooked anyway you want. The bartender, Amin, has a great sense of humor and is a very interesting person to chat with.Yes, we'd stay here again.

<Content>Looked better on the website than in person. We booked through Airmiles to stay 2 nights at this hotel. The Airmiles pictures definitely make the hotel look more luxurious than it is in person. The fixtures and furnishings in the bedroom are ready for refurbishment and the bathroom needs a deep clean. The location is ideal for exploring Amsterdam and there are tram links close by. Don't hail a cab unless you can speak Dutch because we were truly ripped off; I don't think the taxi driver realised we had been in Amsterdam for a couple of days and had walked the road numrous times when he took the scenic route and charged us E15 for what should have been a 3km journey. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is good - healthy and fresh with plenty of choice, but don't expect service with a smile. General value for money was about average, I reckon.

<Content>A Great Location Good location, quiet, yet within very easy walkingdistance to the main shops and bars and restaurants.Trams 16, 24, 25 run from close by to city centre tickets can be purchased from most shops.Trams are every few minuets, so you are never waiting around for long. On arriving at Schiphol airport, and not knowing our way around,we went to the tourist information desk and bought a return ticketfor the shuttle bus, which took us right to our hotel. If you have never been to Amsterdam before like us, then I can recommend you use this or you may never know how to get to the hotel. For 19 euros it was easy.The hotel staff are all very helpful and polite, the rooms are basicand well maintained, and not bad size wise, which were cleaned every day. They have a free safe deposit box, T V with some English channels as well as Dutch.The bathrooms are average in size with shower, however the showers do not have doors, and water goes all over the bathroom floor unless you turn the shower head against the wall, but there is always plenty of hot water.Continental breakfast, with a good variety on offer.Part of the hotel is none smoking, which suited us fine.You must buy a good map, don鈥檛 rely on the small free maps that are given away. Always be careful of the cyclists, they don鈥檛 give a dam and seem to have right of way, they don鈥檛 bother to stop if you get in their way.The Anne Frank museum is well worth a visit, but be warned, it鈥檚 a very moving experience.The Heineken experience is also a must. For 10 euros you get about 3 hours of fun and drinking.We certainly had a good time at the Arthur Frommer, and can recommend this hotel to the more mature traveller.

<Content>Not So Much Pros: Good location. Very friendly staff.Cons: Hotel is run down. Clean, but need some attention paid to it. Room was really small. Located in an alleyway, which made getting home at night a little scary.Bottom Line: Basic hotel if you're looking for something cheap, but I wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Noiisy and run down hotel in sweetlocation I enjoyed the location of the hotel, but the room had a very worn out, dated look to it, and the bathroom was ridiculously funky. The carpet seemed unclean, the blankets and pillows very old and uninviting. Most annoying was the low level of sound proofing in the facility--this is a good hotel for people who don't mind the sound of doors slamming day and night. Many of the guests seemed to have little regard for others' sleep; there was lots of hollering out in the hall. The windows could use improvement, as even on the quiet street we faced, there were motorists and drunken revelers passing by in the wee hours of the night. While some of the desk clerks we encountered there were helpful and professional, one was downright rude about giving directions to the VanGogh museum upon our arrival and another was curt and impatient. Breakfast was just so-so; we only ate there once and preferred to walk to Village Bagel on the main street. Unfortunately, the main street leading to Noordestraat was all torn up and under construction, which gave our approach to the property an industrial, unpleasant feel. But once we wandered through the canal streets east of the hotel, we fell under the spell of Amsterdam. We wished we'd opted for a hotel on a canal, with a little more charm. The Mercure Arthur Frommor was just utilitarian.

<Content>Friendly Hotel We spent 3 nights at the Mercure at the beginning of June. The hotel is about 20-25minute walk from Dam Square though the trams are only 5 minutes away. It situated in a pleasant area of quiet streets and canals.The room was fine though maybe in need of a fresh coat of paint but it was clean and tidy. What we most liked was the friendly staff. Our Airmiles package included breakfast which we felt would have been a bit pricey if we had to pay the 15 Euros each.We would certainly return there if back in Amsterdam.

<Content>Great Location, Quiet, Clean Great location if you are in Amsterdam for a few days. Clean and quiet neighborhood.We used trams No 16, 24 and 25 in and out all day (trams stop at Wettering Cirquit which is a 2 minute walk from the hotel). You should buy a - 24h or 48h or 72h - discount pass (available at Central Station) because it saves you a lot and can also be used for buses (including night bus).Breakfast is continental buffet and we felt it is overpriced for EUR15 pp per day - even if they can serve it to your room. Try walking to the bagel corner spot which is 3 blocks north, on your way to downtown - locals feel at home there, you should too. Or, walking south, try breakfast at the caroussel right on the Wettering Cirquit, you cant miss it. In other words, if you really dont need breakfast in bed, then there is something for you within walking distance.We are satisfied with the reception desk service. They will spend time with you to make sure you are happy with the information, they will offer alternatives and book almost anything for you. They will store your luggage if you need that on your last day. When we brought in an applepie and asked for utensils they responded in no time.The room (we stayed at 222 non-smoking) was clean - and they kept it that way. Room temp was fine, we never felt cold. It was rather small but we never felt we needed more space. The mini-bar was ok and fairly priced. No problem with the bed. Bathroom has no tub, but 24hour hot water plus bath amenities make up for that. Good space for your clothes. Also, laundry service availability - at a charge. Free safe, we liked that. Not much of a room view, but we did not care for that. TV with limited options but who visits Amsterdam for that.There is no restaurant in the hotel. There is a steakhouse right outside with very tasty food, but the steaks couldnt get any smaller - prices ok though. The persian restaurant nextdoors offers much more for less and surprizing good quality, we would eat there again on any casual occassion. Good reasturants you will also find near the meusem square.You will notice a very small pastry shop on your right, just around the corner, walking north to downtown. It is considered one of Amsterdams best. Do buy sth, you wont regret it, all those locals flocking in every afternoon cant be that wrong.In Amsterdam, do take some time to visit the south part of the city (city meaning the greater Amsterdam area, not just the centre, buy yourself a real map), the most expensive real estate there, along a great park with lakes. You will be happy to lose the bar scene and coffee shop picture that so wrongly profiles this city and notice Dutch people on their daily activities - we felt they are lively people with broad interests and we were very happy to have met some of them. Outside the city, take a tour or two to the country, yes it is pricey but - hey- you get to be part of the real country for a change.If we were not to upgrade to a 4* or a 5* next time we visit Amsterdam, we would stay at Arthur Frommer.

<Content>Grat weekend location Our group of 14 despite our late friday evening arrival were welcomed efficiently  checked in quickly to our small clean ensuite rooms. The buffet breakfast is adequate with eggs  toast made to order. The hotel is in a quiet location but in easy walking distance of all the main sights. On saturday evening our group enjoyed dinner at the local steakhouse recommended in earlier revies. food was good  cost reasonable. On checking out we were able to store our luggage at the hotel  enjoy a full day on the sunday. At the end of our stay all were happy with this 3 star hotel  would recommend to others planning a weekend in Amsterdam.

<Content>A hotel that's well worth considering We've just returned from a two night break to Amsterdam where we stayed in the Mercure Arthur Hotel. The hotel is located about 4-5 tram stops from Central Station (Trams 16 and 24 do the trick, and a 48 hour tram pass at 10 euros, at the hotel or on the tram, should be considered for getting out and about during your stay). The taxi from Cenral Station cost us 13 Euros which equated to approximately a 20 minute walk. The hotel is near enough to walk to all the central attractions, but far enough out that you can get an undisturbed night. Another plus for the location is the proximity to the Riksmuseum which is only a 5 minute walk away. Although the hotel buffet is adequate, you may get chance, during your booking to opt out of it and save the cost of 15 euros. This could be well spent in one or two of the local bars and cafes nearby. The hotel reception staff were friendly and helpful during our check-in and throughout our stay. On opening the door to our room, we must admit there was a bit of a musty smell but that disappeared within a minute and other than that, we were quite please with the cleanliness of the room and the standard of fixtures and fittings (bearing in mind it was only a 3* hotel). The mini bar was adequately stocked and not over priced. So, to sum up, we'd happily recommend this hotel to most people for a weekend break as long as they bear in mind it's a 3* NOT 5*!!

<Content>Clean Hotel for the dollars This hotel was in a hidden area off of Noordestraat - but not so hidden you couldn't find it. Once you arrive in Amsterdam Central train station go to the front of the station and take tram number 24. This tram will take you to Wetering Circle which is where you will get out. Do not stop at Kerkestraat(sp) it is much further. The reason is that there has been a tram eliminated (no 25) from service due to the construction on a new part of the metro system. This construction is due to last until 2011. Once you get out at Wetering Circle backtrack one street. Look down the avenue and you will see the Mercure sign - it truly was easy to find. I would not suggest having a car - there are only 6 spaces in front of the hotel. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. They are able to book Key Tours from the hotel desk. This was very nice as we did the Dutch Countryside Tour. It was a six hour tour. My suggestion is that if you have a day - do the Grand Holland Tour - it is 8 hours and includes the Delft, Rotterdam, Hague. The hotel rooms are small - but typical Europe size. About 10x10 plus the bath. There are no washclots so if you use one - you should bring your own. The room was very clean. The showers have no doors so the floor tends to get a little wet if you point the sprayer in the wrong direction. The hairdryer worked great - which is unusual for a hotel. We were in room 302 and it was pretty quiet - we had another relative traveling with us - in room 307 and he said it was noisy all night long, doors slamming and people yelling. With regards to the breakfast - they have a continental breakfast at the hotel. It is really not worth the 15 Euro they charge. However, there isn't much close around for breakfast so we had it 2 mornings. There is cold cereal, juice, coffee, pastries, coldcuts and cheese, fruit on one morning. They will make you eggs - you have to specify what kind. They are mediocre at best. The front desk will sell you 48 hour tram passes, they are a good deal - unless you buy a strippenkart from the bookstore at central station. There are a few coffeeshops right around the corner for those of you interested and a great Italian place recommended by those at the hotel front desk on the main street past the tram stop.

<Content>Very good hotel The hotel is very good and clean. It鈥檚 a 5 minute walk to Flower Market and other attractions, so very close to the city centre, but in a quiet street. There are plenty of nice restaurants and bars nearby.Staff at reception were helpful and friendly. The only weird thing is that the cleaning lady knocked at the door at 9:30 AM (on the 2 mornings we stayed there) and within one second she was inside the room 鈥?not very good for privacy鈥?Apart from that everything else was fine. Would stay there again and recommend it.

<Content>Really nice, good value hotel This is a funny hotel, because even though it's part of the Accor chain, it hasn't changed into one of the bland, neutral hotels that seem to be springing up all over the place. It is a very traditionally decorated hotel i.e. dark carpet, wooden furniture, patterned curtains and bedspread etc, but I really love it! I travel a lot with my job and stay in a lot of hotels, most of which are the modern ones I mention. I don't find anything wrong with them, but I find this one very charming.The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, the rooms are comfortable, the mini-bar is great value (and has chocolate and crisps in it, yum), very well located (although I would have to rely on the others on here, as I only go to my office and back)! They do a breakfast, and I always have this brought up to my room - they are incredibly prompt with it and it's the traditional continental breakfast - a couple of rolls, cheese, ham, croissant, jams, apple, yoghurt etc, but always does the trick for me.They also have BBC1 and 2 on, tragic of me to be so concerned I know, but especially if you're away on business on your own it can be very helpful to know these things!The bathrooms are fairly small and don't have a bath, but the shower is large (not the most powerful, but it does the job) and always toiletries and plenty of towels.I don't know what it is that I like so much about this place, but I always have a good stay, never have problems and would thoroughly recommend it on that basis.Incidentally, the area is very quiet as it's a residential area, but if you do want to make sure, ask for a room which doesn't overlook the car park, it's only small but it's where the main doors are so you will hear people coming back from nights out etc.2 restaurants within 1 minutes walk - a steakhouse (very popular) and a Persian restaurant next door to it - went in here one day because the steakhouse was full and have been going back ever since - great food and service.

<Content>Lovely and quiet location I would agree with most of what the previous reviewer has commented on. The selling point is the lovely quiet, off the beaten track location. The walk into the major area of the city is only 10 mins and covers a route that has many less touristy restaurants.The hotel itself appears to have been rebranded as Mercure in the last few years, and I can imaging that it would have been a quaint private hotel in days gone by. The reception staff were great on arrival (room ready at 11am) but a certain recptionist named Bruno was pretty stressed when I checked out, blaming me for giving him the wrong room number for my account when I spoke clearly and even handed him my room pass with it written on. He was also 'huffy' about storing our bags for 4 hours before we left, even though they had the facility and we had checked with other receptionists earlier. Apart from him, the staff were great. I would stay here again, but I would use the Bagel shop around the corner for breakfast and I would drink at the Marybelle bar opposite the French Consulate (on the main road in the direction of the 'Tehran' restaurant).

<Content>Good Location Have stayed here a couple of times. The hotel is basic for the cost and so much more could be done with it based on its great heritage. The hotel doesn't offer much by way of facilitys, expensive breakfast and a small dingy bar but the rooms are comfy dispite being very basic but have some charm about them. The loctaion is the best thing as it's in a quiet residential area next to a small school yet it is only a short walk to all the main areas. That is the main reason I always choose this hotel.

<Content>Excellent value We visited this hotel in late March, and found it to be really agreable.It is in a perfect location - tram stops are a few minutes walk from it in either direction - to Leidseplein or the Dam and all other tourist attractions in between.Or if the weather is nice (it was freeezing last week) you can easily walk to everywhere.Hotel staff were pleasant and helpful, the room was a decent size, with comfortable beds, tv, mini bar, and large shower room.Breaksfast room/Bar was a decent size. Can't fault the hotel at all really.. would throuoghly recommend as it is very comfortable. In a good location, but also benefits from being in a quiet street away from the hustle and bustle.Would thoroughly recommend. Enjoy your stay.

<Content>Just what we were looking for Good quality hotel, just as expected from Mercure. Good value for money, clean, very quiet, curtains cut out light totally allowing a nice long lie in and there was a lovely steakhouse restaurant just down the road which seemed popular with the locals. Close to 2 tram stops into the centre, but only a 10-15 minute walk if that doesn't bother you.

<Content>Good service, good location Stayed here 13 - 16 February 2005 in one room with 2 adults and 2 kids (room 227). Hotel is central but still a walk to most sites. Van Gogh Museum and Rijksmuseum are just under a 10 minute walk away. These are the closest main attractions. Tram lines are close. When we arrived they knew our name, was impressed not to be another number. Breakfast was OK, asked for eggs and they came one minute later. Room was clean and very reasonable. Walls could have done with a clean. No bath only shower and the toilet is too close to the sink and is not comfortable. Price was excellent.

<Content>Cheap, clean and with amenities! (a/c in all rooms). I cannot believe the prior posts. My experience in this hotel was excellent! CHEAP, CLEAN and with FRIENDLY STAFF. Clean air conditioned rooms, bathroom including amenities (soap, shampoo, lotion), very friendly staff always willing to help you with directions and maps and well located (1 1/2 block away from the nearest tram stop). A grocery store is 1 block away, a couple of restaurants are about 160 feet from the hotel and the Heineken Museum is a short walk distance.This hotel is now part of the Accor chain hotels. Maybe those awful experiences I read in the prior reviews happened before this Mercure Frommer hotel acomplishes the Accor standard.I totally recommend this hotel for young people with a controlled budget.

<Content>Dont' take notice of other reviews! Can't believe the two reviews I've just read. Just returned from Mercure Amsterdam (April 04) and it was fine. Staff very courteous, most comfortable large double bed I've ever had in a hotel, clean, etc. Also clean WC and 'wet style' shower. Nice white fluffy towels. Only thing wrong was no tea or coffee making facilities, but they had satellite TV. Hard to find hotel though, when you arrive at airport, train to Amsterdam Central and then Tram 24 or 25. Just ask, ask ask! the natives are friendly. Thoroughly recommended.

<Content>Terrible place I stayed at the Mercure Arthur Frommer this summer and the temperature went up to tropical hights. It was hell at night altough they claim to have airconditioning. The barman was smelly and was asking for a tip! Brutally! To make things even worse: the night porter was drunk!! I complained to the manager but she tried to blame me!! Never, never, never stay at this hotel

<Content>Hated the Mercure Why do the advertise with a/c when they switch it off at eleven in the evening? When I complained to the night-receptionist I could't understand a word he was saying. I think he comes from Pakistan or something. The general manager did't listen to my complaint she was more interested in her ugly little dog.
