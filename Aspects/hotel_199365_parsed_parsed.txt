<Content>Great time at Upstalsboom My husband and 2 sons booked into the Upstalsboom Hotel at the end of August 08. On check in we were given an upgrade which was great to a room which had self catering facilities if we wanted them. Our sons had a twin room - both our rooms were immaculate. The staff were exceptionally helpful. The hotel was spotless. The selection at breakfast was really good and the food was great value. The hotel was really handy for the S bahn which we used all the time. We bought a 72 hour ticket from the hotel reception which was handy. The nearest S Bahn was Warschauer Strasse which is on the main line from the airport and goes to places like Alexanderplatz and Hackesher Marke. Definately recommend this one. Lovely hotel, good food and real handy for all the sights.

<Content>Excellent We stayed for 3 nights and it couldn't have been better. The hotel is very clean, staff are polite and friendly and the rooms are comfortable. The area is very young and dynamic. A few mins walk away is Simon-Dach-Straè„½e with loads of great bars/restaurants. The S-Bahn is 10 mins walk from the hotel. Highly Recommended!

<Content>Good if you can see past the area As other reviewers have stated, the one drawback is the initial view of the area the hotel is in.First - the positives....It's quite reasonable if you are in a couple...not so much if you are on your ownThe Breakfast is good - not brilliant but certainly good enough an above average.The rooms are large.The bathrooms are clean and modern.The staff are friendlyThe terrace garden is nice.Nightlife in the area is very good indeed. Resonably priced and good quality for the average traveller. very studenty but at the same time very atmospheric.Warschauer StrasseStation is 5 mins away and trains to the centre of Berlin are frequent and take about 15 mins.BUTThe station, by anyone's standard is ROUGH....Many homeless hanging around the entrance and a lot of dodgy looking people aroundBUTWe never felt threatened...there was never any sense of impending doom and although there was a lot of drinking on the street around the station, there was never any feeling that there would be trouble.If you are prepared for the poor look of the area, this is definitely a good place to stay. You'll have a great time along the various roads near to the hotel. We found there was no need to go into Berlin for the evenings as all you could need with regard to Bars and restaurants was in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.One more thing - the lack of Air Con could make it pretty uncomfortable in Summer

<Content>This Hotel Is a Gem!!! What a great hotel! We stayed 2 weeks and enjoyed it immensely. It's in a quiet neighborhood not far from trams and S-Bahn and U-Bahn lines. There are many great restaurants nearby with very reasonable prices. ( Friedrichshain has become a very popular spot with Berliners for bars and restaurants.)Our room was lovely - very cool even on hot days. When we arrived, the hotel upgraded our room, at no charge, due to the length of our stay! The front desk staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay.Every morning, as my husband headed off for an early morning walk, he was greeted in the lobby by a waitress with a cup of coffee to take with him. (he didn't even ask for this service!)The breakfast buffet is unbelievable. We have eaten at many European breakfast buffets and this is one of the very best. Fresh, gourmet quality food!The hotel offers free internet in the lobby, has a lovely restaurant, bar, and exercise facilities. All of this at extremely reasonable prices ( esp. if you book online).

<Content>Can recommend Upstalsboom Hotel, Berlin This hotel is well located for getting to all the interesting areas of Berlin. An easy five minute walk to the S-Bahn. The hotel was easy to find, quick and efficient reception service. The room was large and very clean. Breakfast was brilliant. The whole hotel impressed me. At first glance the area seemed a little doubtful but it was absolutely fine to walk around late evening and we felt very safe. There are some nice pubs and restaurants close by so all in all we really felt this was a good choice and we would stay here again.

<Content>awesome hotel Decided on the upstalboom after reading a few reviews and them being the only hotel with a triple room.We got to the upstalboom just before midnight to be greeted by a smiley receptionist very quick and easy check in. The room was Big with two single beds and one fold out sofa bed. The bathroom was basic with toilet and shower(no bath) and a washing basin. Our highlight was the fridge it was HUGE and we could fit all our alcohol in it.Breakfast-Really good, good choice of cold cuts/cheeses, Cereals different types of breads. Hot foods sausages/eggs/hashbrowns. Lots of different choices of teas and juices. Fresh cakes-i recommend the cheesecake if you are so lucky to get some. We didnt it went really quickly and they didnt bring out anymore.There is a gym and sauna room which i didnt use but had a look at. very basic gym and small sauna room. Internet terminal we read was free didnt manage to use it as they had a private function in the room you need to go through to get to the terminal. It also has a printer too. Unfortunatly the thing we were looking forward to most is the roof terrace bar but it was closed due to cold weather and snow.Otherwise everything in hotel was good and for the price you couldnt ask for a better hotel in a great location.We found it easier to get the the hotel from Warschaser Strabe (5-10mins walk), which has all the S/U Bahn lines so easy to get to from the airport.Lots of bars and restaurants nearby on Simon Dach Strabe.

<Content>A real gem! We arrived at the hotel tired and hungry but from the moment we entered the bright welcoming reception area to stepping into a lovely clean room we knew we had made a good choice. Staff were friendly and helpful, the evening buffet was inexpensive whilst allowing us to sample some German food without the risk of going hungry! The breakfast (bread rolls, jam, cereals, meats, cheeses, bacon, sausage, scrambled egg, salad, fruit etc etc) was filling and an excellent preparation for a day's sightseeing!The room was comfortable and airy, the roof garden terrace is a must although we didn't find it until our last night! Some fantastic views when clear.All in all an excellent value for money base to explore everything that Berlin has to offer. We are definitely returning next year!

<Content>Very good and not so good I stayed at the Upstalsboom Hotel from May 25 to May 28, 2007. This was my sixth or seventh visit to Berlin and first stay at the Upstalsboom. The Good: The hotel is very clean. It is fairly new construction which is something I like in a hotel. It is located in a residential neighborhood, about 10 minutes from the nearest train and there are some convenient local food markets and restaurants.The staff is fantastic. They answered all my questions cheerfully, made dinner reservations for me, called taxis, gave directions and never hesitated to help out. I have stayed in luxury hotels where the level of service wasn't as good. The hotel has a beautiful roof garden where you can relax and have something to drink or just sit and read. The breakfast buffet was good and the dining room was pleasant. There is a computer for free high speed internet access.The not so good: My room was an attic room with a sloping roof. There was a large widow on the sloped roof and it was right over the bed. Since it was unseasonably warm and there is no ventilation in the hotel rooms I left the window open the first day and there was a severe rain/hail storm. The water poured in and onto my bed. The next day I closed the window when I left. Once again there was a severe storm. When I got back I found that the cleaning staff had left the window open and the water had once again poured onto the bed. Both times the front desk attendant came up to my room and very cheerfully changed the bedding and carried away the soaked blankets and pillows. I would suggest that if you are given one of these top floor rooms during the warmer months you might ask to be changed to another floor. Also, with no air conditioning the rooms in this hotel get very, very warm. I would probably choose a different hotel were I to return between May and September.Another negative about the room is that it had a door to the adjacent room. There was absolutely no sound proofing so the first night I had the very loud sound of the tv next door booming through my room until 1am. That guest checked out the next day and it was quiet from then on out.Bottom Line: I would stay in this hotel again if I could be sure not to be on the top floor and it was not summer weather.

<Content>Great Hotel Just returned from 3 nights at this hotel and it was really great! We were able to check in at about 11am even though the usual check in is 3pm, so it was fantastic dumping our bags and getting out to explore. The hotel accommodation was brill, lovely massive and clean rooms; breakfast was tasty and had loads of options. Hotel is located on the eastern side of the city, and although not central as such, the transport links for the U-bahn and S-bahn are so convenient you donéˆ¥æª› really notice. The nearest U and S-bahn is Warschauer strasse which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. (Though I do recommend you print yourself a street map before you go, if youéˆ¥æª™e going to do like we did and go from airport to hotel by public transport) - Nothing like trapsing round with your case, trying to find your accommodation!! - Overall Upsatlsboom was a great base from which to explore Berlin, and really pleased we stayed somewhere like this rather than the sky skrapper style hotels located in the city.Jem, Kidderminster

<Content>Hotel okay but not 4 star We booked this hotel to visit the Christmas markets in Berlin.The Hotel website states it is 350 metres from the nearest railway station (Warschauer Str). I personally would say it is at least 500 metres, which was misleading for me as I travelled with a 2 year old.The hotel also states it has a shower/bath combination and if you are looking for a nice soak in a bath after seeing the sights, you will not get one as NONE of the rooms have baths they only have showers.The buffet breakfast is however excellent, with a wide variety of choice and runs from 0630 to 1030.The room was okay and comfortable, with the bathroom being very clean and well presented. let down by the quality of towels.Overall, value for money, not in a great part of the city (at night), and not in my opinion 4 star.

<Content>A great all rounder!! I stayed at the Upstalsboom for three nights with my girlfriend on our recent trip to Berlin. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in an excellent location. To begin it only takes five minutes walk from the hotel to either the S-bahn and the U- bahn. The S-bahn can have you back at Schoenenfeld airport in 35mins and only takes 10mins max into the city centre. The area around the hotel has a lot to offer. Literally across the road is an excellent bar called éˆ¥æ¥¬irschéˆ¥? which I recommend and a five minute walk away on Simon-Dach Strasse there is an uncountable amount of bars restaurants and take aways available. The bars around hear where also very good, especially Dachkammer Bar, that I did not need to go into central Berlin to find nightlife as it was already on the doorstep. There is also a flea market in Boxhagener Platz on a Sunday which if you stay in this area should not be missed. The stuff on sale is amazing. The hotel is clean and functional and the hotel staff are very friendly and speak excellent English which is good as my German is pretty poor. The breakfast provided by the hotel is excellent and should not be missed. On the weekend if you get down late it may be hard to get a table. So that must be a good sign. Enjoy!

<Content>A Change at the Upstalsboom Stayed here during World Cup, rate reflected that.Spotless room, large fan in place of Air Con. Excellent breakfast, secure parking. Very helpful staff.A lively area making an interesting contrast to the West where we had stayed the previous week.Would stay again although maybe not if in the car as it was a full half hour longer to get to than the west, obviously depending on where you were coming from and where you were going to if travelling around when you were there. Often the case with locations near a river too.Station referred to is Warschau Strasse, stations around here also S Bahn as well as underground, U Bahn.

<Content>Excellent hotel Located in a relatively quiet area in supposedly trendy east Berlin. It's about 5-10 mins walk from two diffenent U-/S-Bahn stations (Frankfurter Tor and Warsheinstrasse {?}). The hotel itself is fairly bland and business-like, but the rooms are spotless and large. The breakfast is exceptionally good.Overall, it's good, basically. Some good bars nearby, too.

<Content>Superb value The Upstalsboom Hotel Friedrichshain provides superb value to a visitor to Berlin. Located near the metro station, it serves as a good starting point to reach Alexanderplatz, Zoogarten, KaDeWe, Brandenburg Gate, Sony Centre, etc.,.. The attached restaurant serves hearty breakfasts. There are trendy bars, pubs, and bistros nearby that are away from the usual tourist spots. The rooms are spacious and bathrooms are spotless.
