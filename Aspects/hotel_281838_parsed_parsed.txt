<Content>Highly recommended The hotel is very short walk from Florence's central Santa Maria Novella train station and probably just less than a 10 minute walk into the centre of Florence. There's a lot of hotels in the centre of Florence, but it's actually quite nice to escape the tourist hordes at the end of the day when you wander back to the hotel. The hotel staff were very efficient and helpful and spoke very good English. They are able to book you advance museum tickets if you haven't already done it yourself. The hotel itself is full of old world charm, lots of dark wood, chesterfield couches etc. The room was really charming as well, great comfy bed (if you like your bed on the firm side, which I do), painted fresco ceilings, and, not that you'll probably spend that much time in Italy watching the box, but they have English language channels on the tele (hooray!!). If you want to be picky, the breakfast wasn't that flash and you probably wouldn't bother to spend long in the shower, but for the price, it's an excellent place to stay in Florence. Will definitely return there the next time I visit.

<Content>Inconsistent Room Price I traveled into Florence at the last minute and called a few hotels. The Adler C. had a room available - double room, single occupant for 140Euro. This is about the average rate for this area - close to the City Center for a standard hotel.I ended up needing to stay an extra day and asked at the desk if they had a room available for the additional night. The answer was yes that they did, but the price was different - now 195Euro! The reason given was that the rate the day before was a special walk in rate. That's ridiculous - Felt a lot like gouging to me.I walked down the street one block and got a room at the Rivoli Hotel for less than the first rate at the Adler - for just as nice a room and just as nice a hotel.

<Content>Loved the Adler Cavalieri We had a 5 day stay at Adler Cavelieri in August and it was a most enjoyable stay. The staff were friendly and helpful. the rooms were clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was also very clean and provided us with everything from lotions and shampoo to shoe cleaning materials. The bed linen and towels were replaced daily. The room was spacious and the hotel was quiet. We even had our own balcony which was a pleasure to sit out on whilst having a nightcap. The Hotel itself was well within walking distance from all the main sights so even after a tiring day walking round the Boboli gardens we were never more than 15 minutes walk from the hotel. Breakfast (hot  cold) was good and plentiful. To sum it up when we next visit Firenze i would definitely be staying at the Adler and strongly recommend anyone considering Firenze for a holiday to stay there too. You won't be disappointed.

<Content>Great Place  We stayed here for 4 nights, and the experience was excellent. For euro hotels the room was spacious and kept to a high standard. Only minor point was that they are strict about no ironing in the room and no in room tea/coffee in normal double rooms.However if you are travelling with a laptop they provide free internet in the rooms (decent speed ~2mbps) ask at reception for pass code.Its less than a 5min walk from the station, so is a perfect base for visiting florence and surrounding towns/cities. The italian train system is cheap and v.reliable. While there we visitied places like Pisa (1hr) and Viareggio (beaches 1hr 20mins) by train.Also the staff are very friendly and it is based near a variety of restaurants/bars and clubs.

<Content>Great Hotel Wife and I stayed in Florence for 3 days in July. As others have said, the hotel is right next to the train station (make sure you exit the station to the right after getting off the train). More importantly, all the sights are well-within walking distance.The hotel itself was very nice; clean rooms, nice bathrooms, helpful staff. All of the staff I encountered spoke English very well, and didn't seem to resent having to do so. The breakfast was very good, with a good combination of European treats and American standards.All in all, a very comfortable stay and one I would highly recommend to anyone planning to travel to Florence.

<Content>Great Experience I and my wife loved our 3 night stay at Adler Cavalieri. We arrived by at Florence by train from Rome. Hotel is close to the station: we had no trouble walking to the hotel with once piece luggage each. Room was well furnished, bathrooms have modern fittings. Breakfast with hot choices was a good start each morning - we later stayed at a more expensive hotel in Rome with all cold/frozen breakfast choices. Our room (#113) even had a private walkout nook/balcony. All attractions in city center are a few minutes walk from the hotel. Staff were very helpful: helped get tickets for Pisa tour and getting us a printed a train schedule from the web for our return trip. We wish we would have utilized them fro tickets to Ufizi gallery and avoided more than an hour in the line on day #2.SMAurora, IL

<Content>Wonderful Stay We recently returned from a 12 day trip through Nice, Florence and Rome, and stayed at the Adler during our 3 day stay in Florence. Out of the 3 hotels on our trip, this one was absolutely our favorite! The rooms were larger than I expected, always clean, well furnished and very comfortable. Above and beyond that, the staff was impeccable. Not only did they recommend amazing restaurants that were off the beaten path, they readily made reservations for us, offered assistance in setting up tours and spoke English very well. We were a bit hesitant at first about the neighborhood at night, but it was completely fine. We would highly recommend to anyone who wants to have a comfortable stay in Florence!

<Content>Best European Hotel I just got back from a two week trip to Italy. Originally, I had planned on only spending 5 nights in Florence. After only 3 nights in Firenze, I decided to stay for the majority of my trip there, after I fell in love with the city, and with my hotel. The hotel is located extremely close to the train station, and within walking distance of everything the city has to offer. I stayed for 11 nights at the hotel, and the price of the room varied between $110 to $140, depending on the night. The avg. cost per night during my stay, was around $127.00For a European hotel, the size of my room was larger than what I expected. The bathroom was extremely modern, and the daily breakfast served was very good. I can't compliment the Hotel Staff enough. They all spoke english extremely well, and new the city better. It would be very easy to show up to this hotel, without having anything planned to do during your stay, and work on the suggestions of the staff alone. I'm not sure how the price of this hotel compares to other's within the city. However, I have stayed at other hotels in Rome,Italy (for the same price, or more) and have been extremely disappointed with my room, and with the hotel staff. Florence, is my new favorite city to visit, and I can guarantee I will only stay at this hotel. Take my advice, stay here if your going to Florence.

<Content>a few things about the Adler Cavalieri My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Adler Cavalieri last month. And although I have to say that at first I wasn't sure about what to expect, at the end of my 3-day stay I came to the conclusion that this hotel may very well rank among the best hotels I've ever been in. This was a very special occasion for me and my wife - our first vacation together since being tranferred to Rome from Los Angeles. AnywayFirst let me say that the room we stayed in had a very lovely terrace overlooking a nice garden. The bathroom was covered with beautiful marbles and had a wood ceiling. Breakfast was served in charming little austrian caf猫-like room. Food was fresh and the staff very friendly and attentiveA special thanks, though, to the amazing staff of the reception desk. They really made our stay most memorable. They arranged a beautiful bouquet of roses for my wife, provided us with the best massage service, check out they're wellness centre, recommended the best restaurants in Florence, got me tickets for the Uffizi and the Accademia - just a few extra dollars but that saved us a lot of time (don't buy them on the internet, they're more expensive and if you change your mind kiss your money good-bye). Finally I would definetely recommed this hotel to my best friends and to anyone who really need to get away for a few days

<Content>Great Hotel This is a great hotel located in the heart of Florence, right next door to the train station. The room was large and very clean, the bathroom was very impressive. The staff were helpful and friendly and helped my wife and I to obtain tickets to watch the local football team, Fiorentina, play. They also charged my ipod for me when the battery had run out!The breakfast bar was superb and included both hot and cold food and guests were entitled to eat as much as they liked.The free gym was also very useful and had modern technology, for a fee guests can even gave a sauna or massage.This is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in and I would definately recommend it to anybody planning a trip to the wonderul city of Florence.

<Content>No complaints We stayed at the hotel for two days in the middle of March. We were surprised as to how big our room was. The bathroom was rather nice too. The breakfast buffet was pretty good and had plenty of food. The location was close to the train station which was nice since we arrived in Florence via train. We also walked everywhere in Florence and it wasn't a far stroll from anywhere. The hotel even loaned us a laptop so that we coud check our e-mail and check in with family. The staff was helpful and very friendly. I would recommend.

<Content>This is a wonderful hotel and a great value. We loved the Adler Cavalieri. We had a great room, with a lovely bathroom. The hotel had an excellent breakfast buffet and helpful staff. The hotel is next to the train station - very convenient for us as we were traveling through Italy by train.I'd recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Great hotel, convenient location We stayed in this hotel in September 2007 and I forgot to write a review, but I think the hotel deserve to be recommended. There are countless hotels and accommodation in Florence and it is very difficult to pick up one. We selected this hotel on line, after having checked out many reviews and I was fearful of what we could have found. It was selected mainly because it is close to the station and we were travelling by train, but it is also within walking distance to the city, so the location is excellent. The building is old, (like most in the area) but the hotel is nicely refurbished and very clean. We had a room at the back of the building, near a courtyard, and it was very quiet. The bathroom was very nice and spacious, the bed comfortable and the wardrobe had a nice smell (either it is cleaned regularly with wood wax or it was new). We also had breakfast at the hotel, and I would also recommend it, also because there aren't any nice snack bar nearby so if you need a cup of coffee first thing in the morning the hotel offers the best option. On the whole, a great hotel for a reasonable price, very conveniently situated.

<Content>very nice hotel Stayed here in October 2007. Was a very nice hotel, though a bit outdated. They had parking, which was the main feature for us. It is in a good location, close to everything and easy to find by car. The staff was very helpful with restaurant suggestions, so ask them, they know what they are talking about!

<Content>Highly recommended This hotel is so handy to the train station that my son and I walked too far when we arrived and tried to find it - it is literally a small block away. It is about a 10-15 minute stroll to the highlights on most people's must-see lists. I stayed for a week with my 5 year old son and found it great; in particular, the full buffet breakfast (hot and cold) was the best in our 3 week stay in Italy and managed to suit the fussy tastes of my son.The bathroom was modern and well-stocked, the rate reasonable (over Christmas), and the staff courteous (I amended my booking upon arrival and it was no problem whatsoever).I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A wonderful hotel We stayed at the Adler with our daugher during the winter. It's such a wonderful hotel, close to the train station. We walked from the station to the hotel. The hotel exterior didn't look very appealing, the lobby is ok. But the room is so wonderful. The room is large, the bathroom is modern with wonderful amenities. The window from our room overlook the courtyard. We enjoyed the breakfast as well. We love this hotel. We will definitely stay in this hotel again next time we are in Florence.

<Content>Happy campers at the Adler Cavalieri I've never written an online review for a hotel -- I've just never had an experience bad enough or good enough to warrant the time and trouble. Until now. I was very pleased with my five-night stay at the Adler in Florence. I selected the hotel based on these reviews, with a little concern because of the negatives ones. But my visit was solid in all respects for a hotel of this caliber. The location was wonderful -- around the corner from the train station and the bus from the airport as well as on a bus line that took us from the hotel block to the Ponte Vecchio in under 10 minutes. We also enjoyed two meals at a restaurant 1 1/2 blocks away -- can't think of the name of the place the hotel recommended. Rooms were nice and clean (good cable TV with some channels in English), breakfast was fine, and the staff always helpful. When a strike in Paris forced us to stay a 6th night, the hotel took us back at the rate we'd been paying, which made life oh so much easier. Because of the overall value of the place and the good service we received, I decided to break down and write a review as a small way of saying thanks to the Adler.

<Content>Decent hotel. But don't stay in a room downstairs. My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights while on our honeymoon. The room we had was quaint, small, but nice. The bathroom was very nice and clean. The staff were somewhat helpful. The breakfast was decent. It had a good variety. The only issue I had with this place was the room we had... I believe it was #8. It was downstairs not far from the front desk. Our room had hardwood floors, as did the upstairs room. So we could hear the upstairs neighbors as they walked back and forth all night long. We could hear the all the flushing of toilets and shower of the neighbor next door. And being downstarirs, the maid starts cleaning there first, so we were not able to sleep in at all, because of the banging of the maid as she cleaned in the room next to us. If there are quieter rooms in this place, it would be a nice place to stay. Good location. But the room we had was not very private, nor romantic.

<Content>Loved the Adler Cavalieri Florence Adler Cavalieri FlorenceWe stayed at this hotel 2nd to the 5th November 2007. This is a very good city centre hotel, and would have no hesitation in making a recommendation to any experienced traveller. The hotel is situated within 150m of the main train station (Santa Maria Novella), is clean, comfortable, and very good value. All the main sites are within walking distance for a reasonably fit person. We award this hotel top marks. This is based on considering all factors (city location 鈥?expect traffic noise, smaller rooms), good breakfast (not great 鈥?but then we did not pay for great), and especially the overall cost. If you need Burj Al Arab standards (with McDonalds prices), this is not the place for you. The Ill Gardino restaurant opposite the hotel is worth a visit. A word of warning if using trains 鈥?after purchasing your ticket you are required to date stamp it using the yellow machines on the platforms before boarding the train. This is not clearly notified. We failed to stamp our tickets, and got to enjoy a refreshing argument with a 鈥榡obs worth鈥?ticket inspector who wanted to fine us 40 euros each and eject us from the train.Florence is one of the worlds great cities, and would not hesitate to use the Adler Cavalieri again.

<Content>Very nice hotel Very nice hotel in Florence. Front desk staff was especailly helpful. The room was of a very good size and was quite comfortable. Location of the hotel is decent, have to walk a little bit to get to the main part of town, but wasn't far at all. Hotel is also close to train station which was nice. Not a lot going on right outside the hotel, so expect to walk 5 or 10 minutes to get to where you want to go, but I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent hotel and location! We just got back and must say we really enjoyed our stay. The rooms were alot bigger than normal and had a nice view of the courtyard. Everything in the room worked fine and the breakfast was better than expected. The location was excellent and were able to walk everywhere. Lots of restaurants near by and of course, so close to the train station. We will be staying here next year.

<Content>So close to the train station We stayed at the Adler Cavalieri in July for two nights. We then left a suitcase there and headed to the Cinque Terre, where one doesn't want to have too much luggage (with all those steps!), and returned five days later for one more night. The hotel is only a very short walk from the station and the walk into Florence itself is easy. The hotel was absolutely fine, but we found our first room very dark and dull (with all that dark furniture). Our second room had a view over a small courtyard and was much more pleasant. I would agree about the front desk people. We were barely welcomed and then encouraged to book tickets for the various museums. As we have been to Florence several times before, we declined. However, my husband went to the Accademia, walked straight in and said that his walk-in ticket was cheaper than a pre-booked one. Given that there are so many hotels within easy walking distance of the station I would probably try a different one next time, but I have no major complaints about this hotel.

<Content>Will not return Let me start by saying this really is a lovely hotel. It is very close to the train station and has a very nice interior. The rooms are among the nicest I've seen in my travels and very roomy by Italian hotel standards. It is well within walking distance of anything you want to see but is on the outer rim of historic florence. The thing that will keep me from returning is the service. I was spoiled in Rome by a hotel staffed with friendly people who greeted me in the morning, shook my hand, helped me arrange things as a matter of good service, and actually seemed happy to have me in their hotel. From the moment I entered the door, the staff at the Hotel Adler Cavalieri were cold to indifferent. They were professional but I can find professionalism in almost any hotel of that level. I was frankly disappointed in the service. As an example, I would expect for the price they charge per night that the desk personnel would be able to help me obtain a reservation at the Academia simply as a matter of good service. It was not until I actually reached the Academia that I learned they had charged me an additional 4 Euro per ticket simply for making a 30 second phone call to secure us a reservation. He did not even have the decency to inform us there would be an extra charge. It is the principle more than the extra 8 Euro that bothered me. If you're looking for service, look elsewhere because you won't find it at the Hotel Adler Cavalieri.

<Content>Average hotel in Florence Stayed at this hotel for three nights after seeing the excellent reviews on tripadvisor and therefore having high expectations. Unfortunately did not find this hotel to be that good, more like an average three star than a four star. The staff were quite abrupt and bordering on rude when we arrived and the room was not as comfortable as other four star hotel rooms. There was a big breakfast selection, but none of it was tasty and the coffee was poor quality. Should be reclassified as a three star.

<Content>Great Hotel This is an excellent hotel. The location is great and within walking distance of the major attractions and some excellent resteraunts. The staff are helpful and the rooms clean and well equipped. The sheets were changed every two days and there were nice little touches such as slippers in the room and mints at reception. The breakfast was excellent however be sure to wait to be seated as the staff do get a little upset if you don't. The American Bar was beautiful and a great spot to unwind after a days walking. Bernardo the bar person is great and was friendly and efficient. We just loved this hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>La Loggetta at the Adler Cavalieri My daughter and I stayed at this lovely, air conditioned apartment that is owned by the Adler Cavalieri. It is located a few steps away from the hotel on first floor. It comes is with a fully equiped small kitchen, telephone, a large sitting area, bedroom, and an outdoor area. The outdoor part was unsuitable for sitting as it had lots of mosquitoes and was kind of dark. People who live in the other apartments can also look down at you, however who wants to sit around when there's so much to see in Florence. The apartment is central to major sites and we walked everywhere. The apartment is extremely quiet, and guests can use the hotel's amenities. Whenever we needed anything, the front desk was absoultely the most helpful. Our towels and kitchen garbage were changed daily. Phone or email ahead to confirm check in time. We booked through florenceby.com for an apartment that is cheaper than a hotel room. I have found florenceby.com to be a helpful and reliable website. There's online and telephone help 24/7. I always rent apartments if I am staying for a week in a city and have only found one bad choice.

<Content>Old World Charm Pros: Hotel Adler Cavalieri is located 20 minutes by bus from the airport (4,50 Euro each way) and is a short walk from the train/bus station. The reception and hotel staff was pleasant and helpful. In answer to my e-mails they got us reserved tickets to Uffizi and Accademia. They charge a fee on each ticket for this service, but it saved us from waiting in long lines in the heat. The reception area, reading room, breakfast room and bar were clean, nicely decorated and inviting. Our room on the 3rd floor overlooked the courtyard and was clean, quiet and the windows opened. The room had a comfortable king size bed and a large wardrobe that had shelves on one side, an in-room safe, and 3 small drawers. The other side of the wardrobe had ample room for hanging clothes. There was a desk, chair and honor bar. There was also one large drawer next to the desk. The air conditioning was great. The marble bathroom was a good size and was nicely appointed. The shower had good water pressure. The towels were large and thick. The toiletries were nice. They provide slippers. The hotel is within walking distance of most major sights. There is a small store next door that sells soft drinks, wine, beer and snacks. There are restaurants nearby. CONS: The room was small with the king size bed taking up most of the space. There was no trouser press. They ran out of some items for breakfast (scrambled eggs, bacon, pastries) and did not replace them while we were there so had to pick other items instead. This hotel has much more positives than negatives. Enjoy!! We recommend Trattoria al Trebbio, Via delle Belle Donne 16. They have outdoor candle-lit seating as well as inside. Get there early 7:00 p.m. as it fills up fast. They are also open for lunch.

<Content>Wonderful hotel We stayed in Hotel Alder Cavlaieri in Florence for two nights in late April 2007. The hotel was absolutely fabulous. The reception staff were so helpful and polite. As we took a direct coach from Pisa airport to Florence, the hotel was very conveniently located; close to the train/ bus station (but very quite as well). The room was absolutely first class; very clean, well equipped, excellent air condition, tastefully decorated and it had a king-size bed. The bathroom was first-rate; fully tiled, power shower and a lot of attention to the details. There were some great facilities in the hotel like Sauna, American bar and beautiful lounge. The breakfast was excellent; plenty to choose from.This is a great and wonderful hotel. We will recommend it to any visitors to this beautiful city. Really excellent value for money.

<Content>Loved the Adler Stayed at the Adler Cavaliere Hotel in Florence for 3 days in April, 2007.This hotel is beautiful. First, of all the staff, especially the front desk personnel were excellent. I had been e-mailing them prior to my trip asking all sorts of questions from booking museums to finding out about their services their hotel had to offer. They always answered my e-mails and were very infromative and patient. Once I arrived this team of front desk personnel continued with their great customer service to the guests of their hotel. They were absolutely wonderful answering my many questions and helping out whenever they could.As for the accommodations, the rooms were huge and very very clean. Everything was impeccable at this hotel. The staff, the rooms, the linens everything. Location of the hotel was great also. I would definitely return to this hotel, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a charming place to stay. Also, the bar on the top floor was beautiful, very warm and cozy. Bern38

<Content>Quiet place in a busy city Room #4 had a small terrace with table and chairs in a quiet garden. This was just one of many things that made this hotel a hit with us including a great breakfast, easy access to the train station, staff who were friendly and made great restaurant recommendations.

<Content>Convenient Location We booked this hotel on Venere.com and was very happy with the choice. There were some mixed review on the tripadvisor website which made me a little nervous after I booked it. But once we arrived, all the worrying was unfounded. The walk to the hotel from the Florence train station was less than 10 minutes with our 2 large suitcases. Lisa (brunette) check us in and was extremely nice and informative. Unfortunately, not the entire staff is as helpful because we found very difference service level from various staff members. The room and bathroom was huge and we had a room in the back facing a small private courtyard. Breakfast was good with a variety of fruits, pastry, yogurt, cheese and coldcuts. Unfortunately, their cafe latte was not very good. The location of the hotel was very convenient. It was also within walking distance to a lot of sights. There were laundromats close by. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Stay! On the Florence leg of our (me and my beau) Italy trip, we stayed in Hotel Adler Cavalieri. I didn't book this so I was apprehensive at first - the exterior of the hotel does no justice. We got in by train and walked a few blocks to the hotel. Once inside,I was really impressed with the decor. The lady in the front desk wasfrosty at first but warmed up after we tried to check-in in Italian. Fortunately, we didn't get to deal with her the rest of the stay. The other staff was just lovely. Our room over looked a courtyard/garden and we could hear birds and the bells of the not-so-distant Duomo. The room was okay in size and was well decorated (the best in all of our Italy hotels). The bathroom was huge and the toiletries were fabulous.For a short stay this hotel is great. Near to everything and convenient!

<Content>First class hotel and experience Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Adler cavalieri hotel for 4 nights in march and have only praise for it! The hotel is located down a quiet (ish) road near the train station which is perfect if you're flying to/from Pisa and it only costs around 5 euros each one way. The staff are available around the clock and are extremely helpful with recommendations, directions etc. We also needed to change rooms when we got there as there was a slight booking error (see below) but this was sorted with zero fuss.The room itself was a superior one as it had a jacuzzi bath, which is what it says on the website, but you actually have a choice of a terrace OR a jacuzzi, so just check you've got the correct one when you get there (we were given a terraced room initially but it wouldnt have been very useful in march).All the features in the hotel are original with solid wooden furniture etc-makes a change from generic chains of hotels!Breakfast consists of cereals, fruit, yoghurts, pastries, breads, cold meat/cheeses and a small hot cooked selection (scrambled eggs, bacon, boiled eggs). A good variety of things to choose from, aswell as tea, coffee, juices.The only thing we weren't happy about was the fact that guests have to pay for daily use of the sauna/turkish bath at 12 Euros each per day! There was also no discount even if both of you were going to use it every day. We thought this was very pricey as most hotels offer this free of charge, and it also didn't mention the charges on the website.There is also a bar on the first floor which has a selection of nibbles on an evening to go with that chilled glass of wine!! This is a fab hotel with very friendly staff, and situated close enough to all the attractions (10 min walk max) but far enough away so that you can get some peace and relaxation!If there are any bad reviews about this hotel, i would not believe them, you couldn't find any faults with it if you tried!

<Content>Not Impressed with Adler Cavalieri We stayed 5 nights at the Adler Cavalieri in March 2007. Were not impressed with the Hotel. Although close to the Railroad Station, it is in a very seedy area. Lots of unsavory characters hanging around at all times. The room was okay, but bathroom tiny. Breakfast was good. Hotel staff were not friendly at all. Always seemed like we were bothering them when we asked a question. The only pleasant staff member was Fabbio. Don't see how it could be rated 4 Star. Would not recommend staying at this Hotel.

<Content>Don't be discouraged by the outside I had tried to select hotels using Rick Steve's book, but they were all full and time was running out. I used a map and the reviews here to make a choice. As we made the very short walk from the train station to the hotel, we were a bit worried about the area. The outside of the hotel is very plain. Once you enter the lobby, you enter a different world. Warm tones, rich carpets, friendly staff. It was delightful. Our room was very cosy, comfortable beds. We had a turkish bath the first night - pricey but hugely valuable as I had twisted my knee that morning. The bathroom was typical European, quite small. But there was plenty of hot water.The complimentary breakfast was divine. The coffee was terrific. They served real food - eggs, meats, fruit and breads. The conceirge got us tickets for the David so we didn't have to wait in line. The hotel is a short walk to everything in the city.Our Italian was limited but most of the staff spoke perfect English. I would readily stay there again or recommend it to friends or family.

<Content>Great Hotel Stay Stayed here last March for three nights  had a very positive experience. Good location near the train station, Very clean, Great Breakfast buffet, while having a local self serve laundry,  several internet cafe's nearby.Staff was also very helpful in recommending local restaurants.Only minor problem was confusion in getting museum reservations. After asking the hotel twice ( thru email ) to get us bookings at Accademia  Uffizi and receiving no response....I booked them myself. When we arrived they had a duplicate booking.......No Problem things worked outNo Question....would Definitely stay here again !!!

<Content>Fabulous We only had one night in Florence but where able to check in early and even had no problems checking out late the next day when we got delayed. After a fairly average hotel in Rome we where so excited when we saw our room as it was really modern. The girl on the front desk was absolutely lovely and gave us heaps of info. We even felt comfortable having a nice relaxing bath as the room was so clean. The breakfast the next morning was unbelievable, everything you could think of so my hubby went nuts and totally overate!! :) We absolutely loved Florence and this hotel made it extra special. Really close to the train and easy walking distance to the sites, shops and restaurants.

<Content>A Perfect Stay We stayed at this lovely Hotel for 4 days just before christmas.Our room was elegantly furnished and very clean, overall the service was impeccable, especially the people at the front desk. They helped us in any way they could and provided us with useful information about the city. They managed to get us tickets to get into the galleria accademia and the uffizi without having to wait in the line(wich was terribly long!).The breakfast was delicious and rich, there was no restaurant in the hotel but lukily there were plenty of nice tratorias in the nearance. We really loved the culinario club osvaldo, close to the santa croce church.We enjoyed our stay at the adler cavalieri very much, we will definitely come back.

<Content>Comfortable stay I spent 3 nights in this hotel with my sister in mid October. Very nice, quiet hotel. I booked thru hotels and contacted the hotel directly about a month before my arrival to be sure we had twin beds. The hotels kindly assigned us to a triple so we had twin beds plus a sofa and the room was very large. Even though the room was at the front of the hotel, the soundproffed windows worked great. The bathroom was modern, large and had great hot water. There was a whirlpool tub but we never had a chance to try it. The beds were very comfortable with freshly pressed sheets daily. Excellent lighting. The breakfast was very good but disorganized - all three mornings they ran out of eggs and replenishment was slow in coming (I ate at different times each day). Canned fruit salad but freshly made yoghurt. The baked goods were too sweet for my taste but I love those little packages of toast anyway. The coffee was awful but a good selection of teas. It was a 10 minute walk to the Duomo. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Perfect fit Loved our three nights at the Adler! The hotel is small with a wonderful ambiance. The staff is friendly and attentive.The rooms are not large but have beautiful details..such as artistically painted ceilings and beautiful wood furnishings.The hotel has several sitting areas which provided opportunities for us to mingle with other guests.Breakfast was delicious. The hostess knew us by the second day and anticipated our needs.You can walk anywhere in Florence from here but I was happy to have my husband at my side since you do pass the train station where as most train stations do...there were some local men hanging out.The only down side... The rooms on the street are noisy due to traffic but they provide two sets of exterior windows which muffle the sounds. Besides..you awoke to church bells!

<Content>Grazie Adler Cavalieri We stayed at this lovely Hotel at the end of September, in a spacious room with a balcony and elegant furniture.The hotel is close to the train station and just a few minutes from the pontevechio, the domo and all the other wonderful monuments of this city.The staff at the front desk was very kind and helpful, they got us tickets for the Uffizi and Akademia galleries (wich was really convenient since the queues were awfully long) and they gave us some really good recommendations about where to go in Florence. They also made us a reservation at a very pretty restaurant called the culinario club osvaldo, near the santa croce church.The breakfast was delicious and rich. The Hotel looked very clean and the atmosphere was very quiet and relaxing. We really loved Florence and this Hotel made our stay an unforgettable experience, we will definitely come back again.

<Content>gross and expensive maybe we got the one disgusting room in the hotel, but i am very surprised by the positive reviews listed here. the location near the train station was convenient for us and we didn't find it to be dangerous. our problem was the room itself. ours was old and nasty. i didn't want to touch the bedspread or the carpet. we were on the first floor behind the reception desk, so perhaps the rooms upstairs are nicer. i thought it was completely overpriced and i would not stay there again.

<Content>Good Choice The Adler is a good property overall. We were given a room with a private terrace which was lovely. Is is located by the train station and only a 5-10 minute walk into town. IF you wakll out of the hotel and make a quick right and then your first left, you are in the hottest part of town in 5 minutes. We did see a mozzie in our room, but the management took care of it. To be fair, we saw a ton of mozzies all over Florence so I can't imagine it is jsut this hotel. The front desk staff is beyond helpful, they mapped out the best driving path to Sienna and recommended lots of wineries on the way. I woudl stay here again!

<Content>Good base for sightseeing Florence Stayed at this hotel (based on price and Trip Advisor comments) as wanted a reasonably priced hotel, knowing that it would just serve as a base for seeing the rest of Florence.We were only here for a couple of nights and as it is walking distance (few minutes) to the train station it is a good base if you are only here for a short time.It was easy for us to walk from here to all the sights in Florence. You could probably choose more centrally located hotels, more special hotels, but for us this suited us well.The room was comfortable, clean and well looked after. The hotel itself was quiet and we weren't disturbed by noise. The breakfast was also good.

<Content>Mosquitoes and lack of cleanliness I'll try to keep this as short as possible as there are so many negative things about this hotel. I don't want the next person trying to find a hotel in Florence close to the train station to waste their money. DIRTY - the carpet near and in the elevator had large stains and the carpet did not look like it had been cleaned in quite some time. MOSQUITOES - I left the hotel the next morning with 6, yes I said 6, mosquito bites all over my body. My husband killed a few before we went to bed, but apparently that wasn't enough. HANDICAP ACCESSIBILITY - we took the elevator to our room, which barely fit myself, my husband and the bellhop and then walked down a long hall and then down 3 steps and down another hall to get to our room. HALF DOOR ON SHOWER - it makes quite a mess of water on the floor and there is quite a drop down from getting out of the shower to the floor. Between those two things it made it very dangerous getting out of the shower without slipping. GROSS BATHROOM CEILING - it is literally years of brick and rotted wood exposed for your pleasure. If these things don't bother you, and paying $191/night seems reasonable then I would stay at this hotel.

<Content>The Adler is a Gem. We stayed there for 4 nights last week (sept 7-11). This hotel was a real gem. We had excellent service in a very comfortable room that had ample space. The bed was nice and firm and the shower had great water pressure. The housekeepers turned down our beds each night and provided us with slippers. We enjoyed sitting on the tropical patio after talking with the wonderful bartender, Bernardo. All of the staff spoke English well and had a wonderful restaurant recommendation - Club Culinario Toscano de Osvaldo. This was a very romantic, very accessible hotel, close to the train station (but not too close) and a good choice for anyone who wants a nice hotel in Firenze.

<Content>Omni-Good hotel and great location I actually had a booking with a different hotel, but was moved to Hotel Adler Cavalieri, which turned out to be great. The hotel is a short walk from the train station and a couple of great restaurants, including a small Italian restaurant and a steak house, which had great prices and service (just ask the reception desk for their recommendation). I was also able to get tickets to various museums from the front desk, which was key to avoid standing in the long lines all day. Although the hotel's bar was on the pricey side, there is an Irish pub a few blocks away, which had a great atmosphere and prices. If you don't mind being away from high tourist traffic, this hotel is great.My only complaint is that the shower is quite small.P.S. Beware of food that you order from the stands along high tourist traffic streets...make sure that the price is listed! My husband and I had to pay 16 euro for four scoops of ice-cream!

<Content>An OK stay Stayed here for 2 nights. The location was very easy to find from the train station and whilst it is not in the greatest location we did not have any problems.It is a short walk to the historic centre and all the sights, no need to use public transport around Florence.Staff very helpful and were able to obtain two tickets for the Accademia as we hadn't prebooked.The room was nice and clean.

<Content>Great price performance Great location. The hotel is very close to the Florence SMN train station. There are numerous internet cafes, laundry shops and bars on the same street. Friendly staff. I booked my entrance tickets to Galleria dell'Accademia and Uffizi with concierge. Buffet breakfast included different kinds of ham, cereals, fruits, breads, eggs and pastries. I had reserved a double room. It was compact but still big enough to have space for our 2 pieces of 26-inch luggages. Felt like the restroom was recently renovated. Generous with bath supplies ( i.e. shampoo and soaps). Great price performance. I would stay at this same hotel if I need to go back to Florence.

<Content>Wonderful The Adler is an oasis. We stayed here July 9-12, 2006 and I was overjoyed at my experience there. Hotel desk staff were excellent, going the extra mile to help, e.g., phoning ahead to various properties to help us make reservations at our next stop. Our room was clean, quiet and nicely appointed. Marble bath was lovely. The matrimonial bed was comfortable: enough support for her, enough give for him. The location can't be beat for arrivals from or departures to the train station, just a 5 minute walk, and/or arrival via bus from the airport (2 minute walk). Walks into the city center are a minimum 10 minutes from the hotel, not a major issue. The neighborhood in which the hotel is located is not the greatest, but I never, ever felt a safety concern when walking in the area at night.The front desk gave a wonderful neighborhood restaurant suggestion, Carrabaccia; it is one block further past the hotel from the train station, around the corner and to the right. The hotel's breakfast buffet (included) was a delightful surprise, offering a bountiful selection of eggs, meats, cheeses, bread, sweets, yogurt, cereal, juice, coffee, etc.If you need to be in the thick of things, e.g., walk out the front door of your hotel and be at a major site, there are many other hotels in Florence that offer that convenience. However, the price at the Adler (110 Euro by booking ahead) and the room quality, amenities, strong air conditioning (a major plus after a day walking in the heat) and breakfast make this place a find.

<Content>Lovely Hotel with Wonderful Staff After being in Rome for 3 days with a mediocre hotel, we arrived at the Adler. It is just a few minutes from the train station; great location. The hotel itself is lovely. Clean, great rooms and all decorated nicely. The best part was the front desk staff, particularly the concierge. I had corresponded with him prior to our trip to arrange for a car to drive us to the beach resort, Viareggio. He handled all the details carefully and provided us with a very nice driver, who spoke english, and drove us to the best beach area. We had a wonderful relaxing day. The staff helped make our brief stay absolutely wonderful. We would definitely return!!

<Content>Below Average Service We weren't thrilled with this hotel. Our biggest complaint was the unfriendly attitude at the front desk. We politely asked a few quick questions on two occasions and felt as though we were bothering them. One night we came back to our room to find that we were out of soap. I went to the front desk to ask for some and the man I asked muttered something, made me wait about 10 minutes for someone else to bring it to the front desk, and then handed me the soap without a word. I suppose he could have been muttering about how the hotel staff should have left some soap in the room, but I thought the situation deserved at least a simple, Sure, no problem when I asked for the soap or Sorry about that when he handed it to me. Either one would have sufficed.We asked them if they could make reservations for us at a specific restaurant twice. The first day they tried, couldn't reach the restaurant and assured us they would call again while we were out sightseeing. They never made the reservations and didn't tell us they weren't made. We asked them the next day and the same thing happened. We were told that they couldn't get the reservations. We went to the restaurant that night and were able to get a table without a reservation. Another night we asked them for a recommendation for authentic local food and were sent to a tourist trap, where none of the food tasted good, not even the bread. There was not one local in the whole place and every tourist that walked in advised that they had been recommended by their hotel.We liked some things about the hotel. Our Double Classic room was a nice size and comfortable. The bathroom was a decent size. The room was quiet, we had requested a room away from the street. The breakfast was great. They offered a large selection of food and changed a few things each morning, so there was a variety. They offered scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage, which were not offered at the three other hotels we stayed in during our trip. They had a nice garden area to eat outside.There was a layer of dust under the bed in our room, although the rest of the room was clean. The hotel was located very close to the train and bus station, which was convenient since we had side trips planned. This location, however, ended up being rather seedy. There were a lot of unsavory characters in this area.We paid $229 for the first night and $360 for the other two weekend nights in our room. At this price, we expected more.

<Content>not good value for money We weren't so impressed with this hotel...we had a small room on the ground floor....window to the courtyard. For the money we didn't think this was good value. It was near the train station, but we didn't think the location was that perfect. We ended up moving to a hotel right beside Piazza della Signoria and 100 meters from Ponte Vecchio that was far better value for money.

<Content>A great hotel I stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is really nice with excellent attention to detail and friendly staff. I forgot to fill out my breakfast card on the first day however my turndown service provided the card on my pillow to remind me. They also greet you with chocolates and a map of Florence.The rooms are light and airy, clean, quiet and in a convenient location. I loved the large bathroom and the extra large bathroom sink. Next time I return to Florence I'm staying here again.

<Content>Just the facts, Ma'am This is a very well appointed hotel located in a convenient spot: it is 3 minutes from the train/bus station. It is a 10-15 minute walk into the center of Florence. There is a self-service laundromat just down the block. Two blocks away are several restaurants (try La Rotunda Firenze, a pizzeria just across from the trattoria stuffed with tourists - better food, half price, dine with the locals).The rooms are quite large and amenities, ie slippers, robes, etc, very nice. The hotel has obviously been updated, including the 'fresco' on the room ceilings. Probably due to the remodeling the windows are double paned so the room remains quiet, despite any outside noise. The staff is extremely accomodating and has a good level of English. Breakfast includes hot and cold items with coffe and steamed milk served at your table. The wine bar is a very nice and underused feature, private with an entrance onto the courtyard. A sitting room off the lobby has a variety of newspapers in various languages. We booked early and received an excellent internet rate.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for three nights in late May 2006. The room was gorgeous, the service was outstanding. The location is good. It is only a short walk to all that Florence has to offer. Our room was nicely decorated with a painted ceiling and the bathroom had a typical toilet/bidet/shower set up that you will find in many Itlalian hotels. But the difference in or room is that the bathroomm was spacious and did not feel claustrophobic. If you need to do some laundry there is a laundromat three doors down. And, don't miss the Pharmacia at the convent of Santa Maria Novella just down the street. Behind inconsipcuous doors is an interesting and beautiful shop wher the convent sells perfumes, tinctures, and other naturropathic products. Really cool.

<Content>Wonderful Extremely friendly and helpful service people at the desk. Nice room (even though we didn't have a balcony like some other reviewers). We only stayed one night and had to leave very early the next morning and therefore the breakfast area was not yet open. Get this though: they packed us up a bag of goodies for breakfast to take with us!!!! It was basically crackers with jam, cookies, a piece of fruit and a bottle of water and juice. All the same, it was a incredibly nice service and reflects the kindness felt at the hotel. If we are lucky to get back to Florence, we will book here again. No further searching needed!

<Content>Best Sleep, GREAT Location My friend and I stayed at the Adler Cavalieri for 4 nights out of a 2-week trip to Italy. When I booked it, I was concerned that the location might be too near the train and bus stations, which in other cities often means a more seedy neighborhood. We were pleasantly surprised to find that NOT to be the case in Florence, and that the location had many conveniences (some great restaurants, laundry facilities, and easy to hop on a bus or train for day trips... we took the train to Cinque Terre, and the bus to Siena). I also worried that this might be a plain conventional hotel, with amenities but little charm (we'd been staying in small Inns). This was also NOT the case. The lobby was pleasant, the breakfast room comfortable, with a great buffet (FINALLY, a hotel that served eggs on the buffet!), the bar had a nice little seating area that feels like you're in a garden, with a pretty pond and flowers, but is closed in on 3 sides. Our room was the best part. We faced an interior courtyard, so could open a window and get cool breezes but there was absolutely NO noise. Also, when the bellman showed us the room he asked if we wanted the double bed separated into two, which we did, and when we returned later they were separated and made up as two. We had the best sleep there, and lovely to wake up and hear the church bells and feel the breezes. The bathroom was well-appointed and walls were fully sound proofed, so if someone got up early you couldn't hear them, not even the hair dryer. The wireless internet capability in the lobby was convenient, with pretty good rates to use their laptop (better than most of the Internet cafes I'd used). Staff was friendly and helpful and spoke English. Bartender Bernardo was gave us good advice re:what to see and do. You could walk to everywhere in the city from the hotel (and you certainly wouldn't want to drive in Florence!) The ONLY turn off was when we first checked in they gave us a street map (pulled off from a whole pad of them) and when we asked for a second one for when we went our separate ways the bellman said loudly, we're out of them. (I believe that bellman was actually the manager or owner, since the person behind the desk acquiesced). That cheapened an otherwise lovely stay, to be lied to right off the bat.... (we got our second map later on, when he wasn't around to pipe in). But other than that, NO complaints and I would stay there again in a heart beat!

<Content>An awesome hotel! This hotel was the best we stayed at in Italy. It was easy walking distance from the train station. The staff was wonderful  spoke english very well. The room was beautiful and updated with a new painted ceiling, marble bathroom,  keycard entry. We stayed in room 112 which was in a unique spot in the hotel making the bathroom very big and allowing for a private terrace - which not many rooms had. Breakfast was included in the price and even included scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, meats, cheeses, cereal, pastries, etc. They also recently added some spa services at the hotel which we unfortunately did not have the chance to take advantage of. Even though the hotel was updated, it had a lot of old world Italian charm with patios with flowers and fountains hidden within the hotel. Do not think twice about staying at this hotel - it was wonderful!

<Content>Excellent value for Europe Super hotel. Good value, glad to have made the choice. Excellent and professional service from all the staff, particularly the front desk staff. The hotel was clean, rooms were well above standard, comfortable beds. Clean and well co-ordinated bathrooms. Shower was a little small but that is to be expected in Europe. Quaint courtyard sitting area for afternoon drinks or tea and lovely upstairs lounge and bar with service to midnight. Great location, within 5 to 10 minutes walk of all sites. My husband and I travel exstensivley and like to stay in 5 star hotels, why leave home if you can not have all your luxuries. On this trip we travelled with friends and decided to select mid range hotels - this was a winner! Thank you Trip Advisor as I did all my research on line.

<Content>loved the Adler Cavalieri Just stayed at the Adler Cavalieri. Excellent convenient location. A trivial walk from the train station, even carrying your luggage. Easy walk to everywhere you need to go in Florence. Rooms spotless. We got a king size bed in a quiet room overlooking their courtyard. Large bath tub and shower. Helpful, friendly staff. Terrific breakfast including scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, meats and cheese, fruit, pastry and more. We would gladly stay there again!

<Content>Great hotel The location was excellent for this hotel and the quality of the service, the breakfast and room cleanliness were superb. However don't go to Florence in May-WAY too many tourists...I think its much nicer in the Autumn/Winter.

<Content>The Reviews Are Right The reviews on this site are correct - great location near the train station, convenient to all sights, clean, great breakfast, and nice rooms. Staff is very helpful and friendly. On a side note, for dinner, try Il Latini...

<Content>Very nice hotel indeed We were very happy with our stay at the Adler. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, the bathrooms were extremely clean and modern. The front rooms (facing the street) have double windows so the noise from the street was non-existant with them shut. I think it *might* get a little hot in the summer with them closed all the time, but we didn't test the AC to see if it worked, it was so beautiful when we were there.The breakfast that comes with the room was very very good- standard continental breakfast with the addition of really tasty italian cold cuts, scrambled eggs, and sausages. It was a great start every morning.The hotel staff was very friendly, and spoke enough English to be very helpful. The server at breakfast was very attentive, and after the first morning, always remembered our preference for coffee with breakfast (due capuccino, per favore). The location is very convenient. Close enough to the Stazione to be an easy walk with rolling luggage but not close enough for the traffic to be any issue whatsoever. Its not *exactly* central, but close enough to what you want to see that you can get to just about anything in about 30 minutes, just enough time to walk off the breakfast.I do recommend trying the pasta restaurant around the block, just across from the train station. We had a very nice meal there, though I didn't think it was terribly authentic... its hard to find in Florence with all the tourists anyways.

<Content>Best Hotel in Florence Single woman traveling alone. I had a room with a terrace overlooking a garden courtyard. It was charming and a quiet retreat from the city. The frescoed ceiling was fabulous. I paid $180 euro/night. I noticed the hotel had a cigar/pomade smell to it, but Florence is generally a pretty smelly city anyhow. Also the AC and towel warmer did not work. But I had a jetted tub.The location was really close to the train station, but about 10 blocks from the Duomo, which is really where all the action is. I later stayed at Hotel Sofitel near the Duomo. Although it did not smell like cigar/pomade, it lacked the character of the Adler Cavalieri and I certainly missed the balcony overlooking the garden. The breakfast was pretty good, service was excellent there and at the bar. They do not have a restaurant for lunch or dinner, but I always recommend eating outside of hotel restaurants anyhow.

<Content>Glad we changed to this hotel We had booked another hotel used by a large package holiday operator, but after reading a Tripadvisor review we cancelled it in favour of the Adler Cavalieri. We were glad we did. We travelled by train and the hotel is conveniently close to the station and well located for most sites. The staff were welcoming and we had a super large, clean and quiet double room with a good sized bathroom. The room rate, incl a good breakfast -was excellent value for a 4* hotel. We could not fault the Adler Cavalieri and would love to return.

<Content>Highly recommended hotel Hotel Adler Cavalieri has a great location, close to the rail and bus stations and in easy walking distance of the Historical centre of Firenze. The staff are superb - helpful and friendly - as are the rooms which are clean, spacious and comfortable.Also very near to some excellent restaurants [go where the locals go and not the ones aimed at tourists!]Highly recommended and would definitely stay there again if I return to Florence!

<Content>The Adler felt like home... I had the pleasure of staying at the Adler for almost a month last June. It truly was my home away from home. Not only was it convenient as it was my home base for all my excursions in and out of the city, but it truly felt like my home.The rooms were efficiently comfortable - all clean, modern and no useless space. Again, remember I was there for weeks and never felt crowded or in need of more space. The beds were comfortable; the rooms clean, the bathrooms were immaculate and all remodeled. The staff was incredible. The front desk team was always accommodating, friendly and extremely helpful in booking reservations for anything, anywhere. Franco was like a brother at the end of the trip. He was kind and thoughtful and made sure I had a terrific trip. Andrea was also a gem. The restaurant and bar team - Fabio, Fabrizzio, Simona - were not only gracious but had a wonderful sense of humor. They conjured up great omelets, cappuccino and Negroni's, FYI!As you can tell, I made some great friendships at the Adler. It was so easy as the hotel is laid out so you can meet everyone and feel and live like a Florentine. I have and will recommend the Adler to my friends and family - always. The question for me is not if, but when will I return. The Adler made my memorable month in Firenze easy to navigate and most importantly, stress-less and a blast. Mille grazie, Adler Cavalieri - TomBest, Tom

<Content>Awesome Awesome Hotel The staff and the hotel are some of the best and most accomodating I have seen. We asked for a room with a bath and they changed it without delay. The food was excellent, the breakfast plentiful. The service was very good allround. I forgot my key in the safe and they posted it back to me within a week. The rooms are very comfortable too with good views. Highly recommended to all sorts of travellers

<Content>Great hotel and location We have just returned from a five night stay at this lovely hotel.We were impressed by the standard of service and helpfulness of the staff.The rooms were spotless and spacious with a well appointed bathroom. It would have been nice to have coffee making facilities, but that would be our only criticism.Breakfast was buffet style but with plenty of choice.The position near the station was great, so convenient. There were good restaurants nearby and all the main sights were within walking distance.We would not hesitate to use this hotel again.

<Content>Very nice rooms and service We stayed for two nights and couldn't have been more pleased. All of the staff were very professional. Lisa at the front desk was very helpful as was the waiter at breakfast and the evening bartender. Our room was wonderful, big and clean. For us, this was a sidetrip and we found the hotel to be a place to relax and regroup before heading back to Rome.

<Author>Around the World in 80 Ways
<Content>A peaceful oasis in the centre of town We paid a little extra for a room with a balcony, but it rained for most of our three night stay! We were overlooking a nice little courtyard and even though we were in the centre of a bustling city heard absolutely no traffic noise whatsoever.The Adler is perfectly located, being 5 minute walk from the railway and bus stations and ten minutes from the main tourist attractions.There are lots of good restaurants within a two minute walk and a few bars as well (including an English 'pub' and a bar selling Murphys, with an early evening 'happy hour')The accommodation was very comfortable, nice sized rooms, and very friendly and nice staff, who were happy to help with advice and suggestions for an itinery etc.We were at the hotel very much out of season on a (very) cheap flight from Liverpool to Pisa (God bless Ryanair!) the bar was open, but not well used, and the barman laid on nibbles free of charge for anyone who wanted them. It turned out he spent some time in Liverpool on a school exchange and had worked in London!Breakfast was in a lovely room, and a well stocked buffet with a couple of hot dishes as well. From 7am until 10.30 - ideal for the last morning, when we had an early dash to Pisa airport.Only two very small details stopped us giving this an 'excellent' rating - there was no restaurant (bar snacks were available from frozen) and we arrived soaked through at 4pm, but they could not supply us with a cup of coffee until the bar opened at 5 o'clock (would have been nice if there had been coffee making facilities in the room).Florence was wet, but gorgeous, and we had a lovely break. We left our cases at the airport in Pisa and got the bus into town to look at the tower, then got a train to Florence (about 1hour 30min direct from Pisa airport to Florence - clean, prompt, comfortable and cheap!)

<Content>Fabulous!!! Best hotel, best location and best price in Florence!!!! This hotel should be much farther up the popularity scale. The rooms are big, beautifully decorated and extremely clean. Our bathroom had great amenities too include a bidet and a large shower with great water pressure. The location could not have been more perfect. A two minute walk to the bus station and a three minute walk to the Santa Maria Novella train station. It took us maybe five minutes to walk to the Ponte Vecchio. The hotel offered a wine tasting tour that visited a castle with interesting history. If this tour is offered, take it. The hotel was quite and in a very safe area. We will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel Great boutique hotel. So sooooooooo clean. I am a bit of a germ freak and I can tell you that their bathroom is almost clean enough to eat off (I wouldn't but you get the point). Its small but average in NYC standards and all the fixtures seem really new. The room was standard but well taken care of and quite comfortable. Completely silent. The room was a bit chilly even though I had it set at 24C. I talked to the front desk and surprisingly, they had a high tech online system of tracking room temperatures and so they increased our room control ranges. Pretty cool. They had a nice strong hairdryer (bonus pts for that). The doorkey is a magnetic card but the door had to be slammed shut to lock.The hotel staff was great. The front desk was helpful in making reservations and was prepared for the worker's strike, which effected museum  bus schedules. I was impressed that the breakfast room attendent/room service personnel remembered how we liked our coffee after the first day and how attenative they were. On the minus point, I saw them smoking in the kitchen but that seemed pretty much the norm in Italy.The location was the only thing I found ok. Its 3 blocks from the train station and is in a safe neighborhood with a ton of other hotels but its quite on the edge of the city... mind you a city that takes only 15 minutes to walk across so not really a problem. So if you were to call this a great location then I would say 99% of Florence hotels are in great locations unless your purpose is to stay near the train station.This was my first hotel in Italy and after staying at a range of other hotels in Italy from Inns to 5-stars... this ended up being by far the best. Like someone previously posted - it is quite the hidden gem.

<Content>Good Hotel Stayed with my wife on a w/e trip to Florence. I booked direct with the hotel via their bilingual web site.Hotel is very convenient to the SMN (central Station).Staff were polite and helpful and made our stay enjoyable. There was much talk before going that the main street outside the hotel would be noisy but we had a room in the back which was very quiet.The room was average size with a spotlessly clean bathroom. Breakfast was good continental with none of the awful cremated american bacon.Florence is a beautiful city to wnder through and we walked to everywhere from the hotel. The Uffizi is c.15 mins walk . One thing not to miss is the Central Indoor market and streets around. Carcking produce at good prices (take home the sun dried tomatoes which are vacuum packed)Overall a 4 for the hotel but possibly a 4.5

<Content>Honeymoon Bliss We visited Florence for a week on our Honeymoon. With this being our first trip to Europe, I was nervous about the hotel based on what I've heard. I was SO pleasantly surprised when we walked into the hotel Adler Cavalieri. If you are planning day trips, it is very close to the train station which we found convenient. The lobby was nice and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. I booked the hotel online and there were no problems checking in. The staff was incredibly helpful exchanging our currency, calling cabs, and making both museum  dinner reservations for us. It was a huge help to us!We were quite happy with the room. It was large, well furnished, and CLEAN. It was comparable to an American hotel chain. Phew! Our view looked out onto their courtyard, which was nice. The private bathroom was all marble with a nice shower/tub. The restaraunt was good with a buffet breakfast that was included. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable stay!!

<Content>This Hotel is a Jewel This beautiful boutique hotel was just what we were hoping for after the long flight from California. The rooms were immaculate and charming and a soak in the jacuzzi tub of the marble bath a treat for tired tourists. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the location is convenient. We would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>very very good hotel this is a typical boutique style hotel the furnishings and decor are just what I hoped I would find in an italian hotel. The rooms are of a decent size and the bathrooms are marble with some having a jaccuzi bath which we had. A problem occured with our air conditioning on our first day and we where given an upgrade this was an added bonus the hotel reception staff are wonderful especially the young girl who was present during our stay 16th to 19th sept she was more than helpful nothing was to much bother she even phoned the bus station finding out times for us many thanks to her. The hotel is spotless all in all a wonderful hotel to stay in you will not be dissapointed I would reccomend it to anyone location is also fantastic just far enough away from the centre about a 10 min walk and just round the corner from the bus and train station. Also the breakfast is very good a good selection and buffet style.

<Content>Great Service, Nice Hotel! My experience at this hotel made my trip to Florence much more enjoyable. Our entire vacation was rained out while in Florence and we spent a lot more time in the hotel than we anticipated. This, however, was an enjoyable experience. First of all, this hotel is located very conveniently near the subway station as well as most tourist hot spots. The hotel is decorated very tastefully and it feels very welcoming. The rooms are not very spacious but such is the case in Europe. The rooms are, however, very clean and thoughtfully laid out. The bathrooms are, again, small with NO counter space but very clean and well-maintained. The complimentary breakfast is a nice touch and would be even more enjoyable if it were not raining-you could sit out on the terrace. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful. They were able to arrange for us to get tickets to the Uffizi Museum (these are hard to come by but the hotel keeps several to sell to guests) and provided us directions to wherever we were going. Overall, I would recommend this hotel and very much enjoyed my stay.

<Content>a must!!! stayed at adler in june for 5 nights prior to my wedding in florence with 23 of my guests.this hotel is excellent in every respect !!!.the rooms are lovely with painted ceilings and our room even had a jacuzzi also it was on the front street and you don't hear a thing we would open our windows to hear the bustle as this is what going on holiday is about.the breakfast is good with plenty of variety.the hotel has some lovely communal areas especially the courtyard where we would all meet at night for drinks with bernardo the barman who could not do enough for you.the location of this hotel is great 2 mins from the station people who are wary of this area have nothing to worry about, its a bustling part of town even late at night and those who slate the area are not well travelled its no less safer than any other station area.you can reach all the main sights of florence just walking from the hotel and the reception will help you with any of your requirements.there is a great pub just along the street called the joshua tree together with some great resturants. all of our guests had a great time in this hotel no bad rooms amongst them, a few even had terraces.this place is alot better than some of the more expensive hotels i've stayed at in florence.give it a visit you'll not be disappointed.this is wrote together with a review of villa la vedetta in florence

<Content>Great Location Great Location for all the sights in Florence, we arrived very late for a 5 night stay and found the staff very helpful. We later found out it was because their were only 4 other couples staying!!!The hotel has underground car parking, for a small fee, which was not advertised and a pleasant surprise!The rooms are clean and decorated to a high standard, we were both very happy. The bathrooms are typically italian, fantastic marble but about the size of normal UK residential ensuite.Its about a 5-10 min walk into the heart of the tourist area, but its through the small (and very lively) back streets.The hotel cookhouse did an excellent continental breakfast of cold meats and pastry, the attempt at an 'English Breakfast' was ok, but then, you should not be looking for sausages and beans in Italy!!!!All in all, a great hotel with friendly staff in a location close to all the sights.I'm a fussy traveller and would not recommend any hotel, this is my first post.A definite for those looking for a reasonably priced, clean hotel with friendly staff close to the sights. I would stay there again.

<Content>Very enjoyable stay Great choice if your visiting Florence and don't want to be in the middle of the sightseeing area. Its a short walk, and very quiet. Rooms are small (typical for Europe) but tastefully appointed, as is the rest of the hotel. Ample breakfast including eggs. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Good location, excellent hotel This is a great location for a hotel in Florence, especially if you are planning day trips out of the city, since the buses and train are literally right around the corner. I found the Adler immaculately clean and the staff extremely helpful. The rooms were pretty standard and quiet. I would most definitely stay there again.

<Content>Beautiful City, Beautiful Hotel I am a businessman who goes to Italy once a year. Every year, I find myself staying at this hotel. It is on a busy street in the busy part of town. But once you get inside, you will hardly notice the outside world. Tastefully decorated, pleasant staff, and a calming atmosphere makes for a wonderful environment. I took my son and friend with me this time, and the stay was no exception. Everyone had a terrific time and enjoyed their stay.If you are travelling to Florence, I recommend this hotel. You will not regret your choice.
