<Content>Big room small bathroom It is not far from train station, quite location, close to Arno river, Room is big enough , very clean, king size bed, dark colour curtains, furnished with the maching Florance atmosphere (authentic) but the bathroom is too tiny and needs refurnishing.We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Warm welcomed at front desk by friendly hotel staff, she gave us all the necessary information abaut museum, restaurants, trains and buses. The breakfasts are so basic and same for every day. Bacon, cheese, marmelade, cereals, coffee or tea and canned orange juice is the bonus.They gave us a room at the backside of the hotel even though we made reservation a month ago. Our room window is facing next door neighbours kè°‹tchen. We couldn't be able to see the weather when we woke up in the morning (was it raining or sunny day). Heater didn't work at night but she gave us extra blankets to keep ourselves warm.

<Content>Nice family run place Nice family run place about a 10 minute walk from the train station. Decent accomodation. Friendly helpful staff especially Loretta pointed us to 2 good restaurants close to the hotel. Free breakfast. Internet not free but available. My only complaint was that the bathroom was a little cramped for space.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed at the Pagnini for 4 nights after seeing the reviews on tripadvisor. The hotel is tucked away down a side street which is a good thing as there can be a lot of traffic and people walking along the streets, so it means that the hotel is always quiet. We found it very easily from the train station thanks to great directions and it is a short 10 minute walk from the centre of Florence.The hotel as said is a small family run business, all of the staff are very helpful two of the staff can speak excellent English and will do what they can to help you, maps of the city, restaurants etc. The rooms are all a good size with comfortable beds just what you need after a long day pounding the cobbled streets of Florence! All of the rooms are very clean, though I would say that the bathroom is a little tired and could do with a refurb sooner or latter, but everything still works fine with lots of hot water!Breakfast was good nice selection of bread cereals ham croissants etc with your choice of coffee cappuccino and espresso etc which was nice bonus!!!Overall with its location, size of rooms and price I would definitely stay there again

<Content>Italian friendly familystyle!! This is a good clean italian family hotel. Very friendly stuff and resonable price.The location is nice, not in the middle of centre, but a nice walking distance of 10 minutes after Arno the river.(ok, maybe to long for a fat american tourist).You get what you pay for! i recomend this for sure!

<Content>Extremely Clean and Friendly Owners We just returned from a week long stay at the Hotel Pagnini. Close to the train station (10 minute walk), close to the city centre (10 minute walk-the other direction), close to shops (on the street behind you), very quiet when you have a courtyard view (in essence, no view at all, but quiet)We are two adults and a 10 year old girl. The airconditioning in the room was great, the lift big enough for a suitcase to save you lugging it up the stairs. The staff at the Hotel Pagnini are extremely friendly and very professional. The breakfasts are basic but plentiful. Just some ham, cheese, apples and cornflakes cereal. Lovely fresh brewed coffee and cappachino for breakfast.The Hotel was a pleasant respite from the city of Florence which we found to be quite smelly, dirty and teeming with beggars and illegal street vendors. Every single building seems to charge admission and the food prices are high compared to other places we have stayed in Italy (Rome, Naples, Sorrento, Pisa, Venice, Lucca) and the people (other than the Hotel Pagnini staff) very rude. One restaurant actually through the menus down onto to the table and were not overly surprised when we stood up and left.Easy to take day trips from Florence, which we ended up doing most days. Lucca is beautiful and Venice is breathtakig, as you would expect. Italy is beautiful, Florence is not a good example unless you are a student of art.

<Content>Godd location The hotel has a great location, close to all the main sights of Florence. The rooms are slightly dated but clean. In comparison to many other hotels in florence this a good hotel for a reasonable price. My only complaint is the shower curtain in the bathroom. Why do hotels insist on these? The bathroom flooded every time we used the shower. Our room faced the main road and we found it to be relatively quiet. Vespas are everywhere in Italy and I think we became immune! No doubt the fab wine helped! A great stay with very friendly helpful staff.

<Content>A little run-down, but full of smiles I spent one night here. The location is excellent, neither too close nor too far from the train station. The city centre is a bit less than 1 km away, and you can cover that distance with a pleasant stroll along the Arno. Once you're inside the hotel, the staff greets you warmly and does its best, to provide you with help on how to reach the key points of the city. Also, they will be happy to keep your luggage on your departure day, until you come back to reclaim it (this doesn't always happen, in Italian hotels).The rooms are a bit run down and worn and, while the small and old bedroom looks somehow quaint and picturesque, the bathroom would benefit from some renovation. The breakfast is served at you and, while not in buffet-style, I quite appreciated it. Overall, I recommend this place to everyone... save to those suffering from light sleep, as the rooms are not sound-proof and noise from people going in and out of the hotel will likely reach your ear.

<Content>a litlle far away I stayed at the Hotel Pagnini on August 2006. I chose the hotel mainly because of the air conditioning. Although the room was small and quite run down, the hotel and the room were very, very clean. They certainly take some time on each room every day to clean them up. The people at the desk were really nice and helpful. The only thing about the hotel is that is a little bit away from the historic center of Florence. It is actually 30 minutes from the dome to the hotel ( I took the time). I've read some reviews about the zone around the train station being a little bit scary but I didn't have that feeling. Always felt safe. I recommend to stayed nearer the station, as you have to walk through it anyway when you are coming back from the historic center. .

<Content>Very Friendly Hotel We (husband, wife  adult child) stayed 2 nights at Pagnini in Florence in June 2006.The staff, were very friendly and most helpful.The hotel was reasonably easy to find and about 10 mins walk from the train station and about 10 - 15 mins walk to main part of Florence.Like Rome you don't get a great deal of value for money in Florence, the rooms are basic, a little tired but clean and everything worked.I chose the Hotel because of three reasons, 1) because it had air conditioning and was glad of that, Florence was hot (about 30 deg C) and the A/C worked perfectly. 2) because it was quiet, we asked for a quite room and got one at the back and we did not hear much other noise from the Hotel. 3) because of closeness to sights, we walked from the station and to the tourist spots quite easily.There were restaurants nearby and one (can't remember name)that the hotel recomended was really good and great service.The staff spoke good english, breakfast was basic but like Rome you get a cappacino made for you as well.Only problem was a lot of mosquitos in the room but we got some spray from the hotel and fixed that quickly, and because the room had A/C we then kept everything closed.I would recomend the hotel and stay there again, mainly because of the friendliness.

<Content>wrapped in plastic Family of three stayed 27/5 to 28/5. The hotel is well away from the shopping areas and while the rooms are quite good sizes for Europe the room we stayed in had terrible street noise and you need to wear ear plugs to sleep also they had a problem with mossies buzzing around all night because it was so warm you had to open the windows to get some relief from the heat as the do not turn on the air until it is summer. The shower is a nightmare as the shower curtain clings to you and the toilet paper holder is in the shower cubicle as well and gets wet each time. Breakfast is preset and you have no choice but to except it or go without.

<Content>Good hotel, but not excellent Good hotel. Quite clean. Modest price. Conveniently located near the attractions. Appeared safe. I stayed here for 6 nights. The staff were very helpful and spoke reasonably good English.However, the shower was too small for a 4 star hotel. The double room was also too small. Later moved to a different, larger double room, which was more expensive. The breakfast was too modest. Very basic, continental. I came here for work, not travel. It bothered me. If you are a tourist, breakfast may not matter a whole lot. But I am glad that I had a peaceful stay. In May-June Florence is mobbed by tourists. It is hard to find a good place to stay.

<Content>Lovely hotel, great location The rooms here a quite modest but who spends much time in their hotel room when they're visitng Florence? The rooms were cleaned every day and a simple breafast is provided. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and their engliish was great. The location is the real draw card. It's a few minutes walk from Santa Maria Novella train station and no distance at all from the river and many of the fabulous attractions Florence has to offer. It's in a quiet street whcih means a peacesful night's sleep. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Location This hotel was clean, simple and with a great location. Rooms were adequate size and clean. Continental breakfast was enough to get your day started. The location was great! Easy to walk to all sites.

<Content>Nice ambience, good location, tiny shower. I just returned from my visit of Italy and had a chance to stay at the Hotel Pagnini while in Florence. It is situated along a fairly quiet street near the river and is a short 15 min walk from the train station. (Be aware that the addresses on Via Montebello are a little strange...it seems they went through a renumbering and some places still have the old addresses shown...we ended up ringing the doorbell of someone's residence and learned the hotel was located on the next block, toward the middle.) The staff is very friendly and courteous. A continental breakfast of croissants, coffee, fruit is served each morning. The rooms (I shared a triple) are pretty spacious. The room has an antique feel to it with its old world furniture. The bathroom was nice, however the main complaint was the small shower stall. Roughly 3'x'3', it is surrounded by a shower curtain which tended to stick to you when trying to maneuver yourself around. The curtain didn't help contain the water within the basin, thus we ended up with water on the floor all the time. It was the worst shower I had encountered on my trip. Other than that nuisance, I'd recommend the hotel for its warmth and charm. Plus, do try the restaurant on the street behind the hotel. (Unfortunately, the name escapes me...begins with M) It was an excellent recommendation from the staff and it featured Tuscan-styled meals. It was so good we ended up having dinner there twice, and each time it was memorable. The pizzeria on the same street was also really good.

<Content>Welcome to Firenze! A warm welcome awaits those choosing to stay at the Pagnini. Centrally located for all major attractions, the hotel is beautifully presented inside, rooms are spacious and impeccably clean and the staff are warm and extremely friendly. Will also offer advise on where to eat, particularly if you arrive late at night as I did. Breakfast is simple Italian bread and pastries, allowing you more time to do what you came for, explore Florence. Only gripes are the shower is small and there is no kettle/ cups in room. The owners will however provide cappucino/ tea and a 24 hour reception means Florence's nightlife can be fully enjoyed. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend and return to this fabulous hotel, which provides great value for money.

<Content>Great, reasonably priced hotel in Florence Recently stayed at the Pagnini for 4 nights. Our double room was comfortably large and the bathroom was clean and well appointed. The staff was helpful and friendly. Breakfasts were fine. The hotel is located about a ten to fifteen minute walk from the major tourist attrations: Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio but the walk along the Arno (if that's the route you pick) is refreshing and provides an opportunity to see a bit more than just the central tourist/shopping area. The hotel was very reasonably priced and delivered as promised. I would stay there again.

<Content>Charming...except for the smoke and noise Pagnini is a very cute hotel situated near Santa Maria Novella train station in Florence (though I would only suggest walking with luggage if you are hearty, it's about a 15 minute walk dragging a suitcase). The Florence city center is small enough that this location is central enough to walk to everything. It is furnished nicely with antiques and the desk staff is friendly. However, I did not enjoy my experience there a great deal because of the choking smell of smoke in my room. I opened the window hoping it would help but it opened onto a courtyard, so there was no air circulation. I left the window open anyway, but it was quite noisy. When I went to bed, I couldn't sleep because you can hear every word spoken not only by people in the rooms near you, but also by the staff downstairs (and this woke me in the morning as well). At the next hotel, I realized how awful all my clothes smelled from being in the smoky room. At E78 it was a great bargain, it is cute and has a good location, and if you are a smoker (or not bothered by smoke) and an early riser this is a perfect hotel for you.
