<Content>Fantastic find! I came across the Villa Fontaine chain last minute, and picked the Shiodome location because of the positive reviews in Trip Advisor. Good mix of business men and foreign tourists.Positives:- extremely impressive lobby- very close to fish market, Ginza and important train station- room and bathroom spacious and clean- staff at reception very courteous, but we appealed to staff at the Conrad when we needed to ask for recommendations on dinner- laundry facilities and vending machines- flat-screen tv with access to BBC- free internet cafe on first floor- bus to airport from Conrad Hotel nearby (app. $30 each way)- surrounded by train lines and office buildings, however the noise insulation is extremely goodDownsides:- breakfast is included and is enough to get you going for the day, but nothing glorious- no safe to store documents, however I never had to worry about that in Japan- very little storage space with minuscule closet, however I used the space under the bed for luggage- the hallways can be interesting to navigate in the morning at the cleaning ladies are starting their shift.- beds are hard compared to Western standards, however it is common across Japan considering the tradition was and still is widely to sleep on the floor).- I am very geographically coordinated, however got hopelessly lost at night as the buildings do not have logos on them.The location and Tokyo in general can be confusing to get through by subway since there are 2 different systems, however we always traveled by JR trains (i.e. 30 minutes to get to Shinjuku for under $2). We traveled with an infant, and had a very easy time navigating Tokyo with a stroller. We would definitely choose Villa Fontaine in the future, however would like to try a different location for variety. No hesitations at all in recommending this venue though!

<Content>Convenient Location While this hotel appears to cater to business travelers, it was a fantastic option for travelers as well. It is in a great location in terms of being close to many of the metro lines. It's spacious and clean, with a complimentary breakfast each morning. There are also washing machines on every other floor, which was convenient since we were going to be in Japan for more than 2 weeks. There are multiple convenient stores and restaurants nearby.It is also next door to the high end Conrad hotel. You can go to the top of the Conrad to get a great view of Tokyo. Also, Gordon Ramsay has a restaurant in the Conrad as well, for a nice dinner out.The front desk staff spoke a good amount of English while we were unable to speak any Japanese and were somehow able to help us forward our luggage to our next hotel.I would definitely stay here again during my next visit to Tokyo!

<Content>Nice suprise My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights in June 2008. This was a really nice suprise after hearing horror stories about the costs of Tokyo hotels. The hotel is one of a chain around Tokyo catering for business travel. With this in mind there's no pool or gym, but everything else is fine. The bathroom was clean and the bed was firm but comfortable. There are many train lines nearby but the rooms have first class sound insulation and we couldn't hear a thing. This is probably the quietest room we've ever stayed in. The room also included breakfast - soup, salad, bolied eggs, sausages, bread rolls and danish pastries. Certainly enough to get you going for the day.The tv had both English and Japanese chanels. We were very pleased with the value for money, we booked directly via the hotel website - payment on arrival.Shiodome is a relatively new area in Tokyo. The hotel is connected to the Shiodome subway station, the Shiodome elevated train line, and a 5 minute walk (or one stop on the subway or elevated line) to the large Shimbashi station. The Tokyo train system is a monster, with different companies operating independent lines to the same destinations. Shiodome and Shimbashi have good access to most other parts of the city.It is also a 10 minute walk (or one stop on the subway) to the Tsujiki fish market (the worlds largest) and there are sculptured gardens (very nice) nearby, with a tea pavillion set on a lake.On our last night in Tokyo we took a walk to the north side of Shimbashi station (street level) and found an outdoor antique book market with plenty of places to eat nearby. We would have gone there more often if we'd known about it.

<Content>Fantastic value, great environs! I stayed at the Villa Fontaine Shiodome for a week-long business trip. I have stayed at several other hotels in Tokyo and the Villa Fontaine was by-far the best of the bunch. For under $200/night, I got a king bed in a very large room, couch with sitting area, work desk, foot massager, and a soaker tub. It's worth mentioning that the room's furnishings and finishings were ultra-modern -- a style that would more commonly be associated with a $400/night hotel in a major American city.The staff spoken excellent English, the Internet connection was fast, and the room was scrupulously clean. You can access the metro directly from the building's basement. Ginza is within walking distance, but it's easy to get lost at night.

<Content>One of the best in its class! I recently stayed in this hotel during a vacation to Japan and I could not have asked for more! Highlights include:1) Great location: The Hotel Villa Fontaine Shiodome is located just a short walk from several train stations, which makes any area in Tokyo very accessible. It is also within walking distance of Ginza. Tokyo station is not that far away either, which is good for catching the Shinkansen and Narita Express. Furthermore, there are a tun of great restaurants in the area and shopping.2) Good amenities: I would describe the hotel as one for business travelers (although there were plenty of tourists there from what I could see). They have free internet in every room, as well as free computers to use in a room off the lobby. There is a free buffet breakfast, although it is nothing fancy. The rooms are fitting with a modern decor. We stayed in two room (one double and one triple). The triple was huge and the double was on a small size. They were both clean and seemed to be in good shape.3) Friendly staff: During the stay, the staff were very polite. They spoke pretty good English and were happy to print out maps to places were looking to find in the city.4) The price: it is safe to say that I have not stayed in a hotel of this quality for the price I paid. It is a great deal and I will stay there again when I go back.There is another hotel, called the Conrad, located right across from this one. It is pretty expensive to stay there, but all are welcome to have a drink in the hotel lounge. There are great views and live music at night. I highly suggest that you check it out!

<Content>Good hotel, good value in a nice modern building We were first time visitors to Tokyo and found this hotel to be convenient and good value. The rooms are good sized for japanese hotels (we certainly didn't have problems fitting into the room properly with 2 large suitcases), bathroom is quite small but adequate (and like everywhere in japan the toilet seat was great!) The building is very modern and the hotel shares it with offices. The hotel itself is funkyly decorated - quite nice.Service was v. good - very prompt and polite.They have next day or overnight laundry service which we found v useful and not too expensive (like London prices).They also have internet connection in every room, or if you don't have a computer with you, there is a computer room you can use.Breakfast wasn't great - a few pastries, boiled eggs, sausages, japanese salad and soup, bread, tea/coffee and orange juice (that's all they had, and every day it's the same).It's 10 mins away from Shimbashi station (best way to reach the station is underground) which we found v useful because we travelled from Tokyo station (which was 2 stops away on the JR Yamanote line) a few times.It's also about 10-15 mins walk to Ginza and 15 mins walk to the fish market.We went to Roppongi quite a few times and it was about 1,500JPY by cab which I thought was cheap.We would go back.

<Content>Great value Very helpful staff that spoke good english. Location was very easy to find. We spent a little extra to get a larger room. Large room was a the size of a normal western room. Price was great for the area. We paid $180 per night. You do have to pay when you check in. The breakfast was decent. Soup, rolls, boiled eggs and sausage was included with juice and coffee. It rained one day but the building has the subway in the basement and is attached to a couple other buildings. Never had to step outside to get wet. Other high priced hotels didn't include breakfast. You'll pay half price here for a stay. Internet (with a laptop) was included with an ethernet connection (very fast in a business room). No complaints, it was a very comfortable room and a great value for the price. I would recommend it to anyone going to Japan on a short trip. We stayed for four days. It is right next to the Conrad Hotel.

<Content>Very good value I had checked this site to find a hotel in Tokyo when I was visiting for two days in March. I stayed at the Hotel Villa Fontaine, and overall, I would have to say this was a very good hotel stay. My room was $120/night. The rooms were clean and modern, and the hotel had a quiet elegance that was very Japanese. There are a number of good restaurants nearby. The breakfast was adequate, but particularly limiting to vegetarians such as myself. (Bring breakfast snacks.) I would definitely come back.

<Content>Excellent value for money Great property and excellent value for money. Modern building. 10 min walking distance to Ginza area, and to Shimbashi station. 3 min to Shiodome metro station. Rooms are quite spacious for Japanese standards. Room rate includes internet connection and a light brekfast. Overall it's a great choice for business travellers. Neverthless, I wouldn't advise the hotel for first time tourists in Tokyo.

<Content>Good deal for what it offers Villa Fontaine is a satisfactory hotel in every way. It offers everything you need for a comfortable stay, and nothing more, but for the price, you shouldn't expect more. There is no restaurant, and no bar. There are no luxurious beddings or toiletries. The furniture is modern utilitarian. The overall feel is cool urban, although a little bit on the colourless side. Villa Fontaine is clean, it is quiet, the staff is professional and efficient. It is a business hotel. The location is excellent. Bars, restaurants, transportation all within a short walk, as are many of Tokyo's top tourist destinations. You will not be disappointed (avoid the breakfast and eat at the boulengerie in the underground mall), but you will not be in awe either. When I'm in Tokyo to get business done, especially if I'm alone, I'll stay at the Villa Fontaine. If I'm with my wife, and I'm looking for a more laid back fun time in the city I'd stay across the street at the Park Hotel.

<Content>Great location, no extras, awful breakfast Shiodome is the most recent developement of Tokyo's urban planners and you can feel it at Villa Fontaine. The building is extremely modern and partially used as office space. It's typical Tokyo: You can spend an entire day without ever seeing the sunlight. The hotel is connected via an underground passage to the Shimbashi metro and JR station (Yamanote loop line). Very convenient. Take a metro to Shinjuku and go shopping - in an underground mall. Step out into Roppongi nightlife later on and then head back to bed.In the morning it's a short walk to Tsukiji Fish Market - a must see, though not a charming experience like, say, Sidney Fish Market or Hamburg's Fischmarkt.The in-room facilities are good. Everthing's small, but you're not here to spend a lot of time in this room awake. There are even some non-smoking rooms available.There's free umbrella rental at the reception desk - can be a real bonus in Tokyo.Breakfast is appaling. They set up a camp-style buffet every morning in the main lobby, hand you the type of trays you last used picking up grub food in the college cafeteria and let you loose on a selection of food that can only be described as random. Sausages (no mustard), next to japanese salad, next to Croissants (no butter but margerine), next to cheap coffee, next to pork soup - it can be called food, but it's definitely not breakfast and you'll look forward to the brand coffee shop from Seattle next door.Overall: Good value for money (15,000 Yen/room incl. breakfast).

<Content>Great price and location I stayed at Fontaine Villa Shiodome for four nights in mid April and paid 11.000 Yen (110 USD) per night including breakfast and taxes. The hotel is located in the modern but somewhat soulless Shiodome area. There is a Metro just outside the hotel (Shiodome) and a major station (Shimbashi) 5 minutes walk away. When going to or from the Narita Airport I can recommend taking the Airport Limousine Bus to/from the Conrad hotel that is just next door. That鈥檒l cost you 3.000 Yen and you won鈥檛 have to drag your suitcases around in the subway. Get a metro pass and you are good to go for some Tokyo exploring. The staffs speak good English and are very helpful. The hotel is part of a 鈥渃hain business hotel鈥?but looks reasonably stylish although the rooms are getting a bit worn and torn. The room is small to medium sized with a good-sized closet. There is free internet connection in the room (bring a cable) and a fridge. The bathroom was OK in size with a 鈥渇unky toilet鈥?that you can do all kind of stuff with. The bed was HARD but it seems like the Japanese likes it that way. There were no whatsoever disturbances in the room and I slept very well. The breakfast was basic but filled its purpose. There are so many restaurants within ten minutes walking but there is no restaurant or bar in the hotel. Who cares when you so much to choose from by just walking for a few minutes, the lazy ones just have to take the escalator into another building and voil谩 鈥?there are a whole bunch of restaurants. There is a 鈥渇ine food court鈥?by Shimbashi station where you can get some great take away food and in the same place there is a supermarket as well. Buy some Japanese whisky - not at all bad. I鈥檒l be more than happy to stay at the hotel again and given the price and location it must be rated top class. If you want more, well, then just cross the plaza to the Conrad and pay 4 or 5 times as much鈥?/p>

<Content>Decent hotel housed in an incredible building We stayed at the Villa Fontaine the last night of our trip to Japan. The hotel is in the futuristic Shiodome area, and the building the hotel is in has a massive open atrium that is sure to impress anyone on their arrival. The front desk was very friendly, and had even held a bit of luggage for us at no charge since we had started in Tokyo and did not want to haul it around with us while we saw other parts of Japan.The rooms themselves are unremarkable, but clean and efficient. Like others have said, there is not much to do right in Shiodome, but Ginza is a short walk away, as is the Tsukiji fish market and Hama Rikyu garden. It is also possible to connect to the JR lines and subway directly from the hotel building (10-15 mins walking underground).A breakfast is included (Japanese and Western), and both of us enjoyed it - definitely a plus.

<Content>Would definitely return I chose this hotel for part of our stay in Tokyo based on the Tripadvisor reviews. My husband and I were not disappointed. Our room was clean, comfortable and very quiet. There were nice amenities in the bathroom as well as crisp, comfortable nightshirts.We found this hotel to be ideally located, a short indoor walk from the subway and JR. train. The breakfast buffet was an added bonus. For Tokyo, this is a real bargain!

<Content>soul-less Comfortable and clean but in the middle of a new highrise development (and itself part of an office block) so there is little to do in the evening without jumping on the subway to somewhere with more life, although Ginza is 15 minutes walk away. Relatively cheap but worth paying more to stay somewhere closer to the action and a bit more lively.

<Content>Excelent location and service I was pleasantly surprised at the location of this hotel and the quality service of the personnel, along with all the gizmos that Japanese hotel rooms are known for. Hotel Villa Fontaine is located right next to the Shiodome Media Tower, as well as many other business and hotel towers. There is also a restaurant complex located almost directly outside Hotel Villa Fontaine, and a Family Mart conveniently located in one of the hotels, right next to Hotel Villa Fontaine. The hotel is about a 10 minute, casual walk to the Shiodome Tokyo Loop line, using either the sio-site walkway, which is a walk on a walk-way, which crosses over the main roads, or use the sio-site underground subway complex, which also leads directly to the main Tokyo loop subway. Also, there is an airport shuttle, which has a stop in Shiodome (Shiodome Media Tower), for added convenience. Basically, getting to/from the hotel, from Narita Airport is very convenient and hassle-free. The quality of Villa Fontaine also surprised me, since it was much more up-scale than I had imagined. The design is very sleek, with lots of windows, marble, and shaded lights. The basic rooms are complete with air-conditioning, a small refrigerator, a small desk, personal closet, your typical Japanese style toilet with all the buttons on it, a flat LCD TV, which doubles as an info guide, a free internet access port to plug into a laptop, an alarm clock, a wonderful view, and a very clean/sleek decor. The price, considering the location and the amenities, was also fantastic, considering I was only paying about $100 USD per night. The price also includes a basic breakfast, consisting of eggs, toast and coffee from about 7am to 10am.  The only down-side to Villa Fontaine is that the beds are a bit hard, but can be upgraded for an extra $10-$20USD or so, but I'm not complaining here, because the price for the room was quite affordable. Also, the TV only includes basic Japanese TV channels. The TV can be upgraded, by purchasing a 500 Yen card in the vending machine room (1 located on each floor), which gives you access to all the movie channels/MTV Japan for a 12-hour period.Overall: Prime location, very relaxing environment, great cleanliness, amenities, service, decor for the priceTravel tips: - Study up on how to use the Tokyo subway system before-hand. Traveling, using the Tokyo subway, for the first time, while unprepared, can be quite intimidating and confusing at first.- If you're on a budget, get your meals at the local convenience stores (i.e. Family Mart) to save yourself $5 to $10 per meal.

<Content>Great place to stay - even with kids Stayed a couple of nights with our 1yo daughter. We booked a bigger room to make way for the travel cot (although it must be said that a bigger room is about normal size). The bed was really comfortable, the amenities great and the location very convenient. We were surprised at how modern this place is. The only thing we had trouble with was with the train trying to get to Haneda airport, it was very difficult with our baby and all (her) luggage! I would consider a taxi next time.

<Content>Upmarket hotel at a very affordable price Villa Fontaine Shiodome fulfills all the requisite elements of a well-rounded hotel - great value, convenient location, modernistic and decent-sized rooms, and professional staff.The ultramodern rooms are equipped with contemporary furnishings and appliances. They are decent-sized (for Japanese standards); they were certainly sufficient in comparison to other hotels I stayed at in Japan. The toilet deserves a special mention - ever heard of those crazy multifunctional Japanese toilets? The toilets here contain the most extensive functions I have come across in Japan - they contain a seatwarmer, fake sounds, and bidet and shower buttons. The lobby continues the modern, futuristic motif - it is sleek and dimly-lit. Receptionists are professional and efficient, however, their services are limited to those behind the counter; no other staff can be found beyond the reception desk (reflecting the affordable rates). Prices are inclusive of a buffet breakfast - while limited to one type of salad, boiled eggs, mini sausages, bread rolls, soup, coffee and tea, it is adequately filling.The hotel is conveniently located a few minutes from the heart of the city, yet quiet enjoyment can be found here. It is of short walking distance to 2 train stations (connected via indoor passageways), a bevy of restaurants, a convenience store plus a shopping centre linked to the underground passageway.This hotel is a wonderful find and is highly recommended to all travelers.

<Content>excellent stay This is my second time in Japan. We stayed in this hotel for two nights after our Hokkaido tour. Hotel is very clean  convenience. Since we have three people, so we have make a reservation for 3 from hotel's web site. Price is pretty good for three of us to share.Location is little bit away from Shiujuku, but it is quiet area during the night  the weekend. If you don't like the busy area, this will be your good choice.We used the airport limousine service on the neighbor's hotel to go back to NRT which is very convenience, too.Only one thing I don't like it is the bed is too hard.

<Content>Value for Money at Villa Fontaine If you are on a business trip to Tokyo and want a simple, efficient and affordable hotel to stay in, you cannot do much better than the Villa Fontaine in Shiodome.Occupying just ten floors in one of the skyscrapers in the new Shiodome area, the Villa Fontaine has single rooms for just 13,000 yen -- and throws in a modest but adequate breakfast to boot.The rooms are small and the bathrooms even smaller but then again most rooms in Tokyo are. But there is free internet access, security is very good and the hotel is modern, has a very impressive lobby and is quite well laid out.Also, as it is in the Shiodome area and adjacent to both the Shiodome and Shimbashi stations, you can just take a train to just about anywhere. The Yurikamome line going to Odaiba is also just outside the hotel entrance.There is a walkway that connects the hotel to the rest of the high rise buildings and leads to access to Ginza (15 minute walk) and Tsukiji (10 minute walk).There are many restaurants in the building housing the Villa Fontaine not to mention those convenience stores that seem to be in every nook and corner in Tokyo. You'll never want for anything. Coffee shops like Vie de France and Excelsior and a Donut Plant and a Nathans Hotdog outlet are somewhere in the vicinity too in case you find the set breakfast meager (small sausages, bread, eggs and coffee and it's the same fare everyday!)The Villa Fontaine also has rooms targeted to female travellers that are slightly pricier but have special amenities. Unfortunately, some of the rooms have a slightly worn look -- perhaps due to the heavy influx of guests. It always seems to be full -- local businessmen, visiting foreign businessmen, vacationing Japanese ladies on a day trip for shopping in Ginza, backpackers... you name it, the hotel attracts them all.For value for money, I would highly recommend the Villa Fontaine. Spend what you save on a nice sushi meal at Tsukiji instead!

<Content>Great value hotel in convenient location We stayed here in October 2007 on two separate occasions. Whilst we couldn't check-in early (equivalent to 拢8 an hour), we were able to leave our luggage in a secure location. The reception area is stunning and vast and quite impressive. The rooms were of a reasonable size with a good bathroom (and shower), TV (incl BBC World), fridge, wardrobe and desk. The bed was a little hard for my liking, but this did not stop me from visiting a second time. The decor was modern and on certain floors there was a v cheap laundry, ironing board and drinks machine. The rooms were very quiet and we heard no outside noise.Breakfast was a buffet and met every one of our needs. We stuck to the bread, croissants and pastries (with coffee, tea and OJ), but there was soup, shredded cabbage and eggs to suit more eastern-orientated tastes. It really set us up for the day.It's close to Shiodome tube station and about 10 minutes from Shimbashi train station. The restaurants in the same tower block are aimed at local office workers, but we had 2 very good and reasonably priced meals here (including an italian called To The Herbs).I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Excellent location and acommodation After all the horror stories of how small Tokyo hotel rooms are, I was a bit hesitant as the price is pretty cheap considering where it's located.We stayed in the Ladies room, which costs us about 18,000yen per nite per 2 people. With ladies rooms you get foot massager, and 2 other equipments that I cannot remember what they were anymore :PYou also get the other girlie stuffs like hair elastics, make up remover, mask, etc (which we loved !).The pyjamas that they provide is extra comfy too, loved it !The location is great, Shimbashi subway station is only 5 minutes away on foot, and you are surrounded by 3 malls (Caretta Shiodome, Shiodome City Centre, and Pedi Shiodome), so you will have no problem finding places to eat. The staffs at the front desk were helpful as well, they speak good English and are willing to assist. Will definetely stay here again in my future visits to Tokyo.

<Content>Do NOT expect any flexibility in service As my office is nearby, I stay in this hotel on an ad hoc basis when I have to work overnight and need a couple of hours sleep.The cost compared to other hotels in Shiodome is reasonable, the rooms/bathrooms are clean. The amenities incl. pillows are somewhat below average of a Japanese business hotel. Variety of breakfast is limited, but their bread/danish is fresh and tasty!Front desk service seems impeccable if you do NOT face a problem; if you do, then do NOT expect any flexibility or forthcomingness. I was appalled by the rigidigy of clerk Mr. Sato: I asked for a small portion of a conditioner they have in their 13,000 yen Ladies room, as I could only get a 16,000(more expensive!!!) room that night which only has dismal conditioner, but Mr. Sato refused, upon my check-in at 4am(!) when I quickly wanted to fall asleep as opposed to go shopping in 24h convenience stores for a less-than 200yen item. As the rate of Japanese business hotels are on average lower than European hotels, and forthcomingness that does not involve high cost is a norm in Japan, I was truly dissappointed.

<Content>Great value for money Spotlessly clean; seems provide queen sized bed even in single room. Nicely decorated. Chic  new. Breakfast offers not a great variety but of good quality. Very convenient location. Malls nearby. Airport bus does not serve this hotel, but serves the large hotel right behind - just one min away, thru connected walkway. So no need to roll luggage across roads etc
