<Content>Basic accomodation stayed at the royal grove for a week and was very happy with the service...they were a very helpful and friendly hotel. The location is perfect..just yards away from the Duke's statue and Waikiki beach. The rooms were fairly basic and needed redecorating but for the price what can you expect !! Recommended as a cheap option for Waikiki which can be expensive. Money saved on the hotel enabled us to do other amazing things in Hawaii.

<Content>Like sleeping at a NYC bus stop...only louder. This hotel is all everyone else says: kitchy, quirky, beachfront, cheap, and old. It is also the noisiest place on earth, and I've lived in New York my entire life. The windows are glass slats from sometime in the 1970's and as such, they never completely close. I was advised by a fellow trip advisor to stay on an upper floor to get away from street noise. We stayed in the old wing on the top floor in a gigantic suite (that hasn't seen an update since 1971) with a shower made for those 4'9 and smaller. We did not have a single complaint, as our Waikiki beachfront palace cost only $71 a night and was, indeed, comical. That is until we tried to get some shut-eye. I cannot express in words the noise level from the street below. It was amplified, I'm not sure why, and we heard every horn, every bus hydraulic, every drunk idiot on the street, and everything inbetween. I imagine sleeping at a 42nd street bus stop on a Friday night might be a close runner up.By all means, stay here if you plan on enjoying downtown Honolulu for its nightlife and are on a limited budget but please for goodness sake, put down several maitais with your dinner and drink heavily before bed if you plan on even an hour of restful sleep. Seriously, if I ever visit Honolulu again and find myself unfortunate enough to have to sleep at the Royal Grove, I would pack some serious earplugs.

<Content>Great, full of personality, but not fancy Royal Grove is a great individual hotel. Plenty of personality and never dull. The staff are friendly as are the guests, some of whom stay for months. The location is good, a block from the beach and right in Waikiki. The rooms have kitchens and a balcony. Remember though that the hotel is not fancy and is quite old. I loved it because I felt really comfortable and not in a typical hotel 'factory'. My duaghter and wife thought it was just so so.

<Content>inexpensive lodgings I stayed there(by myself) Sept 27-Sept 30. My room faced the street the building is located at. Sure I heard noises part of the night but who doesnt when they stay somewhere. Heck, I'm a Motel 6 kin-of-guy and this was quiet to me. I stayed in Rm 404 which was airconditioned and I had a king size bed. Yes there was lint stuff in the wall vent, however, it is not used since you use the a/c in the wall anyway, so big deal. I recommend you have the a/c going full blast all day while you are out and the room will be comfortable by the time you get back in.The room was very clean and there was maid service everyday. I chose the Cat#1 room for $67. Look, all I need is a/c, a tv, clean bed and room and shower and I'm happy. I got up and left the room about 9am and didnt come back until after 4 or 5pm, then only for a short while, to relax and then go out and eat and then less than 5min. walk to the beach to watch the sun go down among hundreds of others.I utilzied the fridge by buying some local fruit at the fruit stands on the other side of the island and brought my own coffee with me. So all that was part of my breakfast in the morning.There is a small Korean take-out restaurant down stairs located on the corner in the same building. They serve breakfast; Portugese sausage or spam, two eggs and an ice cream scoop of rice plus toast for $4. Cant beat it. I saw long lines in Dennys for breakfast who wanted to spend more money and didnt trust the food quality from the small local eateries. Dont know why.If you have a car, you can park about two blocks away for $10 for 24hrs. at the Waikiki Banyan. The hotel has a loading zone which you can unload luggage and stuff and bring it up to your room then you can park the car or just take off.I wanted to use the computer when i woke up early but I was told you can used it from 830am until???. Dont know why 830am is the magical time.I've been to Oahu many times on vacation and with the military and for me, I'm not fancy, this will be the place I will stay from now on. For those who want the $55 room, they they get what they pay for; no a/c and street level noise. Heck just pay $12 more and get the a/c and up a couple stories and youre away from most of the noise.I will stay here again.

<Content>Excellent price, very close to the beach, a bit run down! We stayed at The Royal Grove for 7 nights in July 2008.We thought this was a pretty good place to stay, especially if you are on a budget. The location was excellent - less than a minute walk to the beach, so it was easy to go for a swim without needing to take anything with you to the beach.The room was not amazingly clean - the bed and bedding was clean as well as the bathroom and kitchenette, but the curtains and carpets could do with a bit of attention! There was no air conditionining in our room, instead a ceiling fan and a bedside fan. We needed to have these on all night which was a little noisy and combined with the street noise, it meant I needed to buy some ear plugs!There was no internet connection provided in the room, instead a computer available for use in the lobby.Overall, I thought this was an okay place to stay at a very cheap price for Waikiki! I'm not sure that I would stay there again, and would only really recommend it to someone on a budget who doesn't really plan to spend much time in their hotel anyway!

<Content>great bargain Lets just say this.You can stay next door at the Hyatt for one night, room only.You can stay one night at the Royal Grove, be just as close to the beach, have a nice breafast out, take a surfing lesson, have a nice lunch, go on an afternoon tour, have a nice dinner or dinner cruise, watch the sunset, all for less than the room only at the Hyatt. And have money left over!!!!Plus have a nice hotel staff and feel like you are staying with family or friends.

<Author>WaikikiJEDI
<Content>Month long stay at the mini Pink Palace. Review of my month long stay (August to Sept 08).For the first two nights, I stayed in a One Bedroom Suite:This room faced the main road and experienced the afternoon sun. However, running the AC and keeping the curtains closed kept the room comfortable and had the added advantage of 'drowning out' the sound of civilization outside. (You are in Waikiki afterall). Bed was comfy and EVERYTHING in the room worked  was clean. Probably would have prefered the TV in the 'living area' rather than the bedroom, but I'm not in Waikiki to watch television.Spent the rest of the four weeks in 309 - a corner room with wrap around lanai (Balcony). This room actually seemed to be bigger that the one bedroom suite, but that is because the suites have two rooms. No major issues were experienced with this room and although I did not cook during my stay (hey, I'm on vacation after all!!) there was everything one would need right there - all you need to do is provide the food.. I also had two fully working refrigerators, and I made the most of the coffee percolator, even though there was also a drip filter coffee maker, complete with filter papers.Look, this place is not a dump. It's honest and great value. The staff greet you by first name from day one. The pool and surrounding area is nice and clean, plus you get all the added extras. Books to read, magazines and free newspapers daily, free coffee in the foyer and much more stuff you can borrow. Hell they even made dumbells available to me, so I could exercise in my room.  As for people complaining about fluff on exhaust fans - have you checked the one in YOUR bathroom at home lately? And sand on the Lanai? - hows about rinsing your feet at the beach before tramping back to the hotel? Found a DEAD bug in the bathroom? flush it down the toilet or toss it in the trash. (Bugs probably go to the Hilton as well you know....) These are petty complaints and a call to the front desk will have your issue sorted quickly.You know, there are Hyatt people and there are happy people. I like to think of myself as part of the latter group, (and I bet the front desk gang are part of it too). Big special Mahalo to Donna, for making me feel like part of a family. Thanks also to the Fongs for the great entertainment and a great place to call home, when I'm in Waikiki.Couple of points for those of you wanting to book:1/ Call the hotel directly for confirmation as email replies can be a bit slow.2/ Want a quiet room? - ask for poolside off the ground floor.3/ Pay the few extra bucks for an AC room if you're gonna have issues with warmth or noise etc.4/ Make use of the hotels facilities - borrow the body boards, fins, snorkels, towels, airbeds etc. (You won't find this offered in other hotels)5/ Finally, if you're demanding or pretentious - do us all a favor and book at the Halekulani instead.Mahalo.

<Content>Oh Please Some comments on here do make me laugh! We stayed at the Royal Grove from Aug 29th until Sept 3rd 2008, in room 609 and had a view of waikiki beach! (Apparently room 609 is the favourite room - I assume for the view)Ok guys lets put this into perspective, you pay 55 dollars a night, for a hotel literally 2 mins from the beach in Waikiki and you moan about it?! If you want the Hilton, which clearly you do by your comments, then go pay 5 times as much per night, and no doubt some of you will moan about that.Yes the hotel is old, very old, and the furniture, decor is perhaps 1970's, but one thing every hotel needs to be is CLEAN, and I was absolutely impressed with the cleanliness of my room. Yes there are silly signs everywhere which did make me smile, but as long as somewhere is clean, then I'm a happy man! I would have no issue in staying here again, but I do appreciate that if i wanted a trendy hotel with posh fittings, i'd be prepared to pay alot more in price!!!!All of the staff were really really helpful, and really friendly, which made it a perfect stay in honolulu

<Content>We loved the Royal Grove - It is what it is! I stayed at the Royal Grove with my partner and 10month old son for 3 nights and we really enjoyed our stay there. The photographs on the website clearly matched the room we stayed in. I was particuarly impressed with how clean the room was as well as the bathroom. We had AC and there was no problem at all.The reason I say that it is what it is is because you are paying on average $55 per night! You can't beat the location and the service we received could not be faulted. My younger sister stayed there last night and is returning again in a few weeks. She is staying there with her best friend and they absolutely loved it!! It's very retro, kind of reminds me of old school family holidays...Put simply I loved it and I would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Like staying at an elderly aunt's apartment This wasn't the worst place I have ever been and it definitely has a lot going for it. My husband and two kids (16 and 9) stayed here for 10 nights. My husband was disappointed, however and thought we should have stayed somewhere nicer. It was a bit embarassing to tell people where we were staying but I spoke to another couple who were paying twice as much and their hotel was just as dated/shabby so the price is certainly right. We paid under $800 plus $120 for parking for 10 days. Really cannot beat that. Parking is not convenient but everything else is. There is a market downstairs and a good restaurant. Shave ice on the corner and across the street is another market which is open earlier than the other. My kids enjoyed the convenience of borrowing flippers, toys, beach mats, snorkles, (near the front door) boogie boards (behind the pool) etc and we walked to the beach nearly every day and had a shave ice every evening. They have surf boards to loan as well. There is a coin operated laundrymat open until 11pm in the hotel and in the laundry room there are coolers and lawn chairs you can borrow. We took a cooler to the North shore and had a nice picnic. They will also give you towels to use at the beach. They have hairdryers and irons to loan out. Laundry soap is 50 cents and dish soap is a dollar at the front desk (cheaper than in the market). Front desk staff are indeed helpful and polite. You can pack pretty light. Everything you need is right in that building. The closet is fairly large with lots of hangers. There were 13 drawers in our room (double with two single beds) so storage was no problem. For some reason our room had a multitude of mirrors which I thought was funny. Mirrors above each bed, back of bathroom door and in bathroom. Guess they saved on art work?The dominos pizza man comes around every evening around 6pm with small pepperoni pizzas for six bucks and he will bring you something else if you ask. One evening our kids swam at the hotel pool and ate pizza while we did laundry and checked our email. The bathroom was not up to my standards of cleanliness and I am not a picky person. I didn't like the mold around the bath tub fixtures and the dirty air intake. The maids were supposed to come in twice a week but as one of the previous reviews said it was hit and miss as far as cleanliness went. They never did sweep the lanai floor so we had sand everywhere. My pillow had a foul odor so I got a new one. Bed was ok to sleep in. We had to keep the a/c on all the time and turn on the fan or the room got too warm. Be careful, even local phone calls are 50 cents apiece from the room.The neighborhood has a fare share of vocal mentally ill people hanging around but there were always lots of other people there, even at night, so we never felt threatened. I wouldn't let my kids go out by themselves though. All in all this is a good place for a budget vacation and I might stay here again if I have the kids along. They liked the hotel and appreciated the beach toys.

<Content>Never Unpacked I'm not here to question the criteria or discretion of my fellow travelers. I'm just flabbergasted to compare their findings of this hotel with ours. We arrived on Aug 7th for a weeks stay. I expected the location to be super and the exterior of this facility to be dated, but I was truly shocked by the interior conditions. We had a kitchen with twin beds and an adjoining bedroom with a double. Upon entering, we were struck by the obvious deterioration of the furnishings as well as the distinct filth. The kitchen table had a layer of dirt, the AC filter was clogged with grime, and every air duct had a greasy film fluttering in the breeze. The beds were barely OK to sit on, but we couldn't fathom crawling between the sheets. We quickly realized this was not for us; first impressions were going to be lasting impressions. We secured other accommodations and explained to the clerk that we were not able to stay. She was very understanding of our situation and there was a satisfactory conclusion, We vacated with no charge, and I assume someone was willing to take our place. To each their own, but we never unpacked!

<Content>dirty and hot!!!!! my review is for the old rooms @ $ 55 p.n. aka old wing room as mentioned in lonely planet.the royal grove is located a 2 min. walk to waikiki beach and 1 min. from kuhio ave. (where most of the buses stop)we stayed 2 times at royal grove. the first time the room had twin beds and was very dirty,hot and smelly.the bathroom was disgusting and absolutely NOT clean (dust and the hairs from previous guests were everywhere!! even the floor was dirty. we also had a dead cockroach behind the toilet) the maids didn麓t CLEAN the room not even close, they only made the bed, but only if you don麓t leave any private things on the bed.i really wonder why the hotel has such good reviews- but i also don麓t know the rooms w a/c. (in the new wing)forget sleeping, it was VERY loud because of the restaurant and traffic noise. the only positive to mention is, that the people at the front desk were always friendly and helpful.NEVER AGAIN!!!

<Content>Excellent value My 18 year old daughters and I stayed here for a total of six nights, and it was the best value accomodation we stayed in during our three weeks in Hawaii. Given the price we weren't expecting the Outrigger or the Halekulani (though some of those who left negative reviews seem to have been) but we were very pleased with what we had. Quirky is probably the best word to describe the Royal Grove, and it certainly had a unique charm. One of my daughters described it as like a youth hostel with private rooms, and that was meant in a good way. It was odd walking throuhg the back of the restaurant next door to get to the stairs, but if that sort of thing offends you, take the elevator!We split our first 5-night stay over two rooms because of a mix-up in the booking that was about 75% our fault, but which the hotel sorted pretty quickly, and had a different room on our one-night return visit, so had a chance to see more rooms than most guests. (If you're in the main block, ask for a corner room - much bigger lanai.)All three rooms were pretty shabby and would benefit from redecoration, but I'd rather have shabby and cheap and save the money for eating out. As well as a microwave and full oven there were, somewhat bizarrely, two fridges. We were able not just to make our own breakfasts but to cook full meals a couple of nights, which also helps keep costs down. The pool was smallish but big enough to swim in, with plenty of tables and chairs around it. Internet in the lobby was good value at ten minutes for a buck, and you can print as well. As well as beach towels there are beach mats and other useful things you can borrow.Because we're cheap we walked two blocks to the parking lot that charged $10 per 24 hours, but if that's too far to walk you can park across the road for $12 a day.If you want spotless and newly painted rooms, go somewhere else and spend a lot more, but if you want basic but perfectly acceptable accommodation for a ridiculously cheap price given the location you will struggle to find anywhere as good value as the Royal grove.

<Content>Best deal here - great! Of the five places we stayed as we travelled around Hawaii, this was the best deal: a kitchenette and private bathroom in our own room for just $55 per night for the room with two single beds. It's also a minute's walk away from the beach, shops and restaurants. We'd definitely stay here again.

The room was fine, although I would suggest that the drapes be drycleaned; they were somewhat dirty/stained.Everything else was reasonably clean.The staff was always friendly and helpful, They were always willing to answer any questions we had.The location is terrific. On;y 2 blocks away from the beach. Public transit and restaurants were also close by.We felt safe the entire time. This is an extremely good value for the area. We will return someday.

<Content>Great location, friendly staff, rooms need some work We stayed here for 3 nights recently while on vacation, based largely on the glowing reviews on Tripadvisor. Certainly, the Royal Grove is well situated, inexpensive and quite clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. The downstairs sitting area is welcoming and the other guests were pleasant - we encountered mostly younger couples and young families. However, the two rooms I saw could really use some maintenance. In my room, the top of one of the chairs was detached, one of the lampshades was heavily stained, window screens were clogged with dust and the walls were quite scuffed. It seemed like some fairly minor upgrades to this particular room would have made a big difference. It's possible that some of the other rooms are in better shape - I only saw two. Street noise (early morning garbage trucks, etc.) can also be issue, depending on where your room is located. Overall, I am not sure if I'd stay at this particular property again.

<Content>The best deal in Waikiki We had a great stay at the Royal Grove. Yes, it's worn and dated, but it is also CLEAN, inexpensive, centrally located and friendly. We stayed for 4 days at the beginning of our trip and liked it so much that we came back for 2 more at the end! Our room was everything we could have wanted - it had a nice stocked kitchenette with a refrigerator which we used to cook breakfasts (saving us lots of money). Its location (less than a minute walk to the center of Waikiki beach) allowed us to go surfing every day, walk to shopping and restaurants, or hop The Bus to anywhere. The health food store downstairs (Ruffage) makes killer whole grain turkey sandwiches (for packing on a hike up Diamond Head), and the smoothies shop made us so many yummy taro bobas that we lost count. The room was cleaned daily, we had fresh towels constantly, and the staff was very friendly - holding our bags while we picked up the rental car, lending us beach towels, snorkles, umbrellas etc. The next time we go back, we're going to just stay for a week...

<Content>Royal Grove Rocks (or at least jams on Tues nights) I visited the Royal Grove on 05/20-05/23; aside from the weather, which was generally overcast with some light drizzle, I had a great time during my stay in no small part due to the Royal Grove. I arrived at the hotel and checked-in at around 3pm; my cousin, with whom I was sharing the room, arrived at around midnight (after his flight was delayed) and had no problems checking into the room after I informed Christy that he'd be arriving later.The really cool part about the stay (aside from the great price and the proximity to the beach) is the jam session that took place on Tuesday night. The owners (the Fongs) invited some of their friends over to jam to some Hawaiian tunes on some ukuleles, an acoustic guitar, an electric guitar, an electric bass guitar, and a set of drums. The music was pretty sweet as was the impromptu hula session given by the (daughter-in-law?). After the jam session, I had the chance to meet the Fongs, who as it turns out, have owned the Royal Grove for about 40 years now. Although they still own the hotel, the Fongs leave the day-to-day management up to one of their sons, Tim, whom I also had the chance to meet. I'm not sure how Tim does it, but the staff he works with was generally really friendly and helpful. Speaking of which, Christy, one of the ladies behind the counter was a total rockstar of friendliness and helpfulness. She wasn't alone in this; I was able to get directions to a good (and inexpensive) salon for a haircut, directions to a place for good eats nearby, etc. throughout my stay.All in all, I had a blast during my stay at the Royal Grove and look forward to another stay there.

<Content>A cheap hotel reminiscent of the seventies. The location cannot be faulted and the price does not reflect the little gem that it is.The decor is dated, the hotel needs an overhaul but that is also part of its charm. Even the parrot in the reception is a little bonus. Do not expect in room service or concierge (although they will do all they can for you) but do expect a decent sized room that has a fridge and a hotplate. I didnt have much problem with noise but then again we used to hotel for sleeping in after a full day.Being central you have all the shops you need in the area including small restaurants and takeaways.Definately recommended.

<Content>Good location This hotel is really in a very good location, very convenient to everywhere. But the room along the street side is very noisy...So if possible avoid stay there. There's a Korean small restaurant next to the hotel, their food are great, very good value and very tasty,

<Content>Real character hotel After reading about the Royal Grove on TripAdvisor we thought we would give it a try and it did not disappoint. This hotel is probably one of the few left in Honolulu with genuine character. OK, so it is a bit worn around the edges but the hospitality shown by the staff, the proximity to the beach and most importantly the price more than compensate. We loved it!

<Content>Great Budget Hotel Royal Grove was as advertized in other reviews. Great location, couple of blocks from the beach at the main attractions/shopping end of Waikiki. Our room with kitchenette was fairly spacious, very clean, no bugs, even had a partial view of the ocean, also quiet. The hotel is a superb deal at a price of about $70 night. The furnishings are dated and the room could use a modernization, but at the price and location it cannot be beat.

<Content>Wonderful as Always A++ Again !! This is our second visit to the hotel. $55 - $60 per day. Remember the price and keep everything in perspective.Age/Condition of The Hotel: We were told that a man sitting across from us (in a motorized chair has been coming there since 1968, so the hotel is quite old). It has aged gracefully because of the care it gets from the staff (and the long-term residents who often come from Canada and often stay for 5 months).The hotel is rated as a 1 star budget hotel, but has so much care and Aloha that it really is 5 stars.Some of the bathroom paint (in the closet) was peeling, some of the baseboards are disjoining from the walls, the hall did need a good shampoo and vacuum. But- we thought there was new carpet in our room (a 1 room air conditioned room, with complete small full-service kitchen).Tv channels are not something to spend time in the room for. But, I would not want the hotel to spend any extra money on TV- in fact, save the $ each month that they spend now and take the TV out. Entertainment (Free):Every second night, there was music coming from the lobby. Music from friends of the owners (the Fong family) who care enough to continue to drop by to entertain the guests (for the last couple of decades from what we heard). There was classical piano music coming from the lobby, from an elderly gentleman guest, who wished to share his wonderful talents. New Years Eve- there was music, pot luck food, and lots of Aloha. We really did not participate, but sat on the veranda and listened to the lovely music and fun. I think some of the guests/residents make it a point to come on special occasions. One gentleman told us that he comes yearly, and has several children, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren,.... and he IS AT the Royal Grove. This place has special meaning for people.The staff have been there a long time, and this says a lot about the comfort they feel there. Guests/residents have been coming a long time, and that says a lot about how they feel about the place. We will go back again.Yes, as a reviewer said, bring your own shampoo. The hotel DOES give several bars (small) of soap, kleenex replenished regularly and toilet paper replenished regularly.For a place that supposedly gives cleaning 2ce / week for guests staying 1 week, the maids were really around 4 or 5 times out of our first week, and the same for the second week. ...They start working at 7 AM ! Put the do not disturb sign on if you want to sleep in.Not one bug! And I hate bugs!!! They regimentally spray monthly!! Cement building (not wood).Nelson, the maintenance man always has a smile on his face, and is always there, every day. Holidays included. He must feel like he is at home there:)Thanks to Steve (night staff), Donna, Debbie, Christie, another lady (sorry my brain is fuzzy), Nelson, Jimmy, and the elder owners Mr. and Mrs. Fong- and everyone there I can't remember the name of. Free coffee and paper in the AM is nice.Pool is cold- your shoulders are warm in the sun, though.Free items in the lobby to borrow (just ask the staff) to meet ALL your beach needs.** 30 seconds to walk to the beach. And we do not walk fast!Security- good because they lock the lobby at 12 midnight, and the hotel is in its own courtyard- very good design.**To book- look at their website and see what room you want first. The hotel staff are busy and don't have time to describe the rooms. Call for info. about availability, once you familiarize yourself with the hotel offerings. We heard staff refer people to their website. Non air conditioned rooms in the older wing are often sold out because of the low-cost... but if you can afford the air-conditioned room (our room had 1 double bed and 1 single bed) it is great because you don't have to have the window open. THE NOISE IN WAIKIKI IS TERRIBLE. A homeless man yelled every 2 AM. Garbage trucks backing up with beeps starting at 4 AM. Loud music from car radios all night. TRY TO GET A POOL SIDE ROOM. Very much quieter.Long-time returning guests are remembered and appreciated by the staff and management. All are treated with respect.We will go back again. Tip regarding travelling- if you can live without a car rental- do so. The cost is high, the parking is very very limited and adds to the cost of your trip. The Bus is $2 and they give you a transfer (one transfer offered 2 hours another offered 4 1/2 hours) so we got off, did something, and then got back on again. The most we spent in 1 day was $8 for 2 of us. We used The Bus every 2 or 3 days. Save your money. We went around the island on The Bus- even past Hanama Bay (great value for money !!). Waikiki has many well positioned bus lines. They knew what they were doing when they designed Waikiki and its bus system!! If you have a Medicaid card, you only pay $1. We are not American, so I'm not sure what you have to do to get this, but if you have this card, it cuts your bus costs down even further.All the best, happy travels, you will love Oahu- we do.

<Content>Great deal a block from the beach! Clean, spacious, comfortable beds, full little kitchen, extra pillows and blankets, new rugs in our room. Small but clean bathrooms--bring your own shampoo. We were able to borrow an iron and full size ironing board. They also had beach mats, boogie boards, snorkels, etc. to use. Free newspaper everyday. The management had a very friendly family feeling.The decor is dated but our eyes were mostly closed when we were in the room so it wasn't a problem! There was A/C but we didn't need it.

<Content>70s style hotel close to Waikiki Beach We only stayed for 1 night, as I really needed somewhere with internet access.The room was a good size, but very outdated and in need of a facelift. The location was brilliant - a short walk to all the shops and minutes from Waikiki beach.Having the kitchen would be a huge help for those on a budget.If you want somewhere affordable and clean, this isnt a bad place to stay. But we ended up getting a great last minute deal and moving to a nice refurbed 3 star with a view just around the corner for $90+tax.

<Content>Best deal in Waikiki Beach Just found this lovely hotel trough tripadvisor,and stayed there for 4 nights. The rate of 75$ for a standard room is by far the best deal you will get in Honolulu.The rooms are spacious and have also a fully furbished kitchen.So you can heat up your own food and pizza,which will save you also a lot of bucks.The location is perfect,just a 2 minute walk,and you are right in the center at Waikiki Beach.The owners are very friendly and help you wherever they can.Just dont expect a new hotel,it has already a couple of years,but in mu opinion,the by far best deal in Honolulu.Enjoy it....Jurgen

<Content>great deal just returned from the Royal grove, stayed five nights. had a one bedroom room with a double bed in the bedroom and two twin beds in the living/kitchen area. It is a old hotel, but very clean. Our room overlooked the road, that was ok' because the doves came to visit pretty much every time we went on the lanai, the road noise was kind of loud in the early morning (garbage truck and car alarms) but the air conditioner and fan really helped keep the noise down to a bearable level. The other guests were considerate with the noise level also. The room was way worth the $80.00 we paid considering how expensive it is in Waikiki. Would definately return. Again, clean, NO BUGS of any kind, quiet for the most part, close to the beach and shopping and food, what more could you ask for!

<Content>I loved this place! I was more than happy with my stay at the Royal Grove Hotel! I was told 609 was the most popular room, only forging out 60 dollars a night for a 2 bed room with a kitchenette, airconditionining, and a partial ocean view! Its 2 blocks from Waikiki beach which I could see out my balcony, and across the street from a little mexican restraunte, a surf rental shop, and your choice of 3 or 4 ABC stores in a 2 block radius, Most importantly, the room was CLEAN and free of bugs! The shower had good water pressure, which always is a plus in my books. I have nothing negative to say about this place! The front desk was GREAT, very friendly, and the housekeeping staff was always smiling and saying hello as you pass through the halls. I enjoyed my stay, and I encourage anyone who is looking for a cheap stay to book at the little pink Grove! Enjoy!

<Content>Cant beat the price and the staff were great Hats off to the staff at the Royal Grove Hotel. If you are expecting the Ritz then you can go to one of the OUTRAGEOULY EXPENSIVE high riseHotels anywhere in sight. The rooms are dated of course, but clean andvery adequate. After all you are in Hawaii to see Hawaii not four walls of a hotel. Our trip turned out to be less than a vacation as my mother traveling with me became quite ill and had to have emergency surgery right afterarriving in Honolulu. The staff was absolutely great. Because of the uncertainty of our departure because of the hospitalization I needed to stay an additional week at the hotel. Because of the season beginning the hotel was completely booked up but the staff was able to find additional room nights for me for an additional 7 days. Try and find that at one of the other upscale hotels, I dare you. All of the guests at the hotel were very friendly and a very community-type atmosphere. MANY of the guests were regular returningguests from previous stays at the hotel. This says a lot to me. Evenings you could find a few of the local and family members of the hotel owners in the lobby playing traditional Hawaiian music for the guests. This place really makes you feel like you are visiting with relatives on the island and a party of the family.Had it not been for the friendliness of the staff and their going OUT OF THEIR WAY to make sure all of our needs were met, Im sure this tripwould have been a TOTAL disaster. Everyone always asked how my Mom wasdoing and when she returned from hospital, there were big smiles on everyone's faces to see that she was doing well.ONCE AGAIN, I cant say enough good things about this hotel. I travel quite a bit and can tell you, there wont be another experience like it anywhere. One hint though. Try to get a room on the pool side of the hotel as the traffic noise on the street side can be a bit distracting early inthe morning as is with most every other hotel in the Waikiki area due to deliveries etc. KUDOS to the ROYAL GROVE HOTEL.Rick ApfelbeckNov 9, 2007

<Content>Good Value, Good Location Stayed for four nights and could not complain about anything. The price is right, the location is great, and it is very laid back!Not a bad Mexican Restaurant between hotel and the beach, Hawaiian food is not the best unless you have a strange craving for Spam.

<Content>bed bugs! Upon arrival, I was told we were upgraded to one of the two units they own in Pacific Monarch across the street. Shortly after we laid down to sleep, my baby started to cry. I looked and noticed some bugs moving around his face in the dark. Lots of blood came out as I crushed the bugs. I turned on the light. It was a horrible scene. There were bugs crawling on the bed and more coming out of the pillows. I called the hotel and were moved to the other unit they own in the building. We didn't find any bugs on the bed. But every morning I still woke up with bed bug bites. The carpet was filthy. One unit had a microwave the other didn't. The A/C in the living room can't keep the room cool.

<Content>Wonderful place Pleasantly surprised with the hotel. Very clean and roomy. Our room overlooked the pool. Our price was $66 with air, Kitchen, and 2 beds. Very good price we thought compared to other hotels. Very easy walk to the beach even for this old lady. Nice cheap place next door to get breakfast. They do not do maid service every day but if you need it just hang the sign and they will be happy to. The only down side that I can think of is parking. It is cheap only $8 every 24 hours but it is at the Kuhio Prince Hotel which is about 2 blocks away. Not that far but when you have been out all day and tired it is a bit of a walk. Overall I would recommend it and stay there again.

<Content>Great value Me and my girlfriend stayed here in june 2007 for 3 weeks, as we were traveling we were on a tight budget and we came across the royal grove hotel online and decided to book one of the budget rooms for $50per night. This hotel is clean well run and great value for money seeing as it is just a short walk to waikiki beach. I would definately recommend this hotel if you are on a budget and want to visit oahu!!! i would recommend staying here rather than a hostel for travelers as it works out about the sames as staying at one of the hostels in oahu and is much nicer!!

<Content>Great stay at Royal Grove We spent a wonderful week at the Royal Grove. It's not some fancy resort, but it offer CLEAN rooms, good beds and a good shower. Those were the important things! The location is grest, two blocks from the beach, close to many restuarants, grocery store, and shuttles. Paid parking ($12 a day) at the hotel across the street. The kitchenette has full-size refrigerator, microwave, coffee pot, and four burner stove, plus all the dishes, pans and silverware. We stayed in room 208 overlooking the pool. Free use of beach mats, snorkel gear and beach toys was a plus. It was nice to get the free paper from the lobby and have my morning coffee while reading it on the lanai. I felt like this hotel conveyed more of the real Hawaiian spirit than the big resort hotels. As long as you aren't expecting a big resort with lots of activities, you won't be disappointed when choosing the Royal Grove! At $400 a week, it costs less than you could pay per nite at some of the other hotels in Waikiki. We're already planning our return!

<Content>Great Value for money My husband and I stayed at the Royal Grove at the end of August 2007 for a week.The location is soooo handy to beaches, bus-stops,shopping etc.We found our room to be spotlessly clean, the desk service was very helpful and friendly, and the whole atmosphere of the place was casual and relaxed.We chose a room with kitchen facilities, as we were on a budget, and didn't want to have to eat out all the time. The kitchen facilities were nothing great, but perfectly adequate for what we needed, especially the large fridge/freezer.The decor is dated, but everything worked properly and nothing was falling to pieces. And if the decor of the room is of major importance to you, then you should pay ten times the price and go to one of the big shot hotels.Our room was overlooking the pool area,which was as I had requested, because we were concerned about road noise, as we come from a very quiet area.The only noise we heard was a rubbish truck empying a skip somewhere in the block each morning, but that is a job that has to be done, and it gave us a chance to fall back to sleep, and feel like we had had a sleep-in.We were particularly happy to have a room facing Easterly. We had lovely morning sun on our balcony for the first few hours each day, and then in the late afternoon when one was hot and tired from the days activities, it was nice and cool and shady. And if we felt like watching the sunset, then Waikiki Beach was only a 3 minute walk away.We have no regrets at all about choosing the Royal Grove for our stay, I cannot imagine better value for money, and am grateful to others who had posted comments on trip advisor which gave me the confidence to book into a low star rated property. So if like us, cleanliness, friendliness, helpfulness and economy are the important factors, you cannot go wrong here.

<Content>A diamond of a place My husband and I spent our 2 week honeymoon at this hotel. not the most romantic setting for a honeymoon but we were in HAWAII so we didn't care.At first sight it may just be an old hotel but it truley is a gem. Our room was clean and had everyone you needed for a very enjoyable stay.Our a/c worked but for some reason didn't really keep our room all that cold, but we didn't mind that much...Some hotel staff are friendlier than others, but overall very helpful.I was worried about staying here because of how cheap and old it was, but after i read the reviews we decided to give it a go.It is right in the middle of everything and easily walking distance to most things.We hired a car a couple of days and had to park elsewhere and walk a bit, but that is ok. If you were hiring a car for your whole stay it may get a bit annoying.

<Content>Great Place We stayed at the Royal Grove Hotel for 3 nights in August. It is a nice place to stay,and it is absoulutely priced right. It is the probably the best in Waikiki for the price you pay. The only drawback was having to park our car elswhere, but Im sure this is not the only motel that does this. The staff was very nice, and very helpful to us. We did not receive our luggage the 1st day that we were there. So we informed the staff our luggage would arrive sometime the next day, and they assured us they would take care of it, and they did.

<Content>Wonderful! We stayed at the Royal Grove hotel for 12 consecutive nights and had the most wonderful time. Our room was spotless, the beds comfortable, the staff very helpful. The hotel was very quiet and we never had any noise problems (except for the garbage truck doing its rounds outside our window at 5 in the morning a couple of times!) Granted, the Royal Grove is not a fancy place. But having our own kitchen in the room and being located 20 seconds away from the best part of Waikiki beach for $60 a night was fantastic! I highly recommend the Royal Grove if you plan on staying in Waikiki.

<Content>What A deal! Our studio was spotless; altho old with funky furniture but everything worked. The A.C. kept the studio cool and drowned out any noise, the desk/lobby area was entertaining and comfy. We felt safe and from within 30 seconds of leaving our room we were standing in front of Dukes' stature on Waikiki Beach.This hotel is for surfers and guests who do not plan to hang around an exotic pool and spend lots of $ on wall papered, fancy rooms. We were gone everyday doing fun stuff.The pool was fine for cooling off, and the beds were very comfortable. ( there were 2 beds)Parking, if you have a car, is a challenge. We could have, and should have, bought the $50.00 pass at the Waikiki banyan, 2 blocks down the street, for seven days. Well worth it. Almost all hotels in Waikiki charge for parking.The korean cafe next door was good for a quick stop and the area cafes were close and pretty reasonable.Perfect location, nice folks and a feel-good atmosphere...and reasonable. Aloha!

<Content>Consistently just what we needed I just finished reading some of the recent reviews on the Grove and have to say it was nice to see one from our OZ friends and finding we are pretty similiar in our needs. This was our third stay at the Royal Grove and the second for my brother and his wife. We maybe a little superstitious about somethings like  if it ain't broke don't fix it  in that the times we have stayed at the Grove we had a very relaxed and enjoyable visit. I think it is one of a few that what you see online is what you get when you arrive. For less than $70 you get a fridge, 4 burner stove with oven a m/w, and toaster pots and pans plus a coffeemaker but with Me's cafe just around the corner with breakfast and coffee for $4 who cooks.I didn't mention the lanai on which we had a small oceanview but it seems some are willing to pay much more for about what we had. Also the staff and many of the guests we felt were a big help in making it another great stay .

<Content>once again, an incredible experience I will state right now that vacations for my family are about experience,people, and relaxation not about posh surroundings.Yes, the Hyatt has a beautiful pool which overlooks the beach...there are 100 more elegant choices in Waikiki than the Royal Grove...but for stories, for heart, for old school Hawaii, there is no better place, and will never be a better place. The Royal Grove doesn't work to be anything. The Royal Grove simply exists. It is the place you hate to leave, filled with character and characters. The staff is friendly,not overly so. The rooms are clean.(We had the coolest room, on the corner, with a wrap around lanai, and an ocean view...). Men play music in the sitting room on Wednesday nights...sort of hawaii unplugged.It is not a fancy place....it is purely a place I fancy. My home when I visit paradise.

<Content>great location and good price i stayed here for a week in june. i had heard that it's a noisy hotel so i asked for a room on the sixth floor overlooking the pool/inner courtyard rather than a room facing street traffic. my room was quiet, especially with the a/c running. i never heard anyone in the next door rooms- the walls seem to be well-insulated. the a/c barely kept the room cool but it was very humid in honolulu so i'm glad i reserved an air conditioned room. front desk employees were nice and helpful. free daily newspapers were nice to have. the prices are good, especially considering how expensive other waikiki hotels were. the hotel is just 2 blocks from the beach. many stores in the area and the busline to go downtown or to pearl harbor or the airport was across the street. parking was $50 a week at the marriot 3 blocks away. it was also nice to have a kitchenette and cable tv.

<Content>More Great Bargain than Royal What more can you want - clean  functional (but old fashioned  fairly basic) rooms, friendly and helpful staff, excellent location 2 minutes walk from the beach, great korean takeaway  cafe below. I didn't have or need aircon but you might. I was in HL for a conference. Others stayed at the Marriot. I 'Groved' - and glad i did. Back for another conference in January  will stay again.

<Content>Great Atmosphere, Great People The Royal Grove has many great qualities: The friendly and attentive staff, overall cleanliness and great atmosphere. For all those reasons it hurts to have to mention that this hotel is past its prime. However, from what I've heard at seen from other Waikiki hotels, this one was still a steal. My family was able to get what was by far the best rate in all of Waikiki. Along with the positive reviews, this place was an easy decision. We stayed in a one bedroom that was clean and comfortable. One very big issue was the absence of air conditioning in the front room/kitchen area. It was hot. Every night, we had to drag a mattress from the front room to the air conditioned bedroom so our daughter could sleep in comfort. I was told by the front desk that all the one bedroom units were the same. They supplied two fans but they did very little. I would consider staying there again if A/C was supplied throughout. Overall a good deal. If you're looking for a bargain, this one is worth it.

<Content>Another wonderful visit We love this place,this was our third visit and we felt like we were visiting friends,same hotel staff as before and they are all wonderful (Christie can crack you up)we like it because it is homey and cheap,has every thing we need and if it doesn't they will find it for you.True Hawaiian style and so close to everything we want.Not only is it cheap but the rooms are very good sized.Sure the furniture is old and the place is a little run down but who cares,unpack,throw your stuff around grab a towel,enjoy the beach,eat out or in then maybe if you are lucky the guys will be playing music down stairs in the evening and spend a couple of weeks cause its affordable.Make your self at home,they want you to.We were there for Halloween and there was a potluck in the lobby,everyone concocted something or bought something and it was all soooo good.We got to meet alot of people who visit time and time again,after dinner we walked down to the beach and watched people parade around in wonderful and hillarious costumes,wonderful memorys and we can afford to do it every year thanks to The Royal Grove.

<Content>Gotta Love It! Coming from Maui...I don't want to spend a bunch of cash on somewhere to sleep. This place is golden. I'm not sitting in the lobby looking at it's opulence and beauty and ordering drinks from a well groomed bartender.....it's not here. I'm getting excellent directions from people whose first language is English. I'm getting a rate that is phenomenal for this location. I'm getting $8 daily parking 2 blocks away....a steal in Waikiki. I'm getting a staff that won't hand you anything until they clean it first. I'm getting a deal. Especially on the weekend of Pearl Harbor Day, U2 and Honolulu Marathon. Expect a bed and a bathroom and you won't be disappointed....if you want more...there are plenty of rooms in Waikiki, just make sure you don't go broke. Great breakfast 20 feet out the door and a store and a mini-mart around the corner. Waikiki beach is 2 blocks away....3 minutes walk. Some might call it a dump, I call it a deal. Next time I fly over....I'm here!!

<Content>perfect vacation We have been going to the Royal Grove since 1992 and it seems to be getting better. Don't expect the Hilton or Hyatt, it is strictly an old family run hotel with lots of ambiance. The friendliness of the staff, particularly Donna at reception, Nelson the all-around helper, Mr. Fong the owner, Amy our super housekeeper, it feels like home away from home. The loclation could not be better, literally steps from Kuhio beach (which is the best and least crowded beach in Waikiki). Mr. Fong put on a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner with about 80 guests in attendance, turkey with all the trimmings. Guestscontributed to the food and afterwards there was singing around the pool.The Royal Grove is not for everybody but we will be back. It's strictly a happy place to be.

<Content>Decent, not awesome but decent My new wife and I stayed at this hotel in September. We booked it primarily for the price and the location. We knew going in that it wouldnt be the greatest thing in the world...and we were right. Having said that however, we didnt spend all that much time in the room anyways. There is just too much to see and do on the island to spend your time at the hotel. The location was awesome. Less than a 5 minute walk to the beach and ABC stores. Love the ABC stores!!! Our room was a good size. It had a queen, but it felt more like a full, and a twin bed in it. I will say this though, the bed [--]. It was hard and didnt have hardly any cushion. It felt like it was probably from the 60's. The room had a fridge, microwave and kitchen utensils, which was nice cause we made our own lunches and saved cash this way too. We also had a nice big lanai and would eat breakfast out there everyday. Our biggest problem with the hotel was the AC. The first day we got there it was on but it was cranking out absolutely no cold air. We told the front desk staff and they got us a portable AC unit that was on the floor. This cooled off the room for the most part but it was a real pain in the rear. WE had to empty out the water behind the unit when it got too full and even this wasnt enough because we were gone so much. It always overflowed and our carpet was soaked. That made walking on the floor not so pleasant. There was no parking on site and we had to walk 4 blocks to the Waikiki Banyan where it was 40 bucks for a week to park. It wasnt bad considering we were in paradise but after a while it gets to be a long walk. Other than the AC issue and the bed being too hard it was an alright place to stay. We knew going in that it was nothing spectacular and that is OK. I got a kick out of people who thought this place was supposed to be a 5 star place. However, I do think that the given all of the reviews on this place that it is a bit over rated. If you are looking for a very cheap place to stay (we paid 500 bucks for 8 days) than this is the place for you. Would I stay here again? I would really, really have to think about it. I would if I was going there on a very small budget again but I think we could probably spend even a few hundred more dollars and stay at a better place. I hope this helps all of my fellow Hawaii travelers.

<Content>OK stay but limited pool hours We stayed at this hotel in late August. The hotel is a great value but is old with the pool only open limited hours (i.e. 9am-8pm). If you are like me and want to swim early or late you can't because they are stict about this. Also, they had a pot luck supper while we were there but the hotel mananger told us the wrong night so we missed it! This was one of the reasons we wanted to stay there so I was very disapointed about that!Kristy, the lady at the front desk, was great. She has a great sense of humor and always went the extra mile for us. Emilio, the bird in the fount lobby, would chirp and sing to everyone but if you catch him in the right mood he will sing the theme song to the Andy Griffith Show. That was a highlight! Overall an OK stay. The room was always clean and the towels always fresh. I just wish they would extend their pool hours.

<Content>Great Value in a supurb location I have to say that for the money, you cannot go wrong with the Royal Grove Hotel. I had heard about the hotel from some friends who stay there all the time. My first reaction to the cost of the rooms was HUH? It is as you see it on the website. There are no fancy frills here. Simple honest to goodness family style hotel. The Fong family has done a fantastic job and there are so many of their memories throughout. Surf boards, a quilt done by Mrs. Fong. If you can get a room pool side, it is much quieter. But our AC became the hum we needed to drown out the rest of the noise. Kitchen was fully stocked with cookware and essentials and after a trip to the supermarket, we were all set to go. It was so wonderful to be able to step out on our balcony in the morning with a cup of coffe and sit and watch the sun rise as the tropical tradewinds blew across you. When traffic was quiet, you could hear the rolling surf from up the street. It is literally right up the street to the beach. There is also a wonderful landmark which is the Duke Kahanamoku statue on the beach of Waikiki. You are within walking distance to so many great things from the hotel. The International Market Place, Kapiolani Park, just to name a few. The only downside is there is no parking. SO...if you are renting a car, you will need to do like we did. We parked at the Waikiki Banyan which is about 2 blocks away, and paid the weekly rate to park our car. There are locations closer, but they have a high daily rate to park in their garage. That was a minor inconvienence for the money we saved with our room. They have beach chairs and mats you can use to go to the beach. There is music on Wednesday evenings as the Fong 'Ohana would come and play music with their friends. There was music and dancing, food and laughter had by all. It was great getting to meet some of the other guests that were staying there. I ran in to sooo many who have been to the Royal Grove 4+ times. We'll be joining the return to Royal Grove club. It is simple and basic and a treasure right in the heart of Waikiki. Debbie and Steve were great behind the Front Desk. They were always cheerful and helpful and then there is Emilio. He sits on his perch at the door to the hotel and greets everyone with his chirps and whistles.I am recommending this hotel to all I know and we will definitely be staying there again! Mahalo to the Fong 'Ohana. May you all be there for a VERY long time!

<Content>Ok for the money We stayed here as a family of 4 for 3 nights. It was in a fantastic location. We could walk to Waikiki, as it was 1.5 blocks away. Therefore we got to experience the nightlife of Honolulu. It was also a fantastic price, considering what other hotels in the area charge.That said, it had some downsides. The woman at the desk was incredibly unhelpful. She spent most of her time on the phone to her friends, and when I disturbed her (by asking a quick question) she made it clear I was a pain. I was not impressed by her level of customer service. The guy on the desk is much more helpful, but unfortunately the woman seems to be on it far more. When I told her that our AC was not working, and neither were the powerpoints on the right hand side of the wall in our room she said I'm not surprised, everything in this place is falling apart. Our AC got fixed but we had to live without the powerpoints. The night without the AC was terrible. I could not sleep with the humidity. This was not helped by the noise. Forget NYC being the city that never sleeps, Honolulu is. The walls do not block out sound, and people seemed to love making noise in the hallway (usually between 1am-4am), which is not the hotels fault but it certainly is frustrating. All up, considering the price I got what I paid for. If I ever returned to Hawaii I would probably find another hotel slightly better. As a tourist I would have loved desk staff who answered my questions readily.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful I simply cannot say enough good about this treasure. I and a number of other women attended a conference at a larger, much more expensive hotel in Honolulu from July 6-11th. A good many of us had decided in advance to stay over after the conference and make a holiday of it. I had read the reveiws of the Royal Grove and thought it was certainly worth a try, and am I ever glad. The other women who followed my example and did the same thing were also delighted with their stay. The rooms were large, and very clean, the staff were wonderful and the location certainly can not be beat.Yes, the hotel is old, the furniture is dated, but it is all part of the charm of the place. It is not glitzy by any means, but nor is it slick and shiny and impersonal like our original hotel. The Royal Grove has its own unique character which made our stay even more special.The musical evening with a number of locals (including Mr. Fong and his son Jimmy) was the icing on the cake. There were even a couple of hula dancers.The hotel has its regular guests who return year after year, and I can certainly see why. The value and the location are unbelievable and I am sure that one would have to look a long time before finding another property where the personal touch is so evident. I am looking forward to returning in the future and can only hope that this hotel stays open for many years to come!Smithers, British Columbia

<Content>Can't Be Beat We stayed at the Royal Grove Hotel from 6/13/06 thrugh 6/18/06 and loved it. This hotel is the best deal in Oahu. Your two short blocks to the beach and right in the middle of waikiki. The hotel is a bit dated but clean and very quaint. The pool is small but clean. The rooms were big with a kitchenette. If you care about all the small amenities that the big hotels give you with a bigger price, this place is not for you. If your like me and are looking for a clean place with great location and great price, this place is absolutely perfect.

<Content>One Word: Fabulous! My boyfriend and I recently vacationed in Oahu. We stayed for a week at the Royal Grove hotel and loved it. The hotel is quite cute - vintage Hawaiian. They are in the perfect location - VERY close to Waikiki beach (less then a 5 minute walk), and all the shopping and resturants. The hotel staff was a joy - very friendly and extremely helpful, We stayed on the 5th floor. We had a cute lanai and there was even a fridge out there to store drinks and food so we did not have to go back in the room to get stuff from the kitchen. The place was super clean and well kept. There is a pool on site and internet access. There is also the most yummy Korean BBQ place right next door. One of the best deals for good food in Oahu. I highly recommend it. My boyfriend and I would definately stay at the Royal Grove again.

<Content>Good for transitioning to the island My husband and I stayed at the Royal Grove for 3 weeks while we looked for an apartment in Honolulu. The rates couldn't be beat, and the staff is very friendly. The laundry room wasn't overpriced, and they offer free beach mats and toys. With the beach 2 blocks away I never went in the pool. The vegetarian restaurant downstairs is highly recommended. We had an older room without air conditioning, and it was always comfortable. I felt safe in the hotel. With the weekly rate the room is cleaned twice a week, and we never saw any bugs or cockroaches. There is no parking, but they directed us to a garage about a block away that wasn't too unreasonable, for Waikiki.While it was small, it served its purpose for us, and is in a great location--even close to the grocery in Waikiki. Its also on the main bus lines (a montly pass is only $40). If you're used to budget accomodations, this place is a real find, if a bit worn around the edges.

<Content>If you want a lanai (balcony), don't ask for a non smoking room A warming to anyone looking for a non smoking room - I was given a room without a lanai (even though I'd booked a category 1 room with a balcony) because I asked for a non smoking room.I booked a room with A/C and lanai, but was given a room on the ground floor w/out a lanai. When I queried this, I was told that I had asked for a non-smoking room, and the only non-smoking rooms were on the ground floor with no lanai. When I asked to move to a room with lanai I was told I'd need to wait until the following morning as the night reception staff member couldn't change my room.The up side to this room was that it was right next to the pool, facing inside rather than out on to the road, so while there was some noise from the pool during the day it was quiet at night. As a result I decided not to go to the hassle of changing rooms, and so had peaceful nights - but I did miss having a lanai!

<Content>Noisy and overrated I stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks last year, having chosen it on the basis of the reviews I saw on Trip Advisor and I must say I was very disappointed. We were given a very noisy second floor room facing the street and I found it hard to sleep as a result. The room was very large, but rather shabby and dated. The worst part was the parking situation really as it was hit and miss every day as to whether there would be space in the lot across the street. When there wasn't we had to go to another lot about a 10 minute walk away (through an area which becomes pretty seedy late at night). All in all I'd pay a bit more next time for something a little bit more convenient and sophisticated. Unless you're looking for a basic post-beach crash-pad I would avoid.

<Content>this is where you'll find aloha in great abundance Date(s) of stay: Nov 2005Hotel location: 2 blocks from Waikiki Beach, 1 block behind Hyatt Regency. Roberts Hawaii airport shuttle service drops off  picks up at front door. Pedestrian-friendly neighborhood: yesAccess to public transportation: yes 鈥?陆 block away.Room location(s): on 3rd floor. Internal units.Room rate(s): $270 for a whole WEEK!!!Overall appearance: our room faces the apt complex next door. Late evening and early morning traffic noise but not too bad with the fan on.Other guests: budget travelers, seniors, families, students.Quality of room(s): tiny studio efficiency with 2 twin beds, but it's clean and comfortable. Full cable service. Kitchenette stocked with cooking utensils but no cleaning supplies (we brought our own detergent towelettes). A service elevator 20' away, but guests used it, too. Our room was in the old annex: no lanai or air conditioning 鈥?we weren't in the room long enough need either. For those who can afford to splurge an extra $18/night or who plan to stay for more than a couple of weeks, I'd recommend the Category 1 room 鈥?the front desk staff let me take a peek at a vacant room the morning that I checked out 鈥?that room was about the size of a regular hotel room that has a kitchenette as an extra.Quality of bathroom: tiny but serves its purposes. Other amenities: Outdoor pool in courtyard. We didn't use it, but guests did.InterNet access: I don't recall whether the telephone has a modem data port. Lots of InterNet cafes within walking distance (one is the Korean caf茅 adjacent to the hotel and provides wireless service; another in the hotel next door 鈥?8 a.m. 鈥?midnight 鈥?enabled me to do an online check-in early in the morning for a midnight flight; ).Quality of service: If you want to experience true aloha, this place is it!!!!Meals: lots of affordable, mom--pop restaurants as well as posh restaurants within walking distance. A supermarket about 5 blocks away. With the money we saved on our accommodations and eating in the first few nights, we were able to splurge on afternoon tea at the Moana Surfrider the day before our departure. We arrived several hours too late for the Monday cook-out and left several hours before the following Monday's cookout. Security: We experienced no problems, though in the wee hours of the first morning a domestic disturbance at the apt complex next door woke me up and kept me up for almost an hrRecommendation: a resounding yes!

<Content>Great Budget Hotel During the first week of March three of us spent 3 nights at the Royal Grove hotel. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. The room was clean, but showed signs of age. Only the bedroom had air conditioning which was a bit of a problem but the other room had a big fan. We stayed on the second floor facing the street, I recommend you ask for a room higher because of the noise from cars and people. The Room was cleaned everyday, and fresh towels was provided. The room has a refrigerator and a small kitchen, however we didn't get to use it. The hotel provides a safety deposit box for valuables for free which is good. The hotel is situated at a very great location, a short 3 minute walk and your at the beach. Basically every thing is reachable by foot within Waikiki. The hotel doesn't have its own parking space, but its easy to find parking at nearby streets if your patient, or there's a parking lot 5 block north for $7 a day.Now, you might wonder why this hotel gets such a high score. Well the hotel is suited for the budget traveller that doesn't really care about major hotel amenities. If you are a stickler with regards to amenities such as a hair blower, large bathroom, modern looking facility etc., then this hotel is not for you. However, if budget is your concern this is the place for you. Even if you can afford any place, this is still a great place to stay if you don't like hanging around the hotel any way. Why spend so much money on an expensive hotel when your going to explore everything outside anyway.Overall I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great bargain We stayed at the Royal Grove in Oct 2004, during a budget vacation to Hawaii. The hotel and it's rooms are exactly what they look like on the website - very simple and a bit dated. If you are aware of this going in, you won't have any surprises. The location is amazing, though, and we hardly spent any time in the room. You can walk to the beach, shopping and restaurants. Spend a few extra bucks and get a room with AC - it helps drown out the outside noises. Buy some groceries and take advantage of the in-room fridge to help cut food costs. My only complaint is the doors in the room have large air vents, so you hear everything from the hallways and sometimes from other rooms. This can effect sleeping and romance.

<Content>Family setting, very hospitable!! This place is located just a block and a half away from Waikiki beach and priced at an unbelievably low rate. The rooms were decent, but the people who worked there were awesome. They were so helpful and went out of their way when asked any questions. They made our stay there incredible and we will definitely be returning. This place is what Customer service is all about. You can't go wrong staying here!! AAAAA++++++

<Content>Great Place I spent 6 days at the Royal Grove Hotel and I would recommend this place to anyone visiting. The hotel is 2-3 blocks from the beach, retail stores, and near every bus route. The staff was nice, except to people that gave them attitude. My room was clean, bug free, and everything worked. I had heard horror stories about roach motels in Honolulu and the Royal Grove is NOT one of them. Where else are you going to find a place with a balcony and kitchenette for 60 bucks a night. If you are the type of vacationer that just wants to relax in your room or the type that is barely in your room, you won't find a better deal. If you need a jacuzzi, spa, room service, and lots of bells and whistles, better try somewhere else. Hell this place still uses actual room keys and not access cards.

<Content>Great Hotel. Great Location. The Royal Grove Hotel lived up to its expectations. We arrived there August 2-6th and although the old fashioned atmosphere took my children aback at first, they soon grew to love it. We were two blocks from the Hyatt, a block from an ABC store and a block and a half from The Bus transportation. The people at the desk were very friendly and let us borrow beach mats and towels for our day trip at Hanauma Bay. The maids were great -- the room was always made up nicely and the towels were clean.Again, the location and the price makes the Royal Grove a super catch. We could easily walk to Waikiki Beach as well to the other hotels where we caught the Society of Seven and the Magic of Polynesia show. We could also walk to two supermarkets as well as the International Marketplace (hint- the best and cheapest place for souvenirs though is the Aloha Stadium flea market which is opened Wednesday and weekends. The prices were cheaper than all of Oahu and the other three major islands!).Anyway, you just have to stay at the Royal Grove. Aloha.

<Content>There's no place like home-(The Royal Grove) Okay, my husband and I and our two children did a survey after arriving home from our 9 day stay at the Royal Grove Hotel in Waikiki just this last week and we decided that if we were to go back tomorrow and had any pick of hotels to stay at, that we would undoubtedly go back to the Royal Grove....it was unanimous! We are an upper middle-class family and could easily afford a more upscale hotel but we truly liked the casual atmosphere there at the Royal Grove.....like no worries kind of atmosphere. You just stroll in and you can wear exactly what you feel like there (no need to dress up). The room was basic and you definitely have to overlook certain things because fancy it ain't.... :) but our room was fully equipped with everything we needed...we had a stove, full-sized fridge, kitchen sink and it was fully stocked with dish rack, silverware, fry-pan, bowls, mugs, glasses, spatula, and dishtowels, etc., etc. We had our own balcony and you could allmost throw a pebble up to the waterfront. The Hyatt is across the road and up about 50 yds or so and I can guarantee you that those people are paying a heck of alot more than we did and for what? Our room was very clean and the maids did a great job of cleaning up all the sand we dragged in everyday and everyone there just smiles at you and they are all just super friendly. They have lots of things for you to use, such as sand toys for the little ones, boogie boards, they did have a few snorkel equipment also and this is all on an honor system. They have a dining table downstairs and a small pool to use, however I cannot imagine why you would come to Waikiki to use a pool for heaven's sake. Emelio, the cockateil is there in the reception area to great you, however he does go to bed quite early so you need to visit with him early in the day. The foyer area is filled with all kinds of traditional hawaiian memorabilia and surfboards on the walls and a couple around the lounge area...(would you see this at the Hyatt???? I think not!) That's what's so cook about this place.....it's uniqueness! You just feel relaxed the moment you walk in. You can do your wash there cheaper than any laundramat anywhere I've ever known. and they have a safe for you to keep any valuables in if you like. All in all, it was just the most relaxing place we've ever stayed in.......ever!So, like someone else said in a review I read before we booked the Royal Grove is that if you are looking for a place with all the beeps and bells and spa treatments and such....don't stay there but if you are looking for a place to really relax and get all the tension out of your system (which is what a vacation is all about anyway), then do yourself a favor and stay at the Royal Grove! We really want to thank EVERYONE there for making our stay the GREATEST!!!!!!

<Content>Great Trip This was my 1st time in Oahu and the Royal Grove was a great deal. It wasn't the nicest place on the island, but for the price...it couldn't be beat. The staff was very nice, and were attentive to our needs, like directions or restaurants. We stayed in a suite w/ balcony and kitchenette. The bedroom had a double bed and the room the kitchenette was attached to had two twin beds. My boyfriend surfs and had plenty of room for the boards he brought on the balcony. The Duke statue is at the Waikiki beach 2 blocks away. We walked everywhere to eat and shop, and the bus line was around the corner. Try the Cheeseburger In Paradise or numerous sushi bars! Also walk to King's Village nostalgia shop to check out the Beatles cover band!

<Content>Great For The Budget Minded My 4 night stay was all work. So, up at 3am, and back by 6 or 7. So, I didn't go out much. Just to get a bite to eat. Well, my room was great for $62. Didn't see one bug. It was pretty clean. Air conditioner worked great. Great TV. Had a fridge, stove, and kitchen sink. Dishes. Okay, so it wasn't a 5 star, but it was great for the price. Didn't eat any Hawaiian food. So, I ate fast food for 4 days. Lots of fast food places around. Parking across the way is $12 a night and $7 at the Waikiki Banyan, about 3 blocks away. Corner stores all over. Pretty good prices. People who work at the hotel are very nice. It's quiet. It was worth the price. But if you are over 5'8, then stay somewhere else. `Cause this bed was very, very short. I'm 5'8, and I had to sleep in an angle to get in the bed. And it smelled a tiny bit funky. But I was too tired to really notice. If you are expecting a really nice room with a couch and nice furniture, well, this isn't the place. But for $62, it is worth it.murderbomb7@yahoo.com

<Content>Terrific Way to See Oahu! We too had our doubts about such a low-cost hotel in the heart of Waikiki. But, the wonderful lobby, the quiet pool, and the warm welcome of the staff took us one step toward nirvana as soon as we arrived.This is a hotel like I would imagine in one of those old John Wayne WWII movies, where people just wander in, sit down and talk with each other, smoke a cigar, have a cold drink, and just relax. The lobby is a friendly, cool, welcoming place, where you can just sit and read a newspaper, visit with Emilio, the cockateel, or just dream about living in paradise. In addition to finding someone to talk to, you will find magazines, a computer (with reasonable use rates), newspapers, and a piano. You might just find someone to sing along with your playing.In addition, guests get the use of beach mats and children's beach toys that are kept neear the front door, the lobby. There are fresh towels near the pool, which can also be used there or can be checked out for use at the beach, so you don't use your room towels.The rooms are adequate and kept clean, even with only twice weekly maid service. While a little more attention could be given to cleaning under and behind the beds, even my cleanaholic wife was satisfied with how well they were maintained. If you just can't live without fresh towels and wash cloths, you can request them from a maid as she cleans another room, or get them in the lobby.Parking IS a little bit of a problem. Parking is at the Royal Monarch, across the street. Their parking garage was built for japanese cars - very tight. But, in a city where parking is at a premium, the $6/day was worth it.This AIN'T the Marriott, the Hyatt, or any of those other overpriced industrial monoliths, where everything is at your beck and call. If you want them, you have to pay their prices. This is just a very charming, very comfortable, family-owned hotel. If you use a vacation hotel for more than to shower, sleep, shave, and change, go to the Hyatt. If you go on vacation to see the sites, lay on the beach, hike Diamondhead, enjoy the nightlife, and do a little souvenier shopping and spend a grand total of 8-10 hours per day in the hotel, this is the place for you. If we return to Oahu, WE SHALL RETURN.

<Content>Great Place to say! I read about this hotel through trip advisor and was VERY glad I stayed there. OH MY! What a great staff! I met others during our trip and nobody heard of the Royal Grove...which I think is great for those of us who do. Kinda like a secret resort for those in the know. Anyway, my son is planning to return to Waikiki and will definitely stay there. It is not a Hyatt but it is very cozy and homey. Our last night there they were celebrating the owner's grandson's graduation and had some of his friends there as well. We were all invited to the party. They provided the food and entertainment. My only advise is to book EARLY. They were booked solid when we arrived. I booked my room back in February.

<Content>Best deal on Oahu My husband and I spent 6 nights at the Royal Grove and had not one complaint. Staff was great, our room was always cleaned well, and we even had an ocean view from our 3rd floor balcony! It is just steps from the beach, shopping, and the bus stop. Good restaurants very nearby. Parking was only $6.00 a night in the lot across the street. (A DEAL in the area!) Loved it. Would definitely stay again. It isn't the Ritz, but it has everything needed to have a comfortable stay.

<Content>Great litttle place Stayed here for a week at the beginning of May. Could not agree more with the previous reviewer in that it is a fantastic location for the price of the room. Do not expect luxury at this hotel, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for, but when you are here to see Waikiki and not your hotel room you can do far worse than the Royal Grove. After a week walking up and down Waikiki I think this is the perfect location. Only a 2 minute stroll away from the beach, and that is when the Do not walk signs are on just before the beach road:-) The hotel is old and the furnishings are not great but this is a happy hotel and the staff do almost anything to oblige. You get towels to take down to the beach, coffee in the morning if you cannot be bothered to use the coffee maker in your room and the owners pot luck dinners to look forward to if you are there at the right time. Safety deposit boxes at reception are free. Street noise can be a problem as the hotel is located near to a busy road. Give it a go and have some fun with the money you save.

<Content>Realistic Expectations = Rewarding Stay We just completed a 9 night stay at the Royal Grove and, having read a number of reviews of the place on this site and others, felt the hotel met our expectations. The staff was particularly helpful and friendly. We always felt welcome, at home and all our requests were handled promptly and with courtesy. The location of this hotel could only be bettered by a beachfront property, and in this price range such a notion would be out of the question.The Royal Grove is a short block from the center of action on Waikiki. We were moments away from the free nightly entertainment at the beach (6:30PM), were able to conveniently and safely take our daily walk south and through the park and zoo area. It would be hard to find a hotel more conveniently located in the Waikiki area.The room was adequate for our needs and very clean. On the down side, the air conditioner could not cool both rooms, so we kept the door closed between the two. The street facing windows required that we keep our drapes closed at all times to avoid putting on a display for the neighbors across the street.All in all, this was a very good value. The key is to be realistic with your expectations. This is an older hotel in an older building with aging equipment and furnishings. The professional staff and location are big plusses.

<Content>One block from Waikiki Beach-Super location We loved it. Staff was very helpful. Stayed 5 nights. Super location for beach, shopping... Our room and the lobby needed a good cleaning. We had mold in a/c but when asked, the ducts and a/c were cleaned right away. Use the city bus system, don't rent a car or use taxi. -----. We spent $1. each to tour island, go to Pearl Harbor, dinners, Diamond Head... We'd stay again. Don't spend $300+ a night when you can get a great room for $45-$60. Enjoy!

<Content>A locals great find My daughter and I flew over from Kauai where we live and stayed at the Royal Grove Hotel in December of 2004. Living here in the islands costs enough as it is, so all I was looking for was a clean, cheap place to lay our heads. I spent a good three or more hours going over reviews before deciding to stay here, and I'm so glad I picked it. Not only is it really affordable at $60/night for the type of room we needed, but it was close to EVERYTHING! My family flew in from all over the U.S. because my cousin was playing a football game against U.H. and they all stayed at places like the Hyatt and privatly owned house rentals. For the amount of time we all actually spent in our rooms, we all agreed I made the wisest choice. The staff was great, the rooms were clean and included, fridge, stove, and microwave. They also had avaliable, boogie boards, surf board and other beach stuff, for free! Now I do have to say that if you are looking for luxury, spas, and pampering, this is NOT the place to stay. It is a older small family owned hotel. While I was there, I was waiting next in line to add on an extra night, and the couple who were foriegners, in front of me were complaining that there was a cockroach that someone had planted in thier room. Well all I have to say to that, is welcome to Hawaii. There are more cockroaches than people in Hawaii. You're lucky you only saw one! Anyway, I just wanted to share that this was one of my better choices in life! The Royal Grove was great, and anyone who says different should pay the extra money it costs to stay at the Marriott or Hyatt. You get what you pay for and I ended up getting a lot more than I expected. The next time my family and I go to Oahu, we will most definatly be staying at the Royal Grove and spending the extra money we saved on ourselves out and about while we are there. Aloha!

<Content>We had mixed feelings about our stay... The good...A wonderful, accomodating staff and spacious rooms. Great rates, where else can you get a hotel room in Honolulu for $60 a night. Great location, just a block from the beach and shopping.The bad...Very run down hotel. Upon arriving at the hotel, my wife and I almost looked for another place to stay. A very small parking garage is available at the hotel across the street. The rooms desperately need to be remodeled.As you can see, I had various feelings about the hotel. Would I stay there again? Probably not, but if you have a small budget like we did, then by all means stay here. You won't get near this for the money anywhere else.

<Content>Hawaiian style, Hawaiian attitude After landing in Hawaii about 7am I headed into Waikiki with no hotel plan. So after breakfast I went to every hotel I could find to ask about their rates; and more to the point...what the staff were like.And that's what did it. The Royal Grove staff are amazingly, super friendly and it made the whole stay relaxing and homely. Nothing was any trouble and I felt it was easy to ask for any advice, or just chat.For me, I don't really care how squeaky clean or what kind of facilities a hotel has if the atmosphere is sterile or in some places unsociable!That's why the Royal Grove won me over!I would say to folk who are after a fancy hotel that this is not the place, the room was fine but nothing to sing and dance about. The emphasis here is homely, like a friend's house and I'd prefer that anyday to a faceless large hotel.I talked to locals and other visitors about the Royal Grove and they said they know people who go there everytime simply for the family like atmosphere the hotel has.So if that's your priority, the Royal Grove is your second home!

<Content>Hawaii on a Shoestring My husband jokingly told me that if I wanted to holiday in Oahu near Waikiki Beach, I had to find a place for under $50.00 a night. I searched the Internet, read the reviews concerning The Royal Grove Hotel and felt quite comfortable in reserving for a two week stay, which averaged a daily rate of $37.50. Upon arrival I was sceptical of our room, which was in the older wing - clean, but provided neither balcony or air conditioning. While I was made aware of this while I was booking online and felt it unnecessary, I changed my mind when the 85 degrees of heat and 100 % humidity pressed against my body. My husband and I asked at the front desk if we could be upgraded and by the end of the day we were in a room three times the size of the space before. Mind you, the price changed to $59.00 (taxes included) but it was worth every U.S. penny. It had all the comforts of home including a mini bar, stove/oven, microwave, balcony and A/C. Kithchenware was provided but next time I would bring a few plastic beer glasses (for around the pool), a cork screw (one wasn't provided - unless you visit room 202. We forgot ours there!), and a small bottle of dish detergent. The bed was utterly soft and comfortable, and the water pressure in the shower was perfect and we never ran out of hot water. When we asked if it was possible to stay in our room for a few extra hours since our flight wasn't leaving until 6:00 - there wasn't even a moments hesitation. To sum up the hospitality of Mr. Wong and his management was the posting in the elevator a few days before our departure back to Canada. It was an open invitation to all guests to sign up for Thanksgiving supper on November 25th - hosted by the Wong family. Another note to mention is the Oahu Discovery Passport bus pass. It costs $20.00 for 4 consecutive days of unlimited travel. Available at any ABC store. It is recommended to also purchase a Map and Guide Book at the same time ($4.99). Well, worth the money.

<Content>A Royal Place to Stay! I found the Royal Grove through Trip-Advisor and made reservations based on the reviews, and the price. We were going on a shoe-string budget and the Royal Grove is very inexpensive. Our room was $260 plus tax for 7 nights. You can easily spend that much a night in Waikiki! Our room had no a/c, but cooled down nicely after sunset with the fan on.They say with real estate, it's location, location, location. The Royal Grove certainly has that!! It's steps to the beach, bus and trolley stops, the statue of Duke and lots of shopping. It's older, but VERY well maintained. Everything was freshly painted. The staff truly cannot be beat!Many evenings, Mr. Fong and a friend played and sang Hawaian music just off the pool. It felt more like staying in someone's home than a hotel. We got to know some of the other guests while we were there so well that we gave them our unused groceries! Having the full kitchen allowed us to save a ton of money on meals.You probably wouldn't choose this place on looks, but you can't beat it for the ambience! I have NO complaints about the Royal Grove and would stay there again in a heart beat!!

<Content>Good value, friendly staff. We stayed at the Royal Grove from Oct. 30 to Nov. 5. The staff was so nice, really sweet and accomodating after a long flight out to the islands. The hotel had a nice potluck for Halloween, a local Hawaiian band played island music and a dancer performed hula dances. This was all for free! And again, the Fong family couldn't have been nicer. We were really impressed that they would do something like that and felt like part of the family. What was neat to find out was that other people felt like that too. So many couples we met at the potluck were regulars to the hotel that come visit year after year. The hotel is not a resort, so don't be expecting luxury accomodations. However, it was clean, and the location cannot be beat (1 block from Waikiki Beach)! The price is outstanding for the area. Even parking was cheap! Other 'luxury' hotels in that area cost a fortune for the room, and then for parking, so when put in that perspective, you are really getting a deal. We did so many activities on the island that we were hardly in our room except to sleep. So I am happy we saved the money and stayed at the Royal Grove, and brought home more souvenirs.

<Content>Old Hawaii at her best My friend (who is Hawaiian) and I stayed at the Royal from Oct 2 - 12, 2004 and had a blast. This hotel has an aura of old Hawaii and now I would not stay any where else. Most of the staff has been here from 10 to 30 years. We met many residents that have come for over 30 years and stay 4 to 6 months at a time. Our room did not have A/C but we had a fan and slept with wet t-shirts!The parking is cheap at $6/day and the hotel is 2 blocks inland from Duke's statue. There are several good places to eat under the hotel. My favorite is the Korean BBQ place where even the local police eat. There is also a smoothie and Health food store with sushi.The hotel provides beach towels, mats, boogie  surfboards, umbrellas and bikes. Free newspaper every day. The rooms have full kitchens.The staff of Chrissy, Debbie, Tim and Nelson are awesome and we miss them already. We will be coming back every October so watch out!

<Content>Best for the $$$- DON'T HESITATE!!! We stayed here from August 30 to September 6, and the Royal Grove added immensely to our GREAT vacation. As someone who lived on Oahu 30 years ago for almost 2 years, I knew the island fairly well, so in a way I was not a typical tourist. The location of this hotel was great - close to most everything a tourist would be going to in Waikiki... and, it was 2 blocks away from a street that would take you to Highway H-1, where you can access the North Shore and the rest of Oahu easily and quickly. The room was comfy and clean - not extravagant - and large enough for 2 adults. As the price is much more reasonable than most (if not all) hotels in Waikiki, I suppose we were a bit skeptical in staying there, but now, we would not hesitate AT ALL to recommend this place to everyone. We plan on return trips to Oahu, and will not even consider staying anywhere else... unless we win a lottery, and want to friviously throw money away. :-)))

<Content>Inedequate A/C, dirty room - I stayed at Royal Grove for one night during a layover on Oahu because of recommendations on Frommer's and this site and definitely did not have a great experience..First, the good:$6 parking is a great deal for Waikiki, the location is perfect a couple of blocks from the beach and the rooms are spacious and include a full kitchen with all the dishes,utensils etc. and the front desk was very helpful.The bad but tolerableParking is a block plus away from the hotel and is a 5-6 story parking garage with no stairs or elevators - a bit of a walk - and the spaces are really tiny - if you rent anything over a midsize, fitting in one is not a pleasant experience The room was not exactly clean.. a bit of a mildew smell, wet spots on the ceiling, dust. - definitely a few spots below an average motel 6 on mainland. The A/C filter was absolutely filthy and limiting its already pitiful efficiency (see below)The really ugly: Their website screwed up our reservation so they had no record of it when we came. They did have rooms available so we got one with no problem, however, all those rooms had A/C OFF!! (checking it at 5PM this means that the room was probably at 90+ when I got into it) and the piddly wall unit that it has did not succeed in getting it to any even remotely comfortable level until after midnight. I don't know if they would've turned it on earlier if they knew the room wsa going to be occupied... but as it is I could hardly imagine a worse hotel experience. Given that you can get a reputable highrise hotel in Waikiki for $10-25 more a night, I would never consider staying here again

<Content>If you don't mind staying at a dirt-cheap dump! Was there 9/17-9/18/04. I think everyone who loves this place has no qualms about staying in an old, decrepit, dated place. Yes, you can't beat the price for 2 blocks from Waikiki beach, and I wasn't picky either, but I have to give it the worst service because they essentially lied to me. Told me to upgrade to a room not facing the street for less noise when I reserved. When I got there, guess what...my room was on the street. When I complained they were unapologetic, and matter-of-factly told me someone else is staying longer than me, so I got bumped from my original room. No class. I got out of there immediately. Be warned. In comparison, in Maui, I stayed at the much more modern and friendly Sunseeker Resort for the same price -- made this place feel like a shelter. I mean the only thing separating the laundry room from people walking down the sidewalk is chicken wire. If that's your idea of great accommodations, be my guest!

<Content>My experience at the Royal Grove I stayed at the Royal Grove in March of 2000, it was small and cosy. I liked it there, it was clean and air conditioned and so close to everything, and having the parking lot across the street was great because parking in the area is limited. I traveled to other islands and before I came back home stayed there again for two more nights. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I have. I found it in the Frommers Budget Guide to Hawaii. I will go back again and bring more people with me.The price is definitely right and there was even a liquor store next door. Go and see for yourself, you can't go wrong with this place, definitely a good value on many levels.

<Content>Great Hotel! I stayed at the Royal Grove from April 2 - 18, 2004 and will not stay anywhere else in Hawaii from now on. Aside from the great price, rooms, service, location, etc., the staff were the greatest. They knew my name and room number by the second day and were more than helpful and accommodating in every way. A great place to stay! I'm booking 3 weeks for next year and hope to continue to stay there each year.

<Content>My favorite Waikiki hotel! This is a small, unimposing hotel with a truly remarkable ambience. I lived in Waikiki for a year, and I became familiar with many of its hotels. True, the big, expensive establishments are impressive, and if you can afford them, that's great. But if you're looking for a quiet, clean, friendly place to stay that will really make you feel as though you're on a tropical island, you can't beat the Royal Grove for quality and value. I've seen some of the other economy hotels in the area, and I feel sorry for the people who come to Honolulu with wonderful hopes but walk away disappointed or bitter after their experiences there. But if you're on a tight budget, and you have to keep your costs down, but you still want to enjoy yourself, the Royal Grove should be high on your list of places to stay. What I liked best about it was that I met Hawaiian residents from the other islands who were visiting Waikiki and chose this hotel for their base. I joked with their kids who splashed in the tiny swimming pool in the hotel's courtyard, and shared drinks with their parents. They told me stories of their own islands, and I listened with delight. They helped to make my stay there a memorable one. The Royal Grove rates five stars on my personal hotel ranking scale!

<Content>Going for 4 times at the Royal Grove... I found this hotel in Fodor's guide in 1993. I've been to Hawaii many times and have even lived there for a few months at a time. I knew this area well, but had never been inside the Royal Grove before. My family was very skeptical because we knew that it was an older hotel, possibly unwanted bugs, etc. Much to our surprise and happiness, it has the old feel of the islands, what I remember from when I was kid there. The staff is always great, Tim Fong the manager is very friendly. In 1999, my Mother, due to Parkinson's, required a handicapped room and needed a hospital bed. Though Tim said he'd never rented one before, he took care of the arrangements and I paid the modest rental. He also bought a raised toilet seat with handles. Mr. Fong went out of his way to make sure that my mother was happy. It was her last visit to Hawaii and I will be forever grateful to him for making it a comfortable and truly enjoyable one. We love to relax after a long day of beach time or walking around by reading books in the little paperback library in the breezeway or playing the old upright piano, feeling the tradewinds blow through. The real Aloha spirit. If you want an island unto yourself on a very exciting island like Oahu, this is the place to stay. I hope to go back next month.

<Content>Will Be Going Back! I stayed at the Royal Grove on my honeymoon in May of '04. It was well worth the money. Our room had a full kitchen as well as a full size refrigerator on our private lanai. While the room was not the most modern, it was clean  the maids were always attentive asking us if we needed towels, sheets changed, etc. In addition, the front desk workers were always pleasant; they even let us stay in the room all day at no charge because our flight did not leave until 10:30 p.m. I highly recommend this hotel, you will get your money's worth and more.

<Content>Excellent !!!! With 1st time in Hawaii, I had no idea to stay with my kids. I reviewed and reviewed and at the last moment I called the Royal Grove. They made me feel safe and was so friendly and helpful. It was Great!!!! We had a long flight and was so worn out by the time we got to the hotel, they sent us to our room right away. We had a three bed with kitchen, balcony and air. The hotel is in the center of everything and all in walking distance. 2 blocks from the beach and bus stops was around the corner. Our taxi driver said home of the ABC stores and he was right, one in every corner. Food Pantry was within walking distance. International Market Place was within walking as well ( right of the hotel). They have shows on the top level and food court on different nites. Take in a luau, take the Pardise Cove Luau you can catch the bus around the corner. So much about the area to see we stayed 7 days and still not enough day to see the island. But the hotel was the best, I would stay there again! They do not bug you and helpful in every way. They will even call you a taxi when you get ready to leave... A must stay for the money! If you would like to know about the hotel or Island, I have pictures to show as well, just email me.
