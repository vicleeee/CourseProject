<Content>Wonderful hotel We just got home from staying at hotel Andra, and compared to a lot of the smaller hotels in downtown, this one was one of the best. Very friendly staff, great location, and we just walked to everywhere we needed to be. The rooms had much more room than the other hotels we have stayed. Would stay there again.

<Content>Good but not world-class Clearly a luxury hotel but surprisingly ordinary. Room modern but showing signs of wear  tear - not quality furnishings. Good location for shops and the famous tourist sites.

<Content>I always recommed Andra. So, I grew up in Seattle and moved away for a few years and now I am back. I always have and always will recommend Andra to friends and family when they visit as the Andra is the hippest hotel in town with the best rooms.I most recently stayed here in March for my birthday/St. Patrick's day. We booked a one-bedroom corner suite at a screaming deal for spring in Seattle (369 a night, yes a suite for under 400 in Spring in Seattle). I LOVE THESE HOTEL ROOMS. Ample space, wonderful decor, comfy chenille blankie, two (TWO!) flat-panel televisions.I have done similar suites at the Westin and the Fairmont, which for the price I paid there and the price of the Andra the Andra wins hands-down. Even with the bathrooms, which again, I think are totally awesome. Love the original tile on the bathroom floor, love the ample lighting in the bathroom (esp the nightlight!).And let's talk about the Front Desk. Anyone who compliments my outfit immediately wins brownie points.

<Content>Disappointed: Andra only so-so Every December, a group of friends and I all stay together at a hotel in downtown Seattle. This year, we broke away from the larger chains and booked a great deal at Hotel Andra. I have to say, it didn't live up to the fabulous reviews. The lobby, front desk staff, and Lola restaurant were top-notch, but the rooms were more like a three star hotel. The bathrooms had grungy tile and worn towels with spots on them (even if they were Frette). The main plush chair in the room was shallow, stiff-backed, and very uncomfortable. The decorative pillows on the bed looked like they had been fished from someone's basement. I liked the bedding, but the beds were so soft that I had a backache in the morning. Conclusion: we usually stay at the Sheraton, where we lament the crowded lobby and slow service. However, I prefer their spotless (if impersonal) rooms to Andra's uncomfortably aged rooms.

<Content>Luxury and Beauty, Meet Convenience We recently stayed at the Hotel Andra during a weekend getaway to Seattle, and couldn't have asked for a nicer place to stay. Aside from the convenient location, blocks away from Pike Place Market and Downtown/Belltown shopping and restaurants, this hotel is beautiful. I felt comfortable and welcome immediately with the cozy lobby and friendly staff, and right at home in our room that overlooked Fourth Ave. The hotel is a seamless mix of original 1920's details and modern decor, and the bed was so insanely comfortable we actually opted to lounge about instead of touring around the neighborhood. This may have been the nicest lodging I've ever experienced, and I definitely hope to return on my next trip to the Emerald City.

<Content>Love the Andra. It's an updated trendy hotel in a perfect location! I have stayed at the Andra a few times and have always had a great experience! The rooms are updated, clean and spacious! The staff is friendly and always helpful! The restaurant is convenient along with many other choices for food in the vacinity. I prefer to stay at the Andra anytime I am in Seattle!

<Content>Not Quite There The title of my review basically sums up our recent stay at the Andra. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay, as we got a deep discount, but I'm left wondering how or why they are listed with Small Luxury Hotels of the World.We had a Lux King corner suite, and the suite itself is quite spacious, and very quiet, we did have a restful sleep. Beds/linens were soft and comfortable, and they brought up extra pillows as requested. There was plenty of storage in our suite -- 2 closets and a set of drawers, plus the generously-sized night tables were a plus.However, the sofa was disappointing -- of cheap construction, and sagging in the middle; fairly uncomfortable to sit on to watch tv. The armchair seriously needed recovering, as the edges were worn, dirty and frayed. The suite is due for an overhaul soon; we noticed chipped paint throughout, plus chipped and scratched furniture. The carpets felt a bit grimy -- there was an overall feeling that the room could have been cleaner.The bathroom is small (I knew this going in, having read past reviews). This did not bother me much, as there were adequate shelves and storage. However, if you like soaking in the tub, forget it. The tub has a very low overflow drain, obviously designed by someone who hates baths. I'm 5'2 and not very big -- the maximum water level came up to my lower abdomen. As I reclined trying to soak, the water kept draining off, and I gave up after about 5 minutes. Shower pressure is good and tons of hot water any time of the day. The Face Stockholm amenities are a delicious subtle white tea fragrance; however the bottles are the size of postage stamps, which seems cheap for a luxury hotel. The staff are happy to send up more, but it was tiring to request this on a daily basis.The staff were mostly 20-30 somethings and very pleasant and eager to please. However, I still feel they have not achieved a luxury level of service. We had a simple request that we be sent a Seattle Times, v. a New York times as we like to read local news. On a daily basis we received a New York times, which to give them credit, was swiftly replaced with a Seattle Times on request, but we shouldn't have had to keep asking for 4 days in a row. Another time we asked a desk person to reconfirm a reservation (the concierge had left) and he looked at us like we handed him a dead fish. It may seem that I'm nitpicking, but I would expect this from maybe a Motel 6 v. a luxury hotel. I would actually place the Andra slightly above a 3 star hotel, not at a luxury level. The staff for the most part, are accomodating and pleasant, and the room was ok. We would stay again if we got the same low rate; however, we would not stay if we had to pay the high season rate of approx $480.00 -- we felt the service and room would not be worth it.

<Content>okay....not amazing...and they lost my bags. Stayed here for a friend's wedding. I had high expectations going into this hotel, and I was not impressed at all after I checked in. The rooms were very small and cramped. The bathrooms seemed small too. I stayed at the Sheraton in Seattle the previous two nights and paid about the same price...and was far more impressed with the accommodations at the Sheraton....they had better accommodations, bigger rooms, bigger bathrooms, and everything seemed cleaner  more upscale.During checkout I checked my bags with the hotel so I could get lunch. When I came back for my bags, nobody was able to find them. I ended up having to ask a bellboy to take me down into the basement myself so I could see if my bags were there or not.....I ended up finding them locked in some random room in the basement. So staff seemed pretty worthless that I had to find my bags that they lost themselves.

<Content>Stayed at Hotel Andra for our wedding We stayed at Hotel Andra for our wedding and we absolutely loved it. Everyone there took really good care of us and our other guests that were staying at Hotel Andra. We stayed in the Andra Lux Suite and if there is one hotel I would want to live in it's the Hotel Andra. Othere guests stayed in the Andra Rooms and the Andra Suites and everyone really liked their rooms and enjoyed their stay. I would highly recommend Hotel Andra for anyone looking for a stylish place to stay in Seattle. With great service and an amazing restaurant (Lola) you can't go wrong.

<Content>My favorite hotel My work responsibilities have taken me to Seattle 4-6 times a year over the last five years and I now have stayed at Hotel Andra about two dozen times, 2-5 nights each stay. In that time period, I have had to travel extensively elsewhere (domestically and internationally) as well but this is my favorite hotel. Apart from a superb location at the seam of downtown Seattle and Bell Town with all its wonderful restaurants -- a location which cannot be beat in my view -- this non-convention style hotel is very contemporary in its furnishings, has comfortable beds and efficient workspaces (with easy internet access), and has two excellent restaurants on either side (one accessible through its lobby). The breakfasts at Lola are just outstanding; on the other side, Assaggio is a terrific Italian place for dinner (and across the street one can have an excellent lunch or dinner at Dahlia Lounge). Most of all, the staff is particularly friendly and responsive, happy to accommodate reasonable requests for favors. And, as if that were not enough, as a news junkie I really value the fact that one only has to ask and, presto, you have a free copy of the New York Times (including Sunday's!) at your door each morning!

<Content>Beyond Amazing at the Hotel Andra Seattle I have had the priveledge of staying at the Hotel Andra in Seattle twice this year. Both times... absolutely amazing!! Hotel is beautiful, clean, has great restaurant, bar and lobby lounging areas. The staff is beyond compare when it comes to customer service and friendliness. They always go out of their way to accommodate even the oddest requests. If you want a great location and a stay you can rave about afterwards...don't miss out on staying. I will be back anytime I travel to Seattle.

<Content>Another great stay...will be back! I have just returned home from another great stay at the Andra. Travelling as a single woman on business, I like that the Andra is in a great, safe location where you can easily walk to shopping, restaurants, and the business district. The staff were welcoming at check-in and acknowledged me when I returned at the end of my work day. The room was very comfortable and showed attention to detail. I would not hesitate to stay again.

<Content>Hotel Andra ~ it鈥檚 got it all! Hip Ambiance, High-quality Accommodations, Handy AreaWe spent a 鈥淕irls鈥?Weekend鈥?at the Andra and loved our stay there! The trendy ambiance immediately greets you as you enter the hotel 鈥?the inviting fireplace and then the comfy chairs where you can order from the adjacent bar. Our room was great 鈥?luxurious beds, a roomy sitting area, and those unique Swedish Voss water bottles! Best of all is the location 鈥?close to downtown and also right on the edge of Belltown with its great restaurants and jazz bars. The customer service was stellar 鈥?from the valet taking our car to the helpful front desk people to the welcome note that was waiting for us in the room. The 鈥淕irls鈥?give it a 2-thumbs up!!

<Content>Absolutely perfect, professional, and decadent Just a little note of big thanks for such a wonderful weddingweekend at Andra. Your hotel is beautiful, inviting, and comfortable. We adored the Lux Suite, which was the perfect retreat from the big events all weekend. Your staff was very attentive and friendly; we never were in-want of anything, and the food was delicious and the amenities impeccable. Our family and friends who stayed at Andra and who just visited all concurred with our review. Oh, and the champagne was delicious!Thank you, again. We look forward to more opportunities to stay at Andra, and plan to make it the place of our anniversary the years we are home in Seattle from here on out.....but of course must reserve 704!

<Content>Best Wedding Party! We used Hotel Andra for our wedding party and stayed there the night of the wedding. We had a fabulous experience from the moment we reserved the rooms until the morning we left as a married couple. The staff is friendly and took wonderful care of all of our out of town guests (including getting them to our wedding at a private residence that was hard to find). We had a fabulous bottle of champagne waiting for us in our lovely room and spent the night with all our friends celebrating in the bar. The front desk even ordered our entire party late night pizza! We are so glad we picked Andra

<Content>Hotel is fine, construction noise is not acceptable at 6:45 AM I stayed at this hotel in mid October for 5 nights. Initially I was put in a room on the Virginia Street side where there is a huge apartment building going up. The first night I was woken up at 6:45 AM due to extremely loud construction drilling, banging, trucks driving,  men at work. I asked to have my room changed immediately  the staff was accommodating. I was moved to the 4th Avenue side of the hotel  able to sleep undisturbed. The hotel location is great. The rooms were fine, but I would say that the lights were very dim. Brighter lighting would be helpful. I second some of the comments here about the mildew in bathrooms  small size of the bathrooms. However, the closets were quite large. The hotel gym was quite small  had only 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical machine  1 stairmaster. The business center was also small-with only 2 computers, but free internet access  printing. The lobby is nice with the fireplace  Scandinavian decor. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>good hotel but not perfect The hotel is well situated, but very noisy because of e big construction site at the corner and the streets around. On the hotel website they don't say anyhing about this construction. Rooms are quite nice, well furnished (we were 2 aduts ans 3 kids and had a one bedroom suite with a roll away bed and double sofa bed in the siting room) . The bathroom is very tiny even for 2 persons and looked quite old for a 4 stars hotel. For the 5 of us it was a good price. Restaurant lola downstairs is very good but expensive in the evening. The staff is nice and helpful.

<Content>OK if you like cramped The Hotel Andra was perfectly adequate. However, it was rated by Travel and Leisure as one of the top hotels under $200, and from the website I was expecting a posh experience and was underwhelmed.The hotel lobby was attractive, however only one elevator worked for the entire time we were at the hotel. We had a standard room, it was so tiny that I bashed into the sharp corners of the bedframe as I walked past. Also tiny closet and bathroom. Hotel was old and only modestly refurbished. Regarding the location, I would have preferred to stay closer to Pike's place - Inn at the Market might be good. We had to walk through a couple of sketchy neighborhoods to get to where most of the attractions were. However, the bright spot was it was surrounded by excellent restaurants - Lola (attached), Serious Pie (across street), and Dahlia (didn't try, but served their amazing Coconut Custard Pie at Lola).Staff was helpful.

<Content>Hotel Andra -- Solid choice in Seattle My husband and I stayed in a luxe suite for three nights in late August. I got a good deal on hotels.com for a package that included a $40 per night coupon at one of the Tom Douglas restaurants and parking. The other reviews generally capture the pluses and minuses of the hotel. Pluses -- rooms are nicely designed, and the location is excellent. I wouldn't describe the decor as ultra-hip, but modern and comfortable. The minuses -- the bathroom is small and not luxurious at all (basically a minimally remodeled older style bath from the 1930s or 40s); the internet access is not good (I had assumed it was free since it didn't say there was a charge on the internet, and there is a $10 charge, which I find annoying); and the service was on the poor side. This isn't a rant, but we checked in at 3 pm, our room was not ready, the front desk said we couldn't leave the bags in the room, and no effort to try to compensate us in some way -- not a really big deal, just tiresome and not the kind of thing that makes you feel like the service was great. No coffee in the lobby in the morning, which would be a nice touch.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, location Free Bus service Just spent a night at the Hotel Andra as a surprize night in Seattle for a romantic getaway with my wife. Before my review I want to mention that all the public busses are free in downtown Seattle all the time just hop on, no charge!! We are kinda fussy travelers. We would not hesitate to recomend this hotel. Rooms are beautiful, roomy sort of a mini suite. Everything seems brand new. Robes are to die for. The bathroom maybe small but....they are clean and nothing to even mention as a negative,and there is sort of a dressing area outside the bathroom by the walk in closet. The immediate area has several nice resturants, also a pizza place (Serious Pie) and a bakery accross the street. The Mayflower Park hotel, ( one block away) has a very good bar (Olivers) with great free snacks at happy hour. There is also much shopping a few blocks away. You will not be dissapointed.

<Content>Nice Boutique HOtel I stayed at the Hotel Andra with my husband and two teen boys just prior to sailing for Alaska. I reviewed TripAdvisor thoroughly and settled on this hotel for it's location and size. We were looking for a well situated location to the Pier and things to do within walking distance.We arrived in Seattle at noon and went directly to the hotel to store our bags. Much to our delight we were able to check in and get settle prior to heading out to the visit the city. We found a comfortably sized room, excellent beds and pillows and plenty of room for us to put our stuff. All the staff was very helpful when it came to recommending restaurants, locating a cab and providing us with directions.We stayed in a room facing the construction zone but with it being the weekend we had no issues with it. The hotel overall is very quiet. The bathrooms are small but we had no problem with that, however the tile on the floor could have been cleaner.Overall I would recommend this hotel to stay, the only issue we had is that we only stayed one night.

<Content>Exceeded expectations I searched Seattle hotels online and checked reviews on tripadvisor.com before selecting Hotel Andra. It was terrific. We were there for 1 night, July 5, 2008 before boarding a cruise to Alaska. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived several hours before the posted check-in time, so they asked if we would like to a free upgrade to a suite! It was lovely and the people at the desk and the concierge were very helpful directing us wherever we wanted to go. The hotel is well located--an easy walk to the Space Needle and to Pike's Market. I would recommend this hotel highly.

<Content>Excellent Seattle Hotel- Great staff, perfect location, lovely rooms We just got back from Seattle and a trip to the San Juan Islands. Spent 3 nights at the Hotel Andra. It's a great place to stay. Our room was on the 7th floor, in the back. It was a lovely room. The staff was excellent, helpful and professional. The hotel is easy walking to both Seattle Center and Pikes Place Market. Highly recommended.

<Content>Disappointing reservation mistake I know I'm going to the lone descenting voice here, but I was really irritated by my experience at the Andra. I have never checked out of a hotel early in my many years of travel.I booked a room at the Hotel Andra almost 6 months before we went to Seattle. I booked directly through their website for a room described as 2 Queens or 1 King. I made a note in the reservation that I wanted the 1 King, as I was going with my boyfriend. When I got my confirmation via email, it said 2 Queens but the note was on there about the 1 King, so I didn't worry about it. When we arrived, I verified with the front desk agent that we were indeed getting 1 King, not 2 Queens. He said only the 2 Queens room was available. Obviously, we did not want to spend our vacation time sleeping in separate beds. The only thing available with 1 bed was a Queen. In other words, we were downgraded. There was no offer made to lower our rate, though. I blew it off at first because we had received a great rate anyway. After we spent one night in the room, we were both miserable and grumpy with each other. The queen bed was just way too tiny after being used to a King at home, and the room itself was also incredibly small. The bathroom was hardly big enough to turn around in. And our view? Construction and another apartment building. I complained to a manager, who said they were completely booked so there was nothing he could do. We went back to our room, looked online, and were able to book a much nicer room beginning the next day (we were in town for 5 nights). I told the manager I was going to check out the next day. He told me I'd have to pay a $75 cancellation fee! When I balked, he said he'd have to talk to the reservation manager to get that waived, and he'd call me in the morning. We checked out and I told the woman at the front desk that I did not want to be charged the fee. She said ok, and didn't charge me. So, this was the only positive part of the experience. The reservation manager never called me. Aside from all this, I still wouldn't have liked this place- the neighborhood is really sketchy, even though there's a bunch of nice restaurants. We got asked for money every time we walked out of the hotel. As a side note, the Silver Cloud Inn at Lake Union was amazing, for the same price (large suite, free breakfast, free wifi).

<Content>Comfortable, Relaxed and Urban My husband just treated me to a weekend getaway at the Andra. He booked the Romantik Package which included a Lux corner suite, champagne, Theo Chocolates (one of Seattle's best hand-dipped chocolatiers). Dined at Lola (one of my favorite Tom Douglas restaurants located on the first floor of the hotel). As always, Lola was outstanding, relaxed.We had a great in-city get away. The staff were most accommodating and friendly, but not snotty. Location very good for exploring Seattle on-foot.The suites are well designed and furnished, somewhat spacious, the bathrooms are well-appointed but smallish. Based on the size of the suite, I would find the basic room to be too small for my taste. I could see a speck of Lake Union from our room. I did appreciate that windows were operable (I like fresh air when sleeping).The Hotel Andra, is a small, comfortable boutique hotel in a restored building. Clearly the constraints of restoring an older building limited room size, but the suites are well-appointed and very comfortable. We would not hesitate to return.

<Content>Hotel Andra lives up to its name! Since this is the only place in the world that I've found that shares my strange name, I'm obviously going to be prejudiced. This hotel is hip, clean, efficient, moderately priced and very conveniently located in Seattle. It has a small neighborhood feel in the heart of downtown. The staff is courteous and helpful, and the facilities are awesome. The rooms are well laid out with comfy beds, and the bathroom night light is a thoughtful touch (especially in the middle of the night!) Several very good restaurants are right across the street, and the very touristy things are only a few blocks away. Lots of shopping is also steps away from the front door. I love this hotel.

<Content>Very pleasant and comfortable I had a very pleasant 3-night stay at the Andra over Memorial Day weekend. The hotel staff was very pleasant and attentive. We had one of the larger rooms with a wet bar and walk-in closet. The beds were super-comfortable and the room was quiet! I think it was a combination of good sound-proofing and conscientious staff, because there wasn't the usual housekeeper noises at 8 a.m.

<Content>Loved the Andra! We visited the Andra and stayed three nights. It was a wonderful hotel and they made us feel very special from the moment we checked in. We are an older couple and enjoy the quiet atmosphere. The lobby restaurant was animated, but was never a problem - smelled delicious! There was always someone to greet us at the door and the desk. Our room was very small, but we did not request a large room. The bathroom perfect, with super comfortable bathtub. The bed and bedding was wonderful. We found the website and will check out the pillows! The Andra was very clean. There are not a lot of reasonably priced restaurants within sight of the Andra, but about two blocks away is a large shopping mall. The Andra didn't mention this to us when we asked about dining, and we found it on our own. It was fine for our early dinner, but would avoid after dark. We would definitely return and we thank everyone for making our visit a happy one!

<Content>Nice but not luxury My husband  I stayed at the Andra for a week this spring. The first thing I noticed upon arrival was the construction of new condos across the street. I really didn't want to wake up to loud banging every morning on vacation. The receptionist said there hadn't been any complaints about noise. Okay it was the weekend (plus Mem.Day) so it wasn't too noisy but Tues. was a different story. We were offered another room but by then I didn't want to move all our stuff. I should have asked for another room from the beginning. If you're staying here anytime soon be sure you're on the inside of the hotel.Someone should have checked the sheets they were putting on the bed because there were a couple of holes in the bottom sheet. We also had a coffee pot that was broken,they replaced it but left the broken one in the room. Maybe I'm being picky but I expect more from a luxury  hotel.We stayed in the lux suite which was large  decorated nicely. The bed was comfortable  the smaller bathroom wasn't a problem. The people were friendly enough but I just didn't consider this a luxury hotel.

<Content>Comfy and classy It was tough choosing a boutique hotel in Seattle but the Andra was a good choice. Great decor, everything from the light fixtures to the retro clock radio on the night stand. Room was quite large and comfy, the beds were fantastic. Only complaint would be that the bathroom was a bit old and dingy. It appears to be an older hotel that was renovated - the rooms are great but the bathrooms have old tiles and flooring that looked like they could use replacing or a good scrubbing! Bathroom is also tiny but not terribly so, still quite usable. Service was great and location is also a bonus, would stay there again.

<Content>ver nice botique hotel Very nice hotel in Belltown next to downtown. Very nice rooms with comfortable beds and Frette sheets. Staff is very nice and helpful after all it's a relatively small hotel. Don't stay here though if you like big bathrooms - the hotel is a renovated older building and the bathrooms are tiny by modern standards. Still everything else is quite luxurious - the hotel is very clean, very quiet and the people are exceptionally nice.

<Content>Satisfied and will be back. We stayed there for one night last year. We booked at short notice via their website. I mistakenly booked a queen suite when I wanted a king. I called their reservation desk after I booked online and there was no problem exchanging it. For such a short trip myself and Mrs Majik decided to splash out and get their Romantik package. Check-in was swift. On arrival in the suite we were delivered a good bottle of Mumm sparking wine and a box of Theo's chocolates. Unfortunately though it seems to be a habit in North American hotels to advertise champagne and deliver sparking wine, if you're fussy I'd call ahead to check. Mrs. Majik loved the chocolates so much she has spent months trying to find them in Vancouver. The package also included a 2pm checkout which is very useful when you are only staying the night.The room was a decent size and the king-size bed was bed huge. I've found hotel bathrooms in heritage style buildings tend to be a bit on the small side and this was the case in the Andra. They were well stocked with nice 'Stockholm' toiletries though. The suite also has a wet bar, desk and couch.The Andra is situated in Belltown and I don't think the website does the locale justice. The hotel fronts onto a tree-lined street with restaurants, bars and boutiques. It is within walking distance of all the major sites and attractions in downtown Seattle. That night we took the concierge's recommendation and dined at the Flying Fish, we were not disappointed. On our second afternoon we dined at the hotel restaurant Lola, for lunch. The food was good but be prepared to order a few dishes as it is a Meze (small bites) style menu. Overall we enjoyed our stay and will be back again next time we are in Seattle.

<Content>Decent, but not luxury Hello, my wife and I stayed at the Hotel Andra for three nights in March. We found the hotel to be clean, quiet, and comfortable. The Lola restaurant was decent, with good service.I wouldn't go so far as to call this a luxury hotel, it seemed somewhat basic, though comfortable. We didn't require much from the hotel staff, so we didn't have much interaction with them; they didn't really go out of their way to see how we were doing. The valet parking was a bit expensive ($35/night) and one night the valet left our car lights on, requiring a jump start the next morning. Otherwise, not a bad experience.

<Content>Great location! Hotel Andra was the perfect hotel for our 4 day getaway in Seattle! We were upgraded to a junior suite, which had a king size bed and sofa/sitting area. The only downside about the room is the small bathroom, but that's the only thing I can somewhat complain about. The bedding and pillows were extremely comfortable for a hotel, and the location is perfect. We took the bus (only $1.50) downtown and only walked 5 minutes to the hotel. It was 5-10 minutes walking distance to everything we wanted...shopping, Pike Place Market, and good eats! I definitely recommend staying here for anyone who wants a moderately priced hotel in an ideal location!

<Content>What a delightful surprise! We stayed for one night this month since we were in the city for a concert and this hotel is in a perfect location. The ambiance of the lobby, low-key and professional desk staff, and the charming valet made us feel quite welcome. We were upgraded to a junior suite, which gave us a sofa and chair and it was good that it wasn't football season because my husband eyed that flat panel television with longing. Rooms are quiet, bed comfortable, and bathrooms well-laid out. Dinner at Lola (adjoining the hotel) is a fantastic experience, and so (unexpectedly) was breakfast. We'll definitely be back.

<Content>The most comfortable bed I've ever slept in!! I agree with all the nice things that have already been said about Hotel Andra - its perfect location, its gorgeous lobby, its attention to details...Everything is close to perfection. Even the elevators are nice! You really feel in a comfortable place when you walk in, especially in winter. We had a free upgrade from our room to a junior suite - which was a very nice gesture and even though the suites are not huge, it's more than enough for two people. The furniture is modern with clean lines, the bathroom is more retro but has still all the amenities. They provide you with a lot of thick towels and bathrobes, a definite plus on my list!! And the lightning is amazing. But what I will definitely remember is the bedding. The sheets are soooooooooo comfortable, it was hard to leave the bed!!! I would definitely recommend Hotel Andra to anybody who would visit Seattle. I can't wait to go back!

<Content>Great Hotel Loved the hotel--had great service from everyone. Short walk to the Pike Street Market. You might take their concierge advice with a grain of salt, it seems that they direct you to only a family of establishments.

<Content>Our Favorite in Seattle This is our second stay at Hotel Andra - we love everything about this boutique hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful. Andra is pet-friendly and welcomed our small dog with a gift bag of dog bones! We love spending the morning in the lobby by the fireplace with treats and coffee from the Dahlia Bakery (across the street). With all of the Tom Douglas restaurants nearby, you don't have to venture far for excellent food. We enjoyed meals at Lola, Serious Pie, Etta's and the Dahlia Bakery - all great food. Location is great for downtown, Belltown and the Pike Place Market. We enjoyed and appreciated a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite - the room was perfect! Seattle is my hometown, so I know it well - and think that Hotel Andra provides a wonderful base camp!

<Content>Great boutique hotel I stayed at the Hotel Andra during a business trip in October 2007. Walking distance to the convention center and prime shopping in Seattle. This hotel is not directly serviced by the Downtown Airporter (shuttle between airport and downtown hotels) but the hotel immediately next door (the Warwick) is a stop so you can get off there and then walk the 1/2 block to the Andra. It's a lovely boutique hotel--appears recently remodeled. Very modern lobby with cozy fireplace. The front desk staff were very helpful and friendly. My room was spacious with 2 queen beds, sitting area, bar area. Decor is very modern---kind of Ikea-esque. View of neighboring construction site, unfortunately, but interestingly enough I never really heard the annoying sounds of construction. Pretty small bathroom compared to other hotels but nice nevertheless. Frette towels and Face Stockholm bath products---luxurious! They had a very small business center with 2 computers and printers--free of charge. I didn't use the gym so I can't comment. Had to pay a daily rate for in-room wireless. Lots of great eating options within walking distance. The restaurant in the lobby, Lola, is AMAZING! A Tom Douglas establishment that has a mediterranean theme and definitely lived up to the hype. There's also another Tom Douglas restaurant across the street, Dahlia Lounge, that had the most amazing donuts on the menu for dessert, served warm with marscarpone cheese and green apple butter. Again, amazing! Adjacent to that is the Dahlia bakery, which is great for that cup of morning coffee and a pastry. Overall, I would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle.

<Content>Pretty good - funky nice property Booked a weekend through Luxury Link, which included gift cards for food at the restaurant downstairs, champagne, and chocolate strawberries.The rooms were nice. Quite spacious with beautiful linens. Frette towels and Face Stockholm toiletries. I only gave it 4* because I thought the service was OK, but not spectacular. There was nothing wrong, but they were not particularly friendly or helpful for a hotel that costs over $200 a night.The restaurant downstairs is good - very busy with locals. The Tom Douglas pizza restaurant is fabulous. It's only a block or 2 away. Im not sure it was open when I stayed at the Andra, but I subsequently visited the restaurant and it was great!It was easy to walk to the central shopping area (less than 5 blocks) or down to Pike Place Market. We also walked to the Seahawks game. There is a block or 2 where I felt a bit uneasy (it's dark and there are homeless people in the doorways), but there were two of us so it was fine. I probably wouldn't walk as a female on my own. All in all, a nice weekend and a lovely intimate hotel.

<Content>Great place to stay I stayed in the Hotel Andra for 4 nights while attending a conference at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center; it was a quick 6 block walk from the hotel. The hotel was wonderful. I arrived early, and was able to check in right away. The room and bath were exceedingly neat and clean. As others have stated, the bed was so comfortable, and because I was so close to the conference, I could sleep in a bit longer in the morning and enjoy it!I had room service two times; both times the food was terrific, and arrived hot and in a reasonable amount of time. It was a bit overpriced, but there is a huge selection of restaurants in the area you can take advantage of. The only complaint was the charge for internet in the guest rooms - many cheaper hotels offer it for free.I would definitely stay at the hotel again, and would recommend it for any travelers, whether for business or leisure.

<Content>great hotel and super location My husband and I loved this hotel. We stayed 2 nights this past weekend. The room was very comfortable. We liked it that the windows open to the street noise below if you want to hear the sounds of the city. We like that. The location can't be beat. The bed was the highlight of beds in hotel rooms. I want to buy the sheets and 2 pillows from the website. They know they have something going on at this hotel. My compliments to the owner/Pres of the company. A stay at this hotel will make for a great Seattle experience. We loved drinking down in the lobby on Friday afternoon. It is quite a scene. Plus, you have options galore with the Tom Douglas restaurants all around you... plus the Dahlia Bakery for breakfast 10 steps in front of the hotel. I can't say enough great things about this hotel.

<Content>Chic factor is high; great value, to boot! The hotel's car service failed to show up at the airport, as I had scheduled, so I was a little miffed when I arrived. All was well, though, once I took one look at this chic, sleek lobby and was warmly welcomed by the staff. My room was stylish and offered ample space for my friend and me, who were in town for a girls' weekend. The walk-in closet AND separate dressing area w/ mirror made it easy to share this room. The restaurant attached to the hotel is one of Seattle's best. In a three-day weekend, we ate at Lola three times. It was an easy walk to the Pike Place market, the ferry landing, the Rem Koolhaas library, great restaurants and the monorail. It's rare to find such a well-located, hip hotel that is priced right. Andra is a real gem.

<Content>Updated Review I originally had a couple problems with customer service in my stay. I was contacted directly by the Hotel manager and my view of the customer service was changed.During my stay, the Hotel was extremely busy. I only booked for one night and was not in the room much. I believe that the problems I encountered would have been corrected immediatly had I noticed it sooner. I would stay at the hotel again but would only stay in one of the larger rooms.

<Content>Nice hotel, nice location Stayed at the Hotel Andra for one night as a quick stop in Seattle at the start of our family vacation. It's a nice clean hotel with exceptional service. The rooms and bed are comfortable, with the exception of the airconditioning (a bit noisy). The bathroom is small, but clean. Will stay again, but if travelling with the kids again for a longer stay, will definately get two rooms.

<Content>A Great Stay Attentive, friendly staff upgraded us to a suite upon arrival. Hotel is very stylish, very comfortable, and priced reasonably considering it's quality and location in Seattle. Easy walk to the Space Needle  Seattle Center, or down to the Sound and ferry terminals. I could not have asked for a more pleasant hotel in Seattle- I would definately recommend to others and look forward to returning.

<Content>A wonderful hotel in Seattle The hotel has been wonderfully renovated. The bed was quite comfortable. The bathroom is small but with nice amenities. The hotel's restaurant, Lola, was very good, serving a Mediterranean cuisine. The staff was friendly and helpful. The valet parking fee was bit high, at $29. We stayed in the suite and the a/c did not cool the room very well. We tried opening the windows, but were then swarmed by gnats. I liked the location of the hotel; in the heart of the city withing walking distance of everything.

<Content>Good experience at Hotel Andra Two girlfriends and myself booked the Hotel Andra through Expedia. We got a great deal with flights. We were quite pleased with our room. It faced the front of the hotel and we never had any problem with noise. Nice amenities, as others have stated - Frette towels, FACE toiletries, Starbucks coffee. Large closet - great for 3 women with large suitcases and many purchases. Loved the location - a block to Macy's and a little further is Nordstrom etc. The staff were always very friendly. I used the business centre to access e-mail for free. I had my laptop but refused to pay the crazy prices to access internet in the room. We never ate at the hotel, but we did have a few drinks at their bar. Fun atmosphere. I'd definitely stay here again and recommend it.

<Content>Great hotel, avoid the T-mobile hotspot Hotel itself was great, I stayed there back in May. Friendly staff, great location, and the rooms were really nice and large. My only downside was the t-mobile hotspot, I was drastically overcharged, and they acted like they were doing me a favor by rebating 1/2 of what I was overcharged (so I still had to pay double). My advice, use the wired internet in the hotel, as that is run by the hotel, not t-mobile

<Content>We loved it We spent 8 nights at the Andra as we were in Seattle for a conference and a break. We asked for a suite on the quiet side of the hotel which we got along with the requested non-allergenic bedding.The service was generally very good although occasionally the front desk could get busy.The suite was well appointed but there would be little privacy if you had a member of your party using the sofa bed. There is a small office center where you can use 2 PCs with internet connection and printers. No charge for this.You can walk easily to all the downtown attractions as well as Pike Market.

<Content>Great hotel, will stay again. I just came back from a stay at the Andra. Wonderful boutique hotel. I was getting a little worried from some of the negative reviews but found my stay very nice. Staff was nice, frette towels, starbucks coffee, new york times paper daily, FACE bath amenities. Nice modern decor. The only thing that needed work was the bathroom floor - it needs a good bleaching and scrubbing. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Fine This hotel was pretty good - the best thing is the size of the rooms: they really are very spacious, with a separate, large closet area, and also a kitchenette area. You're right in the heart of downtown and can walk pretty much everywhere in the centre/Capitol Hill. Reception staff were a little bit snippish, but nothing too bad. The hotel restaurant - I can't remember the name now, but right off the lobby - served good breakfast and the staff there were v friendly and helpful. All in all the experience was good!

<Content>A Big Disappointment... Stayed here for four days in April. Very disappointed. First, there is a MAJOR construction project going on across the street. They blow the whistle (literally) at 7:30 and the noise does not subside until the end of the day. I am amazed that the hotel did not disclose this. Second, this hotel has no soul. It is constructed of cheap materials...kind of a hotel IKEA, if you know what I mean. Everytime we left the hotel our keys would de-magnetize and after a while we learned to just stop at the desk on the way back to the room to have them re-programmed...a bit of a hassle as we would have to wait our turn. They did not re-fill the mini-bar every day. And last, when Saturday finally came and they could not do construction across the street and we could sleep in, the maid service came knocking on our door at EIGHT AM (!) despite that there was a newspaper outside our door (we obvioulsy had not opened our door yet). I would never stay here again. There are so many great hotels in Seattle and this is just not one of them!

<Content>An Emerald City Jewel My wife and I just spent the weekend of Jan. 12-13 at the Hotel Andra. The hotel staff including the doorman were always helpful and cheerful. We were upgraded to a jr. suite without asking. The suite was well appointed with a large work desk, flat screen tv, in room coffee maker, morning newspaper and a hide-bed/sofa combo if needed. The seperate bedroom included another flatscreen tv, a wonderful king sized bed, robes and extra pillows/ blankets in the closet. Yes, the bathrooms are a little small but come well equipped with all the bottled goodies, hairdryer and even bottled Oxygen if needed for hangover relief. The Hotel Andra is located in the Belltown area of downtown Seattle just a few blocks from the Pike Place Market, shopping at Nordstroms and the Pacific Place Mall. Many nice restuarants close by including our favorite spot for italian, Assaggio Ristorante which is located right next door to the Andra. The hotel has a very nice place to have drinks inside their restuarant with a greek flare, Lola's. We will return to the Hotel Andra next time when staying in the Emerald City.

<Content>Not worth the ratrings We had issues with the cleanliness of the room and helpfulness of the front desk. We had a package that included breakfast. We had to ask several times for our voucher for our second day, the first day voucher was delivered to our room shortly after we checked in. The bathrooms are really small. I mean really small. Beds are very comfortable however and the adjacent restaurant Lolas is very good.

<Content>A night at the Andra A night at the Hotel Andra exceeded expectations for these Seattle parents.....so close yet so far from home. Hotel Andra is close to everything that is downtown Seattle, Belltown, Pike Place, the center of all and all accessible on foot, yet secluded and private within the immaculate suite. The staff made us feel welcome and offered assistance, though maintained appropriate distance so as not to overwhelm. This well traveled couple was impressed and hope to indluge annually at the hotel. We will certainly recommend to all!

<Content>Great place to stay Lovely older hotel in Belltown, recently remodeled in Scandinavian hues of beige, cream, slate blue  browns. Just steps to major shopping venues, and lots of excellent restaurants. Plus, interesting shops in Belltown. Very comfortable room with double-glazed windows afford a nice respite from the city. Design is modern, and warm. Room was large and comfortable (2 Queen beds on 7th floor). Lola, a Tom Douglas haunt has a great afternoon bar scene. Didn't dine there, but breakfast was excellent.Smaller, though adequate bathroom more than compensated for by large closet to stow bags and hang clothes. This is a room you can move into and enjoy rather than live out of your bag.

<Content>Funky The Hotel Andra is a fab hotel in Seattle. It's decor is very funky and we had a suite so the room was large with it's own bar area. A big comfortable bed with a large walk in closet.Your own sofa with a partial view to Lake Union. The hotel is very central to shopping,nightlife,Pike Place and the Space Needle. I'd definitely stay here again when in Seattle and hopefully try the restaurant next time. The staff really set this hotel apart as they were so friendly, from the check in staff, valet parking and the concierge.A big thumbs up! We'd read about this hotel in the United Airlines magazine on the flight up to Seattle so were very pleased when we experienced it in person.

<Content>Very comfortable and great personal service This hotel is a lovely oasis of peace and calm. The service is competent but not overbearing. We were upgraded to a suite - I don't know why - but we loved having an extra sitting room. The decor is uncluttered yet warm and inviting and the bathroom actually had a place to put stuff! On Sunday morning the lobby was very inviting with the fireplace burning and a lovely ambience in spite of the modern/industrial decor.

<Content>Great Place To Stay! My boyfriend and I traveled to Seattle for the first time and was very pleased with Hotel Andra. It is a very trendy yet comfortable hotel that truly makes you feel special and taken care of. The location is great and staff is very friendly and helpful. Adam at the door was great and always knew our name! This is not a large hotel so do not expect that. We got a suite on the the Connor which was great. The rooms are on the smaller side as well as the bathrooms!!! It is worth splurging a little for a larger room. You are in walking distance of Pikes and the Space Needle. You just can't go wrong with this place!I look forward to visiting again soon.

<Content>Great hotel, great location, terrific service!! Just blocks from Pike's market, the Space Needle, downtown shopping and surrounded by great restuarants, its hard to ask for anything more. The room was large with a bar and desk -- bed was heavenly -- decor was very fun, modern and relaxing -- restuarant Lola downstairs was tasty and trendy -- staff was always welcoming and knowledgeable. Would definately stay again!

<Content>Great location Surrounded by great places to eat. Good restaurant on the premises. There's a grocery store across the street with a wonderful choice of good food that has a cafe in it that's open until 2. A great bakery also directly across the street. Two blocks from Jazz Alley. Five blocks to Pike Place Market and the Downtown area. Easy access to the free Metro bus system. The Airporter stops on the same block. The staff is friendly, the concierge extremely helpful and the rooms very clean. and complete with all of the amenities. Huge walk-in closet. The only thing is that the bathroom is very small and the room could use more light. A great blend of an old and new. Definitely plan to return.

<Content>Fabulous Stay! We just returned from our anniversary trip to Seattle and a two night stay at the Hotel Andra. We hadn't been to Seattle in many years and looked into the best places to stay that were within walking distance of Pike Place and the waterfront, as well as good restaurants. Hotel Andra is located in the newly revitalized area of Belltown on 4th Ave- a walk straight down Virginia on the corner takes you to Pike Place and the waterfront. Tom Douglas' restaurant Dahlia Lounge is directly across the street and the wonderful italian restaurant Assiago is right next door. We loved our room on the 5th floor, the decor in the hotel is modern and fresh. The beds were fabulous- the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept on in awhile! The bath products are great- they're from Face Stockholm, and the spa robes were wonderful. The staff could not have been more helpful- they were extremely pleasant and accomodating with requests. I would recommend asking to stay on a higher floor if possible- the views are better. My husband enjoyed the workout room- each treadmill had it's own flatscreen but it was on the smaller side. Since the hotel is in an older building the rooms are not huge either but I would definitely stay at Hotel Andra again- we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!

<Content>Excellent Stay, Great Hotel, Great Staff We stayed at the Hotel Andra for 4 nights and the only negative point was the noisy A/C unit. The rest was terrific, great room, great staff - especialy the valet/doormen. Don't forget to eat at Lola. Not only the food is exceptional, but service is flawless.

<Content>Great Hotel - Fabulous location I loved this hotel. They staff is wonderful and go above and beyond. Once I checked in, they welcomed me each time I came in and remembered my name.The concierge followed up to make sure I enjoyed the restaurant he recommended (Purple Cafe - LOVED IT!!!!)There are so many restaurants with in minutes. The market is just down the hill.The only slight draw back was the room was a little small, but definitely livable.If you are as tired of Marriott's as I am, try this refreshing hotel!

<Content>Overpriced, not impressed Disappointed. Paid a huge amount for a Jr suite or shall I say tiny suite no bigger then your average holiday inn, in fact they may be larger in sq ft. Don't let the pictures fool you, its nothing big or special. The bathrooms are so small you could wash your hands as you sat on the toilet. For the three hundred and fifty two dollars per night I expected to have a good experience. That didn't happen. Your dollar will be better spent at the courtyard for half the price. I will not return.

<Content>A pleasant surprise The hotel looked disappointingly ordinary from the outside, but once you get into the small lobby area, the atmosphere is stylish and cheerful. The room was extremely spacious, with a good desk area if you needed to do some work, and a great marble surface for making hot drinks. The bed was very comfortable, and the plasma TV screen and furnishings were modern and stylish. The staff were courteous and helpful at all times. My only criticism was the room service from the Lola restaurant. Not only did they deliver the wrong order, but it was over-salted and over-priced. They did however give me a full refund without quibbling when I complained. The hotel is in a very central location, and I would definitel recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in downtown Seattle.

<Content>Great location, good stay Hotel Andra is good but not excellent. We had a Lux Suite which is pretty expensive. The main room was spacious and we liked the extra closet space, but still got an incredibly small bathroom. And why no shower gel with the usual toiletries provided? The service is above average - the valets and bell staff were particularly helpful and friendly, the front desk staff extremely pleasant. The hotel was very busy so we weren't made to feel particularly special, but the concierge team had some good advice and was helpful in booking a hire car, spa treatments etc. The location for the shops and the Space Needle is excellent; lots of restaurants are nearby. or it's a short cab ride to most places downtown. I would recommend this as somewhere a bit more modern and interesting than the usual run-of-the-mill chains.

<Content>Good location We stayed at the Andra for three nights in july. The location is within easy walking distance of most attractions including the space needle. The room was a decent size and the bed was comfortable but unfortunately there was no fridge. The temp was in the three figures and to only have ice to cool drinks down with was quite ridiculous. There is a market called Ralphs accross the road and it is open until late 2am I think. Has a good range of drinks and fresh food.We dined at the Lola restaurant below our hotel it is a greek rest and the service and food were excellent. highly recommended

<Content>Best place I've stayed at in Seattle I've stayed at the Andra in the past, and will always choose this hotel in Seattle. They have large suites that are only slightly more expensive than a standard room - it's well worth it. The suite is quite large, the decor is very smart. Very comfortable beds, nice furniture.I think my only complaint might be that there's not a lot of lighting in the bedroom part of the room. But lots of windows that open fully, so you can easily lighten up the room and get some fresh air if you want.Very convenient, Macy's across the street, very close to the shopping district and a few blocks away from Pike's market.

<Content>Superb! We stayed at Hotel Andra in early July for two nights. I had spent hours scouring the pages of TripAdvisor for somewhere to stay whilst in Seattle. From the moment we arrived everything was perfect. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. They pointed out all the best places to watch the 4th July fireworks from, and provided us with a map of how to get around. Our room was small but more than adequate. The furnishings were luxurious, and everything immaculate. We both slept well, and never even heard another sole all night. Unfortunately we didnt get the chance to sample the delights of the restaurant, but from the outside it looked like the perfect place for a romantic meal. What we did find very useful was the business centre which was free of charge and open 24hrs. All in all we couldn't fault the place. The location is perfect. We walked easily to the Space Needle  Lake Union. Pike Place Market was no more than a 10 minute walk, and the shops were just a stopnes throw away. This hotel is a must!

<Content>Great location Just far enough away from crowds at waterfront but close enough to walk to great restaurants and local attractions. At the time of booking only rooms with 2 queen beds were available. Upon arrival, I asked again for king room. We were upgraded to accommodate the bed type. Rooms are very spacious but small bathrooms which was okay since there was another area for getting dressed and drying my hair. We stayed 2 nights and booked another night on our return trip. Again, we received an upgrade. Staff was very helpful and both onsite restaurants were good.

<Content>Definately Not a luxury small hotel of the world!! As frequent business traveller to Seattle, I thought I would try this hotel as a potential new place to stay.... and I am now regretting doing so. Once checked in and in my room, I tried to use the two telephones to make an urgent phone call only to find they were still 'barred' so I couldn't call out. Then 30 minutes later the problem still wasn't fixed. Not offering any solutions I asked to move rooms which was such a hassle for them, even though the facilities in my room weren't working. The following day I put laundry in to be done (at a ridiculous cost) and found only half my things were delivered back to me and no one seemed to know where my missing items were. On the same day a colleague also staying there had his laundry declared lost after it had been missing for two days. By this stage I was quite stressed so booked an in-room massage for the evening asking for pricing in writing. The massge was good, but at the end of it I was told the front desk had quoted the wrong price and I was charged an additional $25.Additionally no bathroom amenties aside from towels, were ever replaced in my room over a 4 day period.The staff are nice, but the hotel is run like a backpackers inn!!

<Content>Great Stay I stayed here for 4 nights and I was very pleased. It's kind of an edgy hotel, similar to the W but not nearly as pompous. It was a little expensive, but considering that every hotel was sold out, it was understandable that I had to pay $200 a night. The rooms were very nicely done and very clean. The bed was comfortable (I need a good bed), the room was pretty big, though It was a little dark. The service was excellent, though sometimes the valet got a little backed up. It cost something like $26 to park. The location was ok. It was kind of in no man's land, a few minutes away from the city's heart and a few minutes away from the market (the location was fine, but there wasn't a lot happening right outside of the hotel).

<Content>Absolutely Fabulous Will Definately go again ***** My Wife and I just spent our 11th aniverisary at the Andra for the Weekend. I can't find a single negative thing to say about this fine hotel. Which for me is very unusual, I can usually always find something to ding an establishment on. But not the Andra. Our room was spectacular (when we told them it was our aniversary they gave us a free double upgrade). They made dinner reservations for us at a very nice restaurant. they sent us a complimentary bottle of Champagne and were at all times helpful and pleasant. Though I didn't bring my laptop with me, they do have internet in the rooms. Everything was clean and very well maintained. The decor was exceptionally well done. Their location is premium, they are just a few blocks from most everything you might want to do in downtown Seattle, Pike Street Market, Monorail to Space Needle, the shopping district, short cab ride to the ball fields. We rode the train up and I just couldn't have picked a nicer place for us to spend our aniversary.

<Content>Comfortable Stay at Hotel Andra Just returned home from a business trip that ended with three nights at Hotel Andra. I'd booked the Andra Suite and it was just the right size. I loved the walk in closet; it was nice to have all my bags flipped open in there rather than out in the room. Also, the couch was super comfy for watching tv at the end of the day. The other touches I liked were the full length dressing mirror and the can't be beat comfortable bed. The bathroom was tiny and despite the modern upgrades still seemed dated, and the water for the shower never got as hot as I prefer. Not to be missed is the restaurant downstairs. I ate there 3 times and everything was delicious, especially the made to order donuts with mascarpone cheese. The bar makes great drinks, too.

<Content>a bit disappointed I tried to ignore those reviews that discribe the Andra suits are actually rooms and hoping that there will always be people complain about everything. But they're right. I stayed in a Andra suit but it was just a room with a tiny sink. The vitual tour on tirpadvisor shows two guest rooms movies. Those are actually the suits. The guy at the front desk told me that a regular guest room doesn't have the writing/sitting area. The bathroom is really small. The soap was extremely drying. The fitness room is the same size as a regular guest room. It has a few cardio mechines and a few hand weights. Overall, the room wasn't bad. I was just disappointed that the suit is so small. I think it would be fair to call it a deluxe room but nowhere near a suit.

<Content>A Fantastic Seattle Boutique Hotel Experience @ A Great Rate Three cheers for the staff @ the Hotel Andra. At all points of contact I felt welcomed  assisted in a professional but warm manner. We were provided a complimentary upgrade on our room type (without our asking) when the front desk noted that they had room to do so. Room service was fantastic (gourmet larger than life BLT sandwiches and delicious kebabs  dips). Big comfy robes, cool ambiance, and a blissful sleep. The hotel is a bit older (like most in Seattle) but extremely clean and decor has been upgraded with a modern contemporary look/feel. I'm confident that we couldn't have found a better boutique hotel for a better price. A great experience - we will stay here again next time we travel down to Seattle for a getaway weekend!

<Content>Hotel was great! There were four of us sharing a Lux Suite (2 adults and 2 older teenagers) for 3 nights. The suite was perfect for us. The only time it felt cramped was when the sofa bed was left open (which the maid did leave one day). The furnishings were beautiful and the decor quite different and unique (our teenage boys loved it - especially the plasma TV!) I was disappointed with the bathroom however as it looked dated and felt cramped. I did expect a lot more there. Sound was not an issue on the 8th floor except for the occasional siren. Staff was great - very friendly and helpful but in my opinion, not out of the ordinary. A good hotel should train its staff to be this way. I was slightly annoyed one day when our room wasn't cleaned upon returning around 3:30 PM. This happens occasionally but it's such a hassle having to leave again for another hour to let the maid clean when all you want to do is put your feet up.Location wonderful as we walked to everything. Check out Raph's Deli across the street for wireless Internet and great coffee and cheap food which came in very handy for us with teenagers! Also had dinner at Etta's (not so cheap but great food!) Not sure I'd pick the Andra again as I like to try different places but I would certainly recommend it.

<Content>Wonderful service What a great example of classic service. Service was excellent. I had set up a package via Luxury Link however upon arrival the reservation was no where to be found. The hotel staff was excellent in making it a non-issue. Our room was large and VERY clean, nicely organized with all the bells and whistles. Contrary to other reviews, there were no noise issues. The Tom Douglas restaurants are a must. There are four of them plus a bakery. Food is outstanding. We lack that kind of flavor here in Denver. Will we be back? ABSOLUTELY!!!Biggest advantage is location, blocks from Pike's Market, the ferries, shopping, and people watching. Can't miss this hotel, MORE than worth it. Value is excellent.

<Content>The staff make the difference I am in Seattle at least 4 times per year and always stay at the Westin or Hyatt. Because both were sold out, I tried the Hotel Andra. I was there for three nights and by the end of the third night, I new I would be back. Yes, the beds are great, and the rooms are modern cool. They charge for Wi-Fi but if you eat in the restaurant(which is top notch - especially for breakfast), you can log on for free. The deciding factor was the staff. Every person I encountered went out of their way to be nice and helpful. Always greeted with a smile and by name. The other hotels are nice but a bit too impersonal. Hotel Andra was really a nice break from the norm! I also highly recommend the Italian restaurant next door and Ettas about a 10 minute walk away.

<Content>Up to Expectations My girlfriend and I stayed at the Andra over New Year's Eve. We booked a package that included a small suite, champaign, and a couple of other add-ons. If you are interested in exploring Seattle, the location is excellent. It is close to night life, good restaurants, and other points of interest in the city. We didn't interact much with the staff, but when we did, they were fine. We had no problems at all, and found the lobby and room decor to be pretty cool. On arriving, we found our room had a view of a building immediately adjacent. We asked for another room and were accomodated. We did not find the hotel overly noisy (although we were out pretty late ourselves). While we didn't really put the Andra to the test, we were satisfied with our experience and the value received for what we paid.

<Content>Now a local's favorite The bed was heavenly! And the suite we stayed in was wonderful. I highly suggest getting the reservation through the hotel website itself (----) to get some sweet deals, like free breakfast at the Tom Douglas restaurant and some Starbucks gift cards. The staff was always pleasant, helpful and friendly!

<Content>Small and Noisy The room was considered a suite, but it was extremely small, while other members of our party suite's were much larger. The room was noisy from the street below. The staff was young and inexpierenced and not very helpful. The check in is very crowded and awkward as it is next to the elevators and is very narrow, bad design and the lobby very small. A good location, and great beds! But we would not stay here again.

<Content>Very Chic hotel, brilliantly decorated, but thin walls Overall, we loved the Andra and found it very charming and chic. The location was great as well, and the staff, especially the guys in valet parking (who you will deal with the most if you have a car) are amazingly helpful. They printed out maps for us and just were very nice and quick and always on the job. The beds were so comfy too. The walls were, as previously said, very thin however. Luckily, I'm a heavy sleeper, but I did wake up and hear the people in the next room a few times, and there are some ambulance sirens to deal with, but then again this was in the middle of downtown and not out in the country somewhere. There is also a nice fireplace in the lobby and also free internet which we used every day as well as the little gym (mostly for cardio) and the restaurant, Lola, was pretty hip too. Very recommended.

<Content>Good Service, Great Beds, but Over-priced We stayed at Hotel Andra for two nights. The staff were very helpful throughout the stay. The place is beautifully decorated and the rooms were of average size. I found the place to be quite clean. The bed was wonderful. I usually have a terrible night's sleep in a hotel, but had a great sleep two nights in a row. I did not find the hotel to be noisy, but my husband did. I did find the hotel to be a bit over priced for what we got. It is billed as being a small luxury hotel but really didn't see it as being any different other than decor. The location was great - we walked everywhere from the hotel. We only had breakfast at Lola (the adjoining restaurant) but it was excellent. I had the doughnuts!!! I'm still raving about them. Overall, I enjoyed our stay, but next time would stay somewhere less expensive.

<Content>great little hotel We were very pleased with the Hotel Andra, which is downtown in the Belltown area. We had a spacious, well-decorated room. The hotel staff was pleasant and extremely helpful. Hotel is half dozen blocks from Pike Place market, Seattle Art Museum. Hotel offered free business center services(computer with internet access and printer). The attached restuarant, Lola, served breakfast (and lunch and dinner, which we did not try), and seems to be open late.Hotel is not very large; its has an intimate feel.

<Content>We won't stay at the Andra again. We went on a 10 day trip to Seattle and the surrounding area and stayed at the Hotel Andra 3 nights. The room was nice and even had a safe in the room for security while away. However, I would not stay at this hotel probably ever again. It is located down the street from a hospital and consequently ambulance sirens occur quite frequently. We were on the 9th floor and could easily hear every siren go by, all night long - every night. If you stay here, bring some earplugs as that's what we had to use to get a nice sleep. The parking lot across the street is used for Sat. night parties as well, for even more noise. Ice was out on our floor and reported, still no ice 6 hours later.

<Content>Needs Soundproofing We stayed here on our wedding night and while we enjoyed the modern decor and comfortable bed, the soundproofing in our suite on the sixth floor was terrible. Within in 5 minutes of settling into the room, we realised we could clearly hear the conversation of the couple in the adjoining room. We politely asked to move, but were informed that the hotel was booked. The next morning before 7am we were awoken by the television from the adjoining room and needed no more than 30 seconds to learn the couple was up and watching the 鈥淲ater Boy鈥? again we complained but noticed no change in volume from next door nor did we hear their phone ring. At check out, we yet again registered our complaint and received no apology, the young clerk brushed us off by saying he would place it in the log book. To us this was quite unsatisfactory considering our previous calls and his offhand remark that he heard the same complaint regarding our room previously. If it is a problem, why haven鈥檛 they fixed it and why do they continue to put people in the suite?As another reviewer remarked, the only saving grace was the great food and service at Lola, that we can highly recommend.

<Content>Great location, nice hotel, so-so service My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Andra over Labor Day weekend. The location couldn't be better. The first night we were there, we stayed in the Andra Suite. The room was moderately spacious and well designed. The mini-bar was well stocked, but a price list was no where to be found. Room service was from Lola the restaurant in the lobby. The food was very good, and the prices were very high. Overall we had a great experience. We unexpectedly decided to stay at the hotel a second night. After our great experience the first night, we decided to save some money and get the smaller Andra Studio because we didn't think we'd mind a simple size change, we expected everything else to be of the same quality. I can tell you the room size was pretty much the only physical change, but the service the second night didn't reflect it's four star rating. First, the window didn't open. Now this isn't a big deal to us, but when we called the front desk to see if there was a trick to getting the window open (because the windows in the suite opened), the gentleman told us that it doesn't open because of fire code, and all the windows on that floor were sealed shut. I know that's not true because we had stayed on the same floor the night before. We didn't appreciate being lied to. Next, we went to turn on the TV. It didn't work. We checked the plug, it was fine. We called the front desk. They said they'd send someone up to check on it. Forty-five minutes later, a girl from the front desk arrived, announced that maintenance was unavailable and that she was going to check it out. She walked over to the TV, pressed the same power button we had tried and checked the same plug we had checked (just like we told her on the phone). After she was unsuccessful, she told us that she didn't know what was going on, and that she'd try to find maintenance. Another twenty minutes go by, and she calls to tell us that eminence wasn't working and wouldn't be until morning. I told her that was unacceptable because we had plans to stay in for the remainder of the night and were going to watch TV. I requested a new room with a working TV. She told me there were no rooms available and that we'd just have to wait until eminence arrived. I explained that I found it hard to believe that they were sold out all of a sudden, considering we had checked in two hours earlier and they had all kinds of other room options available (including the suite we had stayed in the night before and the mid-range Andra Room). She then told me she'd have to call me back. They ended up moving us and the new room was just across the hall, the Andra Room (and by the way, the windows opened in it, too). This was the second lie of the night. In the morning, we hit the valet key on the phone, to request our car. The front desk answered and said that she'd be happy to have the valet pull the car. We waited ten minutes and walked downstairs (that's about how long it had taken them the day before). When we got down there, there were two valets standing around having a personal conversation. After we stood there for ten minutes, holding the blue valet ticket and tip money in my hand, one of them comes over and asked if we needed our car. I explained that we had called and the front desk said they were going to call out and request the car. He said they hadn't and it didn't surprise him because it had already happened a few times that morning. All in all, I can't say much bad about the hotel, the rooms or the restaurant. I don't mind little things like the window not opening or having to change rooms because the TV doesn't work. What I do mind is being lied to repeatedly and a supposed four star hotel dropping the ball on customer service in such a big way.

<Content>Poor Service All the good reviews the Andra gets makes me wonder if I stayed at the same place.My wife and I spent the last three nights of our honeymoon in Seattle at the Andra. I wish it had at least been the first three days of our trip so that we didn't have such an anti-climax.Having read a previous bad review of this hotel, I contacted the Andra in advance to reserve a room on a high floor away from the elevators as soundproofing is non-existent.What room did I get? One on a lower floor opposite the elevator. They were only willing to move us away from the elevator but on the same floor.Our package included champagne and truffles upon arrival. The truffles didn't arrive until our final night after two complaints to the front desk.I handed an item of clothing in to be laundered. It came back ruined.Overall, the Andra is a great looking hotel and would get more marks from me but for the poor service.The only saving grace was the adjacent Lola restaurant which serves up great food.

<Content>visually cool, but cramped........ first off, the staff at this hotel are JUST wonderful- they all were pleasant, very helpful , and went out of their way to treat their guests well. If you worked Sept. 11-12, 2005, we thank all of you - special thanks to Anthony, who let us weary cruise travelers check in early. The hotel is pretty cool design wise........ they have turned a residential property into a nice place. The downtown location was convient, able to walk to shopping. I dont know if I would walk around at night, one block was nice, the next alittle shady- thou not the fault of the hotel !!! Our room was smaller than imagined. We travelled with our 2 children, and when the rollaway bed was put down, it was tight. The street facing windows (that opened, which was a nice treat) were fun to look out of and gave us wonderful fresh air. The bed was comfortable by hotel standards (thou the Grand Hyatt bed was just incredible ), and had cool blue reading lights. The closet for luggage storage was huge- and had lots of hanger space too. The bathroom too small withnew fixtures styled in the 1920-1930 design. The sitting couch was the only seating, and wasn't too comfortable. It was a nice place visually, but dont know if we would stay there again- just wasnt worth the $$. Lola, the ajoining eatery though was superb- wow, what great food !! Ben, our server was friendly and prompt (and cute too!) Maxwell's, Central Ca.

<Content>Hotel Andra was wonderful We just returned from our first trip to Seattle and stayed at the Hotel Andra. We were very impressed!!!!Yes, the hotel is lovely, but more importantly the staff was wonderful!!! They truly made you feel special, not only did they answer all your questions, but they tried even harder to do more for you! Everytime, I had a question, not only did a get an answer, but a suggestion or offer to do something else for us.Yes, the rooms can get noise from the outside (especially very early in the morning.), but it's on a busy intersection. It's to be expected.Stay here if you want lovely, hip rooms and a staff that truly strives to please.

<Content>A must for the Seattle experience My stay at the Andra was exceptional. The location was terrific. Within walking distance of Pike Street, Needle, Jazz Clubs, Fine Restruants, and just plain city kicking around. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The staff was the best. The beds were unreal. If I didnt want to go out and see the city so much I would have just layed about in them all day they were that comfortable. My wife and myself were so impressed that we have swore to return for a long weekend. For those who are taking a cruise out of Seattle , like us, plan an extra day or two prior to your leaving and stay at the Andra (about 3 minutes form the debarkation dock) to compliment your trip. You will not be dissapointed.

<Content>Hotel Andra Rocks!!! We just came back from a long weekend trip to Seattle and I can鈥檛 wait to get online to review Hotel Andra. During our stay at Hotel Andra, I couldn鈥檛 find one thing I didn鈥檛 like (okay, the bathroom was pretty small but it didn鈥檛 really bother me). The service was superb; all of the hotel staff was very professional, courtesy, and very friendly. We had an Andra Suite (like a Jr. Suite); room is relatively big with a mini bar in the room. The d茅cor was very nice and tasteful. Hotel was very quiet (even though I understood that they were sold out during our stay). Lola restaurant food was very good 鈥?one of the best meals we had in Seattle. Location couldn鈥檛 be better; not to close to all the busy tourist spots but yet nicely located close to everything. We walked to Westlake area, Belltown, Space Needle, Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square 鈥?everywhere -- from the hotel. You probably read other reviews about the bed and it is sooo true; best hotel bed I鈥檇 ever experienced. During my visit, I have looked at all other hotels in Seattle downtown area and I won鈥檛 stay in any other hotels except for Hotel Andra. I totally recommend this hotel.

<Content>Highly Highly recommended We just returned from a 4 day stay in Seattle at the Hotel Andra. We had the studio queen. The rooms are not huge but they are BEAUTIFUL, Trendy and perfect - Like staying at the W but without the insane cost. Our room was 169$ a night booked through the hotel's website. It is in a perfect location near all of the great areas. We walked everywhere. There are awesome restuarants right nearby in the up and coming, funky neighborhood of Belletown, like - FlyingFish (HIGHY recommend), Toi, great Thai, Mama Mexico, Assagio (next to the hotel). I absolutely LOVED Seattle, loved the location of this hotel and would absolutely stay there again. The beds were the most comfortable and luxurious I have slept on outside of the W. The rooms are funky, the people are so nice and friendly and helpful. The rooms remind me of a room at a Spa - very calming and serene. The lobby is cool and trendy, yet cozy. The bar is great... The area is perfect - great for walking east to the VERY COOL area of Capital hill, or to the dowtown water front, it is also right near the shopping district and very close to the Space Needle... it's all you could ever want.....

<Content>I really enjoyed it. I have recently returned from the Hotel Andra and can say that I was pleased with my experience. The room we had was lovely and the people who served the hotel were very accomodating. We had breakfast @ Lola twice and the food was absolutely delicious! The location of the Hotel is perfect. I would stay there again!

<Content>Glad we chose Andra This was truly a last minute booking, made the morning of the day we arrived from San Francisco via Portland. Though we only stayed here for a night before traveling to Victoria BC we all found Andra to be charming and worthy of the praise it's gotten here. The front valet/door attendant was a little slow and service at the door was haphazard that day, the front desk friendly and helpful enough but not over the top either. We did get that great seattle map given to all tourists when we had questions about where things were located. The decor was comfortable and throughout were touches of NYC chic.We got the studio with King bed and couch on the far end of a very large room with a sliver of the Puget Sound from our window...the room reminded us of a NYC high end studio apartment, modern and spotlessly clean right down to the fantastic Frette linens (bed was outstandingly comfortable) and it had a tiny but nicely appointed bathroom. The bathroom (really is tiny with no place to store or hold your toiletries if that is an important detail to you) had great soaps and toiletries and the bedroom's TV was a terrific sized flat screen that you could view from the bed or the couch. Didn't get to eat at the bar or the restaurant but nightlife definitely was evident, we ate at Anthony's on the waterfront that night (great) but would definitely try the hotel's restaurant next time.SO close to everything in the downtown area (a quick walk to the seaport and shopping) I couldn't think of a reason why not to return there next time!

<Content>Great Find in Seattle Nicely renovated hip boutique hotel in Seattle. Near Belltown restaurants and shops. Great location. You can walk to Space Needle (or take monorail), downtown shops and Pike Place Market where the original Starbucks is. We had a huge suite with plasma tv and Frette linens. We paid $229 which was a very good rate for a room that size. Lola, a modern Greek restaurant is in the hotel. The breakfast was outstanding. We did not make advance reservations so we could not get in there for dinner but other restaurants owned by the same chef, Seattle legend Tom Douglas, are very closeby. Service was friendly and extremely helpful. I wouldn't stay anwhere else in Seattle

<Content>Not a world class hotel I chose this hotel for a trip with a girlfriend because it is listed on the Small Luxury Hotels of the World registry. I was disappointed, as the other hotels listed with SLHW have been perfect in every way, and Hotel Andra was truly average. Fine, but average. We stayed for 5 nights. The rooms were fine, but not luxurious. The bathroom was tiny. One of the problems is that no one who works there is over the age of 25. They really need a seasoned, professional concierge who knows what he or she is doing. Here's just one example: I check out early on the morning of our departure, pay a reasonable but hefty bill (after 5 nights) and before turning away, ask the desk clerk for a map to the airport. She proceeds to argue with me about whether I need a map, and how easy it is to get to the airport from downtown Seattle. She finally says, well, I guess I could print you something off of Mapquest. This should have been a no-brainer.

<Content>Andra OK for $240 (tax incl). Nice room, good shower with no tub, good Turkish towels, that can be a little rough. Pleasant staff that doesn't know too much, like no one knew how long it took to get to the opera house. We were there for the Wagner Ring cycle. Cabs almost impossible to get during rush hour, but very helpful doormen. Biggest asset: Lola's restaurant (through lobby), great bk, dinner, and late night snacks. Would probably return.....

<Content>A good week Stayed there for a week whilst attending the Seattle Opera's Ring cycle this year. Overall an excellent hotel though there were some minor irks that should not be in a relatively high priced luxury establishment. Front desk and door people were unfailingly welcoming. cheerful and helpful. I had checked out the parking rates before, so didn't bring my car to Seattle - thus no comments on the valet service. Daily paper - offerred choice of NY or Seattle Times - chose Seattle Times for local content and news. Received NY Times - every day! Six complaints (I was there 7 nights) but never did receive the right paper...Room was in good condition though housekeeping erratic. Bathroom small but adequate, but would look much better if the stained and worn tile floor was replaced.Food Smells - every now and then, usually late afternoon, but the A/C (noisy but very efficient) seemed to take care of it easily.Traffic noise - yes (I was on 3rd floor) but not particularly loud. Didn't bother me. Restaurant - did not try Lola's (but friends who did liked it). Assiago's next door very good. Bakery across the street (Dahlia) a great place for breakfast goodies.This hotel is certainly on my list for a great place to stay in Seattle.

<Content>Top Class Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Andra at the start of our vacation for 2 nights. I have travelled extensively, on business and vacation and any review that does not give this hotel a five star rating is not worth reading.The rooms are well equipped, spacious and very clean.The location could not be better.The design/d茅cor is excellent.The restaurant food is good.However what really makes this hotel such a pleasure to stay at is its staff.From the moment we arrive we were made to feel very welcome. Nothing was too much trouble.The front desk staffs were first class.The Concierge / doorman were some of the most helpful individuals I have ever had the pleasure to meet. In short if I were to return to Seattle the ONLY hotel I would consider is the Hotel Andra.

<Content>Lovely Room Hi,We stayed here as the Second part of our honeymoon, prevously at the Hotel Omni in San fransico.Unlike the Omni we had no room upgrades or discounts as a gesture towards our honeymoon. We arrived fairly late and as a result got room service which came from the resturant attached to the hotel. The food was excellent although very expensive and they added a massive service charge to bring the food to our room. My wife was impressed with the designer shower gels and shampoos.The room was beautiful with a massive bed and all the amenities in the room which you would expect. The location was splendid with only a five minute walk to the stores downtown and simarlaly to the EMP and the Space Needle.The staff were professional, but not particulary warm. I would recommend the hotel if you want a couple of nights in a unique and luxerious room. However, there is no pool or hot tub but is not like a rolled out chain hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Folks!!! My family of four spent only one night at Hotel Andra as we were visiting other places in the Pacific Northwest, but we would have loved to have had more time there. The place is decorated beautifully in rich chocolate brown, green and blue. The decor is funky but very tasteful, warm and inviting. Everyone we encounterd there was very polite, helpful, attentive, happy and just really seemed to like their jobs! They were very young and all quite attractive as well - not that this matters - just an observation. We would love to go back!

<Content>Picked Hotel Andra from Trip Advisor's recommendation I picked the Hotel Andra from reviewing the hotels on this web site and I'm glad I did. My husband and I stayed there for 5 nights in mid-July. It offered everything we were looking for - very friendly staff, perfect location, larger than usual room, contemporary feel, daily paper, and fairly priced.Really enjoyed the contemporary look of the room and a very comfortable bed. Staff could not have been friendlier. Since it was our first time in Seattle, we were especially pleased how easy it was to walk to the Market (10 mins), Space Needle (15 mins), Great shopping (5 mins), and even the ball park (about 35 mins).The only things that don't put it in the league of a 5 star is that the bathrooms are nicely updated, but basically older. Also, as mentioned here, the hallway lighting was kind of funky and took a day or two to get used to. We never once smelled any odors from the restaurant. It was noisy from the street several mornings, but I don't know what they could do to help that.Hope you enjoy your stay there as much as us.

<Content>Outstanding We have stayed at the Andra for two nights at the end of June and were very happy with our choice. The design of the place is extremely nice for those who like a modern style. The beds were very comfortable, the location excellent.In particular we were very pleased with the friendliness of the staff and the manager.If I had to go back to Seattle, I would not hesitate to book the Andra again.

<Content>A Winner in Downtown Seattle My husband and I stayed in a suite at the Hotel Andra for four nights and rate the entire experience as five star. The Andra matched the best rate I found on-line and was even offering its own special price on suites when I booked, so do check the hotel web site before booking. The suite was spacious and comfortable, the bathroom small but well provisioned with luxury linens and toiletries. We ran the airconditioner fan on low to block out the street noise for sleeping (my only minor negative). All staff were friendly and helpful; there are lots of bellmen/valets at the door and fast check out in the room via the flat-screen TV. Complimentary NY Times at our door each morning (including Sunday). Lola's, the in-hotel restaurant, is wonderful, with breakfasts large enough for two to share unless you have a giant appetite. Also had a late light lunch there the afternoon of our arrival and a night cap one night -- all were terrific. Heard good things about Assiago, the fancier Italian restaurant next door, but did not have a chance to try it. The Andra is close to many good restaurants and to the Pike Place Market. We walked all over the city from its central starting point. Will recommend the hotel to anyone traveling to Seattle and hope to stay there again ourselves.

<Content>Extremely Happy!! My family and I stayed at the Andra in June. I can't tell you how helpful and courteous the staff was. We were greeted coming and going. They offered great suggestions on where to dine and how to get there. Each and everyone of them took time to give us directions on a map. The room was spotless and we loved the comfort of the bed. My husband usually can' t sleep in any bed but our own - he has back problems. He slept the whole night and woke up feeling great in the morning. The Andra puts the softest throw pillow on their beds. This is not a typical hotel, even the lighting is outside the box. I would love to have the nightlight in the bathroom in my home. We love the contemporary feel of this property. No white walls in this room. Warm colors. My children loved the televisionsets in the elevators and the ceiling lighting in the halls. I would recommend this property for any type of visitor and will definitely stay again if we go back to Seattle.

<Content>Super place to stay! What a treat to book into the Andra while on a business trip. After a spell of bad luck with finding good hotels on recent previous trips, it was a pleasure to stay in a spacious, clean, quiet hotel with friendly, professional staff. I especially liked the wonderfully comfortable bed and the cool bathroom. Also, the guys manning the front door were so very helpful (and cute). Loved the modern decor of the interior. Was pleased to find the hotel centrally located to shopping and dinning in Seattle's downtown district and waterfront. As a picky clean freak who likes nice things, I fully recommend the Andra without hesitation.

<Content>Seattle Gem! A Great Updated Historic Hotel This is a great hotel in a great location. We could walk to Pike's Market, the Space Needle, the Monorail, the Waterfront, shopping, bars and restaurants in no time flat. The hotel does not have some of the amenities as other luxury hotels (in-house spa, pool), but it has a lot of character in the style of the old luxury hotels, like the Drake in Chicago. Unlike some of the other reviews for this hotel, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful (maybe the Management responded to the negative feedback). My only complaints were: the street noise during weekday commute hours (windows need better insulation) and both of our room keys kept demagnetizing. Otherwise, the Suite was very spacious and comfortable. In fact, I have never slept in a more comfortable and cozy bed. Bathroom is small, but cute and Art Deco-like. The decor in general is very new and Ikea inspired. Valet parking was quick, efficient and friendly (always asked if we needed directions). I highly recommend Lola's (located in the lobby) for breakfast and a nightcap. There was absolutely NO onion smell. I definitely would stay here again.

<Content>Make a reservation! You won't be disappointed! The news that Conde Nast Traveler's magazine recently listed Hotel Andra as a Hot Hotel for 2005 really intrigued me so when a friend's planned wedding in Seattle was announced, I booked rooms immediately  directly with the hotel, using the fax number off their website. The hotel lobby, bar and rooms are decorated in a hip, modern, yet welcoming, Scandanavian style. The bar/restaurant is a happening place, spilling over into the lobby at night with stylish, mostly young people drinking and talking. Quiet, though; no boorish behavior. Our party booked both a suite at $299/night and a double at $159/night. Suites are indeed two separate rooms, as advertized, but don't expect a lot of privacy as the door between the rooms is louvered. Still, if your group is a family or merely good friends, there is an adequate degree of separateness. Rooms are a comfortable size, very clean, well-furnished and without noticeable wear and tear, although the bathrooms are a bit small. The beds are super-comfortable and guests are provided with a great number of spa-type towels. Flat-screen TV in the rooms, too. The business center is small; one desk-top computer and one printer which did not work during part of our stay. Online e-mail is free, however, and there's another desktop in the lobby for use by guests. The entire hotel is WI-FI, $10.00 per day. As they say in real estate, the best part of the hotel is location, location, location. It's three blocks to major shopping, four blocks to Pike Place Market, and many great restaurants are within walking, too. Also, there's a Ralph's on the corner and, 40 yards away, the Airporter Connector bus ($17 roundtrip compared to $56 for a taxi) picks up and drops off every 30 minutes or so. The monorail to the Space Needle and Experience Music Project is only a few blocks away, too. I recommend Hotel Andra without reservation.....Ooops, maybe that's with reservation. Make one next time you're heading to Seattle!

<Content>Thumbs Up for Hotel Andra My wife, son and I just returned from a 5 night stay in Seattle; we stayed at Hotel Andra. We loved the ambience of the hotel, and can't say enough about the friendly, helpful staff. We really liked the location as well. Really close to the Market and within easy walking distance to the heart of downtown. We will be back.

<Content>Great hotel, great rooms, great service We stayed at the Hotel Andra on Saturday night before leaving on an Alaska cruise. Our suite was large and well appointed...hubby loved the flat screen tv. Knowing that when we came back from our cruise the following weekend, we were going to spend most of the day in Seattle before our late night flight back to FL, we asked if they had day only rooms available for the following weekend so we would have a place to shower and leave our luggage while we explored Seattle further. They gave us a studio which we checked into at 730am and left at 7pm. The staff at the Hotel Andra is wonderful, very friendly and accommodating. The location near Pike Place and the Space Needle is perfect for exploring on foot.

<Content>Nothing to write home about, but great location I stayed at the Hotel Andra recently for a shopping weekend and had a great time shopping but wasn't blown away by the hotel. The place does have a neat look to it, though the lobby look was a bit undecided- half ski lodge with the fireplace and wood table, and half more clean cut and trendy. The room was fine, nothing spectacular, and I have to agree that the bathroom was quite teensy, and definitely not new, though there were some new pieces in it, I guess. The beds were very comfy though. No problems with onion smells, or the valet, and the girl at the front desk/concierge who checked us in was very helpful and pleasant actually. Would i go back? For a good rate I would, but I'm going to shop around next time to see what else there is. The pieces weren't quite completely pulled together in the room, and the bathrooms were definitely not my favourite, but the location is pretty fantastic. You're right by the shopping, right by the main restaurant strip, a couple blocks from Pike Place market. So for a good rate, and a shopping weekend, it's perfect!

<Content>Very Enjoyable weekend at the Andra! My husband and I and friends really enjoyed our weekend stay. The rooms were just as advertised and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Lola was also very good. We didn't get to try Assaiggio but we heard some other guests talking about their great experience there. The location is near shopping and the Market.Our room rate was comparable with other hotels we considered but I think the Andra rooms are larger on the average. Would definately recommend to others.

<Content>What a find! We stumbled across this hotel in a web search and now are totally addicted and cannot wait to go back. Because of flight delays we did not arrive at the hotel until midnight and had to check out at 7 am. The room was spectacular - feeling very much like an old NY apartment. Wonderful beds and linens that make it nearly impossible to get out of bed. The staff is warm and friendly. Don't expect grandeur - expect something that is a find. This is not the Westin or W, but has the same feel - just on a very small scale. Highly recommended for those who want to get away from the mass market scene.

<Content>Incredibly disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I booked this hotel because: 1. the reviews here seemed pretty decent (except for the onion smell) and 2. their website made it look modern, hip and different. First impressions... great looking lobby, OVERWHELMING onion smell (in the lobby), arrogant front desk, cool elevators with televisions, attractive and modern room. At first, I thought I'd made a GREAT choice. It looked fantastic. But looks can be deceiving and like the saying goes beauty is only skin deep, so was this hotel. Let me spew: we arrived quite late at night. Upon walking into our room, none of the lights came on. I had to fumble around in the dark to find a lamp. Our room was supposed to have a crib set up for our daughter, however it did not. When it was brought to our room, one side was separated and we were told we needed to read the instructions on how to put it together. It was 11pm, we had been travelling all day with a young child, and were really not in the mood to put it together. We DID NOT pay 200+ dollars a night to put the bed together!!!! We called down to the front desk and told them to send someone up to fix the problem. The same guy came up, but by then we had nearly sorted it out. This just seemed unbelievable that a hotel of this quality would do such a thing.Once settled in bed, we were kept awake for hours because of the noise from downstairs. We could hear the music from the lobby/bar in both our room and the bathroom and we could constantly hear noise from the street (both valet and traffic, especially lots of sirens). I can honestly say that these were the worst 3 nights of sleep I've had since getting the baby to sleep through the night. While the bed was quite comfortable, the pillows were not. They were limp down pillows and just extremely uncomfortable. We decided to turn the a/c on to cool down the room, but it was horribly noisy and smelled like a baby powder scent was being pumped through (post-pregnancy supernose power smells everything!). I am not 100% positive, but I would hazard a guess that it was to help clear out the onion aroma. Regardless of smell, it was so loud we couldn't hear the tv without cranking up the volume, so we kept it off. Yet another annoyance. Speaking of tv, I was under the impression that our room was supposed to have a plasma tv but it was just a flat screen, regular one. The room (Lux Suite) was clean and a fairly good size, including a separate sink/minibar area, desk, and couch. The bathroom was fairly small, and the toiletries were nothing special. There were lots of lights and lamps, which was nice. The hotel does have a small exercise room (just looked in) and a computer room with 2 computers, which I did use.The location was pretty decent and within walking distance to most everything. The front desk staff was NOT at all friendly. They never looked up or said hi when you passed right by them to get to the elevator. The only people who were friendly, were 2 valet guys. We didn't have any issues parking or retrieving our car, like a previous poster mentioned. However, we did call down to get it out in advance. Valet was $24/night.We never went to the restaurant, LOLA (didn't seem suitable for children), so I can't give a review for that, but it looked fine from the outside. The day before we left, the cleaning staff hadn't cleaned our room by 2pm (we'd been out), so I called down to see if someone could come up before I put our daughter down. They decided to come back at 4pm after her nap. Needless to say, when they finally came back, my husband was in the bathroom, so I asked if they could give us a minute. They said no and that they had to leave for the day. I rushed him out of there, much to his dismay. I hope he left them a nice, and hopefully worse than onion aroma, if you get what I'm saying. :) This was just NOT the level of service I expected from a small luxury hotel. The last morning, we were awake by 5am because of all the street noise/valet, so we decided to just pack up and get out of there. When we checked out, I was completely ready to let the front desk clerk know just how terrible our stay was, only he never even asked. Funny that!!!! Seriously, how can you not ask how everything was????? I was so amazed I just walked out shaking my head. Thank goodness for tripadvisor. I thought, at least I can tell people who might care!To sum up this hotel... it is very nice looking inside. Once you start looking beyond the decor, you realize that they've taken an old hotel and spruced it up without properly insulating the walls from noise. They've put arrogant, uncaring people out as their representatives, who are disinterested in creating a positive guest experience. I don't care if it is the most gorgeous place I've ever seen, if I can't sleep and the staff are rude, it just ruins everything. Looks are NOT everything.

<Content>The Best I am generally quite cynical and jaded by the hacks that try to create the veneer of taste and creative design. I speak of the the kind of toss-off of thrift-store-potpourri or the hyper-self-consciously modern style featuring austere curved shapes of polished metal.  But the work done on the Hotel Andra truly impressed me. The choices made in design were, to my eye, very intelligent and finely tuned. The first thing that stood out to me was the choice of carpeting in the halls. The usual flavor of mass produced homogenous pattern that screams volume discount above all else in most places (even luxury hotels) is abandoned for a dark purple field with modest framing lines on the margins. In addition the monotony of most hallways is broken up by a few subtle, long, thin, curved shapes along one margin. The subtlety of the lines, like modest scrollwork, that eschew the mundane and base inclination of symmetry achieves an effect that is stimulating but far from overbearing. For the weary traveler who may not have the energy to actively appreciate the other appointments this touch is quite uplifting. The rest of the build is a great succcess in reclaiming an aging building with modern design. Along the center of corridor ceilings a section of perforated brushed sheet metal reveals only to close inspection the space that holds pipes and conduit as well as overhead halogen lighting. It is a laudable design statement that refuses to simply veneer over the old with the typical staple-on finishings that are the hallmark of mass-market remodeling.  The rooms blend the old building with tasteful understated elegance of modern furnishings. The bedding is lush and generous in pillows and blanketing. The bathroom was nicely reclaimed from the buildingd previous exixtence with modern fixtures that emulated the old, like a new pedestal basin. This choice leaves only a shelf along walll over the sink and a pedestal side stand for personal effects which might create a space shortage for travelers with a lot of personal hygiene and cosmetics. The old floor that was the familiar 1 inch hexagonal tiles was reclaimed by sanding down the old surface. This effect was obviously efficacious but, not my favorite technique. The random fade of the original borders of the hexagons seemed too haphazard. I would have looked for some other treatment in addition to liven up the old floor but this is a minor criticism.  The overall effect inspires me to say Kudos. It is nice to see something in design that really makes me want to praise the work.

<Content>Just OK; did not live up to the hype I was really looking forward to staying at the Hotel Andra as I had seen it be annointed as one of the best new hotels in the U.S. by Traveler magazine. Unfortunately, my stay did not live up to the hype.Things started off bad right off the bat due to the awful valet parking situation at this hotel. The valet parking attendants were not to be found so we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to show up and give us a claim ticket. Throughout the three days we spent there, the valet parking situation was a constant hassle. Sometimes no one was there; sometimes there was no space in front of the hotel to drop off the car because limos and other cars were parked there for the adjacent restaurants; sometimes even when someone was there it took them over 15 minutes to get the car brought around (and this was after calling them from the room ahead of time to have the car brought around). We discovered that the hotel is contracting this service out and will not be providing valet parking service on its own until the beginning of next year. This was a really annoying aspect of the hotel.We tried to check in at 3 p.m. Mind you, we had called ahead of time since we were out shopping and asked if the room would be ready at 3 p.m. and we were assured that it would be. We got to the hotel at 3:15 p.m. and sure enough, the room was not ready. It was not ready for another 30 minutes. The front desk staff was aloof, unhelpful and lacking in social skills. There was only one front desk employee during the course of the three days that actually seemed like he enjoyed helping the clientele. The rest just sat there chatting with each other and barely looked up when anyone passed by. One night we discovered that the valet parking attedant was not outside to take our car because he was inside chatting and laughing with the two girls at the front desk. Needless to say, I was not amused. The previous comments about the hotel smelling like onion is absolutely. . .TRUE. At night when the restaurant in the lobby gets cooking, you will smell onions throughout the hotel. We were on the NINTH floor and we smelled it in the hallways up there. Luckily, the smell did not travel into our room, but every time we walked through the lobby I thought I was going to hurl. It was that strong. Perhaps the front desk people at night were so much like zombies because they had to inhale that awful stench all night long.As far as the room goes, I was very unimpressed. The bathroom was tiny and very hard to get around. The bath products were average at best. I decided to use my own that I had brought from home, and I almost never do that. To their credit, the bed was extremely comfortable. The pillows could have been fluffier though. We had a junior suite, so we had some extra space. There was a couch, coffee table and a small bar area in the living portion of the room. The room had absolutely no view, so we did not spend much time in the room at all. The air conditioning worked well, so that was a saving grace for the room.The location is very good. It is central to shopping and the sights. Personally, I prefer to stay closer to the shops. I definitely recommend the Grand Hyatt Elliott Bay as a wonderful 5-star hotel with impeccable rooms, service and location.The Hotel Andra was very disappointing. I kept trying to be optimistic and find positive things about the experience. But, quite frankly, there were very few things about my stay there that leave happy memories. I would definitely never stay at this hotel again. I just can't express how truly disappointed I am.Book me at the Hyatt next time!

<Content>Loved the Andra This is my 2nd time staying at Hotel Andra and once again I was extremely pleased with my stay. My room (a king suite) was spacious, modern and very comfortable. The front desk was helpful with everything I needed and the hotels location is excellent. This is the only place I will stay while in Seattle.

<Content>Everything but the Octopus As an add-on to a work trip, I booked two days at the Andra for my birthday, based on the web-site and positive reviews here. I must say, I left being a little obsessed with the place.1. I was upgraded to the suite, which of course is just a larger room with a couch. However, it was a very snazzy couch. I asked to see a regular room so I would be able to see what I paid for. It was a standard size room, but...2. The blue and beige Scandanavian-inspired color scheme is quite striking. I understand that in five years it will need to be redone or it will look both dated and frayed, but for now it is a cut above similarly priced entries.3. Fascinated by other problems with restaurant smells, I am almost disappointed to say I had no such problems. However, I did have breakfast at Lola. Expensive, but delicious. No octopus for me, but the smashed potatoes were scrumptuous.4. I cannot abide a hotel that doesn't have a computer room with free acccess. The Lola provides. There is also a workout room. It's small, but I overheard a staff member saying they are planning to move it to a larger space.5. My local friend told me they pumped a ton of money into this and it shows. But as always, it's the little things that make an impact. I liked the design of the paper coasters.6. Have you noticed that many new hotel designs don't provide for much in the way of drawerspace? Is everyone living out of their suitcases? I'm sorry, but I like to unpack.7. Parking is valet only, and quite high compared to the room cost. You can park across the street in a garage and save about $7 a day. But if you're like me and winging it carless, it's not an issue.

<Content>The Andra Recovers from a Near Miss We chose The Andra for a birthday-weekend getaway because of the serene, modern and upscale atmosphere -- something special, something different. We were sadly disappointed when roof construction noise woke us at 7 am on a holiday morning. The staff was courteous, immediately moved us to a different floor in an upgraded room, but I left with that feeling of uncertainty. Why would they let that happen? My uncertainty was totally erased when I got a wonderful return letter from the administration stating the construction crew had broken their contract (hours of work). They even sent one of the hotel's luscious robes to soften the blow. I would certainly give them another try based on the great response we got.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel! The suite was very hip and modern. I really enjoyed the flat screen T.V. and the comfortable bedding. Overall the decor of the hotel was great. The only bad thing was the size of the suite, the bathroom was disappointing, and the smell coming form the kitchen.

<Content>Not bad The location is excellent, can walk to everything. Our room faced the street, and traffic noise was quite loud even with windows closed, in summer with window's open noise would be bad (don't believe they have air conditioning). Restaurant smells (onions?) were very stong in lobby and elevator - but didn't make it into the room. Shag carpet stuff on headboards a bit weird and not sure how they would clean it. Room large and well appointed otherwise.

<Content>Had hoped for more First of all, the location of the Andra can't be beat. Walking to nearly every sight in Seattle was a breeze. However, I strain to compare this boutique hotel to the others I have visited on the west coast. The amenities were lackluster, the weightroom seemed like an afterthought, and the staff was astoundingly incompetent and insincere. They seemed to know next to nothing about the property or the city, and the management seemed to be hiding out in some alcove behind the desk. Overall, if you have money to burn and are looking for a staff to challenge your patience, you will not be disappointed. Wether that equals a happy stay because of the location is up to you.

<Content>The Hotel Andra, perfectly quiet and comfortable My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Andra in downtown Seattle, in FEB 2005. The hotel room looked exactly like the pictures presented on their web site. I wanted special teabags and they were provided to me within minutes. I saw no maid service the entire weekend I was there yet my room was cleaned everyday.If you like a hotel that has very little activity except the front desk, valet and concierge, this is the hotel for you. If you like all of the business of a big hotel, this is not for you.The Hotel Andra is very quiet, in a very good section of the downtown, has a restaurant/bar attached and a bakery across the street and is within walking distance to the Market, Space Needle and plenty of shops and restaurants.

<Content>Great Hotel, horrible smells. The Hotel Adra was conveniently located and decorated fabulously. The only problem we had was the cooking odors from the hotel restaurant permiated the entire building. We had to switch rooms and we were on the 9th floor! I doubt if the ventilation system was updated when the hotel was remodeled as our bathrooms in both rooms constanly smelled of onions. We actually considered changing hotels after the first night, but settled on air freshner and candles instead. We kept the windows opened all of the time and turned the heat off to try to eliminate the smells. Good thing that the bedding was warm.

<Content>Andra was sophisticated, comfortable and friendly! I have always stayed closer to the financial side of Seattle (W, Fairmont, Monaco) but I decided to branch out and try a new hotel in the hip Belltown neighborhood after seeing a great offer on Travelzoo. What a pleasure it was to stay at Hotel Andra. Very friendly non-assuming staff immediately had my luggage inside before I got out of the cab! If one thing stands out about Andra it is the details. High end furnishings, bedding and great service combined with Plasma TV's in the rooms made for an enjoyable new experience in Seattle. The bartenders at Lola's (hotel restaurant) were very friendly and open late. I also enjoyed the four block walk to Pike Place Market on Sat. I will definately go back to Andra on my next trip.

<Content>Perfect Location! My 8 yr old daughter and I stayed for New's Year and we both loved it! The location can't be beat-we were able to walk to the Space Needle, Pike's Place and downtown for shopping. One of the reasons I like small hotels is that they take the time to help. The staff was very helpful securing dinner reserv. for NY Eve at the last minute. Stayed at the Westin previously, but it's too generic.

<Content>Charming renovated hotel in great location We spent Thanksgiving at the Hotel Andra. What a sweet little botique hotel, in a great location. It's not in the heart of Seattle's financial district, but about one or two blocks on the fringe - which means a more reasonable rate and not in the craze of the shopping frenzy. Parking was not a problem. Still, we were one block from Bon Macy, one block from the Cinerama movie theater, and on the same block as 3 of Seattle's upscale restaurants. The renovation of this older building was quality throughout. Great shower head, towels, and shampoo. Plush bedding, gorgeous window dressings. NY Times delivered. We splurged on the suite so our kids could have their own beds and a 37 plasma TV. The rate for the suite is comparable to a standard room 2 or more blocks closer into the financial/shopping district. Only downside is that the walls are a bit thin. Or maybe the baby that was crying early in the morning would probably be heard in even the most padded of hotel walls.

<Content>Great hotel, just needs better service Just got back from a week at Hotel Andra. We loved the hotel's design and our roomy Andra Suite. The room service from Lola was delicious. The location is outstanding. However, the hotel needs better service to match the fabulous environment. We had problems with housekeeping and some of our inquiries to hotel staff were answered rudely. There was no hotel information in the room except for the room service menus, and no information was volunteered about exercise facilities, etc. upon checkin. However, we would stay here again and hopefully next time the service will be up to par.

<Content>I loved this hotel!! Now that I've stayed at Hotel Andra, I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else when I visit Seattle. I am so glad I decided to stay at Hotel Andra and not at the Westin. We stayed in a suite with two queen beds and it was huge. It looked better than the website pictures - which is a rarity. Lots of room to move around with a gigantic walk-in closet. The bathroom was unique and that's a good thing. Also plenty of room in the bathroom. The beds were very comfortable - we slept great. We went for a concert at Key Arena and were less than a mile away - totally within walking distance. We were within walking distance of everything, which is a definite plus for me.The service was great - the staff made everything comfortable and they were very friendly and accomodating.I honestly won't consider another hotel in the future in Seattle. I was very impressed. For the price, especially, the Hotel Andra is an excellent choice. I would suggest it to anyone I know visiting Seattle.Really cool hotel!!

<Content>Why stay at the W? Happened to find the Andra on the United website. Did not see it on any other, so we weren't sure what to expect. My goodness, our room was HUGE. We booked a king room, which had a living room area, huge granite bar with cabinets, big closet and seperate business area. Our friends did not get the big room but instead got a mini walk in closet and other amenities. Hotel provides Frette linens, down comforter, robes, extra pillows, flat screen TV. Was very clean and modern. Location was great, Pikes Market is 4 blocks away, bus stop in front of hotel and valet parking. Walked to all shops and the mall, did not have to use our rental car at all. Never knew of this place (new) and will definitely stay here again. I am glad that the Westin was booked full.

<Content>Great Hotel - Perfect Location I chose the Ambra because of its great location on the edge of Belltown and was pleasantly surprised on all counts. The hotel staff were friendly, the room great, the bed comfortable. The location can't be beat and the hotel restaurant, Lola's was exceptional. We had dinner and breakfast there and loved the food, the service and ambiance. The rooms are very stylish and have plasma TV's and wireless internet access.

<Content>Model, modern hotel Our Andra Suite was large, bright, and attractively furnished. Art deco with modern touches. We saw one room with a large flat screen TV on the wall.And the bed was very comfortable. The only negative about the room was that the closet could have been larger.The hotel is well-located -- only a few blocks from Pike Place Market, Nordstrom's, and Macy's.The hotel would have been more convenient if it had a news stand/gift shop, but there were plenty of stores nearby. There didn't seem to be a concierge, which didn't matter to us but might to some guests.We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Stay My wife and I stayed two nights over Labor Day weekend. We've stayed in many boutique and hip, modern hotels before but found Hotel Andra to be among the most pleasant. The room was spacious and the location great - very convenient to good restaurants and all the perks of downtown Seattle. Additionally, the hotel had a warm, inviting feel that many modern hotels lack. Finally, the staff was friendly and helpful. I highly recommend that you stay here - especially considering the reasonable price!
