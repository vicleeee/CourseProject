<Content>Great Location Great location for price. We were near the Seattle Center and could walk around without trouble. While it isn't the top end Marriott, it served it's purpose just fine.

<Content>Great Location It was awesome! you could see the sea planes landing across the street. Parking was a little steep at $18 but you did'nt need to drive.Take the streetcar downtown. Rooms were nice but to save midnight parties from aparment buildings across the ally way get rooms with a lake view or ending in even digits. The 4th floor was a little nosiy but higher floors are quieter.One suggestion is to make bigger parking stall because a wide car coming in at 9,10 pm can't really get in unless denting bumpers or spending 30 minutes getting into the concreate covered stall. Other than that it was awesome if you don't have an expensive wide euopean car like I did at 9,10 pm.

<Content>Glad To Leave This One Booked this hotel over the telephone, understanding that the relatively high room rate included a continental breakfast.As they do not offer 2 x Queen size beds, we had to take a King size with our daughter sleeping on a pull-out (day/night lounge). Making up the pull-out was no great problem, but the hotel did not supply blankets or a quilt for this bed: considering they knew we would be using the pull-out, the lack of sufficient bedding was disappointing, but not a show-stopper. After two phone calls, Housekeeping finally delivered a quilt. Unfortunately, by the time the pull-out was extended, there wasn't much floor space left in what had initially appeared to be a comfortable room.When we checked at Reception about the continental breakfast we were informed there wasn't one but we could purchase a buffet breakfast (forget the cost, but it certainly wasn't cheap). Referring the matter to the Duty Manager was a waste of time: he was disinterested and unhelpful. Considering the tariff, this all put a rather unpleasant taste in our mouths, so we found alternative accommodation. We checked out the next morning and moved to the The Holiday Inn 3-4 blocks closer to downtown, considerably cheaper and much friendlier and more helpful staff.This was the first time we had used a Marriott Hotel - it will probably also be the last.

<Content>Room location is important Typical Courtyard, but solid option based if you can get it for no more than $100. However, insist on a room facing Lake Union. Great views. Otherwise, you will be overlooking the hotel dumpsters  delivery entrance. Makes a big difference in the quality of your stay. Free trolley to downtown just a 5 minute walk, or brisk 20 minutes walk into town, or 10 minutes to Space Needle.

<Content>Small but adequate The hotel is great for a single or couple traveling. It was too small for me and my two teenagers. We like the location because of the proximty to the new lightrail. Our last visit we stayed in the Marriott Residence Inn, just down the street and it seems like a much better value. Much bigger rooms, usually suites with full kitchen and seperate bedrooms. They also provide a very decent complimentary breakfast. So a great place for families. That said, the courtyard was fine, clean, bed was quite comfortable, hotel looks fresh and clean, the staff were all friendly and helpful. Others have complained about the walk to Seattle Center. It does go along a very busy road, but the sidewalk is plenty wide and it's a short distance. We didn't have any problems or complaints about that. Joeys is a great place to eat and we really enjoyed the Experience music project. There's not a lot for young children, but my teenagers really enjoyed it. Take coins for the lightrail (bills are problematic in their machine) , it's $1.75 for adults for 2hrs., .50 for kids 17 and under.

<Content>Best hotel in downtown!!! This is a great hotel! Good value. I'm on the road most of the time for business and this hotel has everything you need. Seriously! Great staff, clean hotel, comp. internet, full bar/lounge and restaurant. They even offer room service for breakfast and dinner! The lobby is very comfortable. I enjoyed the large fitness center and pool area. Another nice thing about this hotel is that there are at least 10 excellent restaurants that are in walking distance. As of December 2007, the Lake Union Street Car station is one block from the hotel. It's sweet! You can take the street car right into the heart of downtown.

<Content>Never Again.... Sad鈥? I expected the 鈥淢arriot鈥?accommodations and service to match an average rating. 鈥? I was terribly disappointed in both the staff and the room. The small room offered window view of an apartment / condo complex and a building with boarded up windows; the room had dirty windows, the bathroom fan was not working and the room had very poor lighting. The staff service; slow to respond and/or non responsive; seemed to me they are disorganized. We will not stay at this location again.

<Content>Does not live up to Marriott standards This was not a quality Marriott property. The beds were very uncomfortable. You could hear hotel noise in the rooms (ie: toilets flushing, showers running, doors opening/slamming). The windows were very thin, so you heard road traffic, which was quite significant on a Friday morning at 7 am.We paid $229 plus taxes for this room. When you add tax and $17 for parking, it was not a good value. The rooms were clean, but dated.At check-in we were told we could walk to the Space Needle. That was very poor advice to give to a family (or anyone). The only direct route goes through a tunnel. Every other route we tried, we were unable to cross divided Highway 99. I would never suggest anyone walk from this hotel to the space needle. The downtown bus is at the front door providing great access to downtown, except it is not a Free Shuttle, which other hotels in the area apparently have. This was not a Marriott experience that I am used to.

<Content>No more shuttle to downtown! My family and I had stayed at this hotel previously. They had a van shuttle service to downtown attractions, a necessity given this hotel's proximity outside the downtown area. I had booked us into the hotel again for another Seattle stay about six months prior to this visit, and I again made sure the hotel still had its shuttle when making the reservation. However, upon arrival I found that the hotel had canceled its shuttle service, with no notice to reservation holders.While this sounds like a minor issue, it definitely is not for this hotel's location. The nearest attraction is the Space Needle, which is a 1-mile walk straight uphill. Not great for my husband who suffers from an arthritic hip after extensive walking. We had to use cabs to get around, an option that added unwelcome costs to our trip. A sister property, Marriott Residence Inn just one block away still has its shuttle service downtown. So does the Silver Cloud Inn, which is also within one block, as well as the University Inn, another affordable alternative to downtown. These hotels, which still offer shuttles, are actually farther from downtown than the Courtyard. So what gives? The hotel did not have a good answer. But this definitely hurts the Courtyard with tourists and business travelers alike who need to get to downtown destinations.  I would advise anyone considering this hotel to book elsewhere until the hotel reinstates its downtown shuttle.

<Content>Exceeded my expectaions The place was great. It is a chain hotel, but it was nicely decorated, the food was very satisfactory, the bar was friendly, the pool and hot tub area wereclean and nice, the room was spacious the bath very nice, even had the concave shower curtain rod -- and the view is pretty durned good. I expected just a no frills room, and it wasn't the Ritz, but it was very nice and it did exceed my expectaions.

<Content>Billing problems I'll say first that the accommodations were okay. The room was quite small (especially considering the price), but I had no issues with cleanliness. I also appreciated that they offered Wi-Fi access in the lobby and made a few computers with attached printers available to guests. My negative opinion is due mostly to billing problems that I want to warn others about. I won't go into too many boring details, but business travelers in particular should take care. The front desk staff acknowledged when I arrived and at check-out that the company I was associated with would be charged (even though they had me swipe my credit card at check-in). Cut to a few weeks later and my bank statement showed that they charged the room to me (several days after I left). When I called to complain, they were unapologetic. I have to admit that I'm still mad about it, but I can honestly say that if you go to Seattle, you can do better. I spent the rest of my time in Seattle at the Mediterranean Inn where the accommodations were just as nice but much less expensive.

<Content>Sterile, Poor Value for the Location Coutyard Marriott Downtown Seattle/Lake Union is standard hotel chain fare -- sterile atmosphere; expensive, bland food; and lackluster service.The location is not ideal -- situated on the outskirts of downtown in a high-traffic area -- and their shuttle service isn't all too user-friendly (book in advance, only a handful of pre-determined stops, no regular schedule). Parking is expensive ($15/night) and a tight squeeze (6' clearance) in the garage.The room was clean and average, but could use some updating, and the amenities were ho-hum. The furniture was uncomfortable -- the mattress too firm and the couch stiff and boxy. The breakfast buffet was expensive ($30 for two!) and the spread was what you could find for free at other hotels and hotel chains -- fruit, cereal, oatmeal, rubbery scrambled eggs, pastries, and make-your-own waffles.For the rate charged, there are far better hotels -- with more character and more personal service -- in more convenient locations.For a place with unique character go to the Hotel Max. For a great location with quiet Northwest comfort go to the Inn at the Market.

<Content>Good but expensive We chose this hotel due to the downtown location and the lack of availability in other hotels. This hotel is located in a commercial area across the street from Lake Union and we paid $154/nt in October over a 3-day weekend.This is a good location although you will need to take the hotel shuttle (5 different spots) or city buses to go to the tourist areas except the Space needle which is a 15 minute walk mostly uphill. It has a rather expensive ($13 for buffet breakfast) restraurant for breakfast and dinner. it also has one of the nicer exercise rooms with gym quality treadmills and stack machine. The beds lived up to the commercials and were the most comfortable we experienced on this trip. There is onsite parking in a gated garage under the building for a fee or free public parking across the street. I choose the free parking which worked out fine. Bbut be careful, upon leaving Sunday morning I noticed piles of car glass in 4 spots that wasn't there three days earlier. The rooms were nice, but the neighborhood is pretty active (noisy) on the weekend nights. The staff was helpful providing suggestions, maps and directions.There are several restaurants located close by. For breakfast there is a Starbucks in the ACG building and Tin Cup coffee (lunch too) on the far corner of the Jillians/Outback/Fishbone block. The restraurants on the lake are expensive ($15 burger!) and cater to the Yacht crowd docked in the Marina. We also found the Neptune Deli on Dexter St. three blocks behind the hotel. This is a popular area on the weekends so make reservations if you plan to eat at the nicer restraurants.

<Content>Wonderful Place To Stay In Seattle My family and I had a wonderful stay at the Courtyard Marriott on Lake Union. We were in town for a wedding, and about 75 guests stayed at this hotel. The rooms are very spacious, clean, and have all of the necessary ammenities. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. The pool and restaurant are very nice (great breakfast buffet) and the entire building is well maintained. Many of our rooms had an incredible view of Lake Union. The hotel is in a good location and in walking distance from Seattle Center, Downtown, and Pike Place Market. There is also a convenient shuttle that takes you to different destinations in the city. There are many great restaurants around the lake surrounding the hotel. We had such a comfortable and enjoyable stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Seattle.

<Content>Great location and quality hotel I read several good reviews and was not disappointed. Effortless check-in, friendly and attentive staff, free parking across the street (if space available and only evening until 7 a.m. - good incentive for me to get up early and get to my meeting on time). There is very good freeway access, as I had to go to meetings in Bellevue the 2 days there. The main reason I stayed here was price; although I was there on business I work for government and we can't pay high rates (Bellevue rates are very high during the week), even if this means slogging through traffic to get to a meeting next door to the hotel where everyone else is staying. At government rate this was good value; even at a regular or especially discount rate I'm sure this is still a good deal.Also: free broadband (wired) in room; free WiFi in lobby I was told but didn't test; nice snack and sundry store in lobby, great views of lake, excellent fitness room (for a hotel), pool  sauna I would have liked to have tried had I brought trunks, and very conveniently located close to downtown Seattle. One night I walked to and from Icon Grill (worth a visit, although pricy). During rush hour it's a little slow to walk as there are a lot of feeder and access roads in between. There's even a drive through coffee shop down the street on the way to the Interstate (just past actually, which is why I didn't try it).

<Content>Great place to stay! We stayed here July 4-7, 2006. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and we had the room type we reserved waiting for us when we arrived. The pool and spa were nice - great that they are indoors. The shuttle bus personnel were prompt and informative. All staff was extremely courteous. We would stay there again and would recommend it to all.

<Content>great stay with kids We loved this hotel. Great location, great staff at front desk, housekeeping, and restaurant! My daughter had a great time in the pool, which was very clean. Since we stayed there over the weekend, there was ample free parking across the street. If you have a lake view, you get to watch the airplanes take off from the lake!

<Content>Good Hotel Good location Just got back from an Easter weekend getaway.I read as many tripadvisor reviews as possible before choosing a hotel and I think most comments for this property were fair. The hotel and room was clean and well looked after. The location is good for most Seattle activities and it has 4-5 restaurants within a 5 min walk. We didn鈥檛 try the hotel eatery; no one was ever in there except for breakfast that always makes me nervous. A couple of criticisms, the room was on the small size along with the towels. The other for me was an overly soft bed that had foam added to the mattress. I don鈥檛 know if all of the rooms have that kind of bed but it was not a quality product. We paid for a Lake Union view, which was worth it. It鈥檚 a nice view and it allowed us to watch our car parked in the free lot across the street. I would hate to be at the back of this hotel looking at the construction site.The staff was pleasant and helpful. Overall, the experience was a good one.

<Content>More than meets the eye, unfortunately. Great views, bright and modern decor, friendly staff, but our non-smoking room had a terrible odor, and the windows do not open, so there is no way to get fresh air in! Be advised if you have a keen sense of smell. We just checked out this morning after a bad night's sleep. Oh, and speaking of that, the sheets can't be more than a scratchy 100 thread count.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Marriott Lake Union for one night on April 14th. Nice hotel. It looks like the hotel was recently renovated. The furniture was new and the rooms are very clean. Parking is priced at a premium at $15/night, but there is free parking across the street in a lot where the park is. Seems safe enough. Overall, great hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel... This hotel is newly renovated. The 2.5 star Priceline places on this hotel is underrated.The rooms are brand new. The staff are great, and you can't beat the location - literally minutes outside of downtown.And if you want to save yourself the $15 parking fee, just park across the street at the free city lot. It's safe and well-lit.We stayed with our 9 month old baby boy, and loved every minute of it!

<Content>We loved our view The staff was friendly the service was excellent. We had a nice view of the Space Needle. We had are own car so we did not need depend on hotel transportation. Our room was spacious and our King size bed was very comfortable. This Marriott is not on the beaten path but if you don't mind waiting for a shuttle or better yet if you have your own transportation, this Marriott is a great bet!

<Content>Great Service...frustrating internet access! Pros: friendly, helpful hotel staff; clean rooms  very comfortable beds; good on-site breakfast; excellent appetizers  comfortable lounge.Cons: just one, but a major pain - hotel advertises 'high speed internet access', and while I was able to access once, (only after consulting with the service provider), it became too frustrating with each subsequent attempt. My laptop is 'ready-to-go', and I have always been able to connect at other hotels with zero problems. This hotel needs to upgrade - and they should add wireless capabilities as well.

<Content>Good but too far from downtown Seattle The hotel is well kept, clean, but almost sterile. No real character. The rooms are spacious, and provide all you would need. Our view was a huge construction site but that did not disturb us. The main fault with this hotel is the location. The lake is beautiful but there was not much made of it - i.e. bars, rstaurants etc... (except Hooters!). The walk into downtown Seattle was not too far but was through busy roads, and unsavoury areas. The Shuttle was available - although we booked twice on it at the front desk but twice were told there was not enough room. It is visibly close to the Space Needle but again it is difficult to get to. The roads around this area are extremely busy and there are no really safe places to cross the roads (around the hotel). The location really spoilt our trip as there is lots to do in Seattle, but we spent a lot of time getting back to the hotel. Overall an average hotel that is extremely expencsive for what it is. The cleaners were exceptional but that it is it. Our bill was incorrect, (twice), and staff were rude when tackled about it. There were always lots of staff at the front desk - too many cooks??? Costs 35 dollars in a taxi from Sea-Tac and 30 (for two people) in a Shuttle Express.

<Content>Warning - Construction site next door! Stayed for a weekend in July 2005. Overall, this Courtyard is exactly what you would expect...decent service and clean comfortably appointed rooms. The beds were actually on the high end of the comfy scale. However (and to us it was a big one), there is a construction site across the street from the back side of the hotel. The rooms without a lake view look onto the site. The noise was pretty loud in our room on the back side. After discovering that the construction crew starts work at 7am on Saturday mornings, we requested to change rooms to the front side of the hotel. After some attitude from the staff who told us the noise was not the hotel's fault (duh), we were moved to a room on the side where the noise was still pretty bad on Monday morning. For $189 / night, I certainly expect better.

<Content>Great place to stay in Seattle! We stayed at the Marriott Courtyard at Lake Union for 3 nights in July, 2005. Great location! Walking distance to the Space Needle and other attractions. Close to several restaurants and across the street from Lake Union. Our room had a great view of the lake. The Courtyard has a wonderful FREE shuttle service to places like the Needle, Pike Place Market, the Convention Center, etc. We utilized this service every day. Parking just went up to $15/day but is still cheaper than downtown. Everyone at the Courtyard was very helpful and friendly. Very clean, well-kept property. The room (including the carpet) was spotless! Overall excellent value for Seattle area. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Awesome Experience!!! My family and I stayed at this property in June. Everthing was great. The staff in the restaurant was so kind and helpful with local activities to do. Food was great also. Hotel has a clean and new look. Must have had a recent renovation. Only thing that could have been better was the weather. But hey, it's Seattle!!!

<Content>Fun escape from home I really liked a lot of aspects of this hotel, I want to give it a higher recommendation but I can't. I absolutely hated the beds, never have slept in a less comfortable bed in a hotel/motel. I did ask to see if we were in one of the remodeled rooms and the person at the front desk said the remodeling was complete so I guess these are the new beds. They are very soft and you fall off and wake up with back pain.It's really too bad because we thought the whole staff was exceptionally friendly and pleasant. From our waiter at the buffet in the morning to our shuttle driver, everyone was so accomodating. Enjoyed the breakfast quite a bit. The free shuttle was handy as well.Pool and hot tub were decent and enjoyable. Thought that the internet access was pretty good. Free wi-fi, $10.00 for 24hours web tv or a business pc located downstairs that you could rent.There wasn't a mini-bar or minifridge but there was a very clever little store located in the lobby. They sold toiletries and drinks and snacks, all sorts of things, better prices than most minibars and a much better selection. The best part is it's open 24 hours a day, which is nice because there aren't any real stores that are close.Pay-per-view movie selection seemed better than most and not too expensive. I definitely had a fun time, I just didn't sleep well.

<Content>Excellent all around Stayed for 4 days over Memorial Day weekend, and thought the hotel was terrific in many ways:1. They have a free shuttle to downtown areas, such as Pike's Market. It runs every 30 minutes, was always on time, and it was a great service.2. Rooms were great...somebody in 2004 wrote a review saying the rooms were drab. This was not at all the case when we were there. I heard that the hotel was recently remodelled, so this might explain it.3. The common areas of the hotel are very nice, too. Great equipment in the fitness room, a nice, roomy lobby with free apples and coffee in the morning, cookies in the afternoon.4. Staff was responsive and friendly.5. Free internet access in rooms.Overall, an excellent value. I'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>A Great Seattle Hotel I recently had a wonderful stay at the Courtyard on Lake Union and was impressed with the convenient location and views of Lake Union and downtown Seattle. I used the free shuttle to go to the Seattle Center and the Experience Music Project and to Pike Place Market and it was very easy to get around town--they also stop at several other locations. Be sure to ask at the Front Desk for suggestion on where to visit--everyone was very friendly and make your reservations for the Shuttle--it runs 7-11 pm daily. The rooms have been recently upgraded ---everything was very clean and new--including the carpet! One of the best things about the Courtyard is the free Internet in the rooms, which is very easy to use--no complicated set up.  The hotel has a great restaurant that looks out over Lake Union and is open for breakfast and dinner. The breakfast buffet is extensive and very good--you can even make your own waffles. You can have dinner in the restaurant and watch the lights on Lake Union or in the lounge next to the fireplace. The food quality and selection were very good, especially the Calamari and Salmon Caesar Salad. The restaurant and bar staff were very friendly and helpful with suggestions, the drinks were good and the atmosphere was cozy and comfortable.  All in all a great place to stay with its convenient location and free Internet at a reasonable price. I plan to stay there again on my next visit to Seattle.

<Content>Very pleasant I stayed here on business for 6 nights in January 2005. The hotel is undergoing refurbishment which did not disturb me at all during the stay.I was given a newly refurbished room, on the top floor, overlooking the lake. The room was very clean and had a big desk and chair, a storage chest as well as a wardrobe and also a sofa and coffee table.The bed was extremely comfortable (brand new) and I also appreciated the complimentary TV guide in the room (useful for when watching TV during the night - thanks to the jetlag!). The bathroom was small but again new and clean with a bath and shower attachment with good water pressure and a WC. The washbasin was actually outside the bathroom in a small vanity unit opposite the wardrobe (the dressing area as I referred to it!) and also had a coffee making machine.Room cleaning was thorough and items I sent to be laundered were returned promptly and neatly pressed. There is also a laundry room on the first floor of the hotel with wachine machine and tumble dryer facilities.The hotel has an adequate (if a little sweaty) gym on the 1st floor and also a swimming pool and jacuzzi on the ground floor. I found time to try out the gym but unfortunately not the pool!The hotel has a restaurant which is open for breakfast - a good buffet selection (hot food and waffles as well as a cold selection), and then serves room service/bar menu in the evenings. I ordered room service one night and the food was adequate although a little cold, and we had food in the bar one night which was fine although nothing special.The bar is dark but comfortable and has an adjoining sofa area next to a fire which is very nice. All staff I encountered were friendly and polite, especially Michael on reception who ensured that my colleague and I received the nicest rooms possible after our long journey.There is a small shop next to reception selling souvenirs, sweets, crisps, drinks, paper and books.Free coffee (starbucks) is also available with paper cups in reception every morning, and cookies in reception in the evenings (very soft, chewy and yummy!)The hotel also offers a free shuttle service to 5 locations in Seattle which is fantastic!Space Needle is a 20 minute walk away but I would recommend a taxi or the shuttle as it is not an easy walk and involves crossing madly busy highways!!The only downsides would be (in my opinion) the location in terms of what's around - there wasn't an obvious supermarket or store nearby and although there were a number of restaurants within walking distance they were on the whole more pricey - so a diner or deli would have been perfect - obviously this is not the fault of the hotel!The hotel is a pleasant 30 minute walk from Fremont which is a lovely quaint area full of nice shops and restaurants - I particularly recommend PCC wholefoods which has a fab selection of hot and cold foods as well as groceries and drinks, and baja fresh for fresh,, healthy mexican foods.For teas and coffees, Peet's would be my recommendation!I would certainly stay here again and would recommend this hotel as a mid-range hotel suitable for families or business travellers.

<Content>Bed was disappointing The hotel was attractive and the staff was professional and friendly when I was there. The room was large and quiet. However, I found the bed surprisingly soft and had a sore back after my two day stay. Since I stay at hotels for a good night's sleep and not the frills, I found it disappointing.

<Content>A solid 2 1/2 * Stayed there in March 2004 on a business trip. Very friendly staff. In the lobby, there were Starbucks Coffee and apples in the morning, and cookies in the evening, a nice gesture by the hotel. Parking was $10/night. The furnishing in the room was dated and bland. Hotel provided free shuttle to downtown and Space Needle. Overall a tolerable experience.
