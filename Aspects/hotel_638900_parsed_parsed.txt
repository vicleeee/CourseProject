<Content>Cleaned out Hotel was in good area for us. Room was clean and very nice. But we went down to the front desk the next morning to get a paper and something to drink and to get info at front desk. While we were there (about 30 min.) the housekeeping came in and cleaned.We decided what we were going to do,went back to room to get our things. Not only did they clean our room, they cleaned out my purse. Merry Christmas, manager said he was going to do something not sure he did anything. All I got was I'm sorry, and you do know there is a safe in your room. Yes but I should not have to put my purse in a safe just to go down stairs. We never seen housekeeping the 3 days we were there.

<Content>Awesome service!!!!!!! This is my second time staying at the Hilton on St. Charles. It is the best hotel in the entire city. It is close to the French Quarter and all the attractions. Upon check in, I was greeted with the bellman asking to help me with my luggage and then he escorted me to the front desk. The lobby was beautiful. At check in, the front desk agents were funny and very personable. Best check in ever. When I go to my room, I had 2 beds for my friends and I. The room was spacious. I ate at the restaurant called Luke. It was great and waiters were fun. The hotel has a pool and hot tub. They even offer Kiosk check in and check out. My room was always being cleaned by housekeeping staff. She/he did great. Overall, my stay at Hilton was awesome. The service is great and the front desk agents really enjoy there jobs.

<Content>Excellent with perfect location This hotel is an excellent choice for those wanting to be in close proximity to the French Quarter who also want a little peace and quiet. Hilton St. Charles is located 3 very short blocks from Canal and Royal (start of the Quarter), 1 block down from Bourbon. The walk to Canal is negligible as is a walk all the way to the other side of the Quarter at Esplanade (NOLA is flat). The St. Charles St. streetcar stops right out side and it will take you out to Tulane to the west and Esplanade to the east for a mere $1.25 + $0.25 transfer.The hotel itself is a mix of traditional and modern boutique. The staff are friendly and helpful, beds are great and some of the rooms (try and get a corner one) are HUGE. The adjacent restaurant, Luke, is excellent and fairly reasonable. People have complained about streetcar noise, which is nonsense even from the second floor right on St. Charles. Other complaints are directed at the smell of the place. Also nonsense. No complaints of any sort from me.FInally, this location in the Central Business District is apparently completely safe. It' not far enough off the beaten track to be of any concern at all.Try and get this gem from Hotwire and you will get what is very likely the single best hotel deal in the United States. I'm serious...

<Content>Beautiful! I booked this room off of their website - thinking I was booking the Hilton-Garden Inn. It was the best mistake I've made in awhile.We went on an off weekend and paid a pre-paid price of $137/night for a king suite. I didn't have high expectations, and didn't realize we had booked the wrong Hilton until we arrived.Needless to say, we were elated and impressed. The room was very large -- almost the size of a small effenciency apartment. The bathroom was updated and spacious with a large jacuzzi tub and a separate glass shower - both big enough for two!You walk into a Living Room type area with a TV, desk and sofa, then into the bedroom - that actually has sliding pocket doors to separate it from the Living Room. A large King Size bed, small closet and TV are in the bedroom.The hotel was a Masonic Lodge and has wonderful history and architectural detail.The location of the hotel is walking distance to Canal St and the French Quarter. A streetcar also is available with a corner pick up.I recommend this highly as a hotel to stay.

<Content>Nice Dowtown Hotel Took a family trip to NOLA and Hotwired the Hilton at about $58/night. The hotel was well worth the price. Our room wasn't ready until 4:00pm (the listed check-in time) because the hotel sold out at the last minute due to a fire at a nearby hotel. They were very accomodating with our mass of luggage. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had some bathroom issues at 6:00am and had someone up in minutes to fix the issue. We received a handicap accessible room, so I can't really comment on the size or layout of a standard room, but ours was about as expected. Not huge, not small. It was very clean and nicely decorated with very comfortable beds. The pool/spa area was very nice and seemed to be upkept very well.My main complaint with hotels like this are the charges for inroom internet access.

<Content>Something doesn't smell right... This hotel is a historic building with interesting character. Looks like Hilton renovated it in the past couple of years when they bought the property so the design of the rooms is nice - albeit small. Because it's old, I don't expect super large rooms. They had nice Crabtree  Evelyn toiletries, and relatively new linens. The problem here is with humidity. I come from Houston so I'm not unreasonable in my expectations around this - after all it is July on the gulf coast. However, I felt like I was swimming through the air in my room. There was a musty smell upon entering my room that stayed with me the whole time I was there. Despite everything being relatively new, it is aging fast...When I checked out, the clerk told me they have problems with the musty smell all over the hotel. Seems that the mix of the stone walls and air conditioning cause the building to sweat a lot. Hilton needs to invest in some serious de-humidifier equipment - and fast.I'm trying something else next time.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel Close to french Quarter My buddies and I went to New Orleans in April 2008. It was their first trip there. We really were not looking for a super fancy hotel, but got a great rate on this one. We were 5 guys sharing a 2 queen bedroom. They gave us an extra bed for nominal fee. The room was small but very very nice. Clean sheets and very friendly staff to cater to all our needs. Front desk was helpful in directing us to places to eat and to hang out at. Cleaning staff was very attentive. Nice charming hotel. Everything was working perfectly fine. The replenished towels often. Only thing I did not like about the place was the pool, which is in the basement. It is indoor and very hot there. They have a spa- which was working- pool was not. It is 5-8 min walk to French Quarter. They have greek deli next door- cheap good. Parking for 15/day available(this is cheap in New Orleans) bang opposite hotel.Pros: staff, cleanliness, close to french quarter, parking oppositeCons: poolWould definately recommend for people who like to stay close to quarter but still enjoy peace and quiet.

<Content>Not up to Hilton standards but great staff. If you have business downtown, this is a good choice location-wise though far from the only one. You can walk to the casino and Riverwalk in about 10 minutes, a matter of only five or six blocks. This was my first stay at the hotel. I would have given it two stars except for the staff. Every staff member I encountered from the front desk to housekeeping was friendly, smiling and helpful and seemed genuinely happy that you were there. What a nice contrast to most hotel experiences!!! Kudos to this hotel's staff! One other plus is that they have free wifi in the lobby and bar. The bar is quite lively during happy hour and drinks are reasonably priced. The lobby is very pretty and large, a nice place to sit. The hotel is in an old building so you can't expect the rooms to be large but our room was really small, as was the bathroom. There was one tiny window looking out at a rather grim facade of the building next door. Likewise, when in New Orleans you expect a bit of mustiness but our room was really musty. It also was not particularly clean. On the plus side, it was quiet and the bed was comfortable. I don't expect the Ritz when I stay at a Hilton but I do expect a bit more than his property provided. I think this property needs a bit of attention. I don't think I would stay there again based on this experience, particularly when there are so many other choices in the very immediate vicinity.

<Content>Nice decor but musty I stayed at the Hilton for 7 days in early Apr 08 for business with 3 of my co-workers. Each of us had our own room and 3 of the 4 rooms had a wet, musty feel and smell that never left even after talking to the front desk and having the carpets cleaned. The service was good and the staff was friendly. I would have liked free wireless in the lobby and restaurant and I missed a lobby bar where friends or co-workers could gather at the end of the day.The location was good but there are so many hotels in that area to choose from that I wouldn't recommend this one. We were in New Orleans for 12 days and were able to switch hotels to the W in the French Quarter for the final 5 days. We were much happier there.

<Content>Nice hotel but no pool! My husband and I brought our 10  11 year old sons on this trip, and the only problem with this hotel was that their pool was out of commission. No one told us about this before we arrived, or I would have booked another hotel. The manager apologized, but basically told me that I would have to take the matter up with Travelocity. My kids (of course) complained continuously about not being able to swim. Other then this problem, the hotel was very nice, reasonably priced and a short walk to the French Quarter, Superdome, street car stops and riverfront. Their parking is a bit expensive ($29 per night), and as it turns out, we didn't really need a car at all.

<Content>a bit of a bad start, then all was well... we went to see the french quarter festival, and met 4 other couples...troubles with american airlines cost us one night (prepaid) at the hotel. we called to confirm our day late arrival, and to confirm our king bed request. we were told we could not get credit for the missed night, but our king bed, etc. would be waiting for us the morning after we were to arrive.got there 8am...(nightmare flights because of american's shut down) from palm springs to seattle, to atlanta to new orleans...no king bed...twins....after a bit of yelling at the manager, reminding him that we were one of 5 couples staying at the hotel, our requests were granted...we flew alaska and delta to get there...lost our luggage...retrieved at hotel at 3pm...pretty hotel....lovely stay...fabulous music....and the hotel's restaurant, LUKE, is worthy of it's very high rating. delicious (a bit pricey) but terrific.

<Content>Nice accomodations near all! We found the Hilton to be a really great stay for our recent visit. I am fairly picky about hotels and was impressed with this property. It was incredibly clean and quite and the location was great. Not right in the heart of things but close enought to everything! OUr room was a good size and had everything we needed. The staff (with one exception) was really nice and helpful. We did have trouble when we checked out. The desk agent was not very helpful or friendly (it was Sunday morning and she was clearly feeling the pain from saturday night) but evern that was not a real problem.

<Content>Pretty hotel but some disappointments We were booked here for a conference in March 2008. The location is okay, about 2 1/2 blocks across Canal Street from the French Quarter. The hotel is very pretty and service is pleasant. The swimming pool is small but clean, and the fitness center is also very clean. We found the restaurant to have good food at high prices but were disappointed in the service -- it was difficult to get waiter attention to get coffee, then to get the cream, then to get the coffee refill. The most disappointing aspect was the lack of free wireless in the room. The options were wired internet in the room at 49 cents per minute, wireless in the lobby at 49 cents per minute, or internet access in the business center at ... 49 cents per minute. Especially because we were traveling for business, it was frustrating to be unable to log on and check e-mail, do work, etc. without paying such high fees up front. I would consider this hotel for leisure, if other options were booked and the price was good, but I would do my best to avoid it for business travel. Next time for business or leisure I think I'll go back to Le Pavilion.

<Content>Awful Customer Service The prices for grand stand access kept changing. I inquired the assistant GM for the price at that moment. She said she didn't know.I went to ask the hotel desk and explained that I had several negative experiences with the Assistant GM (Raquel). Raquel then came out and yelled, screamed, and ordered me to sit down in front of staff and other guests. Her staff led her away. They then explained that she often yells at staff and guests. Then the GM came out and said he'd investigate, but assumed I must have done something to set her off.I explained I didn't, but encouraged him to investigate and let him know that I would call corporate. After 4 calls with corporate they said they that Raquel refused to send a letter of apology which is all that I asked for. They then explained that calling in the future would not be beneficial to which I responded that I would be notifying the Better Business Bureau.I did not want a refund. I did not want any points or free stays. I simply want a letter of apology directly from Raquel.

<Content>Great Service at the Hilton New Orleans St. Charles The Hilton New Orleans St. Charles was a great hotel. I was in town for a conference and could not have asked for a better hotel. I loved the turndown service and chocolates left on my bed. The staff was very helpful for finding activities for my free time and directions to get there. My room was spacious and clean. Thank you for a great stay!

<Content>Only if the price is right Hilton New Orleans / St Charles Ave. is the Hilton Corporation's latest high-end offering in New Orleans, having just opened in Spring of 2007. The hotel is actually a refurb of the former Hotel Monaco that never reopened after Katrina. My wife and I spent 2 nights here during Mardi Gras 2008. We got a great rate ($119/night) by booking a full year in advance (our rate was so good that management actually sent us a letter that complained about us booking before they were ready. They honored the rate anyway, but this was pretty low class for a major hotel chain, especially for a customer who has Diamond status in their loyalty program.)Location: This is the Hilton's main selling point. You are about 5 blocks to the Riverwalk. 4 blocks to Harrah's. 7-8 blocks to the Convention Center. 6 blocks to the Superdome. 4 blocks to the French Quarter. You get the picture: this is a very centrally located hotel. Plus for Mardi Gras fans, every parade in the City passes directly in front of the hotel.Rooms: The building that houses the hotel was originally built in 1926. When the conversion was done, clearly the emphasis was on quantity of rooms rather than size because the rooms and bathrooms are small (definitely not any larger than those at the Hampton Inn a block away). The Hilton has largely retained the Monaco's conversion, right down to room configuration and certain furnishings. The rooms lack any of the modern amenities that you generally expect at new, high-end hotels such as plasma TVs and ergonomic desk chairs. The furnishings are nice, not overly worn, but clearly not what I expected for a hotel with a $250/night rack rate.Service: Marginal at best. The maid threw a couple of towels at us on Saturday morning, but never returned to make the beds or remove the used towels. The hotel's snack pantry lacks even the selection you would find at a mid-level hotel such as Staybridge Suites. The bell desk WAS helpful and efficient on Sunday morning.Honors Recognition: Never once during my stay was I recognized as a Diamond Hilton Honors member. Nor was I ever offered access to the Executive lounge or any of the other benefits I am generally entitled to.Other Amenities: During Mardi Gras, the hotel sets up its own viewing platform in front of the hotel for hotel guests only. Tickets for Friday night were $50/person and $75 for all day Saturday. We didn't take advantage, preferring to try our luck on the streets. The stands offered by the City of New Orleans can be had in the $20/person range if you book in advance.Overall, I'd say the Hilton New Orleans / St Charles Ave. is pretty average. We'd return again for the right price but definitely would first consider some of the other high-end hotels in New Orleans such as the W.

<Content>Lovely building, lousy hotel The Hilton St. Charles is the newest Hilton property in New Orleans... but you wouldn't know it from a visit. Located in a renovated historic building a few blocks from the French Quarter, the lobby does boast impressive marble walls and brass-decorated elevators. But don't get used to this level of opulence.The double room we booked for a business trip was decent in size, but already looked well-worn less than a year after the hotel's opening. The floors were uneven, the tub was dingy, and the light switch in the bathroom wouldn't always stay on. The room was reasonably clean, though we found an odd assortment of towels (no bath towels, too many bathmats) at check-in and struggled with housekeeping to correct this issue. We also had a long wait (almost an hour) for the delivery of toilet paper after a request was made. The hotel's biggest disappointment is in the Executive Lounge. As a Hilton Gold member, I have visited many properties and enjoyed the exclusive lounge offered for frequent travelers. I look forward to continental breakfasts, concierge services, happy hours, snacks, and a place to relax. The Hilton St. Charles has an open nook that serves as the lounge, which is unadvertised on hotel signs and not adequately staffed or stocked. The boasted Skyview Terrace was continuously closed during our stay, and hotel signs listed it on a different floor than it actually exists.At check-out, I reported my experience to hotel staff, and they seemed genuinely surprised. I hope that this new property improves its offerings, and brings it up to the standards expected of a Hilton.

<Content>Pass on this Hilton The only good thing about St Charles Ave is that it's not terribly far from the French Quarter or Harrahs. We spent Fri-Mon and during our entire stay there was scaffolding work outside the entrance and we had to walk in the street with traffic just to get anywhere. Unless we took a bath before 7AM there was no hot water. The desk said it was an engineering problem but maintenance came by and said to let it run...after 15 minutes it was luke-warm at best. King room was very small and the window rattled all night and was so drafty that we had to keep the heater on 76 just to stay warm. Valet parking was $30 a day or you're left to hunt a spot in the street which took 20-30 minutes of driving around. We wanted to pay cash for our bill but the desk didn't have change so they took up a collection from the bellhops/doormen so we could get our change. Save yourself some trouble and find another hotel...we will...

<Content>Ugh - Avoid! Better places to be found in the same area! Maybe this hotel was once a nice place to stay... back in the 1960's! It's old and it shows. From the dreary drapes to the clean but worn out bathrooms. It's an embarassment to the Hilton name, IMO. It may be cheaper, but really, for $10-$30/night more you can find a much better place to stay and still be close(if not closer) to Bourbon Street.

<Content>Great hotel if it weren't for the bed bugs... When we checked into the room we were pleased that although a little small it was very clean and had everything we needed for our one night stay. As we were getting into bed at around 11:00 we noticed a small bug crawling across the sheets. We pulled back the sheets and found at least 5 more bugs. When we contacted the desk they offered another room. So we started to move there only to find bugs in that bed as well. We were offered at total of 4 other rooms on three different floors and found at least one bug in every bed. The manager called another hotel for us and we lugged all of our stuff there at around midnight. Not the way we wanted to spend our night... This is the first time we have ever asked any hotel to find another room for us. By the way there was no offer of any compensation of any kind for us. I hope that they will at least refund our pre-payment as they promised. They at least need to get to work solving their hotel-wide bug problem.

<Content>Hit  I've stayed at the Hilton St Charles many times over the past summer on business trips. The first few trips were nice with a nice size room but lately each one has gotten worse and I don't stay there any more. In fact the Ritz has a better price now than the Hilton. I actually checked out this morning 9/25 and have a room at the ritz for the rest of the week. The room I received the last few times has been too tiny to accomodate the furnishings and smells musty and everything seems damp in the room; the a/c must not be able to remove the humidity. They don't have adequate staff to manage this hotel. Don't chance it -go somewhere else.

<Content>Excellent Hotel on the edge of the Quarter The Hilton St Charles Ave is fantastic. It is literally a block away from the Quarter, in a lovely area which is close enough to walk to the hustle and bustle, but far enough away to escape the noise!The rooms were well sized (we had a deluxe Hilton room) and well appointed. The staff were excellent and the basement swimming pool a great way to relax in the afternoon after a hard morning walking around the French Quarter.The Hilton Breakfast was very good, although I personally preferred to skip it and head to Cafe du Monde for coffee in the Quarter.The restaurant in the hotel was also very good, the hype is all true. I was very impressed.If you're looking for somewhere to stay in New Orleans, give the Hilton St Charles some thought. The decor and design of the hotel is very impressive when you walk in, and the rooms maintain this high quality throughout.

<Content>Not at all the same We stayed at the Hilton Saint Charles for three days in August. I stayed at this hotel when it was the Monaco many times, and never had a bad experience. It all began with check-in. We were to have early check-in to a suite. However when we got there they had no rooms for us, and we had to wait a couple of hours. We asked them to store our bags, and they did so by giving us the combination to the storage room. Four hours later a room was ready for us, but it definitely was not what we were promised. We finally were assigned a suite, and when we got there they were still cleaning the room!! There was a piece of garbage on the floor, and it was STILL there when we checked out (yes, it was in the middle of the floor in a very obvious place!). The water was NEVER cold (at best you could still make a cup of hot tea), which I think is a requirement in New Orleans in August. The concierge staff was very poorly informed, and I wondered if they had ever even left the hotel and explored the city. We asked for the nearest coffee shop one morning and were told that there was none? (Just as a point of reference, go out the door, make a left when you are standing at the corner look diagonal to you and there is a CiCi鈥檚. The best coffee you will find.) On the first night we ordered room service, we had 陆 of a sandwich left and fries. When we returned the following day the food was gone, but the plate/ tray/ dirty glasses were still there. For the rest of the trip we looked at that plate, in hopes that someone would realize that it should be sent somewhere. The furnishings in the rooms are the same as the ones from the Monaco, however they attempted (poorly) to make it look more plantation instead of fresh. All in all, I won鈥檛 be staying here again, nor will I recommend the Hilton Saint Charles to anyone. I hope that this is just a growing pain that they are experiencing, but I wont be back to see.

<Content>An old hotel/building an it shows One word: Yuck. I stayed at both the Riverside Hilton and the St Charles Hilton while on business. The Riverside was far superior in terms of service, room and location. Check in at St Charles was a bit strange as the desk clerk had no idea what Hilton Honors was beyond the fact that it exists -- room upgrades are not provided to Diamond members. The room itself was very small with not much left over after a desk, bed and armoire were crammed in. The worst part was the smell -- the room smelled of a moldly, damp cabin.Bottom Line: There is a far better option in terms of Hilton near the French Quarter. Avoid St Charles.

<Content>Not Recommended Although this hotel was recently renovated and looks like a four star hotel, the service and amenities are significantly inferior. Several times during our stay, we heard the excuse  We have only been open a month. This appeared to be the standard answer to all problems. If you feel compelled to stay at this hotel, I suggest visiting only after enough time has gone by (nine months to one year) and they can no longer use this as an excuse for poor service. The food on the Conceirge/Executive Level was horrible, stale and spoiled if they put any food out at all. They served prepackaged muffins that had expiration dates of May 1 , 2007 (I stayed at the hotel during 4th of July)...if staying on the Executive Level, you may have breakfast served or you may not - but don't rely on it. - not even coffee..the fitness center looks great, but only two of the cardio machines can actually be plugged in...then again, they've have only been open a month.In addition to the inferior service, the hotel charged me for my entire stay in advance, even though I was only informed that a deposit would be charged. My guess is that they have had guests check out early and this was their attempt to prevent that from occurring again. I certainly would have gladly repacked the next day and check-in o any of the other hotels close by if I had not already been charged in advance.I booked the room through the hotel reservation line for one rate and received a confirmation for my stay; however, when I arrived at the hotel, the room rate had increased by an additional $30! per night. Thankfully, I still have my email confirmation, so protesting the additional charges should not take much time...but I should not have to deal with this inconvenience.I travel often for work (usually 30 weeks per year) and would not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>It is the Flower of St. Charles Had never heard of this hotel, but was pleasantly surprised to find it looking great. Lobby is inviting, personnel helpful, lovely ambience, cannot say enough about the accomodations..I would definitely stay there again now that I know about it.The only thing I would change is the hot water in the bathroom, it didn't get hot enough.
