<Content>The Hotel Alessandra is wonderful Following a very busy three weeks travelling round Italy and cruising the Meditteranean it was lovely to spend a couple of relaxing days in Florence at the Hotel Alessanda.The hotel is a very short taxi ride from the train station.Be warned, there is not lift from the ground floor so you have to lug your bags up the first flight of stairs. However, it is worth it.We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite which was huge and included a sitting room, large bedroom and bathroom and balcony with a lovely view of the Arno. Everything was very well kept and clean, and there were all mod cons.Andrea and his staff were very friendly and happy to assist no matter what the request.The breakfast was simple but lovely with good coffee.The location is excellent. Just a short walk from all major sights including the Ponte Vecchio and the Duomo. It is also just round the corner from the 'Little Pig' markets (where we managed to find some good bargins!). This is a fantastic city. A must-see on any trip to Italy.Despite being late Autumn we were so very lucky with the weather. It was glorious. Just right for sightseeing.It was truly a memorable visit and we'll certainly stay at the Hotel Alessanda again if we ever return to Florence (fingers crossed!).Thank you Andrea and team!!Lynne and Brian, Canberra, Australia

<Content>Clean, comfortable, and central My wife and I spent two nights at Hotel Alessandra in November and really enjoyed our time there. My favorite thing about it was its central location. It was an easy walk to almost all of the items on our to-do list - the Uffizi, the Arno, Duomo, and the many churches we visited. Coming out of the quiet ally of the hotel, you will find yourself on a busy street with shops, leather stands, and eateries. Great locale for people watching while sipping a cafe, eating pizza, or enjoying the gelato. We stumbled upon several restaurants along the back alleys near the hotel as well. Don't miss this great little wine shop across the street from the hotel (I forget the name right now), but we enjoyed a mid afternoon of wine, meats, and cheeses. Not to mention their truffle honey!! Great location, very nice and accommodating staff, and a comfortable stay.

<Content>Alessandra is a Charmer! Six from my family had the pleasure of staying two wonderful nights at the Hotel Alessandra and it couldn't have been more perfect. The location simply couldn't be better but, more than that, Andrea and his Mom were so very accommodating to us. The charm of this gem is extremely appealing and I highly recommend it to anyone planning a visit to Florence.My thanks to the entire staff for a truly memorable stay.Penny PalmerBethel, CTUSA

<Content>Great central hotel I stayed in Hotel Alessandra for 3 nights in May 2008 and loved it. Florence is a beautiful city and the hotel is ideally located for exploring it. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful, recommending places to visit and restaurants. The room was quite spacious and spotless. Only down side was the steps to get to the lift! I would definitely recommend it and would stay there again.

<Content>I'll stay there next time I'm in Florence My husband and I were very happy with Hotel Alessandra. The people at the desk were so friendly and helpful and the breakfast was very good. Our room was nice with a beautiful view of the Arno River. The thing we liked most about Hotel Alessandra was its location. It is in a perfect spot for walking all around the old part of the city, and is close to the river. We walked from the hotel to all the sights that we wanted to see, even to the train station when it was time to leave. The hotel is on a quiet street, and has a nice and affordable restaurant just a few doors up.It was a great experience staying at Hotel Alessandra and we will definately stay again if we are lucky enough to go back to Florence.

<Content>Loved the Alessandra My friend and I stayed 8 days at the Hotel Alessandra in Florence. The hotel room was big and beautiful, and we had a terrific view of the Arno! The staff was helpful and friendly, and the place was very clean. I loved it, and would stay there again. I can't imagine why it is only listed as a two-star hotel. Should be a three.

<Content>Perfect Location The good: fantastic location - easy walk to everything. Never needed a cab. Nice, efficient staff. Friendly and accommodating. Very ample room and bath. Spotless.The not-so-good: Walking up a couple of flights with heavy bags to get to the entrance. Unpleasant odor in the room. (Later we discovered the same odor throughout the city from time to time, so it must be something the hotel could not control).

<Content>Best Service Hotel Alessandra has a good location in the heart of things as well as the most accommodating staff that I encountered in Tuscany. Monti is cheerful, warm, and welcoming. I had an interesting conversation with Andrea about a student protest. And he arranged for me to attend a cooking class, which was a fun experience. My flight home required a 5:00 am taxi to the airport. Because of the hour, the bellman waited with me downstairs. I did not expect this, but was grateful. Also, I have a gluten sensitivity, and was concerned that I would not be able to eat anything on the breakfast buffet. This was not a problem. Hotel Alessandra is a good value, and I would stay there again.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in Florence This hotel is a beautiful family run hotel. The reception staff are very friendly and knowledgable regarding Florence. They gave us some fantastic recommendations for local resturants. The hotel is an older hotel, however the charm of the area, staff and service make up for this. We had an absolutely delightful lady who served us breakfast everyday and Monty who worked on reception was fantastic. I would highly recommend staying here.

<Content>Hotel Alessandra in Florence is TOPS! Delightful, sophisticated hotel right in the artistic heart of Florence. Just a block to Ponte Vecchio and the Uffizi. Spacious, tasteful rooms in a historic building. English-speaking staff very friendly and helpful. Excellent breakfast. When we return to Florence (soon, I hope!), this will be our first-choice hotel.

<Content>I would like to return for a long weekend Enjoyable 3 night stay in September 2008, The Alessandra had everything we needed. Quiet/central location and within walking distance of everything which makes arrival and departure easy (you can even leave your luggage after you have checked out at no charge). Good local restaurants/trattorias within short strolling distance. Breakfast was good and plentiful each morning, croissants, cereals, juices, yogurt, meat and cheese, etc.The rooms were very nice with large bathrooms.All the front desk staff were professional and always friendly. Making oneself understood in English (or French) was of no problem. I will gladly stay here on my next trip!

<Content>Once again with Alessandra Once again we stayed at the Hotel Alessandra in Florence, I think this is the fifth time now, but who's counting. We first stayed over ten years ago when we knew nothing about it except the location, - it was probably our second or third choice. We got a delightful family room with our two sons (now grown up) and realized that we had stumbled across a gem - for its friendliness (not just Alessandra and her son Andrea, but all their staff), its location (a two-minute stroll to the Ponte Vecchio), its atmosphere (modernized interiors but still a genuine renaissance building), and its comfort. There are a variety of rooms, each one is unique. Almost all of them are spacious for a European hotel and the bathrooms are well-fitted and spotless. The only drawback is the twenty or so steps before the lift, slightly daunting with very heavy luggage.Yes, Florence is getting a bit crowded, especially in summer, but it is still one of the world's greatest cities. Walk to San Miniato and take in the view, go to the Uffizi an hour before closing to avoid the queues, (if an hour's not enough go again). Santa Maria Novella contains almost an entire history of renaissance fresco painting (though for Giotto you should go to San Croce), ask for a free tour. Tired of history? There is still all that shopping and eating and drinking. Exhausted? It's nice to be staying at a comfortable hotel right in the center.

<Content>location is perfect,friendly people At first we were a bit confused as to walk up to the small elevator.There was a light out and the stairway was dim.We left our bags downstairs and not knowing how to operateand obtain the elevator . We walked all the way up and found the hotel desk. The staff here is very friendly and helpful. Fantasticlocation.The staff informed us on the workings of the elevator whichis small(one person and luggage at a time) but functional.The room was nicer then usual, for a two star Italian hotel.The common areas had artifacts and were nicely decorated.The breakfast room was nice.My only concern was carrying our luggage a flight of stairsto and from the elevator floor in the dim light.

<Content>Centrally located and helpful staff The hotel is ideally placed within walking distance of the Uffizi Museum, Ponte Vecchio and the shopping area. Andrea pre booked our Museum tickets in advance and was always on hand to assist us, with restaurant recommendations and directions. Nothing was ever too much trouble.

<Content>Living large in Florence My husband and I spent one night here on November 24. The hotel is located on a narrow, quiet street in a nice part of town, about a block from the river. The room we had was HUGE! We had a large bed (king?), vanity, seating area, armoire, dresser, and an equally well-equipped bathroom. The owners (Andrea and his mother) are wonderful hosts. They make you feel right at home. Breakfast is a buffet, served in a spacious morning room. After a week of roman continental breakfasts, it was a delight to eat granola, yogurt, and buttery toast. The building was built in the 1400s and the main Florence sites are all nearby. It took us about 15 minutes to walk from the train station (with 2 wheeled bags) and Saturday morning shoppers. It's a great base to explore the city.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Alessandra! The Hotel Alessandra was one of the best parts of our trip to Florence. The staff was friendly, helpful and efficient. Everyone spoke English. The room was just what I had imagined a hotel room in Italy would look like - comfortable, charming, clean, with a aged Renaissance feel to it. The location couldn't be more perfect - central to the main sites - a block from the Ufizzi Gallery and close to shopping and great restaurants. We left a coat there with keys in the pocket and the staff very graciously mailed it back to us in Canada. I highly recommend this Hotel.

<Content>Relaxing stay! A very nice hotel! My wife and I stayed in the hotel for 5 days. The room was very tidy and clean. The entire staff was very kind and helpful in every way. Andrea was very friendly and helpful when we were seeking information about the MotoGP race in the neighboring town. Myself and my wife would highly recommend Hotel Alessandra and when we make are way back to Florence we already know where we will be staying!

<Content>Best hotel in Florence! I stayed at the Alessandra with my three friends in October, and . the hotel is just a delight鈥攖he location is perfect (one block from the Ponte Vecchio!), the rooms are spacious and well furnished, they provide a good breakfast, I was able to access my emails on their computer. Best of all, they were all so very helpful to a lot of first-timers in Florence. The restaurants they directed us to were all wonderful, and we really appreciated the maps and the great directions they gave us. I am not sure how they manage to do all that they do at such a reasonable price. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Great place to stay in Florence Very comfortable room with a plentiful breakfast buffet. The staff were very helpful, we especially had fun with the gentleman at the front desk. The location was off the main streets, but a quick walk to many sights and shopping. We easily walked back and forth with luggage from the train station. One downside is the flight of stairs that you need to ascend prior to the very small elevator, but after eating in Italy, we enjoyed the exercise!!

<Content>Thoughtful service I had a wonderful stay twice in October 2008 at Hotel Alessandra . My first night in Florence was spent in a lovely quiet room #6 away from the reception desk and elevators...giving me some rest after the long flight. Originally I had booked a room w/out bath but changed to one w/bath at the thoughtful suggestion of the desk clerk who was so helpful and personable. My second stay was at the end of my trip after a long week cooking class in Lucca and hiking Cinque Terre. My 2 friends and I stayed in the Bacio Suite which was spacious, airy and had a huge bathroom! We had a lovely view of the ARNO river and the St. Apostoli bell tower (which was NOT a problem). The breakfast was substantial enough to get us started on our day. Andrea and her staff were very helpful and friendly. The restaurant recommendations were wonderful and not touristy. I definitely would recommend Hotel Alessandra as it is so centrally located to the shops, Ponte Vecchio, Pitti, Uffizi, train station (10-15 min walk), Duoma, yet it is quiet!

<Content>Great location and wonderful staff at Hotel Alessandra The Gennarini family and their staff were wonderful to work with. They answered all my questions before I even made a confirmed booking - both by Email and by telephone. Check-in was seamless and the staff went out of their way to ensure myself and my three travel companions had accurate information about the museums, art galleries, tours, stores and restaurants in Florence. They made bookings for us at no extra charge and were always courteous and friendly. The hotel is situated conveniently to all sights and their breakfast service made a great start to every day in this beautiful Tuscan city. Thank you Monte, Andrea Gennarini  Senora Gennarini for your fine hospitality. We felt as though we were guests in your home and we look forward to returning again in the future.

<Content>Wonderful! We were totally delighted with this beautifully furnished and extremely clean hotel, with its attention to its long history as well as to the comfort of its guests. Andrea provided us with genuinely welcoming, personal and friendly service during our entire four-day stay (marking locations on maps, recommending restaurants, etc.), and really made it one of our most memorable stays on a trip lasting over six weeks. Our lovely room was a quiet and peaceful retreat close enough to all the sights for us to return to for a rest at any time. We also enjoyed lingering over the generous breakfast in the comfortable dining room. The clip-clop sound of the horse-pulled carriage on the cobblestone street below our open window just added to the romantic atmosphere of this wonderful hotel.We will never forget Hotel Alessandra!

<Content>Good stay in a central location in Florence We just had a very nice stay at the Hotel Alessandra. The hotel is located in a good location for walking to any of the central points in Florence. Very close to the Uffizi and the Ponte Vecchio. The staff are wonderful and very helpful for recommending things to do, arranging museum visits, and arranging visits to activities outside of Florence city center. The hotel is part of a very interesting medieval home. The entrance isn't the greatest, and the elevator is small, but not a big deal. The room is a bit loud if you leave the windows open. The room and hotel itself is older and could use updating, but if you want a good location for a good price with great staff, this is the way to go.

<Content>We loved Hotel Alessandra Our room was spacious and elegant, with a small balcony overlooking the street below. Breakfasts were good; service was excellent, and the location couldn't be more central (between Duomo and Ponte Vecchio)! We asked them to get us tickets to the Accademia prior to our arrival, and they were more than happy to do so. The only drawback was that there are about 30 steps before you reach their elevator, so if you have a heavy bag, you have some work to do.We would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Good, centrally located accommodation My wife and I have just returned from a 4-night break in Florence and were extremely pleased with the Hotel Alessandra. Its location meant it was handy for all the tourist sights, shops and restaurants, and the fact that it was housed on the upper floor of an old palazzo added to our feeling of being right in the historical centre of this justly famous city. Our double room with modern ensuite facilities was very comfortable and we were impressed by the smart and clean ambience of the public rooms. The staff were exceedingly welcoming and helpful, and made our stay at their hotel so much more enjoyable, especially Monti, who was a real character. On the negative side, yes the stairway to the hotel was rather dark and dingy, the single lift miniscule and the breakfasts basically continental, but this did not detract from the good impression overall we received. We hope to return.

<Content>Wonderful stay I would definetly recommend Hotel Alessandra. The staff is most helpful, and so, so friendly. They set up our reservations for museums, recommended restaurants, and arranged an amazing day tour of Pisa, Lucca, and (the best) winery tour.The rooms are clean and bright. The location is excellent, near the Uffizi and other attractions, yet off the beaten path away from crowds.

<Content>Loved the Allesandra This is an excellent hotel, with wonderful staff, in a very good location. had a good sized room with a view of the Duomo. Most of the attractions in Florence are a short walk from the hotel. A small elevator services the second floor hotel, but access is also available by stairs. The breakfast is fairly basic - coffee, toast, cereal, yogurt, juice and served in a clean bright room. We left for a weekend in Cinque Terre and the hotel gladly held our luggage for our return.We would stay there again.

<Content>Everything you could reasonably want A very agreeable small hotel. Nothing fancy, just a comfortable room, a good breakfast, an excellent central position (the Uffizi is barely five minutes walk away), and particularly helpful and well-informed staff. And all very reasonaby priced.Henry Summerson, London, U.K. 8 November 2008.

<Content>Great Location - Great Hospitality Our stay at the Hotel Alessandra was wonderful. The location couldn't have been better because it was on a quiet side street in the historic center. The staff was always happy to help in the most sincere way ! Especially Monte !! Their help with getting into the Uffizzi Gallery and tickets for David was easy and involved no waiting in lines. I will definitely stay at the Hotel Alessandra again.

<Content>Perfect Florence neighborhood hotel. A wonderful experience at Hotel Alessandra this October. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The hotel is located in a very convenient and historic part of Florence. We particularly liked the neighborhood and the very local feel of the hotel. Exactly what we were hoping to find in Florence and we cannot wait to return.

<Content>Great hotel in a great location Hotel Alessandra was a great place to stay in Florence. The staff was always friendly and helpful when you needed something. We asked them to book musuem tickets for us, and they took care of all the details. We had a small room with a private bath, and it was great. The room itself was small, but it was clean and that's what really mattered. Outside our window was the bell tower, which rang every morning, but it wasn't too early, and it really wasn't bothersome. One word of caution, I was there in October, we had the windows open as it was warm, and I got bit by a ton of mosquitos...so keep the windows closed! Other than that, (which of course is not the hotel's fault), it was a great hotel and I would definately recomend it. The location made it so that you could go out in the morning, and easily come back for a rest in between. We would definately stay here on our next trip back to Florence!

<Content>Friendly, helpful staff This hotel provides good value. What impressed me most was the friendly, helpful staff. In such a tourist magnet as Florence, I often find front-line people to be somewhat brusque - understandably so at times. However, the staff in the Hotel Alessandra went out of their way to be courteous and helpful at all times. The location is a bit noisy, though. It's on a narrow street that forms part of a ring around the historic core - probably the old city wall? Ask for a room with a view of the river and bell tower. It's slightly quieter (except for the bells during the day), and the view is worth it in its own right.

<Content>The best breakfast in Florence The location of this hotel could not be better. A short walk will lead you to the main attractions in Florence. Our room was enormous and very clean.The breakfast is extremely good with lots of lovely warm pastries, 4 types of cereal, ham, cheese, toast, fresh fruit and a choice of coffee  tea.The staff are very friendly. Nothing is too much trouble.I would definitely recommend this hotel.

The staff were warm, friendly and helpful in finding great restaurants and opera. The hotel is close to all the art, entertainment and shopping sites. It was also convenient to the train station.We could see the Arno River from our room which was very spacious ,clean and quiet. We enjoyed meeting other guests at breakfast. We would highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Great Location This was our 2nd time at this hotel...the last was in 1982! It is so centrally located that we could walk to it from the train station, (and to our Europcar rental) and to all the major sights in the core old city. While expensive (by our standards) it's location made it worth it, and with breakfast included made for more balance. On a small street, few traffic sounds to bother us. Rather, the clip clop of horses hooves passing was charming, and enhanced the feeling of being somewhere back in time. Room was clean, breakfast was plentiful. It does require being able to climb stairs, even to reach the elevator.

<Content>Wonderful experience at the Hotel Alessandra As my three friends and I (all over 50) traveled to Northern Italy, Rick Steve's book was our guide for selecting the places we might stay, followed up by comments found on Trip Advisor. Our stay in the Hotel Alessandra was delightful. The rooms and facilities were spacious and immaculate. We had comfortable twin beds and a lovely updated bathroom with a hairdryer. The breakfast was delicious,the cappuccino delightful, and the location the best you could ask for.None of us will forget Andrea's hospitality. He was helpful in making reservations for us at the Academia and quick to respond to any request prior to our arrival. While there, he was a most gracious and attentive host. We only wished we could have stayed longer.If you are planning a trip to Florence, I would definitely recommend the Hotel Alessandra.

<Content>Wonderful hotel This hotel offers exceptional service in a charming, old world style. It is a family run hotel situated in the center of Florence and very handy to all the sites, great restaurants, the Ponte Vecchio, etc. The staff could not be more helpful in assisting you to make arrangements for tours, reservations for whatever interests you, and generally supplying good tips for your stay in Florence. I would not hesitate to return to the Hotel Alessandra on my next trip to Florence.

<Content>Lived up to expectations We chose the Alessandra having read the favourable reviews on this site and we were not disappointed by the location of the hotel, the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and the standard of the accommodation.The enjoyment of our stay in Florence was enhanced by the assistance and advice of the reception staff, particularly Monty. Our room was very clean and the ensuite bathroom was well appointed and just as clean. The breakfast was excellent, and the location of the hotel was ideal for ease of access to most of the sights of Florence.

<Content>A real find Hotel Alessandra was our home for 3 nights in Sept 2008. Well located, minutes from everything, a superb breakfast and very friendly staff. The staff kindly pre-booked our tickets for the Uffizi and the Accademia; one look at the queues for tickets and we were eternally grateful. One night we were lucky enough to fall upon a concert in the piazza near the Uffizi. What fantastic musos!Highly recommended, both for efficient service and location.We left the hotel to catch the 10.08am train to Viareggio via Lucca. As it did not appear on the departures board, we were advised by a customer service person at the station that it was 'on holidays'. Hilarious!

<Content>Italophile in Florence In Sept. 2008 I returned to Florence (Firenze to those who live there and nuture its traditions) to stay again at the Hotel Alessandra. The owners welcomed me as a long-lost relative, and offered me their predictably comfortable accommodations. My room was complete with traditional decor and a lovely full-sized bathroom. A full buffet breakfast was included in a sunny dining room near the computer-equipped lounge. The hotel's location on a quiet street near the Ponte Vecchio puts it conveniently close to the main sights, and near the art centers, restaurants and shopping the city is so known for.The Gennarinis have a wonderful website which helped me plan a detailed itinerary ahead. Via email, and then in person, they never hesitated to answer questions and assist with travel, entertainment, and all the serendipitous questions I posed. I highly recommend their gracious service and that of their staff, and look forward to my next visit with pleasure.

<Content>Was just OK The location of this hotel was great, the only problem we had was the stairs that you had to climb to get to the reception, and then again to get to the room. The rooms were just OK, the beds were pretty uncomfortable. The breakfast served was your typical European hotel breakfast, nothing special. Would probably not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great base in Florence We stayed at the Hotel Alessandra for 3 days in September. It was located within 10 minutes from the train station, 5 minutes from the Uffizi and Ponte Vecchio, and 15 minutes to Accademia. There were lots of great restaurants/shopping also within 5-10 minutes. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The included breakfast was good compared to others we had in Italy. They have the standard cereal, meat/cheese, and pastries. They do charge for Internet access, but we found it was a minimal charge and worth it. Our room was right along the street and was very quiet. We liked to open our shutters to hear the bells ringing from the nearby churches. The only complaint we had is that our sink had a slow drain. We would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Florence and would stay here again when we return.

<Content>Cheers for Hotel Alessandra A wonderful hotel near all the major sights in Florence. Great 16th century building. We booked late in the game and had to take a room with a shared bath but it was fine. The facilities were clean and our room was spacious and very comfortable. We'll probably stay there again if we return to Florence, which we hope to do.

<Content>Great Location and Service!!!!! Florence was our 3rd stop on our 2 week long trip in Italy. My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights at the end of September. It took us about 15-20 minutes to walk to the hotel. Once we arrived, my husband was able to get into the tiny elevator with our large luggage. I walked upstairs since it was only on the 2nd floor. We were greeted by Monty at the front desk. He was extremely funny and helpful, definitely made our stay so much more enjoyable. He had so many great restaurant suggestions and had our museum reservation # print outs ready for us. We reserved a regular room on the quiet side. Our room had a king bed (2 beds put together), comfy european standards. Bathroom had a small shower with an oversized pedestal sink. Because this is an older hotel, you will notice the few things that needed repair. Room was kept fairly clean. Extra blanket in the closet. We were able to see all of Florence in 2 days because the hotel was centrally located. Walked to the ponte Vecchio (5 minutes away), Pitti palace, Toured the Uffizi (reserve tix in advance, line was very long!), had dinner @ Nella - 1 block away from the hotel (go when it opens at 7pm or they will send you away and make you come back 45 minutes later) This restaurant was not only recommended by Monty, I think it is also in Rick Steve's guide book. Afterwards, we stopped by the famous cafe Rivoire to people watch/listen to music, and ordered dessert. We had the panna cotta, yuck! I think this place is over rated. Waitor was indifferent. Breakfast room was charming - bread, ham/salami, cheese, cereal, and coffee/tea/cappucino with a happy face one it. Started our day going to the Santa Maria Novella old perfumery/pharmacy near the train station (a must do!!!!), spent a good 3 hours at the Boboli Gardens, made reservations at the Accademia (waited in the normal line for 20 minutes so we didn't have to pay extra for the reservation), had dinner at the restaurant Il Boccale right next to the Hotel because we didn't want to walk anymore after our all day. Good food was prix-fix for 10 euros!! Overall, we would definitely stay here again for the price and wonderful service and of course, location! location! location!

<Content>The Alessandra...what a great choice. Our first visit to Florence was made all the better by our choice of hotel.From the minute we exited the lift (admittedly this was a bit of a squeeze!!) we felt like welcome friends. Check in was quick and painless. Our single rooms ,whilst not large, were spotless and the bathrooms modern. The staff and owners were wonderful. Nothing was too much trouble for them and they were very willing to offer advice on places to visit and to book trips for us. We were most impressed by the choice of breakfast...far more substantial than in many similar hotels.The hotel is in the perfect location....5 minutes stroll from the Ponte Vecchio and Oltrarno, Piazza San Giovani and the Cathedral and of course, the shops.The Hotel Alessandra offers fantastic value for money and we have already recommended it to our friends.

<Content>Very nice hotel with a great location and warm friendly staff We had a wonderful three days in Florence and during our stay at the Hotel Alessandra. It is located on a narrow street that adjoins one of the main streets that allows passage over the river Arno, and on the other end is a piazza that is a hub of activity and near the Uffizi. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, the continental breakfast was excellent, I highly recommend this Hotel during your stay in this magnificant city. One potential issue to be aware of - there are many stair steps to get up to the hotel, while not difficult, may be considered if mobility is a potential problem. There is a lift for luggage and we had no problems.

<Content>the Hotel Alessandra will see us again Coming from a world of neon signs and road-side billboards it was a little difficult to spot the front door of the Hotel Alessandra with not much more than a plaque on the wall to identify it's location but once we passed through that door we discovered the most delightful hotel of our Italian holiday.The only more impressive than the exquisite suite and charming decor was the helpfulness and hospitality of the staff. The next time we visit the heart of Florence we will definitely return to this extraordinary hotel.

<Content>Lovely Stay at Hotel Alessandra My husband and I stayed at Hotel Alessandra for two evenings at the end of September. We can only rave about the hotel staff and their ability to answer all of questions and make our stay in Florence memorable. The front desk staff spoke English very well, which helped since we do not speak Italian. Monte, one of the hotel staff, was so funny and made every encounter a pleasure.Our room was very spacious. We had a bathroom inside the room, which had both a shower and a bath. The bathroom was a good size. We had a TV available for catching up on news. Breakfast was offered every morning. There was a nice array of rolls, fruits, cereals, and coffee. The hotel has internet access available for a small fee. The hotel is in a very convenient location on a side street. We would have rated the hotel a 5; however, we did have some problems with the noise. Our room was located on the same floor as the front desk. So, in the morning (around 5 am) when the staff were beginning to prepare for breakfast, we heard a lot of noise. We also were at points disturbed by the noise outside by cars and people on the street outside the hotel. We would recommend bringing ear plugs (just in case). Despite the noise we were able to fall asleep, but it was noticeable. We did not bring this issue up to the hotel staff as we were able to fall asleep. It is just something we think people should be aware of.Given the cleanliness of the room, the friendly hotel staff, and the convenient location, we definitely recommend this hotel. However, do bring ear plugs (just in case).

<Content>A good solid hotel in a great location I stayed here with my wife on our honeymoon in September 2008.The location is prime -- a 5 minute walk from the Uffizi, Piazza della SIgnoria, etc.The room was quite large, especially for a European hotel. The decorations were a little more spare than other places we stayed, but OK. The room was overall quite clean, though we did find a couple squashed mosquitoes on the wall.The hotel has internet access available to guests for a reasonable fee.The staff was friendly and helpful.

<Content>wonderfully, charming hotel My husband and I stayed at Hotel Alessandra in September of 2008 and truly loved it. Andrea, Anna and Tony were so incredibly helpful in guiding us to sights and delicious restaurants. The hotel is centrally located, we were able to walk to all of the famous spots. The hotel was very clean and the breakfast room was charming. We were a little skeptical when we arrived and walked through the door to the hotel and saw just steps in front of us that led to a lift, however, when we realized where we were headed to meet Andrea, we realized that we were definitely in the right place and loved staying there.

<Content>Hotel Allesandra; A Great hotel The Allesandra in Florence is an overlooked gem of a hotel. It has a wonderful location---only about a block from the Ponte Vecchio and walking distance to almost all of Florence's museums and tourist sites. It is surrounded by some of the best restaurants in Italy.The hotel staff was excellent. I was suffering from a damaged hip and had great difficulty walking. The staff located a wheelchair for me and was of invaluable assistance in helping me.The breakfast was listed as Continental , but was better than we had gotten in any restaurant. All in all , I can heartily recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again. And, oh yes. Room charges were quite reasonable.

<Content>Absolutely love the Alessandra I have stayed at the Hotel Alessandra for several years now and highly recommend it. It's very comfortable and homey. The staff is wonderful; so helpful and accommodating - always willing to go the extra mile to assist you when you need recommendations or have problems. The location is perfect - centrally located on a quiet street a block from the Arno and Ponte Vecchio.

<Content>Hotel Alessandra was great! I just stayed with my mom at the Hotel Alessandra for 4 nights this September, and our stay was excellent. The staff was great. I was in contact with Andrea before the trip and he always answered my questions promptly. Once there he helped my mom with our luggage, gave us great restaurant recommendations (definitely try Nella Trattoria and Giovanni's), and great tour recommendations (we loved the Siena and Chianti tour). The Hotel is in the heart of Florence and right near Ponte Vecchio, the Uffizi, Palazzo Vecchio and the Arno River. We could walk to most places in 10-20 minutes. All the staff would ask us how our day was, restaurant, trip, etc. The room and bathroom were clean and excellent. I will definitely try to stay here again if I visit Florence again and will recommend it to friends and family visiting Florence.

<Content>Alessandra by Oz This is is very well located - close to all main sites and taxi rank for trip with bags back to station or airport. Was lovely to have a cool room to come back to after the warm tuscan sun. The room was spacious (with ensuite bathroom), and the breakfast room the best out of similar accomodation in Venice and Rome. The first impression of the steps and the lift - very difficult to be in the lift with your bags ! - may be a little off putting, but the rest of the accomodation quickly makes up for it. One street away from the Arno, and close to everything. Quiet at night, worth considering.

<Content>Hotel Alessandra was perfect We just returned from our Italy trip where we stayed in the Hotel Alessandra while in Florence. The hotel is centrally located to all the major sites, train station, and on a quiet, safe street. For 150 euros/night (including Rick Steves discount) our quad room was spacious with an updated bath and internet was available. Andrea was extremely helpful with directions, information, and booking reservations. He was very nice and easy to work with. Continental breakfast was in a bright, cheery room with cheeses, cold cuts, pastries, spreads, fruit cocktail, juices, cappucino, and hot chocolate. We would love to stay at Hotel Alessandra again.

<Content>Old Florence Gem Spent 4 nights here in the heart of Florence. Our double room was large and elegant (in a 2 star, not 5 star way!) We didn't have a river view, but looking out at 500 year old buildings was very cool, and the location was perfect for walking to all of the museums and churches and shopping. The staff was always helpful when we had questions or needed a recommendation, and you can even have your breakfast (included) delivered to your room!

<Content>Near All Major Sights Just returned from a 17 day trip with 7 women friends, traveling by train through Italy. We stayed at the Alessandra Hotel for 3 nights. It proved to be the perfect choice for us. They provided 2 quad rooms. The rooms were generous in size. We didn't feel crowded together. The hotel is located within walking distance to everything we wanted to see...the Ponte Vecchio, Uffizzi, the Accademia, etc. Using suggestions from the front desk and Rick Steve's guide book, we had some delicious meals, close by and affordable. My first experience tasting wild boar. No, it didn't taste like chicken!

<Content>A great place to stay! An excellent choice in Florence. Strongly recommend it.Great location and outstanding front desk staff who were all very friendly, helpful and accommodating. Our large Jr. suite room was excellent.To give balance:As per other reviews, initial arrival via well documented mini-elevator and stairs (with too many bags!) was a bit daunting but afterwards okay. Avoid the stairs for descent...very slippery.Breakfast room attendant was a bit out-of -sorts during our visit.

<Content>Great Experience The hotel was great. The rooms were large and vintage styled. The showers had good water pressure (which you dont always find in Italy). Breakfast was included for us, which had toast, yogurt, coffee, croissants and cappuccinos (other things too, but I can't remember). There is also internet available at a rate of 5 euro/hour.The location is literally steps away from the most prime shopping on Florence as well.The only thing to note is that the hotel is not wheelchair accessable. You must be able to climb a few flights of stairs to get in the hotel, which may not be ideal for senior citizen's. I am, however, able to climb stairs, so it was of no real significance to me.The staff was always very friendly and made the stay very nice. I had a great stay at Hotel Alessandra.

<Content>Delightful 2* in the heart of Florence We have just returned from nearly three weeks in Italy. We stayed in everything from BBs to 4* Hotels.Hotel Alessandra was only a 2*; but the rooms were the largest of any of the properties we used. Clean, safe and centrally located, this property was perfect for our stay in Florence even if it was not particularly fancy.Fanciness aside, the service here was the best of any of the places we went. Owner Andrea couldn't have been more welcoming and night desk man Monti (sorry if I mispelled his name) was *the most* charming and delightful person we met in a country full of delightful and charming people.The location is pretty ideal - adjacent to the Arno river and steps from the Uffizi Gallery, Ponte Vechio and Palazo Vechio and a short walk to the Duomo.Do check out our favorite restaurant too -- Tratoria Anita is a few steps from the Palazo Vechio and had fantastic food, good service and unbeatable prices.

<Content>wonderful, fabulous We just returned from our first visit to Europe, Italy specifically. We had arranged to stay at the Alessandra and our experience was so much more than expected. Everyone was so helpful and patient with our unfamiliarality with Florence. We cannot express enought how wonderful it was. Our room was so spacious and comfortable. The neighborhood charming and very centerally located. We cannot recommend it enough. We also enjoyed visiting with other travelers there.

<Content>Nice location, nice staff, but also some downsides I visited the hotel end of August 2008 for a (long) weekend. The hotel's location is great, many of the beautiful places of Florence are just a couple of minutes walking away. The hotel has big rooms, but the furniture is a little outdated. The service of the staff however is great, they're very friendly and always willing to help. I wouldn't recommend this hotel when you're travelling by car, or when you don't want or can't climb stairs. The many one-way streets make it very hard to reach the hotel and parking is difficult and expensive (鈧?6 per day). Also you have to climb quite a few stairs to reach the hotel, which is not on the ground floor.

<Content>Great Location Great location along a quiet street but only around corner from the main attractions. Initial impressions a little worrying as reception is on 2nd floor up a rather fragrant staircase but staff were very friendly and welcoming. Room was large and clean but suffered from noise from side street and the occasional waft from the sewers.

<Content>Nice location and service in an old style hotel The Alessandra is a nice, old style hotel, with antique furniture and decorations. The hotel is located on the second floor of a very old building and, mind you, because of that there's no elevator all the way up - you still have to climb some steps. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The Breakfast Buffet was just great, with lots of different options available.The rooms themselves are big and the furniture is quite old and elaborated, if you're into that sort of decoration. I had an issue with cleanliness, since our bed sheets and bath towels were visibly stained. Not like a fresh stain, more like those that you just can't get out no matter how much you wash. So, they were freshly cleaned, but stained. They should just throw them off. That and the huge hole in the bead spread were kind of off-putting .An internet point is available in the hotel's lounge but Wi-Fi is priced the same way, which makes it outrageously expensive for 24 hour access. TV was very old and with lots of reception problems.The hotel is very nicely located, close to just about everything in Florence. The street is just OK at night, safe enough but without many people around.

<Content>Charming Hotel, Great Location The staff was incredibly accommodating and friendly. They try very hard to put you at ease after a very long trip. They can help you make reservations at places that require them, including Accademia and Uffizi.If you are driving to Florence, make sure you call the hotel ahead of time to ensure they can assist with finding a place to park your car. They do offer a valet service because trying to find a place to park in Florence can take up your time.The location of the hotel is outstanding, close to everything you came to Florence to see. You can walk to everythingIf you have kids, they will love the elevator. Be prepared to make several trips on the elevator to get your bags up and down. But once you are in there, the rooms are generous and comfortable.We used our Rick Steves guidebook to find many good places to eat. The hotel can help you locate good local (non-tourist) restaurants that are inexpensive.

<Content>Great Location, Great Service! We had a great stay at the Hotel Alessandra. The room was clean and quiet, the location couldn't have been better, and the staff was helpful and patient. Upon check in, they upgraded our room, which was a nice surprise. They also directed us to fabulous cafes and eateries, one of which we had the best wild mushroom risotto at that I think I might dream about for the rest of my life! One of the staff members also gave us a tip that the museums were open late on the nights of our stay, so we went around 8pm and had them practically to ourselves. It was such a treat! The only drawback I would mention is that they have a curfew, so if staying out all night is important, you should be aware of this in advance.

<Content>A wonderful experience at Hotel Alessandra! My family and I took a fabulous trip to Italy this summer, 2008, and began our journey in Florence staying at the Hotel Alessandra, which we chose at Rick Steves' recommendation. Our room was very comfortable and clean with plenty of room for all four of us! Breakfast every morning at the Hotel Alessandra was the perfect start to our day. Fresh juice, delicious cheese and meat, pastries, bread and (best of all) the smiling monk cappucinno! Deliciouso! We asked the concierge/attendant, Monti, for restaurant suggestions every night during our stay. His suggestions were excellent; not touristy, but wonderful local Italian fare! He called each night for reservations on our behalf and drew a map for us on where to go. We were pleasantly surprised to have Limoncello or champagne (gratis) at each of the restaurants, either upon our arrival or before our departure. We love Monti! He was a delight! The Hotel Alessandra is in a perfect location, within walking distance to Ponte Vecchio, the Piazza della Signoria, the Uffizi, Duomo, Accademia, Pitti Palace, etc. We plan on returning to Florence one day and will most certainly stay, once again, at the Hotel Alessandra!

<Content>Very warm, friendly and extremely nice people run this small hotel I was only there one night but would happily return for a longer stay. It was a wonderful place - close to everything but not too noisy. The people in the office were very helpful to my friend whose luggage had disappeared and she was not even a guest there (I was). A very pleasant experience all around.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Stayed 4 nights at the Hotel Alessandra in Florence. The position of the hotel couldn't be better, close to the Ponte Veccio and even with a view of the Arno from our room. Our room (11) was en-suite, huge, exceptionally clean and totally in keeping with the age and atmosphere of the building.The staff could not have been more helpful, with Monty in particular being exceptionally good with suggestions for restaurants etc.The hotel is unsuitable for anyone who is not agile enough to manage the stairs - the lift goes from the 1st floor to the 3rd, which is where the hotel is located.Breakfasts are fine - and delightfully, we were offered expresso etc., not just the usual filtered coffee.A thoroughly pleasing stay.

<Content>A pleasant stay in Florence My family and I spent two night in Florence and found Hotel Alessandra to be well located, very close to Ponte Vecchio and the Uffizi. We had a spacious room that overlooked the nearby medieval church bell tower. The staff was friendly and the concierge was very helpful. His tips avoided us long lines, and thanks to him we ate at very good small restaurant nearby. A very good experience overall.

<Content>Would go back Found this place on tripadvisor. Great value for your money. We stayed in room 9 for 3 nights. Room was very spacious for European standards. There was no view but I opted for the private attached bathroom instead. The room itself was nice and clean. There is a safe in the room. The outer sheets of the bed seemed a little bit old and may need replacing.Great location! Very close to the Ponte Vecchio.The staff was helpful and very friendly.Only major complaint is that there was no free internet and it was very slow. The internet was expensive but Andrei was willing to help out. Gave me a deal of 10 euros for 6 hours. That was enough for my 3 days there. Works for a desktop they have in common area or for wifi in your room.Remember to pre-book your museums!! The hotel staff are willing to do it for you.

<Content>It was central, it was friendly, it was quiet, it was great! The Allesandra was a perfect base for us to explore Florence. The location is central and yet really peaceful - they're on a quiet back street which just happens to be a block away from the main drag. And yet it wasn't expensive. Perhaps this is because the Allesandra doesn't have a big, fancy frontage on the street - you enter through an elegant door which you can imagine is your own apartment building, and the reception to the hotel is then upstairs (or up in the lift). We liked this - it made us feel like we had a home in Florence. Our room was big, airy, clean and quiet. The staff are consistently helpful, kind and cheerful - and they speak perfect English, which was very nice for those moments where my phrase-book Italian ran out.

<Content>Fantastic Location We stayed at the Hotel Alessandra for two nights at the end of July. I had read previous reviews and was not disappointed with our visit. Our priority was the location and it could not be faulted - we were within easy walking distance of all the local sights of Florence. We were given a friendly welcome by Andrea who was more than happy to give advice and directions. Air condiitioning was also a necessity as far as I was concerned and again there were no problems here - it was lovely to have a couple of hours respite from the heat in the coolness of the rooms. Our room was clean and large although the bathroom was slightly on the small side but an excellent shower so perfectly adequate. Breakfast was fine, my only (very small) criticism was that there could have been a fruit salad at breakfast - there were prunes, but I'm not a fan of prunes unfortunately. There was refillable tea and coffee and you could be served expressos or cappuchinos if you so desired. Yes, as other people have said, there are stairs to the first floor and then a small lift - but that didn't effect us in the slightest. All in all I would definitely recommend staying at the Hotel Allessandra.

<Content>Brilliant location We upgraded on arrival to a suite with balcony, and enjoyed our breakfasts overlooking the church tower - with a view of the river!The location of the hotel is perfect just a few blocks from all the sights. The hotel staff really helped us make the most of our few days in Florence. I'd have no hesitation in staying there again. Watch out for the lift, saves trying to carry your luggage up the steps!

<Content>Classic Italian Experience My husband and I heard about this hotel through a recommendation in a travel book we read. Before going to Florence, we emailed the owners to ask them some basic questions about parking, accomodations, location and possible cooking courses. We heard back from Andrea (a co-owner) with immediacy, who was very gracious, responsive and helpful. We even had directions to the hotel and parking. This was a hotel with great staff and a home-like appeal. The breakfast buffet was delicious and served in a very cute villa room. The server made you feel at home by adding a drawn smile in the foam of the cappucino. The little extra touches at this hotel just added to our experience. We booked a junior suite, which had a view that looked out at clock tower and of the Arno river. The suite was large, spacious and had a true classic italian feel to it. The price for this hotel suite in comparison to other hotels we stayed in across Italy was similar and above average in the authenticity and spaciousness we were looking for. It also had a safe and a fridge that we appreciated while we were there. The hotel is within a reasonable walking distance to all of the sites we went to and the staff was able to secure cooking lessons for us previous to the day we arrived. Since we only were staying 1 1/2 days, having things set up in advance was a great advantage. Our stay in Florence, in this hotel and the cooking course we experienced was at the top of our list of experiences in our drive across Italy. We definitely want to go back and will stay at the Hotel Allesandra when we return. We highly recommend this place.

<Content>Highly recommend the Alessandra! Andrea was most helpful at the Hotel Alessandra, we stayed there one day in our visit through Florence. The airlines had lost our bags, and he set everything up for us so that our bags were waiting for us at our next hotel in Tuscany. The location is fantastic, the staff helpful, and the room spacious! Would highly recommend the Hotel Alessandra.

<Content>Wonderful place to stay in Florence! My friend and I had an excellent stay in Hotel Alessandra for 2 nights. Andrea (the man in charge at the desk) was extremely helpful and kind during our stay. He gave us all the tourist information we needed and directed us to where ever we asked. I will definitely return to this hotel next time I'm in Florence.

<Content>Spacious room at Alessandra We spent three nights at Hotel Allesandra during a 3-week trip to Italy and Switzerland. We found the location to be just right because we were close to the things we wanted to do/see, yet it was very quiet. Our room was clean and VERY spacious... which is a special treat when one is traveling in Europe! It was very hot when we were there, so we really appreciated the air conditioning. The staff was very friendly , kind and helpful. Breakfast was good, too. The only negative thing at all about Hotel Allesandra is the access into the building. Luckily, our cab driver took us right to the door or we may have missed it! There is just a little sign on the building to show that you are at the hotel. Once inside, you must climb many stairs to reach the hotel office. (There is a small lift that goes part of the way.) We would definitely stay at the Allesandra again! It was a fantastic value!

<Content>Wonderful little hotel!! This wonderful little hotel is located on a quiet side street very near the Ponte Vecchio. The furnishings are modest, but comfortable. The bed was wonderful! The room and bath were absolutely clean. There are about 30 steps up to the tiny elevator which takes you directly to the hotel reception. I was warmly welcomed by the very nice family and made to feel at home. The advice and directions given were very helpful. The breakfast was exceptional with excellent service. I stayed here a few years ago for 5 days, and came back for only 1 day this year. When I return to Florence another time, I will most certainly stay at the Hotel Allesandra.

<Content>Hotel Alessandra Excellent 3-night stay. The Hotel is a short 10-minute walk from the SMN train station, centrally located only a few blocks from the Ponte Vecchio (although we found that to be too touristy compared to the rest of Florence) and in a very safe area (police station one block over). The staff was exceptionally pleasant and helpful, esp for museum reservations and restaurant suggestions. Slightly aged and not overly ornate, the Hotel was very clean, breakfast was included (a bonus), and it was quiet in the evening when we needed sleep. It's a perfect base from which to explore the city. There weren't any real negatives here - I'd give it a 4.5 stars out of 5, only due to the 3rd floor walk-up (there's a small elevator which we declined to use) . Great for families. We had a nice time and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>The host with the most We stayed at the Hotel Alessandra for 10 days and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Andrea was the best host ever and he was always willing to help out with sound and accurate advice and also in organising day trips to Sienna and more. The rest of the staff were very friendly and helpful as well. The service was impeccable from the front desk to the service at breakfast. The room was very comfortable and quiet and the general ambience and location of the hotel very good. The only slightly disappointing aspect was the breakfast which was very ordinary. This aside we would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Very Nice, Great Location Enjoyed our stay. Our room was plenty large enough for the 4 of us (couple with 2 children). Room was clean, comfortable and air-conditioned. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was plentiful and served very nicely. Location was close to Ponte Vecchio. Was a flight of steps to get to small elevator, but was not a problem for us. Recommended.

<Content>Excellent Hotel My mum and I spent 10 days at this hotel and would highly recommend it. The staff were very friendly and helpful, they went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The brilliant location of the hotel couldn't be better for sight seeing in Florence. We always felt very safe and were given helpful suggestions about visitor attractions. We hope to stay here again in the future. We had a brilliant holiday.

<Content>Oh Baby! I second the review that nextstop gave to Hotel Alessandra. Andrea could not have been more welcoming and accommodating (we decided on the spur of the moment to stay an extra night and, although we had to change rooms, we were appreciated the shuffle to enable us to enjoy another night in Florence.I also highly recommend a visit to the wine shop, Per Bacco (sp?), next store (if you are facing the hotel, it is on the same side to your left - not the wine bar across the street). It is owned and run by Filippo Pastorini, a man erudite and deeply passionate about Italian wines 鈥?in fact, that is all the shop carries. He shares an enthusiasm for engaging customers in conversations about wine to educate and learn even as he finds a wine fitting your taste and budget. You can bring a bottle back to your room (he鈥檒l even uncork it for you!) or have Andrea arrange a wine tasting, where, in the upstairs private room sitting at a rustic farmhouse table, you will taste and learn more than you ever thought possible in such a short period of time. All the wines are married with cheeses specially chosen and purchased locally. At the end of the tasting you鈥檒l definitely fell you stumbled on the essence of la dolce vita.

<Content>Great location and personable service Location, location, location...the hotel certainly is conveniently located to all the major sites in Florence, which made the sighseeing very easy. With light luggage, we had no problem walking to the hotel from the train station. It is on a quiet street though, which was a plus as we could get away from the noise of the main tourist drag, which is just a few steps away. The staff was very friendly and made us feel very welcome. Nice cappucino for breakfast. I booked directly with Andea, who was very responsive via emails and very helpful in person. He also arranged for reservations to the Accademia and the Uffizi for us, which was very nice. Overall, we were pleased with everything this hotel had to offer and would stay there again next time we're in Florence.

<Content>A wonderful place to stay This is a wonderful place to stay. The staff is unbelievably friendly and helpful. This was true of every person I came in contact with on every shift. My room and the common areas were very nice. My only regret is that I was only there for one day. I hope to get back to Florence one of these days and this will definitely be my first choice. Highly, highly recommended for any woman who might be traveling alone.

<Content>Charming Hotel very well located...we Loved it! The Hotel Alessandra was a wonderful experience. The location was exceptional, only one block from the Ponte Vecchio on a quiet street. The Hotel is very unassuming from the street with a very simple entrance. You then take a lift to an upper floor and step off into a charming lobby...what a wonderful surprise!The rooms are sprawling, charming comfortable and very clean.The staff was warm, welcoming and very helpful in their recommendations.We would highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Charming Hotel in the heart of Florence! Hotel Alessandra is a charming hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff, clean rooms, and a lovely view of the river. Close to many museums, sites, shops, and restaurants; the hotel is conveniently situated. Just be prepared for a flight of stairs before you get to the lift- the hotel is on the second floor. Our stay there was absolutely delightful!

<Content>Friendly Staff We just spent 2 weeks in Italy and stayed here for 4 nights. The staff was extremely helpful and pleasant, never steering us wrong on where to dine. We did the private tour through the Chianti region and Tuscany and would recommend it. The breakfast was good and fresh. Within walking distance to the action. The rooms (5 women, 2 rooms) were spacious and clean. Our favorite of all hotels during this trip! A return trip to Italy will include Hotel Alessandra.

<Content>Best Little Hotel in the World! We visited Italy for the first time in July. We stayed in Florence for five days and had a wonderful time. We stayed at the Hotel Alessandra near many of the main sights in the Historic Center of Florence. We loved the staff, Andrea, Monti, and Anna. They made every effort to give each person special attention. If you had a question or a suggestion for a tour they found the best possible assistance and information. We took the Monday Special Tour that the Hotel set up for us to Siena, and other close hill cities. We stopped at a winery for wine tasting. We loved the art, the food and the people we met during our stay.  We found the breakfast room comfortable and relaxed. We enjoyed meeting others and sharing stories about the sights that we saw the day before. We had our 16 and 23 year old daughters with us and they can not wait to save their money so they can go back! We all agreed we would return to the Hotel Alessandra for sure! They helped us with a small medical emergency. Monti was great in getting assistance quickly. The hotel was clean, beds great, location wonderful, and staff just superb!

With our recent trip to Florence we again stayed at Hotel Alessandra, again everything from the room, the fantastic location, views and staff was first class. If you want location, good value, great rooms and really helpful staff we would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Romantic nights at the Alesssandra Our stay in Florence at the Hotel Alessandra was the highlight of our visit to Tuscany. Our large room looked over a courtyard and beyond that was the Ponte Vecchio. Breakfasts were excellent, and the other guests were friendly and generous with advice and stories. The staff gave us excellent guidance about restaurants and museum reservations. Although it's close to the Ufizi and convenient to the city's center, it faces a narrow street which is very quiet and a little hard to find - so be patient, don't give up and all will be well. Highly recommended!

<Content>Wonderful Place To Stay We had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Alessandra in April of 2008. We spent five nights there and wish we could have stayed many more. The charm of the hotel and the excellent service provided by every member of the staff really added a special touch to our stay in Florence. The rooms were large,clean and the beds were comfortable. The breakfast was a nice way to start the day which were usually planned perfectly with the help of the staff. They were tremendously helpful in suggesting and arranging for all of our sightseeing, travel and dining needs. The hotel was in the best part of the city and centrally located to everything you would want to see or do. Being in Florence is so very special and we loved every moment of our stay. The Hotel Alessandra was a big part of why we loved it there.

<Content>I would recommend this hotel The staff was very friendly and helpful. We are from the US so we appreciated that they spoke English fairly well. The breakfast buffet was free and one of the best we had out of all the places we stayed in Italy. The location of the hotel is fabulous. It is a 5 minute walk away from the main art attractions the city has to offer. The room was large and air conditioned for most of the day. There were certain hours it was shut off and then it did get pretty warm in the room. Here is only one minor complaint. The wood floor in our room was not installed properly and creaked loudly with every footstep. All in all I would stay at the Hotel Alessandra if I were to visit Florence again.

<Content>The Perfect Choice in Florence The Hotel Alessandra was the perfect hotel for our stay in Florence. My Friend and I visited the hotel just last week and loved it! The location cannot be beat. It sits on a quaint and quiet street, yet it is just a block from the Ponte Vecchio and a few blocks from the Ufizzi. We were able to walk everywhere, even the train station for our day trips out of the city (without luggage). Andrea was extremely kind and helpful, as were the other staff, and the rooms (we stayed in two since we extended out stay at the last minute) were spotlessly clean and very spacious. Although there is a walk up 2 flights of stairs to reach the elevator, this was not a problem for us at all. In fact, much of our trip in Italy had us walking the cities for hours, so what is an extra flight of stairs?When we return to Florence, and I know we will, we will definitely stay here again.Thank you Andrea

<Content>Alessandra was the perfect place for us I knew already this was a well located and nice looking place as many photos and information were given on line... Everything about our stay at Hotel Alessandra was perfect. Friendly staff, nice comfortable rooms, extremely friendly and helpful people (in English as well). A pleasant salon was also available to rest after we checked out of the room and prepared ourselves to the rest of our travel.

<Content>Loved Alessandra! We stayed 2 nights at the Hotel Alessandra  really enjoyed our stay. Really great service  a charming hotel. Very comfortable room with a spacious bathroom. They upgraded our room to a canal view without a request, which was a nice surprise. The breakfast was nice, too - great service, decent selection,  great coffee. The hotel is very close to the major tourist attractions, museums, etc. It's about a 5 min walk to the Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio, etc. They also held our luggage after checking out so we could spend the day touring without our bags. Only downers...you have to pay for internet access (30min increments)  the entrance is awkward b/c you have to be buzzed in, then you carry your luggage up a flight of stairs to what has to be the smallest elevator in history. We had to make 2 trips, 1 adult  1 roll-behind each trip. Pretty small complaints considering the location  quality of the hotel. Would definitely stay here again  highly recommend it.

<Content>Great Experience Perfect location near the Ponte Vecchio  shopping. We were upgraded to a junior suite at a nominal charge and had a fantastic view of the river and even had a sitting room! The hotel staff , especially Monte, was always very friendly and attentive to our requests. When we left on a train to Milan, my daughter realized she left some clothes in the closet. Andrea went out of his way to mail them back to us in the States and even e-mailed us with the information. We had such a wonderful experience and hope to return in the future.

<Content>Great Staff, Great Location This is an excellent choice for a reasonably priced hotel in Florence. The location could not be better...it's just a minute from the Ponte Vecchio and the Pitti Palace and is very close to the Uffizi Gallery and numerous other attractions. All members of the staff speak flawless English and could not have been more helpful or pleasant. They even booked my reservations for some of the galleries in advance. The room was small but quite comfortable and quiet with a nice bathroom. Breakfast was also quite good. Highly recommended.

<Content>Hotel Alessandra very nice. I am sorry to be so late in answering this survey. I enjoyed my stay in Hotel Alessandra very much. The staff was the most helpful I have ever seen. The only disadvantage I found was carrying my bag up to the elevator. We had a wonderful time with the elevator. It had been a long day, we were tired, hungry and apprehensive about our first night in Italy. The elevator gave us cause to laugh and joke about our situation. I could imagine hearing someone saying, Those noisy Americans. Even though we were near the busy streets, it was quiet. The hotel was very convenient for getting to places of interest. We walked most everywhere, even from the bus stop, I would stay there again. One of the five of us traveling made the arrangements and I am so glad she did.

<Content>Perfect Location, Wonderful Staff With so many overpriced hotels in Florence, the Hotel Alessandra offers a fantastic location at a very reasonable price. We found the hotel in the Rick Steves guide book, and couldn't believe that it was only 2 blocks from the Ponte Vecchio and 3 blocks from the Uffizi! The staff was top-notch, both incredibly friendly and incredibly helpful. They even arranged for valet parking for our car for only 21 euros. The rooms are not fancy but have everything you need. We faced away from the street and had no street noise. I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Hotel Allessandra was great We just returned from a 10 day stay in Italy with 3 wonderful evenings spend at the Hotel Alessandra. I highly recomend this quaint, perfectly located hotel. just 2 blocks from the Uffizzi and one block north of the Arno, the location is perfecto. More importanly, the rooms were spacious and comfortable. The service stands out as some of the best I have experience-the staff was very outgoing and knowledgeable with recommendations for meals. Be sure to chat with the delightful and engaging Monti-his Joie de vivre is infectious and he is loads of fun.

<Content>Italy 2008: Hotel Alessandra in Florence - Excellent! Our experience at the Hotel Alessandra was a very pleasurable experience. Whenever we had a problem with anything such as the air conditioning, they were there right away to assist you. The staff was exceptional, always making dinner suggestions, shopping suggestions and willing to make you a reservation for you at the local restaurants and museums. I found they were very professional in responding by e-mail to my reservation request as well. Thanks for a wonderful time in Florence and Tuscany!Donna Costello  William Jefferies

<Content>A Peaceful Haven in the Middle of Florence When you travel to Italy, don't miss the opportunity to stay at Hotel Alessandra in Florence! This lovely hotel is on a small, quiet one-way street, and rooms on the opposite side of the property overlook the beautiful Arno. Despite the tranquil location, however, you're only a block and a half from the Ponte Vecchio and other major tourist attactions. The rooms in this 15th century palazzo are spacious, comfortable, and furnished with elegant antiques. Owners Anna and Andrea Gennarini speak accomplished English and will make you feel completely at home during your stay. They will also tell you about excellent nearby restaurants and off-the-beaten-path sites of interest. But their willingness to make your stay special doesn't end there. Recently, when some young friends of ours stayed at Hotel Alessandra on their honeymoon, I e-mailed Andrea asking him to do something special for them, and he came up with a thoughtful, creative way to comply with my request.  After staying at Hotel Alessandra, you'll feel like you have old family friends in Florence, and you'll want to return to this haven again and again!

<Content>Great little hotel This hotel is in a beautiful, central location close to the river. Although the hotel is older, the room was large, air-conditioned, and had an updated bathroom. There was a good breakfast spread (for Europe). I found it to be a reasonable value for the area, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. This would not be a good hotel for people who can't walk up stairs, since you have to walk up a flight just to take the tiny elevator up to the hotel.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Wonderful Staff The property was lovely and in a convenient location to all the sites we wished to see in Florence. The entrance, lobby and common areas are clean and tidy and charming and the rooms were also clean and well-kept and relatively spacious; a decnet value. The owners were wonderful and they had a pleasant staff to accompany them. Italy proprietors may wish to take the lead from the Spanish. Internet access in the common room is included in the room rates in Spain. A lovely stay at Hotel Alessandra. Recommended!

<Content>Best Florence Experience I loved my stay at the Hotel Alessandra. It was one of my favorite Florence experiences. It is on a lovely little street just a block or two from the Uffizi. I got in early after taking the night train from Paris and Andrea at the front desk kindly stored by bag and told me to go have breakfast until my room was ready. By 9:30 am I was in my room and had a great private bathroom all to myself! The staff were always remarkably warm and friendly. The breakfast buffet was better than anything else I found during my week long trip through Italy. I had a great view that included the Duomo.

<Content>Tuscan Hospitality The location was perfect, two blocks from the Uffizi and the room was wonderful. My room was recently refurbished, airconditioning, wireless access and a gorgeous bathroom. The breakfast buffet was better than those Ihave had in more expensive places and the staff were incredible. From the minute I made my reservation (a friend had sung their praises) they arranged museum tickets, recommended resteraunts and did all they could to make me feel welcome. My only complaint was that I couldn't stay in December as their staff has the holiday off. Talk about civilized. I will stay at Hotel Allesandra every time I return to Firenza.

<Content>Great hotel, excellent staff The hotel's location is perfect -- a block from the Arno, three blocks from the Uffizi, 10 minute walk to the Duomo. Ponte Vecchio about three blocks away, delicious fruit stand down the street.Our room was beautiful, very clean and had a wonderful view of the river and the 1000-year old church next door. The front desk staff all speak excellent English and were very helpful. I would definitely recommend it to anyone going to Florence, and we'll try to stay there the next time we go.

<Content>Location, Comfort  When it comes to hotels there are three qualifiers in my book: Service, Location and Comfort. As the first hotel we stayed in on a month-long trip to Europe, this hotel met all three for us.Andrea and Monti provided thorough, polite and patient service to us above and beyond expectations. They booked museum reservations, recommended restaurants, provided internet assistance and became friends as well as hosts to us. The location is perfect: within easy walking distance of the Uffizi Gallery, Ponte Vecchio, shopping and more. The room was comfortable and quiet. The building is OLD. When this building was new, the United States had not yet been established. Lots of buildings in Europe are old and are still lived in. Staying in older hotels is one of the great experiences to be had in touring Europe. Yes, there is a flight of steps up from the street. We made several trips to bring up our luggage. No big deal. Same with the tiny elevator.The breakfasts were ample and included espresso or capuccino, a nice touch. The Internet wasn't free but it was available and quick. I recommend the Hotel Alessandra for its location, comfort, service for people wishing a true European experience.

<Content>Great Hotel My husband and I stayed in the hotel for 3 nights and found it to be lovely. It was in a perfect location, the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and the room itself was clean and quite spacious. We loved our first trip to Florence and part of it was due to this great hotel.

<Content>Excellent family hotel in the heart of Florence The Hotel Alessandra is located within a 5 minute walk of many of the important sights in Florence, including the Uffizi Gallery, the Ponte Vecchio, and the Piazza Repubblica. The family who owns the hotel provides very friendly service and makes you feel at home during your stay. They will assist you with reservations to the popular sights like the Uffizi and Accademia, which will help you avoid the lines. The rooms are spacious and feature high ceilings, and they are very well kept. A continental breakfast is served every morning, again with friendly service. The staff is also very knowledgeable about Florence and can provide very good recommendations for meals.We will definitely plan to stay at Hotel Alessandra during our next stay in Florence.

<Content>Friendly place in the heart of Florence Hotel Alessandra couldn't be located more conveniently--3 minutes from the Palazzo Vecchio, 5 minutes from the Duomo. The hotel is located in a 15th century building on a small side street. It's quiet and well run (good breakfast, too). The very best thing about HA is the wonderful owners and staff. Andrea was great about getting museum reservations and for general information and help of all kinds. Hotel Alessandra is positively written up in Rick Steves's books, so the secret is out.

<Content>You cant go wrong at the Alessandra in Florence. I read about the hotel in Rick Steves tour book of Italy. I stayed there with my lovely girlfriend and we had the trip of a lifetime. The hotel was centrally located. it was on a quiet street (great for sleeping) but only a few blocks from the main attractions. The rooms were great . Very clean and decent size. The hotel staff was excellent. They checked in on you and were very helpful when you needed something. The gentleman who worked at night was awesome. Breakfast was good. I would highly recommend this hotel. Great location, price and hotel staff.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Alessandra! I spent 3 days in Florence, staying at Hotel Alessandra. It was exactly what I was looking for: brilliant location, right amongst all the action without being noisy; lovely rooms, and very clean, especially the bathrooms; and the best staff ever who honestly could not have been more helpful or friendly. I had a fab weekend staying there. So overall, two thumbs up for brilliant value!

<Content>Awesome Hotel in Florence!!! This is a gorgeous old hotel in a prime location in Florence. The building itself used to be a palace or something in the 14th century. The front desk staff is energetic and super helpful. The rooms are spacious and they had probably the biggest bathroom and shower that we found in all of Italy. The breakfast is also pretty good.Location is prime. Very close to the Ponta Vecchio and a short walk to the Academia and the main square in Florence. Uffizi is a little farther, maybe a 15-20 minute walk. The front desk staff gives you a great map and instructions on how to get to the main attractions.The only drawback of this place is you must first walk up about 30 steps or so before you reach the elevator. If you overpacked like we did and are tired of dragging your stuff from one train station to the next, you will be a little annoyed by this, but it's a small price to pay. Otherwise this hotel was charming and great. We loved it!

<Content>Great location and comfortable, affordable accommodation Spent three nights at Hotel Alessandra in May. Very nice location--quiet street, and about two minutes to Ponte Vecchio and very near Uffizi and Piazza della Signoria. Our room, with a view of of the street, was big by European standards, with long/narrow bathroom. Rooms are modest, but comfortable. Fixtures/furniture had a nice vintage charm--a bit worn but not overly so. Friendly proprietors and nice breakfast. Yes, there are stairs to climb and the lift is small, but in my eyes this is part of the charm of Europe, not a detriment. Overall, very nice value for the money. Mille grazie.

<Content>Excellent Location, Excellent Price The Hotel Alessandra is an excellent value (80 EU) in a beautiful but very expensive city. The location on a narrow little street with views of the Arno RIver (steps to the Ponte Vecchio and Uffizi) cannot be beat. Also great location in the event you want to escape the crowds and walk across the river. where prices and quality for many things are better. My hotel room (single on top floor with private bathroom in the hall) was very simply decorated but unbelievably clean and I even had a view of the Duomo. AC worked fine which was a good thing since it was very hot the weekend I was there. The bed mattress was not great but I found that to be true at a hotel that was 2 1/2 times the price in Genoa (work was paying) so it may just be a difference in expectations. The breakfast (included) was more than adequate--all was fresh and there was a lot to choose from. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. Monti was especially terrific--he made great recommendations for my first time visit and was at all times very helpful, warm and friendly. He even saw to it that I had a cold breakfast packed for my very early morning departure since I left before breakfast. This hotel is a little gem and it really felt like home during my short visit. I will definitely return.

<Content>Great Little Hotel - Huge Quad Room Ditto to all the positive comments in other reviews. Just want to add that the quad room was a very generous size with a king size bed and two comfortable twin beds. The ceilings in our room must have been 14 feet giving an even greater sense of space. As parents traveling with 2 teenaged sons, we appreciated the comfort and room. Bathroom was large too.

<Content>Not too sure! The hotel had a lovely situation, easy quick access to local attractions. Disappointmented with mildew on bathroom ceiling. Entrance very disappointing, concrete stone entrance, shabby ,up three flight of stairs. Lift which would not fit luggage as it was tiny. Often you could not get the lift as it only worked when people on other floors shut the doors properly.Bad stain in bath and long black hair. For the cost, I would not use this hotel again. I e-mailed three times to ask for a bottle of champagne in room as a surprise for my wifes birthday, but was not done. Comfortable bed but shabby bedcover.

<Content>Great location On the basis of the reviews here we booked a long weekend at the Alessandra.On the assumption that the hotel will be somewhere to sleep and breakfast, and visit the local attractions, it's great - the Ponte Vecchio is at the end of the street. Their other selling point is the service, which is very friendly It is 2*, for several reasons. 1), you have to climb some stairs to get to the lift (and the lift is very small), 2) it has rooms, reception, a sitting room (which was always empty) and a breakfast room. We booked a junior suite. Decor was plain and in places on the tatty side, the bathroom had some discoloured wallpaper. The room was very clean and the bed very comfortable. Main problem is the mosquitoes, so get some of the coils you burn and burn it for 10mins at a time to avoid setting the fire alarm off. There was aircon, you just needed to ring reception to get it turned on but they soon know if you want it and turn it on automatically when you come in. But for a 2* we couldn't complain.The minibar was reasonably priced, water/coke at about 2鈧?and a half bottle of prosecco at 3鈧?First morning the shower didn't work properly, we mentioned it to Andrea and he checked it out, it turned out it was the city water supply and when we came back in a few hours later it worked perfectly. They can't help the water supply, and Andrea did come and check promptly.Breakfast was good, nice warm criossants, fresh bread and rolls, ham and cheese, cereals and yoghurt, and the coffee was good. I also booked a pizza class. I'd booked a Saturday night. The class at the la Toscana Cooking School can take 2-24 people for the pizza class, as I'd booked a fairly unusual time, we struck lucky and there were only 2 of us. The chef (Roberto) decided that making pizza wouldn't take as long as if there were 24 people, so he included the pasta course and we made tiramisu. The food was excellent, Roberto was a good teacher and we thoroughly enjoyed it, I'd say well worth the money. Roberto said that the school had a good relationship with the Alessandra so were prepared to be flexible and acomodate odd requests such as ours for a small calss on a Saturday night. So I'd recommend the classes.Monti's recommendation for a local restaurant was excellent (the Casalinga). It's a bit loud with the Italians shouting away, but it's not a touristy place - the menu was in Italian only (though the waiters would probably have translated if we'd needed it), and there's no wine list - you just order the local vino in 陆/1litre carafes. Total price for 3 courses plus wine and coffee and a grappa for about 55鈧?- less than half what we paid elsewhere and food was good.If you want to visit the Uffizi Gallery, ask Andrea in advance to book tickets for you. The queue is horrific, we'd have waited 3 hours if we could have been bothered. If you get the tickets in advance you avoid queueing altogether.A trip up to Piazza di Michelangelo is worth it; catch the number 12 bus for 1.20鈧?each, it takes 40 mins but the views from there are fantastic. If you follow the sign for the toilets along the road you come to a bar, besides which there is a set of steps that leads you back down towards the Ponte Vecchio, through the bohemian part of town; Andrea said that there were some good restaurants but we didn't try them unfortunately. Another recommendation - the gelateria across the river at the end of the Ponte alla Carraia - great ice-cream and it costs beans.There's a very handy shop across the street, it's a hardware shop where you can get mozzie stuff, coils, sprays, also toiletries and they sell mains socket converters at a fraction of the price the tourist shops do. Our first converter didn't work but we went back and the chap changed it for one that did without a quibble. There's a nice enoteca/deli further down which has a great range of grappa.The Central Market is a good place to visit too, if you're from the EU (e.g. UK) you can buy fresh fruit, veg, meat, cheese etc to take home very reasonably, far cheaper than in the UK. The stallholders will also vac-pack things for you to bring back. Just past the toilets and 1 row in there's a deli stall that sells Crutin cheese (goat's cheese with truffles in) which is worth a try, it's only sold by Harrods in the UK and hard to find even in ItalyAll-in-all, I'd thoroughly recommend the hotel. It's not a 5*, and to be honest the photos are flattering, but for the price s it's great value for money. It's clean, comfortable, in the perfect spot and above all, the staff are friendly and helpful.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Alessandra! Great hotel, very friendly staff, great location in Florence. Andrea at the Front Desk was very helpful and knowledgeable. She helped us book a last minute wine tour of Tuscany that turned out to be fabulous. Breakfast was great and the service was wonderful. I would return to this hotel.

<Content>Recommend the Alessandra Hotel Alessandra has the nicest, most helpful staff and an ideal location, nestled between the Palazzo Vecchio and Ponte Vecchio. It is also one of the better values in a very expensive city. We really liked it and will definitely stay there again. Several excellent trattorias (Cammillo, La Casalinga and Trattoria Nella) are also an easy walk.Nutley, N.J.

<Content>Great location and helpful, friendly staff We stayed for four nights at the Alessandra and found it to be a very pleasant hotel. Our room was spacious, quiet and comfortable and had its own bathroom (cheaper rooms are available with shared bathroom facilities).The hotel is just a short walk from the Ponte Vecchio and the Uffizi. There is a wine shop just a few doors down and directly opposite the hotel is a general store where you can buy toiletries (although the prices are a little high compared to supermarkets). The hotel reception is up several flights of stairs. There is a lift but you will still have to climb one flight of steps to get to the lift. For some guests this might be an issue but it was not a problem for us.The staff were all helpful and friendly. On our last day they gave us helpful directions on how to get to our next destination in Tuscany. Breakfast was a simple cold buffet but more than adequate and included ham and cheese, croissants, cereals and yoghurts etc. You need to ask the waitress if you would like a cappuccino or espresso, as opposed to filter coffee.The TV in the room had rather poor reception but that wasn't a major problem for us. All in all, a nice little hotel that perhaps deserves more than its 2 star rating.

<Content>great location, helpful concierge, great cooking class! My wife and I and another couple stayed here. The hotel is on a quiet street just a block or so from the Ponte Vecchio action. We stayed in a regular double, our friends in a junior suite overlooking the Arno - but just a sliver of it. Rooms were modest but clean and comfortable. The young concierge was a very helpful young man. We had booked a cooking class (InTavola) through the hotel before arrival, but frankly did not expect much. It was terrific - very personable chef who was serious enough about the cooking without taking himself seriously. We prepared a three course meal for ourselves (a dozen people in the class that night) of crepes, stuffed zucchini and tiramisu. This was my first experience with a cooking class (or, frankly, cooking anything beyond pancakes or grilled meat!), and had an absolute blast. And it was delicious!

<Content>A hidden gem You almost don't know it is there until you're at the door. You ring in and then climb a pretty long flight of wide marble stairs. You then take a narrow little elevator upstairs. The trip is worth it. Hotel Alessandra is absolutely charming. Wonderful continental breakfast, clean spacious rooms, lovely atmosphere but the very best part is the people. The staff is the very best! We were treated very warmly with personal attention to all of our needs. They are great fun and made our stay even more speical. The hotel is only one long block from the Ponte Vechio so it is reached in a couple of minutes. We walked 5 minutes and were at the Uffizi. Everything we wanted in Florence was reached with a very reasonable walk from the hotel.I whole-heartedly approve of and recommend this hotel.

<Content>Location, location, location After taking a long train ride from Venice it was nice to arrive at the Hotel Alessandra and be greeted by Monti who was such a wonderful host. He promptly showed us to our room and gave us a quick tour of the hotel and then equipped us with a map of downtown Florence. Being this was our first trip to Florence we had 50 questions for Monti and I'm happy to say that he answered all of them with a smile in his voice. He made us feel like we were at home. I can go on and on about our Florence adventures, but I know you're more interested in the hotel. The hotel met my main requirements: clean, ensuite bathroom, comfortable bed, and reasonable price. The added bonuses for us was the location. I didn't realize how close we were to everything! I must admit I was a little leary when I saw the church bell outside our window, but soon realized I had nothing to worry about. We had a peaceful night sleep each night we were there. The morning breakfast was a nice jump start to our day. Last but not least, the entire staff at the hotel were very professional and absolutely wonderful to us. I would definately stay there again.

<Content>Great Experience at Hotel Alessandra Hotel Alessandra is a tremendous value in Florence. It is within walking distance of all major sights and is a quiet refuge from the city streets. It offers luxury rooms and wonderful breakfast at a bargain price, and the staff are so friendly and always willing to help. My husband and I recently stayed here on our honeymoon and could not have been more pleased. I would highly recommend the Hotel Alessandra to anyone planning to visit Florence.

<Content>Florentine hospitality We were delighted with our stay at the Hotel Alessandra. The room was spacious, well appointed and quiet. The location was great for seeing Florence on foot. The staff was very helpful and hospitable. We were particularly taken with Monti (I think I got his name right), who bent over backwards to be helpful and gracious and was very tolerant of my faltering attempts at Italian. We felt very comfortable coming back home to our room after a long day of sightseeing.

<Content>Perfetto! This is possibly my favorite hotel in the world! The location couldn't be better, the service couldn't be warmer, and the rooms are quite large for a European hotel and many have lovely views. I've been here twice and would be back every year if I could afford it. The family that runs it, as well as a gentleman at the desk named Andrea, further add to its charm - in fact though it's hard to say any single thing is the best part, they might be :-)

<Content>Amazing Rooms in Florence Found through Rick Steves. While the initial few minutes -- finding the right buzzer, climbing five flights of stairs with 50-pound bags, didn't set me up for the best experience, this 16th-century building was incredible. It felt like a great authentic experience staying in these ancient but stylish rooms with high ceiling and lovely views. The elevator is tiny -- not more than one person with luggage -- but after finding our room at the end of a cozy, intimate maze, we could not have been more pleased. It was amazing, pure and simple. The slightest complaint we can muster is about noise, which is certainly typical for a building this age which creaks and echoes into oblivion, but it could get somewhat noisy from the nearby street or other people traffic in the hotel.

<Content>Great Location, Large Rooms We stayed in Florence for two nights and had a great stay at Hotel Alessandra. They had easy, detailed directions on the website from the train station to their hotel. The room was very large and gave us plenty of room to spread out. Location, location, location, we were two blocks from the Ponte Vecchio and it was easy to walk everywhere. The staff was very helpful and attentive. We would stay there again without hesitation. Note the hotel is up several flights of stairs; there is a small elevator after the first set of steps.

<Content>One of the best When you visit a beautiful city like Florence, a disappointing hotel can really take the edge off your stay. However, a great hotel, like the Alessandra, makes your holiday all the more enjoyable. It has three very important things going for it - perfect location, classy decor and welcoming, capable and helpful staff. It is situated right by the river, a two minute walk from the Ponte Vecchio. The presentation of the hotel is fully in keeping with its surroundings and the room I stayed in was clean, spacious and well maintained with simple, yet tasteful decor. However, the most pleasing aspect was the attitude of the staff, especially Monti the receptionist. I have stayed in enough hotels to know how important this. Nothing was too much trouble for them. I can definitely recommend Hotel Alessandra for anyone wanting a great place to stay in Florence.

<Content>Alessandra was a perfect spot We spent 4 lovely days at the Alessandra in Florence this spring. The location was fabulous, just 1-2 blocks from the Ponte Vecchio and the Uffizi. The people were so friendly and helpful in making our stay comfortable, giving us great directions and wonderful restaurant recommendations (like Tratorria Nella). We chose a double room with bath which was simple but spacious. The double window provided a beautiful view over the rooftops of Florence and we could hear the horse  buggies clip-clopping on the old cobblestones below. The breakfast was ample with delicious capaccino, croissants, cheeses, yogurt, etc. We would highly recommend this small  lovely old hotel in the heart of Florence.

<Content>a wonderful family owned and run property We were treated very well, from being met, assistance with luggage and parking, and pre-booking of museums. A very professional staff, small in number, but as knowledable as any. The amenities were excellent, especially the coffee bar at breakfast. The staff was very helpful in directions and suggestions as to good values in dining. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates a stay in the center of activity of the city..It was the best location for access to all major museums and sights.

<Content>Hotel Alesandra is the Best My stay at Hotel Alessandra was A+. The best accommodations in all of my 22 day Italy trip. My 2 days in Florence were wonderful, mostly due to the great care and treatment by the hotel staff, in particular, Andrea. He was so helpful in every way. He booked my reservations for museums and galleries, gave me instructions on what to do, where to go, what to see. He recommended two wonderul restaurants to eat at. Everything was perfect. The hotel room was lovely, clean and easy to access everything.The breakfast and service was excellent.I have only good (great) things to say about my stay. I have mentioned the hotel, service, and staff to several people on my trip, and if I come back to italy (when i return), I will most definitely stay at the Hotel Alessandra.Caio!

<Content>Liked the Hotel Alessandra My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights based upon Rick Steves' recommendation. The location is fabulous, within easy walking distance of shopping, museums, churches and restaurants. The building is old but in good repair and our room was clean and roomy. The cost was also great considering the central location. The hotel staff booked advance museum tickets for us which can be very hard to obtain in high season without a long wait. The staff also gave us good restaurant recommendations. Breakfast was included and was fine. I highly recommend this hotel!

The hotel has an excellent location and their staff go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need from extra pillows to dinner reservations. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Perfect Location for Florence Stayed here the first two nights of a 10 day trip to Tuscany. If you arrive by train, recommend taking a taxi, I belive the cost was around 5-6euro. To get to the reception, it's up a flight of stairs and use of a small elevator, other than that minor inconvienence, everything else was as we expected. Large room with a safe and flatscreen tv, nice bathroom, generous selection for breakfast and really a perfect location - less than 5 minute walk to Ponte Vecchio. Also highly recommend booking a tuscan cooking class if you have the time, the hotel will take care of it for you. It was lots of fun and some of the best food we had on the trip.

<Content>Romantic Florence We stayed for three nights in Florence at Hotel Alessandra which is conveniently located a block from Pont Vecchio. We were fortunate to get a suite which was favorably priced and included a sitting room, a large bedroom with king-sized bed, dressing area, large bathroom, study area and balcony. Best of all were the views of the Arno River and the 15th century bell tower right outside our room. (The bell rings only from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) The Hotel was very clean, the breakfast room lovely and the staff incredibly friendly. Each evening we asked Andrea or his staff for dining recommendations and they directed us to restaurants that were reasonably priced, welcoming and delicious. For a relaxing, romantic adventure in Florence, stay at Hotel Alessandra.

<Content>Perfection! We spent 2 weeks in Italy and stayed in 7 hotels, and Hotel Alessandra was topping the list of favorites. We were travelers on a budget so we were pleasantly suprised by the size of our room and the large breakfast spread. The staff were incredibly friendly. The location was perfect for site seeing. The room was quiet and clean. It really was more than we expected for 145 Euros.Our only warning is the number of unavoidable stairs. We are the type that climbed every bell tower and Duomo dome so we really weren't bothered by it. We also traveled with backpacks not rolling luggage so we didn't have to contend with any lifting. However, if you have any sort of physical condition that would prevent you from managing at least 2 flights of stairs, or if you are a pathologic overpacker (ha ha), you might want to consider elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a perfect spot in a magical city. When we someday get to return to Florence, we wouldn't consider staying anywhere else!

<Content>Old Fashion Elegance This hotel has very large rooms furnished with near antique furniture - as such the furniture isn't in mint condition but it is fine all the same.Our double bed was two single beds pushed together which isn't uncommon but not ideal. We paid for a room with a shared bathroom. We never experienced a wait fr the bathroom and it was always kept clean.The hotel was a little aged but the service and facilities were very good.Minor complaints about the pillows - too hard and also the fact that the hotel is on the 4th (or 5th) floor. This means stairs all the time.Definitely worth recommending.

<Content>Great hotel in the heart of Florence! We recently spent 3 nights at Hotel Alessandra and enjoyed our stay. Each staff member was welcoming, friendly and helpful.The hotel is in a great location, only a 5-10 minute walk from major attractions such as the Accademia and Uffizi Gallery and the Ponte Vecchio. Stores such as Prada, Ferragamo and Gucci were just around the corner.The rooms are spacious, well maintained and clean. We had 4 adults staying in one quad room and we had plenty of space for our luggage and belongings. Breakfast was included and it was delicious, complete with the best cappuccinos we had in Italy.We will definitely stay here again when we return to Florence.

<Content>Party of four loved the Alessandra We just returned from our two week Holiday Italiano. Part of it was a four night stay at the Hotel Alessandra in Florence. I had read all about the hotel on its website--which is excellent. And I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor. There were four of us (we had booked two rooms--one large room, #21, overlooking the Arno, and another large room, #16, on the other side of the hotel and this room had a view of the top of the Duomo) and we all really loved the Alessandra. Andrea, the manager/owner, was a huge help. From the first email I sent him, months before our trip, to the last email I sent him, just days before we left for the holiday, he answered all of them immediately. When we arrived in Florence at the Alessandra, he checked us in, showed us to our rooms, made sure everything was to our satisfaction, and went over the details of the arrangements that we had asked him to make for us. These arrangements included making reservations for the Accademia (David) to bypass the long lines. Andrea also arranged a car and driver for us four for a 9 hour tour of Tuscany. The driver picked us up a few steps from the hotel's front door at 9 in the morning and dropped us off in the same spot about 6.15 in the evening. I had mentioned to Andrea that we wanted to see Montepulciano, Pienza, and Volterra. The driver alread had the day planned with this exact itinerary. The only detail to be decided was how long to spend in each village. (We would recommend the most time in Montepulciano. It was wonderful--the perfect Tuscan town. Pienza was a bit of a disappointment. If you go, get a sandwich, some wine, and walk behind the buildings on the right as you walk through the main entrance to Pienza for your picnic and some really fine Tuscan views! The drive to Volterra was incredible!!! And the views, once you get there, are totally awesome.) Ok, I got a bit carried away describing this day trip! Back to reviewing the hotel. (I just wanted to show that Andrea arranged the day exactly as I had asked.) As I said, the rooms were huge, the hotel's location is wonderful--just steps to the Ponte Vecchio, the breakfast is delicious, and the staff--from Andrea to the evening staff who got ice for our drinks before dinner and gave us directions to a supermarket--were all uniformly attentive and helpful and nice. A quick recommendation for a restaurant just steps from the hotel's front door: IL BOCCALE. Large menu, good food, and a staff so welcoming that you immediately feel like family. So, if you are planning a Florence holiday, we would all highly recommend a stay at the Hotel Alessandra.

<Content>Home away from home in Tuscany I have just returned from my second stay at the Hotel Alessandra in Florence. Andrea and Anna, the proprietors and their staff saw to my every need. They went above and beyond to ensure that I had a comfortable stay. Before I arrived I always had prompt responses to email requests for information and for reservations for the various sights I wanted to visit in Florence. While there, one day when I slept through my wake-up call, I got a concerned knock on the door to make sure I was up and okay. The folks there really care about their guests. The hotel is very convenient to many places in Florence and while retaining Old World charm has modern conveniences like Internet access and cable TV. I stayed with them several months ago when I was traveling with my elderly mother. She had taken a fall and broken her arm while we were in Rome and the folks at the Hotel Alessandra helped us with finding local doctors for her follow-up care and assisting us with little extras like additional pillows and hot tea in the evening to make her more comfortable.I would highly recommend the Hotel Alessandra to anyone traveling to Tuscany.

<Content>The Alessandra - the heart of Florence This was our third stay at the Alessandra - other members of our family having also stayed there in the past - and our most enjoyable.Situated in the very heart of Florence, a half a block away from the Arno, this early sixteenth century palazzo provides just the ambience for a visit to this sublime city. The Ponte Vecchio is virtually at one end of the street, and the important Santa Trinita, with its beautiful Ghirlandaio frescoes, is at the other end.The hotel family owners and staff are lovely folk, who instinctively go out of their way to help with whatever query you have. The rooms are spotless and well appointed. The breakfast is good and served in a bright and comfortable room with excellent table service(including freshly prepared Italian coffee).There are at least two fine restaurants very near to the hotel, one opposite Santa Trinita, and the other, Nella, a short walk through the intriguing narrow lanes a couple of minutes away. The latter is a small establishment that fills very rapidly each evening (the food is excellent and reasonably priced!), so try to be there for seven o'clock or reserve a table!If I need to provide a negative, it must be the sinking feeling one feels when leaving! However, we are already planning our return early next year.

<Content>friendly and great location extremely friendly, welcoming and helpful hotel staff, superb location just round the corner from ponte vecchio (ie about as central as you can get) on a pretty and peaceful medaival street in the oldest part of town. room itself was quite ordinary (single), but was a reasonable size, very clean and the bed was comfortable. would stay here again, and might pay more for a river view next time.

<Content>Brief, but very enjoyable! I'll add my thumbs up regarding the Hotel Alessandra in Firenze - as we were approaching Florence after a long day of driving and sightseeing in the area without a place to stay, we checked our trusty Rick Steves guide to Italy 2008. After many no, I'm sorry, we are booked this evenings, I finally got a cheery, Yes, we have a room for you! from Monty (I believe that was his name - apologies if not), at the Hotel Alessandra. Although it was a BIT of an effort to locate the hotel (we were driving - NOT the easiest thing to do in the narrow laneways of Florence), we eventually found it. Although I wasn't quite prepared to hoist our luggage up a few flights of stairs before finally reaching the elevator, adrenaline kicked in, and up, up, up I went! (It was either me or my boyfriend who had to stay with the car, which was literally parked temporarily on the sidewalk, and I don't drive standard -- so I was elected to haul the luggage up!) When I finally did reach the reception area however, (on the 4th level, I believe) all my work was well worth it, as Monty greeted me with abundant hospitality, showed me to our room, and flung open the shuttered window to our spacious and clean room overlooking the Arno River at sunset! Perfect! As he put it, It's the honeymoon suite, madam! Just for you! I must put in a good word for the bathroom facilities alone - as my boyfriend put it, we could have just slept in the bathroom! It was HUGE, clean, with every possible convenience. Although our stay here was short, it was nonetheless sweet - this is a well appointed and elegant hotel, with old world charm, excellent service, and breakfast included in a charming dining area -- all for a reasonable price, considering how centrally located this hotel is to most of Florence's hot spots. We were sorry to have leave not only this beautiful city, but the hospitality bestowed upon us by the staff here. Should we be fortunate enough to return to Florence someday, we would not hesitate to book a return stay (in advance this time!) at the Hotel Alessandra.

<Content>A little jewel in Florence! The hotel's location is perfect for exploring Florence on foot, close to excellent restaurants, the historic sites, and shopping.Our triple room was comfortable, with a surprisingly large bathroom, and the shuttered windows opened onto a picturesque, if tiny, square. The staff was most accomodating and pleasant, and spoke excellent English. The building, dating from the 1500s is literally attached to the oldest church in Florence, and the location, especially at night, walking down the dark quiet street, gives a sense of how little this piece of Florence may have changed over the last several hundred years or so... We would not hesitate to return to this hotel, and wouldrecommend it to anyone who is looking for an authentic atmosphere rather than luxury. A very good value, if carrying your luggage up 2 flights is not an obstacle!

<Content>Moderately priced, excellent accommodation near Ponte Vecchio We had a most rewarding experience in Florence and highly recommend host Hotel Alessandra on Borgo SS Apostoli, just 5 minutes from the famous Ponte Vecchio and within walking distance of everything worth visiting.Our accommodation was spacious, comfortable and well equipped. A generous breakfast was included and served in sunny and friendly surroundings.Service by Andrea Gennarini and staff was totally dedicated and caring. We felt that everyone was bending backwards to be helpful. There was no language problem, since they all speak English, all reservations i.e. gallery tickets, performance, taxi were promptly and reliably looked after.We stayed in a junior suite for $165/night, but there are many other rooms to choose from; single, double, triple, quadruple room etc. in total there are 27 rooms.During our stay, we took a 3 days trip to Venice and stored most of our luggage at the hotel. Upon our return we got a different room overlooking Arno River, the sight was beautiful.Bravo Hotel AlessandraFrom the grateful Pengs, Canada

<Content>Hotel Alessandra sets the bar for Service  5/1/08Hotel Alessandra, I thank your entire staff for a wonderful stay April 25-27th, 2008! Your hotel is exquisite and your service sets the bar for any American and foreign customer service I have had. That includes America, Hong Kong, Beijing (Peninsula Palace 5 star), London, Mexico, Rome, and the many cruises I have been on.- Our rooms were ready well prior to our scheduled arrival with superb space and comfort, especially the shower. - The beds and pillows were comfortable. - The staff will turn on the to accommodate you.- Your quick response to room reservations and the Museum reservations was much appreciated. - Everything we would need to know was explained and everyone was personable. -The rooms have a real normal electronic safe which was really nice.-Plenty of bathroom space to hang robes, shower caps, soap, and to move around in the shower.-Nightstands and lights for each side of the bed, along with a triple dresser and hanging wardrobe.-After coming from Rome we felt we hit the jackpot staying at Hotel Alessandra, we thanked God immediately for our blessing to stay at your hotel.- The location is fabulous and accessible to many sites. -Your staff spoke great English to assist us in finding sites in minimum time and with ease. -The breakfast was good.-Thank you for also cashing my American express Euro travelers checks; I didn't know what I was going to do since it was a holiday.  If we get the chance to come to Florence again, we will definitely love to stay at your hotel again!. Best Wishes,Nicolette Collins and Nicole AlexanderChicago, IL and Indianapolis, IN United States

<Content>Best in Florence We have stayed at the Hotel Alessandra twice over the years. The most recent was this past March. This is a nice, family owned hotel. And when you stay there, you feel part of the family as well. Whatever you need, they help you with it. It's very centrally located...just steps from anywhere you might want to go in Florence. It is furnished with taste and elegance. The breakfast is well prepared and if you're leaving early or getting up late, if you let them know, they are more than welcome to accommodate. We wouldn't stay anywhere else in Florence.

<Content>Fantastic Service and Great Room/Location The Hotel Alessandra was one of the great highlights of our trip to Italy. The hotels is in a perfect location and the room was very spacious. Specifically, the staff was very friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make us feel at home. Andrea was perfect in helping with our dinner and musuem reservations.

<Content>100% recommended Hotel had been recommended in Rough Guide to Tuscany  Umbria. We booked on-line through Booking.com, but unfortunately, due to short notice, were unable to secure 4 nights at the Alessandra, and had to make do with just one. This was a great pity as the hotel was excellent. Standard of the room, its ideal location for exploring Florence and the welcome and help given by all staff were all first class. We will fully recommend this hotel to all who wish to have a stay in Florence. Based on our experience, you will not be disappointed.Davisd  Sara Pratt, Kent, England

<Author>GiuliaMemphis_TN_
<Content>great way to end a month in Italy I found the Hotel Alessandra in Rick Steves' travel book and could not have been more pleased with the recommendation.As I was traveling alone, location and security were most important. The hotel is in the best part of town, in my opinion; a block or two from the Ponte Vecchio and the Piazza della Signoria and close enough to the Ponte Santa Trinita that one can traverse the Arno easily when the crowds are unmanageable on the Ponte Vecchio.There was very little street noise which I had had a problem with, in Florence, in the past.The staff went out of their way to meet my needs ,and then some, with suggestions that I had not thought to do.The hotel offers the best, hot shower that I have had in Florence and the room was spacious and comfortable. The sitting room and breakfast room were totally charming-I felt as if I were in a very well-appointed residence.I would definitely recommend the Hotel Alessandra and will most certainly stay there when I again visit Florence.

<Content>Couldn't be better for the price and location! I've just returned from a three night stay in Florence.The Hotel Alessandra is a small, personal, family-run hotel that offers a four-star location at 1/4 of the price. The furniture is an eclectic mix of old and new, but everything is spotless. Every effort was made to make my stay pleasant -- smiles in the morning and evening, from check-in to check-out. ( I was even given a triple for the same price as the single I had booked! )I would be happy to stay there anytime I'm lucky enough to be in Florence.

<Content>Wonderful Home Base for Exploring the Heart of Florence I've visited Florence many times and was delighted to find the Hotel Alessandra; this will be my home base on future visits and I will enthusiastically recommend to family and friends. It's tucked away on a quiet street just steps from the Ponte Vecchio -- a perfect location from which to explore all the wonders of Florence. The hotel itself is lovely and comfortable. The rooms are very large and well priced for the location. It's a family owned and run establishment, and I felt very much at home here and very well taken care of. In my opinion, you will have a tough time finding a better option in this price range. Enjoy!

<Content>Friendly and convenient Friendly and professional welcome, ideally located in the city centre (2min walk to the Ponte Vecchio, 5min to the Duomo...) tough in a quiet street. We had a room with view on the Arno with a bell that would ring from time to time (luckily not at night) that gave a quite authentic atmosphere.

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the room was large, clean and quiet. We have two young children and the hotel was very child-friendly as well. The location is very convenient to all of the major sights that we visited in Florence. We would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Friendly The hotel was located in the center of the city allowing us to walk to every point we wanted to go to thewith exception of one taxi ride.our room was about average size for a suite in the U.S.! and was very clean, although the bathroom was small it was bigger then most in Europe. the large window opened onto the bell tower of a 400 year old church and with a partical view of the river.The staff was very help full and always plesent and truly friendly..The only two issues were the several flights of stairs you had to climb to get to the hotel and I dont get in small elevators so that was my problem. the second was the mosquitos one night but the staff provided a mosquito repealant you burned which was oderless and it did the trick........

<Content>Good location and service! Hotel Alessandra had a great location close to the Ponte Vecchio and convenient to the other city sights. The room was huge and we loved the shuttered window with a view to the street below. The staff were super-helpful and nice, giving us the full tour of the hotel, plenty of maps, and help with our bags. The bathroom was a little strange--narrow with about 3 turns to get to the toilet, with a urinal placed directly in front of it. I thought it was slightly overpriced at 150 euros/night, the most we paid in our trip covering Venice and Tuscany, but I suppose the location was worth it. I think I would look around more on my next trip to Tuscany to see if I could find a better deal, but the location was fantastic, so it may just be the price you have to pay in Florence.

<Content>Hotel Alessandra - The Best Hotel Alessandra is a beautiful hotel with an excellent location in Florence, Italy. A 20 minute walk from the the termini train station - 2 adults and 2 teens - and no complaints from anyone. Our room with a view suited our needs perfectly - a charming blend of old world with some modern conveniences. Our kids loved the internet access on the main floor. Breakfast was a treat - great service and wonderful coffee. The staff went out of their way to recommend restaurants, answer questions and generally help make our stay comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel. Grazie.

<Content>Perfect Location in Florence!! I loved this hotel! My dream was to spend a few weeks in Florence, Italy and immerse myself in the culture. One of the main reasons I selected Hotel Alessandra was for the location-it was PERFECT! I could walk to the Ponte Vecchio in a minute, many of my favorite churches and sites within a few minutes' walk, there were wonderful restaurants right next door and across the street, and there are all kinds of shops and gelati places within a few minutes' walk! The hotel staff was amazing, and made me feel like part of their family, which, being so far from home, and travelling alone, was important to me. They assisted me with ideas of fun things to do around the region, and were even great about giving me a few pointers on my Italian! The rooms were very clean, and I opted for a junior suite, which was huge compared to most European standards. I loved my stay, and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a well-run, family-owned, friendly hotel accessible to all of Florence!

<Content>Loved the hotel We have just returned from a two week trip to Italy. The Hotel Alessandra was fabulous. The hotel is located very convenient to the market, shopping, and major sites. The hotel service was extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and roomy. The staff spoke good English. The hotel has a small elevator which only held 3 people, but once we had our luggage upstairs, it was fine. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the train station. We would recommend taking a taxi if you are not familiar with the area because the streets in Florence are not easy to find. Overall, we would highly recommend this hotel. One of the best hotels we stayed in Italy!The Meinke Family

<Content>Great Location! My husband and I stayed here in May 2005 and were very pleased! The location cannot be beat. We stayed in the room without a private bathroom, but never had to wait for a shower. it was just fine for us. This was a nice place to rest after busy days of visiting museums.

<Content>A great Stay in Florence My wife and I had just come from Rome after I had run the Rome Marathon and were looking forward to a wonderful visit in Florence. This hotel was more than I had hoped for and the gracious hosts, Andrea and Anna mad us feel like we were not guests but part of the family. Andrea arranged a side trip to Sienna for us as well as restaurant reservations.He also suggested some nice running routes for a friend and I to get in a light jog. The rooms were spacious and clean and the breakfast buffet tasty. We were only 1 block from the Ponte Vecchio and a short walking distance to all we had come to see. The hotel was wonderful but it was Anna and Andrea that really made the stay special. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Florence. Frank M. Tampa, FL

<Content>Great City, Great Hotel Yes there are stairs to climb; I think it is well documented in every post on this site. But if it is going to stop you from patronizing this hotel you should skip the Florence experience altogether because every attraction in this city requires hoofing a few (hundred) stairs. Is the elevator small? You bet but the real treat is getting to the final destination, I鈥檒l take the slight inconvenience of a small elevator over a small room any day. The management is superb, from the ease in booking reservations and follow-up to accommodating multiple change requests, all executed flawlessly. This hotel delivers on what they promise along with a couple of special request on the fly.

<Content>Great hotel! Great people! Very charming decor! This hotel was perfectly located, about a block from Ponte Veccio. I had stayed in another hotel prior to this one paying the same amount, and found it to be dull, loud and the people werent very helpful. At Hotel Alessandra, I felt so well taken care of by the staff, and I would have to say that because the staff was so friendly, it seemed to pass on to the people that stayed there, making the entire stay even more welcoming. Also, the room had charm - which is sometimes more difficult to find in a budget hotel.Monte was the best! He was so funny, kind and incredibly helpful! I would stay here again in a heartbeat!

<Content>LOVED the hotel and the staff My sister is living in Rome. It was my first visit to Italy. I chose to visit Florence with my sister and my sister chose the hotel for us. It was so much more than I had expected. We were welcomed with open arms by the staff. My sister and I feared with such short notice we would not get the chance to visit the Uffizi and Accaedemia. Within seconds of our arrival the staff was on the phone making us reservations for both! We had time to drop off our bags and we were off to start our adventure in Florence. That evening the staff made a reservation for a dinner that went beyond our expectations. If I am lucky enough to visit Florence again in my life I will absolutely stay at Hotel Alessandra.

<Content>Great hotel, great location, great staff My brother along with my brother in-law, nephew and girlfriend stayed in two rooms at the Hotel Alessandro in March 2008. It is a great little hotel located about a block from the river and block from the Ponte Vechio bridge. Great location. It was about a 10-12 minute walk, with luggage from the train station, and minutes away from the Duomo and other big sites in Florence. My girlfriend and I stayed in room 21, which was huge by European standards and big by US standard. It had a nice bathroom with a bidet. The room looked down on a little courtyard and beyond that was the Arno River. The staff was very nice and helpful in looking up train schedules and making recommendations for dinner and reserving tickets for the Uffizi Museum (highly recommend making reservations) If you are looking to save a little money on food across the street and to the right is a deli where you can get cold cuts and other finger food. It is a little high end but if you are looking to get away from $15 pasta it is a nice break. We also found another deli where we got a sandwich and a beer for about 3 euros. The restaurant next door is good and reasonable. The only drawback on the hotel, and it is very minor, is that you have to climb about 20 steps before you get to the elevator and then the elevator can only fit one person and their luggage. A minor inconvenience. Once we got our luggage up we never used the elevator. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Perfect location, great place to stay, wonderful supportive staff! I originally chose Hotel Alessandra based on the overall positive reviews it got from previous guests. We needed a clean, quiet place to sleep with a good location in old Florence and it would have been a good choice just for that. But we were pleasantly surprised at how charming the building is (16th-century palazzo) and how supportive the staff were. The rooms are comfortable, clean, roomy, and well-maintained. All of the staff spoke enough English to adivse us on restaurants, attractions, walking routes, and hazards, and their recommendations were always spot-on. They promptly looked up train schedules and made phone calls for us and were helpful every way they could be. As to my original reasons for choosing this hotel, the rates were reasonable and the location was fantastic. Perhaps a three-minute walk to Ponte Vecchio, five minutes to Palazzo Vecchio; we couldn't have asked for better lodgings. The breakfasts were plentiful and had sufficient variety and of course the coffee was excellent. There were several other visitors there with teenage children and they seemed to have no problem accommodating to the location. [My wife and I were traveling by ourselves so we have no firsthand experience as to its family-friendliness but I think we would have had no problem if our children had been with us.] Overall this is a great choice for cultural tourists who want good accomodations at an excellent value for the money.

<Content>A Room with a View We arrived in beautiful Florence after cold and windy Geneva. The Hotel Alessandra was warm, both in spirit and in temperature. Our first night was in a large room with bath down the hall. (We arrived a day earlier than planned). Andrea moved us to a superb room (with en suite bath) with a view of the Arno. The river was less than a block from the hotel. The Ponta Vecchio was, maybe, two blocks. Cathedrals, museums, gelato, and more were all within easy walking distance. Both of our rooms were very clean, the staff was quite friendly and helpful (including help with tickets to the Accademia; don't miss it). Everything was just as advertised!

<Content>Great location  March 2006 was my 2nd stay at the Hotel Alessandra. It is a beautiful hotel within a block of the Ponte Vecchio. Plus, we had 'A Room with a View' of the Arno. I recommend this hotel  would stay there again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Definitely one of Florence's treasures! I booked with the Hotel Alessandra based on a Rick Steve's recommendation and was completely satisfied with all aspects of my stay. The incredibly helpful and welcoming staff booked museum visits for me and gave me great local tips. My room was spacious and clean- next to the front desk but still very quiet and peaceful. Although I shared a bath there was a sink in the room which was very convenient. Yes the elevator was small and up 1 flight of stairs but this was pretty typical of many European hotels I have stayed in. No big surprise. It was very nice to come back to the Hotel at the end of a day of sghtseeing and chat with the staff- as a solo traveler it was a nice aspect of my stay there.The location was amazing- so close to everything. There is an a wonderful resturant 2 doors down where I had the best steak of my life! At the end of the street are more resturants,shops, cafes and several atms. You can't beat being a block off the Ponte Vecchio.I have recommended the Hotel Alessandra to several people already and will happily stay there when I am in Florence again.

<Content>Excellent Accomodation in the Heart of Firenze This is a wonderful hotel in the heart of Florence and I would highly recommend it for your stay. The rooms are very large, especially for a European hotel. We had two rooms, one for me and the wife and the other for our three kids. That room could have easily slept four people as there were three beds, one being queen size and big enough for two. My room had a view of the river Arno which was an added plus.We booked directly with the hotel via email. Their responses were immediate and english impeccable, so the booking could not have been easier. They are happy to make your reservations at the Uffizi, Accademia or Brancacci Chapel (don't overlook this small gem) and have great restaurant reccomendations as well.This place is a small hotel and is run like such. It is not the Westin Excelsior so don't expect to have every door opened for you and 24 hour room service. They do a nice breakfast and have an attentive staff, but this is not a huge place with all the trappings. Nice, friendly and affordable for couples or families who would rather spend their money on a nice dinner than an overpriced hotel room.Florence was a pleasure to visit and Hotel Alessandra enhanced the experince.Tom GreeneWestport, Connecticut

<Content>Perfect location, no parking, too many stairs, so-so rooms The hotel is very centrally located. Major attractions such as Il Duomo are within a 10 minute walk.However, the hotel's recommended parking garage (Europa) is a 20 minute walk away! Also, the hotel entry is strange -- the entrance is obscure with only a small placard, and it has a tiny button you press to unlock the door. Then, you must climb 2 flights of stairs to reach the elevator. The reception is on the 3rd or 4th floor. Your room may be up at least one more flight of stairs. This would not be a good hotel for someone that has a hard time with walking up steps.It does has in-room Internet access for about 4鈧?per hour, and the hotel staff speaks English well.

<Content>Don't miss the hot chocolate at breakfast This hotel is well located near the Ponte Vecchio and within walking distance of the key sites, including the train station. Travel light because you must climb one flight of stairs before reaching the small lift. My son and I took the advertised low season winter special of 85 euros per night for a twin room with bath. We sensed less than half the rooms were booked when we were there. The decor in our room was tired but the room size, the heating, shower pressure, bed firmness and flat screen TV were all excellent. There's a computer in the common living room for Internet access, but the cafes in Via Faenza (near market and station) are a fraction of the cost. The main reasons we would book again were the excellent and friendly service and the breakfast. The staff happily obtained transport information for day trips to Siena and Riomaggiore and opened the breakfast room half an hour earlier for us so we could catch the train. Don't miss the hot chocolate and pastries at breakfast. The selection of teas was also the best we experienced. The narrow one-way street is in a pedestrian zone but be careful with taxis and other authorised vehicles which can go too fast early or late in the day.

<Content>Fantastic Location Great Value This was a great find. The location was one block fron the Ponti Vecchio. You can walk to all the sights within minutes.The breakfast was light just coffee and pastry.The entrance is hard to find with only a small sign on the wall.The hotel is on the second floor of a 15th century building and you have to go up 2 flights of stairs to get to the lift.They will come down a take care of your luggage.The best part is the size of the rooms their huge and the staff is very helpful. They seen to bend over backwards.Dont pay for breakfast on their website if you book direct they will throw it in.This is a family run hotel they should be very proud of their son he does a wonderful job.Stayed middle of Feb in room 11 it was very quite.Cant wait to go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Friendly  Hotel Allesandra was recommended to me by a friend who stayed there on several trips to Florence. The owners and staff were very friendly. I stayed with 2 friends who had never been to Italy before and were not used to European hotels. So I booked one of the rooms with a private bath. It was QUIET,COMFORTABLE  CLEAN. The location to everything in town was great.I would definately stay again and in fact just yesterday recommended to some other friends going this spring.

<Content>Wonderful - convinient - clean - Loved it! This hotel was wonderful! It is an excellent value - very clean, the staff was very helpful and courteous. Andrea was awesome and really helped us see the best of the city in the short time we had. Located less than a block from Ponte Vecchio you really cannot beat the location...and you MUST try the delicatessen across the street. Great cheese and prociutto. My sister and I drove through Florence - which was a nightmare - and with all the one way streets this hotel was hard to drive to when you don't know your way around. But extremely easy to find walking or via cab. Definitely don't drive in Florence - it has the potential to ruin even the best relationship! But we managed, and only drove through the Piazza Santa Maria three times! The breakfasts were great, delicious coffee - friendly staff and wonderful food. Restrooms were clean and practically always available - loved the old charm of the place. Beds were comfortable and had wireless internet which was a big plus! I can't wait to go back. I will definitely stay in Hotel Alessandra again! Buongiorno Andrea!

<Content>Old World Charm From the moment we entered through the large oak doors and ascended the expansive stone stairway to the lobby we knew we had found the perfect place. The hotel has an old world european charm with spacious rooms and high ceilings. The staff is warm and helpful which made us feel welcome and at home. Our experience was most pleasant , will return again and again and highly recommend it.

<Content>Hotel Alessandra-The Perfect Location! We had a very comfortable stay at Hotel Alessandra. The location couldn't be better - steps away from the Ponte Vecchio, the Uffizi and the Piazza della Signoria with its great cafes and gelato shops! They fix a great latte and were very helpful with suggestions for dinner and where to get the laundry done. Open your windows at six in the evening and listen to the church bells - beautiful! We will definitely stay there the next time we visit Florence!

<Content>definitely recommend the Hotel Alessandra Had a wonderful time at this hotel. It's a block or so from the Arno at Ponte Vecchio, in a building dating from the 15th century, but redone inside so that everything was up to date. Having a nice breakfast there as part of the package was a great convienence. I stayed in a room with my bathroom on the next floor - worked fine for me. My daughter stayed in a room with a private bath down the hall; worked fine for her. My cousin and his wife had a large room with a bathroom - very nice and could see the dome of the Duomo from their window. When you go out you leave your key at the front desk, which one one less thing to carry about all day (we walked everywhere from there); if you're coming back after midnight you should let them know because they lock the front door then. There is a small elevator but we always walked the three flights of stairs to our rooms. Prices were very reasonable, the people there were very nice and helpful (I don't know any Italian). I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Location, Friendly Management As other reviewers have mentioned, you must be able to climb one flight of stairs to reach the elevator. That said, the Hotel Alessandra was a very pleasant stay. We had a family room which was clean and comfortable for our needs. My friends were in double rooms and they were lovely.

<Content>If You Can Walk One Flight of Steps, Stay Here The Alessandra is a clean and charming hotel a block from the maddening crowd but within easy reach of the Florence sites. The only caution I would give is: you must be able to get yourself up one flight of stairs to stay here. Once you've walked up the steps from ground level, there is a small elevator to the Hotel's reception floor. (We loved the spaceship sound it made when the door was open.)The hotel staff was cheerful, friendly, and unfailingly helpful. Andrea is a doll of a concierge and all around hotel representative.The rooms were large, well appointed, and clean. Here again there are a few steps to negotiate whether getting to the room or getting from the bed area to the restroom. Our rooms (the Junior Suite and the River View room had a view of the Arno which is a block away. The rooms were quiet (except for the few times when the church bell outside our window rang calling folks to Mass). Breakfast was predictable (cereal, cheese, meat, yogurt, chocolate/coffee/cappuccino) but more than adequate - the cappuccino comes with a happy face topping it which always reflected our mood while there.The Ponte Vecchio is MAYBE 3 blocks away and everything is within a 5-10 minute walk.I highly recommend the Alessandra.

<Content>Lovely Stay in Lovely Hotel Fabulous location and beautiful spacious rooms and baths. The front desk professionals were helpful and friendly. This is a charming hotel will tall ceilings, large rooms, antique furniture, and hardwood floors. We had the Junior Suite overlooking the Arno (well, it had a view of the Arno) and for awhile we had the Junior Suite with the Balcony with the view of the Arno. Nothing is more than a 5 or 10 minute walk from the hotel.

<Content>Conveniently located, helpful staff Hotel Alessandra is a very comfortable, reasonably priced hotel to stay while visiting Florence. Steps from the Ponte Vecchio, the hotel is convenient to many restaurants and sites. It's on a rather quiet street. You must go up a flight of steps before getting to the elevator, (teeny tiny) and then have the possibility of going up or down more steps. The room was comfortable and clean. The staff at Hotel Alessandra is extremely helpful. I would recommend this hotel for people who are not turned off by small bathrooms, and steps. Although not a 3 star hotel, served our purpose in Florence.

<Content>Awesome Alessandra Something amazing happened when I stayed at Hotel Alessandra recently in late Oct 2007: my single room with bathroom got upgraded (for free) to a huge, beautiful suite with awesome views of the Arno River and Ponte Vecchio! How lucky could I be! I couldn't believe it: there were four parts to the massive and tastefully decorated suite with living/reading room, king sized bed, large antique wooden full length mirror, marble bathroom, persian carpets, a study alcove, terraza -and it seemed like i was right on the water! Needless to say, I was over the moon. The location of the hotel is fantastic and handy to all sights in the day time and for taking a stroll over the scenic ponte in the evenings. The hotel staff, Andrea and his sister, who speak v good English, plus the ever so friendly porter (also named Andrea, I think), made me feel like one of the family. The building itself is historic and lovely, with a quaint antique elevator which i so enjoyed using, and the breakfast was more than ample. I will definitely be back! (I am from NZ and Singapore)

<Content>prime location The hotel is ideally located for the sights AND it is quiet. ( our room was next to the church tower whose bells ring on the hour from 0900 to 2100; I confess I love bells) The room and public areas were immaculate with probably the most friendly and helpful management we have met (anywhere). We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel Try the hotel Monday Special day trip if you want a flavour of Tuscany ,Good value and the driver is mainly silent. (joy)

<Content>Nice, historic, great location. Located 1 block from the Uffizi and close to several family-run restaurants, this historic hotel was great. Our LARGE room with a bell tower outside the window was a nice touch. The building is so old that you have to climb the first floor to get to the elevator. There are 2 keys; one for the room, one for electricity. Take the latter one out and the lights go off. The bathroom was a little weird, down a Being John Malkovich hallway and a few steps. It wasn't the cleanest and they didn't change the sheets after one day. If you are immune to feelings of ghosts and such, you're golden. If you are weird about that, then you probably shouldn't stay here. They are picky about the fridge so be careful what you take -- it's expensive and they'll charge you every dime for it. The internet is SLOW and only one station makes for uncomfortably annoying sighing and staring behind you from other tourists. Average.

<Content>perfect hotel, perfect location Huge room with the most beautiful view overlooking the water plus a yummy breakfast. The hotel was perfect, the location was perfect, and the price was perfect. Stay here. I can't remember my room number but just ask for the room with the big windows and the view facing the water. Come sunset pick up a bottle of wine, some cheese and bread, and grab a seat on the bridge a block away to see the most magnificent sunset. I'd also recommend renting a motor scooter (two people can share one) to drive out to the Tuscan countryside and Sienna. There's only one road so the trip is easy and the views are breathtaking. Florence is a beautiful city...Enjoy.

<Content>wonderful stay What a wonderful little hotel. So lovely and you really can't beat the location. The front desk was so helpful. They made museum reservations for us and when our tour to Tuscany was full, they arranged another for us and four other Americans with English speaking driver and a great van. They were pleasant and helpful, friendly and smiling. For the price, it was an excellent value. The rooms were the largest we had in three weeks in Europe. Clean, clean, clean. And the breakfast!!!! which was included by the way. By all means stay here!!

<Content>Great staff! Although there were technical difficulties with our stay (and we only ended up staying one night instead of two), the staff went out of their way to do everything possible to resolve the problem. Just before we arrived, the air conditioning failed in 3 of their rooms -- of course our room housed the a/c machinery. They were able to rebook us into another room for the first night but they were totally booked the second. Not only did they give us a huge discount on the huge room that they moved us to but they couldn't have been nicer. It all worked out in the end.....we decided to get out of hot and humid Florence and head to Lucca a day early. This hotel is VERY clean. The hike up the stairs to the elevator reminded me again that I should've packed lighter :)

<Content>Great place to start our trip! Hotel Alessandra was a great place to start our trip. It's location was wonderful, our room was very comfortable and the Hotel staff was very helpful and informative. Florence is a large city that was quite relaxed so it gave us time to get our bearings before moving on to Rome. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again if we travel back to Florence!

<Content>Great Hotel We booked this hotel based on the location, price and air conditioning. we were planning on staying in Florence for a week and using it as a home base for when we traveled to Pisa, Tuscany and Cinque Terra. It was a great find. Be prepared to walk up a few flights of stairs! the rooms are big and clean. TV has a few English stations. The hotel is located right near Ponte Vecchio and some rooms have a great view. The staff was very helpful in planning excursions with a tour or on your own helping you figure out train schedules, etc. Breakfast was wonderful! It definitely held you over through lunch. I highly recomend this hotel to anyone looking for a great Florence visit:)

<Content>Comfortable and convenient place in an excellent location I spent two nights here and was very pleased with the hotel location, which is really close to piazza della Signoria and Uffizi museum.The bedroom and the bathroom are both wide and pleasant, the bed is comfortable, the breakfast is rich and the staff, depending on who is at the reception, are either friendly or elegant.I slept very well here and would recommend this place; the only (big) drawback is that, on departure day, they will only keep your luggage until 2 pm.Other (smaller) drawbacks are: there's a 1 a.m. curfew and (for those carrying big luggage) you won't find an elevator right in front of the entrance, but will need to climb some stairs first.

<Content>Like everything else, there's the good and the bad We were here on honeymoon for 2 nights at the end of June. Location wise, this hotel was excellent. Just off the river and a few blocks from the major sites of the Uffizi and Duomo, and tonnes of upscale shopping just outside the door. Of course, Florence isn't too big anyways, but the hotel is central, which is great. To get to the front desk you have to go up stairs just to get to the elevator. This would be a hassle if you had heavy luggage. If you don't want to wait for the elevator, it's a few flights up. Our room was in a corner far away from the common areas, so it was very quiet. The TV remote was not working so the TV couldn't be turned on at all. It took a day to get us a new one that would work. The room and bedroom were large and clean and nice. The bed was comfortable as well. The room was well air conditioned, so it was very cool, which was great considering the temperatures were in the high 30's every day. Breakfast was a good selection of bread, cereal, fruits and juices and coffee. The front desk helped us big time, by finding us an available hotel for an unexpected extra night in Florence. There is a common area with a computer for internet use. You have to buy internet time from the desk. The computer is old and the connection is slow. (There are lots of internet cafe's in the area though with much faster connections) The hassle of giving up your keys to the desk whenever you leave, and getting up and down the stairs might not bother you considering the location, value and room condition are all above average.

<Content>The Best! My family of 5 absolutely loved this pensione. Yes, you must be prepared to walk up several flights of stairs, but who cares! The location could not be better. It is safe, quiet, and you can walk everyplace. It is a one minute walk to Pointe Vecchio. The rooms are huge, spotless and have A/C. I always request a quiet location, away from hotel and street noise and I certainly was not disappointed. The breakfast is served beautifully and every staff member is kind and courteous.One special note must be made about the owners, Andrea and his mother. Both could not have been more accomodating. Most of my experience was with Andrea. He is quick to respond to any and every email sent to him before your stay. I requested travel information, private guide informaton, sightseeing information and he kindly replied to ever one, and in great detail. The day we left, he called a taxi for us, and even stayed with us downstairs and made sure that the taxi came, brought us all to the correct location, and made sure that all our luggage fit.I cannot recommend this place more highly, and I am a very particular person!FayeSouth Florida

<Content>The hotel is worth the hike upstairs! What a delightful staff and accommodation in Florence. The hotel is located conveniently to all the major sites. The hotel is located upstairs, so be forewarned if you tend to travel with large, heavy luggage! The building does have a small lift but we only noticed it working once during our 3 day stay. The staff helped us repair our luggage; find great restuarants; and offer suggestions for day trips with teenagers in tow. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends.

<Content>Not so good We just came back from our 2 week honeymoon in Italy. Stayed in Hotel Alessandra in Florence for 3 nights and were very disappointed with our stay. Pros: (1) The room we had was large compared to European standards and the ceilings were very high. The bathroom was also very spacious - the biggest one of the 5 hotels visited during our trip. (2) The location was great and within a 5 min walk of the Uffizi Gallery and the Ponte Vecchio bridge. Cons: (1) Warning if you have big suitcases: you must first go up a flight of stairs(equivalent to the U.S. 2nd floor) in order to get to the elevator Once you get to the elevator it is tiny. It was so small that I had to go up with my luggage first and then send the elevator down for my husband and his luggage. (2) The front door to the building is locked and you don't get a key. So you have to buzz in, in order to get into the building. (3) Rules: you have to turn the key in to the front office everytime you leave. Because of this, there is a curfew of 1AM. So in other words, if you like coming in and out as you please, which you do when you are site seeing, its very disturbing to have to go to the front desk all the time to drop off and get the key. Also, if you want to stay out late, now you have this teenager curfew in the back of your mind. We asked what would happen if we came back after 1, and he confirmed that there is no one at the front desk, but the night attendant sleeps at the hotel so you'll just be waking him up. One night we came back at around midnight and were buzzing to open the front door for about 10 minutes before being heard. We thought we would have to camp out. (4) The walls were paper thin. Every morning we would hear everything from the plates and silverware in the breakfast room being prepared and or picked up, attendants cleaning the room next to us, the elevator door slamming, room doors opening and closing. It was just horrible.We would defintely not stay here again.

<Content>Palace built in 1507 made us feel like princesses 5/15-5/18/06Recently returned from trip to Europe. This was definitely our favorite hotel. We stayed at fancier and more expensive hotels but the ambience and the friendliness of the staff here made it our favorite stay. Built in 1507 it has extremely high ceilings; a small lift (but you have to get your luggage up one story to use it) and walls and floors that do not exactly form 90 degree angles. Breakfast was nice with juices, cereals, ham, cheese, yogurts, coffee and teas. The breakfast room was intimate and reminded us of our favorite bed and breakfasts where you can strike up a conversation and get other tourists' recommendations. We stayed in the only quad with four single beds lined up in a row. We overlooked a small piazza and the red roof tiles of Florence. The windows were double pane so unless they were open we did not have street noise. Our bathroom was beautiful and enormous with huge tub, bidet,  sink. The location was excellent. We were a block from Ponte Vecchio within walking distance to all the tourist sights and great shopping. The owners have an arrangement with a private tour company normally reserved for 4 star hotels. For a reasonable fee we rented a car  driver for a long day. Our driver took us to areas close to the city then drove us around Tuscany and a designer outlet mall while telling us about the history of the region. He told us that 3 days before he had driven Paul Newman around town. We would recommend this hotel to other people who love seek value, comfort and historical ambience.

<Content>Loved it We spent five wonderful nights in the Hotel Alessandra and we loved it. Don't let the small side-street location or the tiny elevator to the second floor pensione put you off. Once you are in the hotel, you will realize you've hit on a gem. The location is perfect. Everything that you might want to see in Florence is within easy walking distance of the Alessandra. Our room with its modern private bath was spacious and very clean. We paid a little extra to get a room with a view of the Arno and the Ponte Vecchio and thought the money was well-spent. Andrea, the manager, and Anna who also worked the front desk were terrific. They were friendly and helpful. They gave advice on sights to see, restaurants to visit, and where to get good gelato. They were also very helpful when we wanted to make advance reservations at the Uffizi and the Academia. We would recommend the Alessandra to any travelers who want to stay within the heart of Florence, but still want old-fashioned ambiance.

<Content>Wonderful Location I stayed at the Hotel Alessandra in April of 2006. The hotel is on a small side street in the Centro Storico district of Florence, a location that is extremely convenient for walking to most of the major toursit sights of Florence. At 145 euro/night, this is a budget hotel in Florence. It's on the 4th floor of an old, but remodeled building. There is a tiny elevator about halfway up the first flight of stairs to help you get your bags up to the hotel. Hint- bring small luggage pieces if you want to take advantage of the lift. The sleeping rooms are what you might expect in a budget hotel, they were clean and well kept, if not particularly attractive. There is a common sitting room in the hotel where you can use a computer to handle your email and the dining room/breakfast area is sunny and pleasant. I found the breakfast better than average for a budget hotel, with lots of cold cereal choices, juice, cheese, ham, panino and of course, coffee or capucino. The hotel owner, Andrea, and his staff are very friendly and accomodating, always ready with information and recommendations. For budget travelers and those not adverse to climbing stairs, I easily recommend this holel with one caveat. Pay your bill with cash and not credit card. I used my credit card and the hotel ran its own euro to dollar coversion before applying the the charge to my credit card. The rate they used to convert was significantly higher than the normal exchange rate your credit card bank charges.

<Content>The Best! We were in Italy for 12 nights, fortunately 4 of them were in this hotel. The location was fabulous: close to everything, but on a secluded side street that didn't have much noise. The room was beautiful and the view of the Arno was everything we expected. We didn't mind the slight walk upstairs and we found the breakfast to be great....not sure what those people who wrote negative reviews were expecting. It was one of the better breakfasts we had it Italy.But I save the best review for the staff. They were wonderful and really made our stay special. Each one had a great suggestion for eating or drinking and arrangements were made for restaurants and museums with no problem. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a pleasant stay in beautiful Florence!

<Content>GREAT service GREAT service. They are so kind and helpful - gave us maps to everything, places to eat, help in finding things, and internet service (for a fee). We had room no. 7 which did not face the water, but it was a nice large room with a matrimonial bed - which was actually two beds pushed together. But it was fine and clean with a nice bathroom. Breakfast is good - cereal, yogurt, pastries, coffee and juice. As all the review say, there are stairs - but once you get past them it is worth it. We will definately stay there next time in Florence.

<Content>Very welcoming and enjoyable place to stay My cousin and I flew to Italy, Florence from Gatwich in London to visit our relatives in December. The Hotel Alessandra we found was a good Hotel and in a fabulos location making easy walking trough the Old City. The staff at the Hotel were obliging and the breakfast served was excellent offering many choices. We would not hesitate to stay there again. We only had 4 days there but I intend and hope to return to Florence and expore even the sourraunding areas. What a beautiful City. The room we shared was a big room with good facilities. We were able to move the two single beds into different situations and found the size adequate to accommodate us. The atmosphere of the Hotel was welcoming and the staff courteous. The rooms were clean and well serviced with TV and CNNchannel to stay in touch with news.Can't wait to get back............

<Content>Quiet and comfortable haven We had booked another hotel in this area via a suggestion from an Italian friend - which turned out to be a mistake. Following a disturbed night, we walked around the area and found the Alessandra Hotel. They showed us a very quiet room at the back of their building (room 226) which looked the river. The room was spacious, welcoming and comfortable. There is aircon and your own controlled heateher. The bathroom was big, clean and well-equipped, the shower was very powerful and everything worked. This hotel is in a marvellous area, within walking distance of everything but peaceful and atmospheric. There are many typically Trattorias and other eating places close to hand, and it is a delightful area to walk around at night..

<Content>Nice souvenirs We stayed at the Alessandra about 5 years ago. There were three of us and found beds to be firm like we all like, not always like this鈥?Excellent location ,clean, and friendly staff. The Continental breakfast was a little limited, but provides all the necessities. Rooms were beautiful with some antiques

<Content>Large rooms, friendly staff, good location Our October 2005 stay of two nights were very pleasant. The rooms are large, the bathrooms modern, beds comfortable. The staff were all quite helpful and friendly and we appreciated the internet access available for a small fee to guests. The breakfast was quite good with many choices. The entrance into the hotel is a bit odd and stark, with the reception several floors up. The Ponte Vecchio and Ufizzi are only a few minutes walk, but if you arrive via train, take a cab unless you're travelling very light. I'd certainly suggest this hotel to anyone travelling who was looking for a mid-priced hotel.

<Content>Very happy with this hotel! We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights ( the longest single stay during our 3 week trip to Europe) and found it near perfect. The price was right, the location was right, and the room was incrediably large and well furnished. We were a bit thrown off by the lobby being hidden away on the fourth floor but once we found our way and got over hiking up the stairs, we were charmed with the overall setting. Breakfast was served on the same floor as reception and the large sitting room where internet access was available. We did find the service to vary considerably. The wonderful gentleman working reception at night was friendly, considerate and thoughtful (even offering us an umbrella when it rained one night)!! On the other hand we found the younger man working in the mornings to be a bit rude, scolding us for not turning in our key when we left one morning. It might have been warranted had anyone explained that policy when we checked in.... All in all, we were pleased with our stay.

<Content>Good location, average hotel . . . You couldn't beat the location of this hotel. It's an an average hotel, but good for the price. The rooms do vary greatly. We had a nice room (four ladies shared it), but our travelling companions room was not so great. It had a very bad odor to it. If you like hiking up stairs, this is the place for you. About four flights up to the lobby, and the elevator is a accessed from the second one. All in all, it was okay. I would probably do a little more research next time and find another hotel in the area.

<Content>Excellent Value, Great Location I booked directly through their web site and was given an excellent rate of 50 euros/night for a single, shared bath. I was very pleasantly surprised. The room was huge by European/Italian standards with a large double bed, high ceilings with crown molding. The bathroom was right next door and, since the other room sharing the bath was never occupied during my stay, I basically had it to myself. The breakfast was good, with some meat and cheese offered in addition to the bread options. The location was great, around the corner from the Ponte Rialto, a couple of blocks from the Piazzale Signorial. Would definitely stay there again at those rates.

<Content>Clean, nice, friendly, roomy We stayed for 5 nights. the rooms were roomy and comfortable. Andrea and his mother were very welcoming gracious. The breakfast was charming and good. Our room had a view of the Duomo and the street below. It was very serene. If I had to find any faults, it would be the small elevator, having to climb stairs to get to the elevator, and the very small TV. Other than those very minor inconveniences, it was great. The location was close to all the major attractions.

<Content>Great location, beautiful rooms I hear the rooms vary tremendously, but ours was fabulous: High ceilings, lots of space, and it overlooked the rooftop garden across the street. We were there in the middle of a heat wave, and the air conditioner didn't always work. Also, the Internet was down. And bring your own soap. The biggest challenge was the stairs ... 40 of them before you reach an elevator, which fits only two skinny people or one person with small luggage. But this really is a beautiful, old hotel with the perfect location. Service was very friendly, too. TIP: Buy water from the front desk! It's half the price of any bottled water you'll find in nearby shops.

<Content>Great Location! Hotel Alessandra is a small family run hotel that is perfectly located in Florence. It is roughly a block away from the Ponte Vecchio and and my room was quite comfortable with working air conditioning. When I was there, the internet connection was down each time I requested to use it and the air conditioning in the breakfast room was broken. Since we were in the middle of a huge heat wave, everyone was sweating through breakfast. BUT I did not go to Florence to sit in the hotel, so the price and location made it just great for me. I would definitely consider going back, but you should realize that the elevator is not on the ground floor. You will need to carry your luggage up a flight of stairs first and that may matter to you if you are not traveling light.

<Content>Loved it! Alessandra is a great place to stay!! Everyone was so nice and helpful. The room was huge and clean. Our room actually had a lot of mosquitos due to the tree outside of our balcony..told the front desk and we were given a plug to keep the bugs away which helped! The breakfast was great also. The stairs are long but it's not that bad. The elevator works as well. Have a great stay in Florence..you'll love Alessandra!

<Content>Suite Place to Stay Everything about the Alessandra is a real pleasure. We decided to splurge and stay in the Baccio Suite for a week. Very large living room, bedroom, small study and a terrace looking out over the Arno. There is a Murphy bed in the living room so 2 couples can easily share. 1 block from the Ponte Vecchio, 2 from the Uffizi and still very quiet most of the time (except for the belltower!) The hosts, Anna and the 2 Andrea's, are fluent in English, friendly, and took care of everything we needed. Highly recommended. If you don't want a suite, ask for one of the rooms facing the Arno. #26 is especially lovely.

<Content>Lovely Place to stay Last week while on vacation to Europe, we stayed at a beautiful hotel in Florence. It was the Hotel Alessandra. Upon arrival and not used to some of the hotels in Italy, we had a bit of a climb to the elevator up stairs that while easy to manage, weren't expected. While heading up with the luggage and then entering into a small elevator, again, American and unused to these things, we were greeted by very friendly staff and escorted to our room. Which was huge, by the way. Very clean and with an almost palacial feel to it. The view from our room was delightful. It is located very near the Ponte Vecchio and close to several excellent restaurants....I know, for those of you who have spent time in Italy, there are a lot of excellent restaurants. The staff made us feel welcome and were always ready to assist us with anything we needed. The one was one of our better hotels in Europe. We're going back.

<Content>Good Hotel, Excellent Location My husband and I just returned from a wonderful trip to Italy (Rome, Florence and Siena). We found the Alessandra to be a fine choice for the money - we paid 108 Euro for a double/no bath, though the room did have a sink which was very handy. The room was a good size and pretty clean, although the wood floors were a bit dusty. The bathroom down the hall was small but clean and we never had to wait to use it. We did learn one thing about ourselves though - - we are too old (early 50's) to be trotting down the hall in the middle of the night. All our other hotels had a full bath and we would upgrade next time. There is a small elevator but you better figure on taking the stairs at least some of the time. Staff was very helpful with reservations to museums etc. The best part was the location - an easy walk to everything. It was so nice to be able to stop back by the hotel during the day if you forgot something or wanted to change.

<Content>Great Hotel! My two daughters and I have just returned from our trip to Florence, Rome and England. Of all the hotels we stayed this one was by far the best. The stairs were a little difficult with our heavy bags, but at each landing we took a rest and continued on. The staff was very, very warm and welcoming. Our room was huge (we had a triple) and exceptionally clean as was the good size bathroom, which was sparkling clean and modernized. Our view overlooked the street and we could see the Duomo from our window. The area was quiet and we felt very safe walking back at night. The hotel is very centrally located to all the attractions and shops. Breakfast was more than enough with several choices of croissants, rolls, ham, cheese, cereals, juices, tea. Even with the stairs, I would definitely stay at the Alessandra again!

<Content>Alessandra a good deal for the location Our room was big, comfortable and clean. The three of us rattled around in it. The bathroom was a little utilitarian, and they were stingy with the soap (I had to go out and buy my own soap and shampoo), but for its price point, just fine. And you can't beat the location -- just minutes from the Duomo, the museums and the Ponte Vecchio. The mother and son who run it are incredibly courteous, warm and kind. The breakfast wasn't anything special -- we usually skipped it and grabbed a bite elsewhere.

<Content>Nice rooms, but hated the curfew I have just returned back from vacationing in the wonderful Florence, Italy. We stayed at Hotel Alessandra and have to say that it was very nice there, but its on the second floor, so you have to walk up a lot of stairs to get to their lobby area. Plus, really the only bad part is that they have a curfew which can be a problem if you don't know what time you're returning. If that doesn't matter to you, then its a great place to stay.

<Content>Would recommend to anyone Good value, perfect location and excellent family-run staff. The only drawback is that you have to walk up 3 flights of stairs to get the reception, however, all other aspects were ideal.

<Content>What a disappointment!! Reviews are not kidding about the stairs and the small elevator. Be warned!! If the elevator is broken, you will have to walk up a lot of stairs. If you have heavy bags you will be sorry. Once inside, the pensione is dark and there are more stairs, depending on the room you have. The rooms are large though which was a plus. If you need to open the window, it will be very noisy. The bathroom door was falling apart and could have been moldy at the bottom from water damage. The breakfast was poor. It was centrally located and very close to Original Walking Tours of Florence which we recommend highly.

<Content>Best Bargain and Superior Service I was to have gone to Florence several years ago, partly on government business, partly on personal travel to a seminar in Florence. As it happened, the business reason for my visit evaporated and so did my government per diem financial compensation! Nonetheless, I was commited to the seminar and happened upon a guidebook listing of the Allesandra and booked probably the cheapest (67 Euro) room. All was set, until I arrived in Florence deprived of my luggage (thanks to Alitalia..!!) and with only 2 hours before the first night's reception of my seminar!! Not a problem, as I was expertly advised by Andreas to head on foot to a particular men's clothing store near the train station and I was soon outfitted in a respectable set of Italian threads for less than $200 in time for my appointment. This plus much other helpful advice from the hotel staff added to the value and great location of this pensione hotel!

<Content>Highlight of our trip to Italy! We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in Oct 2003, and it was a memorable experience. What sets Hotel Alessandra apart is the people who work there. You will feel like you have your own personal concierge! Warm, friendly, and bending over backwards to meet your needs. The rooms are fine, nothing fancy, the breakfast appealing, and we were not unduly troubled by the outside street noise (the location is on a sidestreet, but there are a couple of bars within earshot). On the other hand, you are located 2 blocks from the Ponte Vecchio, and many other major sites. Highly recommended.

<Content>Great little place! This was the least expensive place we stayed in Italy but probably the best. It is in a great location. We had a double room with private bath which was quite large with a high ceiling. Shower pressure was good. The people at the desk were very helpful, there was cheap internet access, and a decent breakfast. Only thing, there were tons of stairs. You have to climb up about 30 steps to get to the elevator, then you are at the hotel. Then to get up to our room from the hotel desk, we had to climb a long staircase to get to our floor, about 30 more steps. This was with our luggage and everything. The elevator only saved us about a 3rd of the amount of stairs, so half the time it wasn't even worth it. This was fine for us because we are young, but we can't imagine an older couple being able to deal with those stairs and all that luggage them selves.

<Content>Great location, Nice Rooms! My friends and I stayed at the Pensione Alessandra on May 22, 2004. We had two double rooms w/private baths. Our room was nice and very spacious. Although the bathroom was small, the shower was roomy. We had a large window with shutters that overlooked the street. The breakfast was good: ham, cheese, cereal, pastries, coffee and juice. Andrea and Anna were very kind and helpful. My friends dropped off some laudry the day before we checked in, Andrea sent it out that day and had it ready when we checked in the next day. She even paid for it first!! Anna was very kind and tried to help us with changing our Uffizi reservations and with our dinner reservations. We left messages for other friends who were in Florence and they received them with no problems at all. By the way, the pensione has an elevator, it's small, but definitely big enough to send your luggage up so you do not have to carry it. It also has a computer to access the internet. The best thing about the pensione is that it is located in one of the best locations. It is around the corner from the Ponte Vecchio bridge, the Duomo, Accademia, Uffizi and walking distance to the train station. It is also surrounded by wonderful shops! Needless to say, I would definitely stay here again and I would highly recommend you do too!!

<Content>Location! Hotel Alessandra was in a great location. We walked from the train station with minimal problems. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was fair, but would recommend saving your morning coffee for a pastry shop nearby. The rooms were spacious with large window overlooking the street.

<Content>nice hotel but noisy This is a family run hotel with a great location, near the PonteVecchio. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the room was lovely and very large. The only problem was that there was a lot of noise on the street at night....often until 3 or 4 in the morning. It was hard to sleep! The noise wasn't traffic, it was young people, coming home from a night out and were quite drunk and loud.Breakfast was adequate but not wonderful.

<Content>Great Service, Great location, Great Price! stayed 4 nights; VERY helpful and friendly staff (Andre recommended restaurant, Nella around the corner from the hotel which was fantastic!); also very helpful when it came to reserving museums, etc. Spacious, well-maintained rooms, and convenient location. Breakfast (included) was filling and varied. I would definitely stay there again, and recommend to anyone traveling to Florence.
