<Content>great hotel! Me and my husband have just returned from a 5 night stay at The Garden Inn Hilton. It is located 10 mins from the City Centre by bus. The bus stop is close by and really cheap, fast and efficient.It was nice to stay away from the hustle and bustle of Florence City Centre.Taxis cost between 10 and 15 euros.The Hilton is extremely modern and very welcoming. All staff are very efficient. In particular, Georgio the head barman, is a great personality and makes great cocktails.We booked a tour of Tuscany from the Hotel reception. It's a 12 hour bus tour round Tuscany and I would definately recommend it. The cost is 80 euros each but well worth the money.The open top bus tours round the City is a must at the beginning of your trip as it shows the many attractions Florence has to offer.All in all we had a wonderful vacation and will certainly return and stay at The Hilton Garden Inn.

<Content>Modern, Contemporary, Lovely Hotel!!! My wife and I stayed at this lovely Hotel on a 2 day break to Florence. Although it is not in a centre location, it is only a 15 euro taxi ride from the centre of Florence or as we did once a number 22 bus a short walk from the hotel for a mere 1.20 euros each!!! The hotel is very clean and modern. The staff are professional and friendly. The room had a hugh king bed, superb wooden floors, LCD tv, glass wardrobes, sleek finishes everwhere and you get the use of robes. Also a hugh luxury bathroom. Breakfast was more than adaquate, plenty of choice from the hot and cold buffet. I have stayed in many Hilton Garden Inns before (mainly USA) most are of a good standard but this is the best yet!!! It may not have the character of a central Florence Boutique Hotel but sometimes it is nice to get out of the centre of a city you have walked around all day and this Hotel met our needs perfectly.

<Content>Very modern  We picked this hotel because we like new, modern and clean places to stay while on holiday. The Hilton Garden Inn met all these requirements for us.The only issue I had, and why I didn't give it 5 stars is because of it's location. It's not in walking distance to main siights of Florence and because of the weather (35 degrees C) it was too hot to get the very crowded bus so we had to get a taxi into town every day which varied in cost but was approx 12euros each way.The rooms were very nice. New, nicely decorated, spotlessly clean and the shower was great. It was a really nice place to come back to after a days sight seeing in the summer heat.A perfect business hotel and a good place to stay for tourists who prefer a more modern alternative to most of the city centre hotels.

<Content>Generally ok room noise is an issue The hotel is located in the area of Novoli and not far away from the Amerigo Vespucci Aeroporto di Firenze.Florence is relatively small city however you may need to have your own car in order to access centro comfortably.Parking,is available in front of the hotel and free of charge.Our check in, was smooth and the polite receptionist explained us all about the sights of Florence, she even offered us a booking to the Uffizzi museum in order to avoid the 3 hour queues.The lobby is lively with nice Italian contemporary furniture and has a library, with quality books relative to Florence and Tuscany.Internet access, is free all over the hotel, even in your room.Business center, is a sound proof room with 2 PC s, copier, fax machine and plenty of stationary, located in the lobby.Our room was spacious with tastefull furniture and an office with a very comfortable chair.Bathroom was large with a shower plate and good pressure.All bathroom amenities were Neutrogena of a very good quality.Mini bar, is a history in their room and well done, after all, prices are always sky-rocketing and unjustified.In case you are in need of something you can use a very well stocked Pavillion close to the reception and prices are ok.There is an issue, with room noise, due to the very poor sound proof materials that have been used, I guess.Noise was coming from the floor above and side rooms.In the morning we wake up hearing footsteps from above and people carrying suitcases.It was very disturbing.Breakfast buffet choices,are in need of improvement both in terms of quality and definetely variety.On the contrary we dinned for two consecutive nights in the restaurant and everything was nice, attentative service and tastefull and well presented dinner plates served.

<Content>Not a hotel it's a Garden Inn This hotel (actually every complaint I made was answered with this is not a hotel, it is a Garden Inn) looks quite attractive in the lobby and bar but it stops right there.They had our reservation information incorrect.There was no two bottles of water provided But they would sell them to us.there was no shaving cream, tooth brushes, toothpaste shampoo etc providedThere was no concierge. The front desk covered that job but they repeatedly did not know the answers to my common questions.They did not know the length of the tour for which they sold ticketsThey charged $95 for a tour that their own literature indicated $90. They corrected the charge when I brought it to their attentiontheir General manager refused to answer six different phone calls.their elevators were inoperative on three occasions (Once because of extended cleaning, once because the service elevator was inoperative and they took over the passenger elevator to move baggage)On three occasions my card key did not workthe printer on the computer PC did not work. Eventually they summoned a geek who came in and got it working againthey failed to make one wake up callThey did not know of the nearby banks operating hoursThey did not know of a nearby hairdressers location, hours or even if it was open They were unaware of a nearby supermarkets operating hoursWhen asked about transportation to Ponte Vecchia etc they said we should hire a taxi ($22) even though there was a trolley a short distance from the hotel.The dining room was supposed to be open for service until 2230 however wwhen we showed up at 2225 they refused to allow us in even though there were several people still eating.The hotel charged extra for breakfastWe finally left the hotel two days early because of our repeated disapointments.

<Content>Excellent value for business travellers We stayed here only one night on our last day in Italy. We chose this hotel because it's a stone's throw away from the airport of Florence. We had to catch a morning flight, so we wanted to be close from the airport to avoid the rush. We found this hotel refreshing, maybe because it was strikingly different from the houses where we stayed for the previous two weeks.The hotel is full of up-to-date gadgets you can expect from a business hotel in US, and offers convenient facilities such as 24/7 free internet and business center, and self-service pantry shop. Everything is shiny and bright. Modern and tasteful decoration. The staffs were kind and efficient, and the room and the bathroom SPACIOUS. It is quite far from the city center. It took us about half an hour to the center by bus. The surrounding area is under construction (kind of development project is going on). Our stay here was uneventful and we rested up before our flight. However, I would not choose it for my vacation, not only because its distance from the historic center, but because it made me feel as if I were in US. It would be excellent for a business traveller. The price/quality value is exceptionally good.

<Content>Excellent service and affordable rates I spent an extended weekend with my two teenage kids here, 2-5 May, and was very positively surprised! I travel a lot on business, typically staying at the large, international hotel chains, which do provide all necessary services and efficiency for business travellers, but typically are so clinical, inpersonal and frankly, boring. So while on holiday trips I try to stay at small, family-owned local hotels. For this trip though, on short notice, the only thing I could find was Hilton. It was to our great surprise and pleasure that this particular Hilton turned out to be a very unusual combination of small scale personality and warmth, with a very friendly atmosphere, while still being efficient and providing a level of service to be expected from business class hotels. All staff we dealt with, reception, restaurant, bar, house keeping etc, were very friendly and did their utmost to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Getting an extra bed into our room was no problem, and wasn't even charged extra for. I typically try to avoid having dinner at hotel restaurants, particularly while staying in Italy, where excellent restaurants are to be found everywhere (if you care to stroll away a few min from the tourist traps) but for practical reasons we decided to have dinner at the hotel the first night. The food turned out to be very good, and we ended up having dinner at the hotel each night. The hotel is located some distance from the historical city centre, but local buses take you to/from there in 10-15 min. The room rates were also a positive surprise, you'll get a lot of value for your money.All in all, we are extremely pleased with our experince staying at Hilton Garden Inn.

<Content>Our worst hotel of the week Only during the first few minutes inside this hotel, we knew the staff was going to be an issue. During our check-in the staff was rude and lacked service skills. Although the hotel only had one guest computer working at the time, they didn't work well with us to ensure we had a turn in using it. When a group of teenagers decided to create a list that would not allow us to use the computer until 1am, I complained to the manager (this is after waiting over an hour patiently). He was not concerned, and even told me to take a bus downtown to use a library computer. Our whole trip in Europe was uneventful, except for this one hotel. They need to work on their service skills, and appreciate those from other countries who decide to spend their money at their location, especially those Diamond members who work hard to stay within the Hilton family.

<Content>Terrific Staff, Gorgeous Property We travel extensively and have often received excellent service. However, we have rarely been motivated to seek out a property's General Manager to praise the efforts of the staff. We were more than happy to do this in Florence. From the Front Desk staff to the restaurant and bar personnel, we were always greeted warmly, our requests were always attended to quickly and with the highest professionalism. After each day of touring the city, we returned to our hotel and felt like we were returning home. If there were a higher rating than Excellent, the staff at this hotel - to a person - would definitely deserve it.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel is first class, great service, good food, and helpful staff. Not close to downtown but the city bus gets you there and back easy and cheap and the front desk sells the bus ticket.

<Content>Loved this hotel This was almost my favorite hotel in Rome. The amenities were excellent. The location is a little way out but you can get bus tickets for 1Euro at the front desk to get into town.The hotel was clean, Staff - well they got me a same day reservation into the museums - wonder of wonder. Food was good.. Ok I really enjoyed it, as a matter of fact I enjoyed it so much I stayed 3 days in stead of 1.This area is building up with I think the court of justice is being built next to it and let me tell you soon it wont be as cheap as it is.BTW - did I mention the dial up beds - the most comfortable of all I stayed in in Italy.YOu will really enjoy this hotel - first class.

<Content>Pretty good hotel but a little far from the attractions My wife and I stayed here for a couple of nights in June. Overall, we had a good experience at this location.Pros: Brand new property, very good rooms, great dining options, exceptionally good serviceCons: the distance from the main attractions; poor after hours technology support - our internet connection went down in the evening and the staff just threw up their hands in helplessness, construction around the placeOther useful information: This property is very close to a bus stand and hence was quite convenient for us to get to and from of the city center.

<Content>Fabulous way to spend the night before an early flight home This hotel is easy to find, parking is easy, welcome most hospitable, and the room was delightful. There is a business center where I could check e-mail at no charge, a bar and restaurant -- even a library for travelers who have run out of books! There are also laundry machines available on the garage level. My room was very large, pleasant, comfortable, with interesting, attractive design features. This is not a hotel for someone who wants to stay in the heart of Florence, but I have stayed in the heart of Florence, at a dump where it was difficult to park and everything was more than a little dirty. I would stay here happily any time. This would be a great place to spend the first night after a long flight into Italy, as well. Wonderful!

<Content>Nice Hotel, Okay location, Beware the Luggage Racks! Once you get to the hotel, the interior is quite new and modern. It opened in October 2006. It's about a 10 minute crowded bus ride from the historic part of downtown.It is in an area where there is a lot of construction. Currently, the surroundings are not all that great, but that may change depending on what ends up being built.The main issue we had was with the in-room luggage rack. I set my daughters luggage on the rack, no problem. The next morning, the cleaning staff removed her luggage to find 2-3 of the leather straps on luggage rack had split at their seems. The luggage was 45-50 pounds (within airline baggage limits), nothing unusual. The hotel claimed we must of set it down hard or in some way were too rough. My question is why they moved her luggage? Normally, messing with a guests luggage is something hotels never do out of fear of complaints about missing items. So my assumption is that they knew it was weak and were checking it, otherwise, there is no reason for them to be moving luggage. The break was not visible unless you laid on the ground and crawled underneath or if you removed the luggage. Anyway, the manager got in my face wagging his finger at me saying we broke it and we needed to pay for it. When I refused, he angrily threatened to report me to Hilton, which is fine by me. I'll be reporting that manager to Hilton as well.Anyway, besides the luggage rack and the location, I found the hotel very spacious, clean, and modern, and liked the hotel. Would stay there again, but keep my luggage on the floor.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay This hotel is modern, but not bleak like most modern decor hotel rooms. Rooms had some warmth to it and furnished nicely. Nice bathroom about the size of the US hotel bathrooms. (not small like European bathrooms) Good breakfast. A real plus to have free wifi (internet). The room was decent size, Very clean. Nice amenities. Only negetative was finding it using hotel's directions. Spent 3 + hours trying to find the hotel per their directions. Also not near the historical district but we were able to get a bus about 3 min. from hotel. Bus took about 10 to 15 min. to get to train station and bus was very easy to use both coming and going. I would definitely recommend this hotel

<Content>The ideal modern business-hotel in Florence (Novoli/Rifredi) I have been several times at the Hilton garden Inn Novoli now and with pleasure. It is the ideal business-hotel in Florence and this at reasonable rates. It is new (sinc Oct 2006), modern, light. clean, and extremely friendly staffed.It is not in the town-center, but Rifredi railway-station is 5 minutes by taxi. The rooms are spacious, with the most excellent beds (actually a lseep-system with adjustable air baffle system), a spacious glass desk, safe at notebook-plus size, comfortable clean bathroom with nice bath/shower. The very large window can be opened for fresh air. Internet-cable is free and the TV is the modern plasma type with BBC and CNN a.o.The hotel is in an area where a lot of buildings are being constructed so this hotel will become increasingly popular even though nowadays it seems quite often underoccupied.The restaurant provides high-quality food and wines with the same fine service and the bar is modern but quite fine for business-meetings. As a bonus, the lobby-library has a lot of books on loan.
