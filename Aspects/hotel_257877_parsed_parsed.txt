<Content>Get what you pay for! Basically with the Haven, the photos are a bit deceptive. The building isn't lovely, and the rooms certainly could do with a bit of a clean up and new decor. I also found for the price (which has gone up since the first time I stayed here) the place is getting a bit too expensive for what it is. The rooms are clean, but they don't have that pristine look about them, which would explain the reviews. I wouldn't say there was anything revolting about them - just the whole place could really do with a revamp. My room had plenty of room for what it was, though outside the noise echoed like crazy. I had to make a mobile phone call I am convinced the entire complex could hear. Because of this screaming kids in the pool were a pain. Absolute plus is the area - if there was another place to stay in Glebe would stay there in a heartbeat. Directly across the road is a bus-stop that takes you straight into the city - it's only about 5-10mins away, and so simple. There are plenty of places to eat, and a walk in the opposite direction of the city takes you to an amazing view of Anzac and Sydney Harbour Bridge. The area itself is completely stunning so if you're happy to get out of the hotel and explore you won't regret it. It is out of the city itself, so I would recommend becoming familiar with the very easy and cheap bus system. Overall it's what you make of it. If you want cheap accomodation where you can shove your stuff and explore a beautiful area of Sydney, it's great, but don't expect too much.

<Content>rude management the room we booked said for 3 adults. children 18  under free. complimentary cot. they charged us $25 for the rollaway bed which we call a Cot apparently in Australia they think 18 year olds should be able to sleep in bed with one of the 3 adults and that a cot is actually a crib to them. i don't know of many 18 yo's that are small enough to sleep in a crib. when i questioned them and told them they provided false advertising the manager was quite arrogant and rude and told me GOOD LUCK when I said I was going to complain. They have a new tv but no cable so you have a choice of 5 channels. the bathroom Redone consisted of faulty workmanship and a moldy shower. the toilet seat slid around and the balcony had nothing to sit on except an airconditioner to view the harbour that consisted of the store fronts across the street. There breakfast is a $15 continental breakfast that we usually get for free in the US at most hotels. it was cheaper to eat at the cafes across the street with a better atmosphere and more personable people. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>nothing like the photos The photos look nothing like the hotel. On the front of the hotel they also suggest that you can see the harbour but you would have to stand on the roof. There is no lift but they will help you with you cases I would not recommend anyone that has problems climbing up stairs or the disabled or elderly. The rooms are a bit tired looking not new as the photos would suggest. but look clean. I unfortuantley turned on the lights in the middle of the night lots of cockroaches running every where. The location is fantastic the buses run every 10 minutes just out the front but even better its on the rail line just 5 minutes walk from the hotel but once again a very steep climb back up as the road is all most vertical you could not manage it with high heels. Elderly or in a wheel chair would be to dangerous to atempt either way.The only thing that kept us there was the great restraunts across the road and the boutique pub great food and very friendly.

<Content>Haven? Only if you are hard of hearing. We booked in for 2 nights including Valentines Night. Not exactly the most romantic setting. (luckily we had a fantastic day/evening in the city!!). The hotel is on a very busy road  we had the worst 2 nights sleep of our entire trip. The aircon (if you can call it that) was just as bad. If the rooms have just been re-vamped then I dread to think what they were like before. We didn't mind the walk to the Harbour or city (the tram is good too) but this hotel is not as central as it tries to make out. Certainly not 1k to Darling Harbour. Glebe itself is great. Lots of restaurants. You won't starve. Don't bother booking in for breakfast. There are far better cafes nearby where you can watch the world go by. Won't be going back. Would rather pay the extra and get a good nights sleep!!

<Content>The Homeless Inn We booked this hotel from the internet and the pictures that were showing on the internet for this hotel do not look anything like the filthy hotel. I was suppose to be staying there for 3 nights with my husband, mum and daughter but checked out after the first night it was that bad. I have stayed in alot of basic accommodation all over the world and also in Australia but have never had anything as bad as this. We had booked a deluxe room with superior balcony to sleep four. There was nothing deluxe about the room and the balcony was certainly not superior. The room was that small you could not swing a cat in it. The bedding was filthy and was smelly. The furniture in the room was broken and outdated, the bathroom was filthy and the window had no glass at top and it felt like you were sleeping in Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow the noise was that bad. It stated on internet swimming pool opening hour 7am- 10pm but after 6pm it was so dark you could not swim and there was no lights. There was a sign on our landing pointing to the oasis bar but apparently there has been no bar for 10 years one of many lies i found. It also states on internet 1km from Darling Harbour this is another lie it is not 1km I would say nearer 2- 21/12km. They also have a picture of the rooms down the front of the hotel building showing lovely rooms, I think this was taken in another hotel as it looked nothing like the rooms in the hotel. After speaking to the manager the next morning i questioned him about the rooms and other facilities it was stating on internet. He was not the least bit intersted so we checked out and found ourselves a lovely hotel right down near the harbour and was 50 dollars cheaper. People be aware if considering this hotel as it looks nothing like the pictures on the internet and is dirty. We were not the only ones complaining that day another family had just checked in and were already asking reception if they could shorten their stay as it was that bad.

<Content>Absolutely Terrible! Absolutely awful start to our holiday!The reception staff were very rude to start with and had the sort of attitude that they could not be bothered.The hotel is in an area that is trying to updated but is still very run down and scruffy, in fact it is the worst area we visited in australia altogether.The hotel room was very basic, and in desperate need of an update. The sheets and towels were clean but the room was so old and run down it had a dirty feel about it. Overall, i would not reccommend this hotel to anyone and i would certainly tell anyone, when visting australia avoid Glebe altogether!!

<Content>It may not have been the perfect haven, but its what we were looking for My wife and I traveled to Sydney for 3 days in September this year. We were looking for a hotel that was well priced and gave us value for our money. Luckily we spotted The Haven Inn on the internet. To be frank, it was not the best hotel we have stayed at, but it did surpass our expectations. The staff were very friendly, breakfast was good value and rooms were kept tidy. We were also surprised by the location and the amount of different types of restraunts in the area. At first we thought getting around the city would be difficult, but it was a breeze with buses and the tram pretty much at the door step. I would definately recommend to people looking to stay in the city for value and service, but dont expect 5 star luxuries.

<Content>greas little place We stayed at the Haven Inn for four nights and had a great time.. Location is superb, My two biggies are a comfy bed and an excellent shower.. This had both and was clean and tidy.. It is not posh, but you are not paying posh either.. Location was the absolute best. so many restuarants and deli's, down the most interesting road in Sydney. The young ladies and gentlemen on the front desk were pleasant and helpful.

<Content>Sleepless nights. The hotel room was not particularly well appointed and the room we were allocated was in need of a complete overhaul. The floor tiles were coming up in places and the decor was generally very tired. The hotel was however fairly clean.Our room was on the corner of the hotel which faces onto Glebe Point Road and another road. Large single glazed windows face onto both roads and the bed was positioned in the corner under by the windows. Firstly this doesn't do much for privacy and secondly (and this was the last straw for us) every vehicle that passes by, feels like it has come right through the room. The buses and lorries from 06:00 are pretty bad, but the road sweeper sticks most vividly in the memory. Glebe Point Road is a busy main road!Value for money was poor anyway and even if the road wasn't there, you can stay in a far superior hotel much closer to the centre of Sydney for the same money. Our advice is to steer clear of this place and at the very least don't accept a corner room.

<Content>Budget Hotel This is clearly a budget hotel ,so would not reccommend paying a high price for any room.The bathrooms had been renovated and for myself who had a hire car and was not there alot during the day it served my needs.Would I stay there again ,no.But it had a satisfactory breakfast,,clean sheets, I slept well because I was tired,and there are many worse places for the a higher price. There are times in your life where you need a budget motel and this serves that need.But I warn anyone who books to ask for a first floor room as lugging a suitcase up three flights of stairs ,is a tedious exercise and also, when something goes wrong ,as did my credit card type key ,which did not work twice, my fault as I put it near my mobile phone apparently, I had to go down to the desk and then up again once it was re keyed. and then go back down again,good exercise I suppose. I am 52 so anyone contemplating staying there or anyone who is eldrly should reconsider staying here, because anything that involved an emergency would make it very difficult to get out in a rush, without an elevator.There is assistance to help with luggage, and I could definately have asked for that and should have done this..Balcony ,no room to swing a cat or sit on dirty chair, and little view of anything.Video would not work for my free DVD and as I rang the guy at the desk telling him about the problem, he came up immediatley and showed me how to get it working, and this impressed me.There are times in your life where you want a budget motel and this served my needs and the cost was very reasonable, considering many of the other hotels were either too expensive or booked out. If I was young and energetic I would stay there again.Staff did not say much or greet you each morning but it was only a relative type stay , so iIwasnot sightseeing and it served my needs.There was also an opportunity to take a walk and see some average Sydney homes and this in itself was enjoyable.

<Content>Avoid, avoid, avoid !! One word summary of this place - NOISY.The hotel is well-placed for public transport - the buses feel like they're right in your room. Glebe is not a bad area, but this hotel has little to recommend it. The hotel website seems to have taken creative photography to new heights, as our 'superior' balcony room looked nothing like the pictures - the couch was falling apart, the furniture was basic and worn, and there were bare wires hanging down above the shower head, where the bathroom renovations hadn't been finished. We asked for a different room, but none was available, we asked for a replacement DVD player because the one in the room was broken, but got a 'there's nothing I can do' response from reception - this seems to be their standard response as we also heard it when asking them to book an airport bus for us after 9pm.Spend your money elsewhere, even if it means paying a few extra dollars - at least you might get a decent night's sleep.

<Content>Do not stay here!! I agree with all the negative comments about this place - the room was so dusty, it made me ill. All they needed to do was sweep the floor as it is laminate!Noisy isn't the word, if its not the other residents, its the locals.Breakfast isn't worth getting up for.Get up early if you want a hot shower.The only thing going for this place is it is in a good place, Glebe Point Road is famous for its inexpensive restaurants, and the bus journey into the city centre is only 20 mins. This place is only a tiny bit better than a hostel...We would have moved if it wasn't for Kylie, U2, the Ashes and a couple of cruise ships - all other hotels were fully booked, and believe me we spent hours phoning round trying to find somewhere wlse to stay!

<Content>brilliant place Im suprised to see negative comments about this place!I stayed there through out the first part of april 2006 and i thought it was well furnished, clean, attractive and the staff were extremely polite and helpful.In fact when i e-mailed through to the hotel when i was looking for a hotel in sydney, the staff wrote back a personal friendly e-mail saying they would offer me a deal lower than stated on another internet site.At xmas, they even sent me a nice animated merry xmas e-mail even though I had only just reserved my booking! My stay there was extremely nice there and id recommend it to anyone!

<Content>What a bad experience Dirty rooms, very noisy we were unable to sleep due to traffic and noise from the other rooms also doors banging allnight. Breakfast was not worth the money, just a bit of cereal nothing else. Bathroom was very small. You could not sit out on the balcony due to the traffic noise and polution. If i were you i would not stay at this hotel. It is also along way from the centre of Sydney.

<Content>What a awful hotel I strongly advise anyone staying at this hotel. The rooms are dirty , there is no double glazing so the noise from the road outside is terrible, we were unable to sleep as the buses were up and down the road all night. Breakfast is very stingy. All in all a bad experience

<Content>Good location but noisy Room 304. Mid - March 2006.Superior spa room. Cost on wotif - $140/nite.When the Legion cab bearing yours truly pulled up at the Haven, I frankly didn't know what to expect. The reviews I'd read of the place conflicted wildly and I hadn't set foot in trendy Glebe since Star Wars was on at the Valhalla. So I'd come prepared for anything. OK. First impressions. The Haven isn't going to win any prizes for architecture. I'm tipping that the rash of heritage orders in this area didn't get going til well after the Haven was already up. With its off-white brick exterior and early 70's decor, it's not a particularly attractive building from the outside. If you're looking to take in the Victorian ambience of Glebe's streetscapes, I suggest you take a walk down Glebe Point Rd with the Haven behind you at all times. 1/5 for external appearance.Once inside though, the place doesn't seem too bad. The girl on reception's friendly, efficient and helpful. There's no waiting to be checked in and no leave-a-credit-card-or-$100-cash-to-cover-your-mini-bar-rorting formalities either. Guess that's cause there's no mini-bar. There's no lift either and I'm on the top floor, but the offers of assistance with the bags are coming thick and fast. On top of all that, I can get free DVD for the night, so happy days. 5/5 for check in.Up the stairs and into my room and it's cold (YES!!!) there's air conditioning and it works a treat. Despite the sub-tropical Sydney funk of the day outside, I have to turn it down in the end because it's just too efficient. 5/5 for air conditioning. The room's reasonably sized and clean enough, but the balcony is quite small and spartan and at no time during my stay do I get motivated to venture out there. The room decor's like you used to see in country motels - in fact the whole place reminds me of the Flag Inn at Holbrook circa 1988. It's clean and it's comfortable. It's not 5 star. There's a small fridge with tea and coffee making facilities and an iron and board as well. 3/5 for the room.The bathroom is OK, but quite overwhelmed by the spa with shower over. The sink is also pretty small and awkwardly located under a shelf, causing me to headbutt the shelf when I was brushing my teeth. 3/5 for the bathroom.Across the road is the Toxteth Hotel - a fine drinking establishment even if the punters DON'T like my jukebox selections. What's wrong with some people anyway? The Ramones are SEMINAL, man. Glebe Point Rd is littered with eating establishments so you won't go hungry, ever. It also boasts the highest proportion of Tarot reading places per square mile in the southern hemishere. 5/5 for local activity.Night time. Noise. Oh deary me. How's the serenity? Well there isn't any. Glebe Point Rd has a surprisingly high volume of traffic late at night. The double-glazing mentioned in an earlier review was not in evidence and this is no place for the light sleeper. 0/5 for serenity.Brekky. The price is right at $5, but don't expect a wide selection. A bit of fruit to go with the cereal would've been appreciated. 2/5 for breakfast.Overall I'd recommend the Haven for budget travellers and those with powerful sleeping drugs or narcolepsy. For $140/nite, I've found better places in the city on wotif in the past.The Haven staff are quite good but the building is a bit dated and could use some maintenance. Glebe's a fun area and close to the city too, but next time I think I'll try somewhere new.

<Content>Good value and clean I got a really good rate from the Internet which meant this was a great deal. I stayed for 4 nights and had no complaints. The stairs could be a problem for some people but the helpful reception staff carried my bags up and down for me, and even offered to carry me if needed! The location is a nice local subarb and there is lots of transport into the city on the buses. Don't stay here if you want to be right in the heart of Sydney, to walk to the centre could be 20-30 mins.

<Content>Do not stay at this hotel I booked a room for 9 nights for my son and myself on the internet as the pictures of the hotel looked ok. In truth the hotel is terrible. The rooms are very noisy, there is no double glazing and you can hear every noise from outside. It is like being in an echo chamber as you can hear every noisy from other rooms and doors are continually banging. The breakfast is awful just stale cereal and toast. We had to check out after 2 nights without sleep and were refused a refund.Be Warned DO NOT STAY HERE

<Content>Best Value in Sydney We have just returned from a 3 month vacation in Australia and our last 5 days were spent at the Haven Inn.We had tried 3 other Sydney hotels in the similar price range as we were using Sydney as a base whilst we travelled up and down the coast and inland.The Haven Inn was by far the most comfortable and best located and in fact the only spotlessly clean hotel we stayed at not only in Sydney but all around Australia.Our room had new carpet ,new bed , new tv and dvd,safe, a balcony ovelooking the city and double glazed windows so it wasnt noisy at all.I would also like to thank all the staff at the hotel who made our last days in Australia so happy.Special mention to Tracey who on our last day organised a suprise dinner for my wife at the Boathouse restaurant right near the hotel.

<Content>Overpriced, poor for *** grade This hotel was very plain and definitely not worth the internet discount rate of USD100 per night, let alone the standard rate of USD175 per night. I feel that AUD80 per night is a more value price. There is no elevator, the outside walls are not maintained. Rooms do not filter outside noise. I'm curious to know who awarded the *** rating and when!

<Content>Great place We are a family of four, and stayed a few nights here. We really enjoyed the place. It's close to town, and in a funky area with interesting shops. The staff were excellent, and very friendly. There is a lot of street noise, but it didn't stop us sleeping. For us, it was ideal.

<Content>Great Location but Noisy Staff was generally helpful. However, windows were drafty and street noise especially from buses was loud. Phone cord kept coming out from receiver. $5 breakfast was inadequate as pastries were not replenished and only hot food was toast. Water pressure from shower was low. Soap but no shampoo was provided. One of drawers in dresser was actually missing. Since there were no elevators, we had to drag our luggage up the stairs. There were no in-room safes. Furnishings seemed old.On the positive side, the location was quite convenient. This was a nice neighbourhood with plenty of moms pushing baby carriages, a library, groceries, restaurants, fruit market and internet cafe across the street. It was a short ride to Sydney attractions by cab or bus. We were able to borrow one DVD without charge and we also received a free bottle of wine as part of an Internet special.

<Content>Concierge Kept Fondling Me - Is this part of the package?! I'll be honest - the Haven Inn was recommended to me by my sister who'd stayed there not too long ago. The place itself is not too far from the city, actually I walked right into the city from the hotel (it takes about 30 minutes) so it is well located. There is a small pub across the street which is nice. and all sorts of places to grab some grub. Le Petit Tarte is a great place for breaky. its on the opposite side of the street about a 10 minute walk. The Haven Inn itself I give it really 3.5 stars. 4 if you can remember that you're staying at a one man show kind of cozy BB. There are no elevators - so if you have heavy luggage - try and stay on the lower floors -(I think there are only 3 floors anyway) Anyhow, I'd probably stay again. BUT and this is the BIG BUT - The night time concierge took a liking to me I was in Austrailia on my HONEYMOON!!! which the guy knew - but everytime my new husband was not around this guy would try and get all over me - which I still intend to report to his manager (god - I hope he isn't the manager). Most of the staff is good - the Girl in the morning was very professional - but WATCH OUT for the night time guy from the philippines. It started out with just compliments which was nice, but by the time we went to check out of the Inn he tried to kiss me and fondled me by grabbing me from behind and hugging me and grabbing my rear all the way from the restaurant to the lobby. (which stopped again - right before my husband could see) - needless to say I was very uncomfortable and my husband was very angry. If the guy isn't working there by the time you choose to stay - then great - you'll like it. But if he is - PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE - Keep your daughters, Wives and Girlfriends with you at all times. I would hate for your vacation to have those memories too! What a honeymoon. (By the way - that's why I rated it a 2 star). Guess you'd agree with that.

<Content>Our Haven in Sydney! Recently stayed at the Haven and loved it. The room had been completely refurbished and we were very impressed with the dvd and cd player, with loads of movies available at reception for free!The location was excellent with buses outside and trams just a 2 minute walk away. A perfect base to explore Sydney and the staff were so friendly and helpful.This is a very comfortable hotel to base yourself in Sydney whilst you are doing all the sights.And dont forget your bathers cause the pool was heated to about 30 degrees when we were there!And last but not least my major weakness , especially when on holidays, is eating and their was an extravaganza of choice up and down Glebe Point Road!
