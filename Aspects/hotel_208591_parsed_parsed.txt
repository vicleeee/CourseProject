<Content>Great location, very cleanliness, low price When we arrived at the hotel lloret the first thing that called the attention was the location , it麓s just in the begining of la rambla next to Plaza Catalunya that is in the middle of the city center. We arrived by aerobus from the aeroport to the city center and it stops really close to hotel lloret.At the entrance of the hotel there are a few steps beafore you get to the elevator but it麓s not a big deal. On the whole the attention was very frendly and polite The rooms are basic but in a good standard, and the cleanliness was excellent.In the lobby there was a wifi zone , and they also had a computer with internet connection. We were surprised that a hotel of these characteristics had these facilities.For us it was a really pleasant hotel experience most of all because of the location, the price and the cleanliness was very important to us. We would recommend this hotel!

<Content>Great value but some poky rooms The deal they offered me -- EUR55 a night for a single en suite room including breakfast and taxes -- was excellent value given the location -- it's at the northern end of La Rambla, literally a few doors down from Pla莽a de Catalunya with its local train and metro station and its bus stops for the airport, sightseeing and several local buses. The location also places the hotel within easy walking distance of both the historic heart of the old city and the later Eixample with its celebrated Moderniste architecture. The first floor room was small and basic but clean and comfortable -- the catch was that there was no natural light, with only a small window looking out onto a gloomy ventilation well. Fine if you're out all the time and only need a base to dump luggage, shower and sleep but not a place to hang out during the day. Breakfast was standard self service cereals, bread, jam and simple pastries, though with fresh fruit and yoghurt too. The multilingual staff on the 24-hour reception are friendly and helpful, but, as I found when I met up with a friend based in Barcelona, they take a dim view of visitors in the rooms.

<Content>Highly recommended I have just stayed 9 nights there and this is a hotel of best value I have ever stayed. The location is impeccable, just 3 mins walk from the Catalunya Plaza and the metro station, 5 mins walk from the Aerobus station and 3 mins to the supermarket. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I have stayed in 5 star hotel and I must say the staff in Lloret is way better than the ones in the so-called upscale hotels. The room size is bigger than the business hotel in Japan and very clean. I find the washroom surprisingly spacious! The bed is very comfortable. Yes the room is a bit dated but it is pretty fair with its attractive rate. Just a tip for the noise issue, it seems that people will have party throughout the whole night (literally, till 6am) on Saturday. It was the noisiest night during my stay. (The rest is acceptable). If you are a problem sleeper, choose a room which is facing the side street rather than Ramblas.

<Content>A great find! We also had problems booking the hotel through their website but when we called they booked us in without a hitch and were very friendly on the phone. They don't charge your credit card until you pay the bill - we settled the bill on checkout.This hotel is a gem. The location couldn't be better - right at the end of La Rambla and across from the Placa Catalunya Metro station. Our room had a small balcony down the side of the building and although the street can be a bit noisy the air con covers any noise that remains after closing the glass doors. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable. The staff are friendly and very helpful. Safety deposit boxes are provided free of charge and a room is provided on check out to store luggage. Drinking can be expensive on La Rambla and on our last night of a four night stay we decided to get some beers (wine can be purchased from the Carrefour supermarket just down the street) from the hotel vending machine and sit on one of the balconies through from reception. Although it is at the end of the street it was a great view and a peaceful and relaxing end to a great stay in an amazing city.

<Content>Trying to book Just wanted to warn other travelers trying to book with Hotel Lloret. I really wanted to stay here and went about trying to make a reservation online, but my card was not accepted for some reason, which I could not read as my Spanish is not very advanced. So I tried calling the hotel directly, only to have them hang up on me 3 times, leaving me very confused. The first time was quite possibly an honest mistake as I heard what I thought was an answering machine (I think it was the on-hold message), which I couldn't understand at all, so then I just kept saying 'hello' and I was hung up on. The two times I tried calling back straight after that, I said hello straight away and was still hung up on.I was quite disappointed after this, so perhaps try other methods of trying to book with the hotel if you really want to stay there.

<Content>Perfect..! Well me and 2 friends have just come back from barcelona and after staying in this hotel - with the extremely helpful staff and wonderful cleaners! We shall definitely be returning! :-)We had 4 nights in hotel lloret in a triple room..admittidly it was a small room but it had 3 comfy beds, a nice power shower and air conditioning!! [ which was at no extra cost ]The majority of the staff speak good english and will be more than happy to help if you don't know the area very well or just want advice on good/reasonable restaurants. [TIP- bars and restaurants off la rambla are much cheaper and often nicer than ones directly on la rambla.]Being teenage girls well lets just say our room became instantly messy within 5 minutes off arriving.! The cleaners even folded our pyjama's up and put them under our pillows everyday! As well as replacing towels and thoroughly cleaning the bathroom and room.! The service hotel lloret provided far exceeded 2 star rating!Some general info about la rambla area of barcelona...if you are young and don't have the money or don't want to dine in restaurants there are plenty of supermarkets to buy ready made pastas/sandwiches and bageuttes. However if there is also a Subway, KFC, Macdonalds, Burger King along la Rambla. So your taste buds will be satisfied [sort of] as long as your'e not there for more than a week!! Admittedly we did dine on subways and the occasional KFC, however the 30 minute walk 4 times a day to port olympic and back solved the issue of piling on the pounds.!!The closest beach is barceloneta and is about a 30 minute walk straight down la rambla and left at the harbour..! [We refused to pay for taxis] The best clubs are at port olympic and most are free to get into just get talking to the right people :-) they chuck out mon-fri no later than 4am...BAD THINGS ABOUT THE HOTEL / HOLIDAY / BARCELONA1] The hotel room had just one plug in the bathroom and one which the TV was plugged into..this was not helpful with 3 teenage girls getting ready to go out each night..!!2] The taxi drivers WILL pile on extras for transfers to and from the airport..it should cost no more than 25euros as its only 20 minutes max away. We paid 35 on the way and just 25 on the way back...we agreed on a price with the driver before getting in on the way back!! You REALLY need to do this to avoid them conning you.!3] Watch out for drug dealers / theives / protitutes there are LOADS up la rambla after about 1am. And it was a horrible experience having to dodge them on our way back every night. Some friends we made got totally mugged credit cards, money, watch the lot..and this is a common occurance. So BE CAREFUL!4] As barcelona is a city expect to pay more for everything. Although soveniers are cheap. Drinks at clubs were a RIP OFF!! 30 euros for 3 vodka and oranges.!! Although some clubs were cheap - going down to around 24 euros...Despite this we all had a fantastic time and we really want to return to barcelona and maybe do a bit more sight seeing and shopping this time rather than just beach/clubbing..!!!Hope you find this helpful!!!

<Content>Great Location Hotel LLoret has a great location, just at the top of the Ramlas, right next to a metro station  10 minute walk from the harbour. The Barcelona tourist bus stops 1 minute away.The rooms were basic  slightly shabby but clean  the beds were comfy.The breakfast was basic, croissants, bread, yoghurts  fruit but it was served till 11ish which meant we didnt have to drag ourselves out of bed too early!The only downside was that there was no bar  the floors are all tiled so when you're trying to sneak quietly back in at 4am your heals clatter a bit on the floor!I would def stay there again.

<Content>Nice for the price This is a decent hotel at the top of the Rambla. It wasn't cheap, but seemed to be the cheapest decent hotel around.As a single traveler, I was scouring the internet for affordable rooms, digging mostly the the hostel options. I found this one for close to the price as many of the hostels and with that top rating for single travelers, I jumped on it.The room looked nice, but very small. This was fine for me as all I was really doing was using the room for sleep and rest. The bathroom looked like it had been recently renovated and was nice enough, aside from the dead roach in the corner. My room had the balcony facing the Rambla which was very nice. Loud mind you, so if you need quiet, don't stay there, but it was fine for me. The breakfast wasn't great, but it was convenient. A week of staggering around town constantly searching out restaurants, cafes, and such was challenging so having some food and coffee right there to get me going was nice. There was one computer in the lobby with internet service. I was able to check email a couple of times during my stay there. The only real complaint was one night having returned from being out until about 5:00 in the morning, the man at the desk was giving me a hard time after letting me in the front door. Mind you, there was somebody harassing me at the time so I was anxious to get in, but once in, the man demanded that I leave my key with him every time I left my room. Basically, I felt that I was being treated as a child when in fact, I was pushing 30 years old. The service aside from that was ok. Initial check in was quick and uninformative. I didn't ask questions so maybe I could have learned more, but there was certainly no assistance offered other than my room key. All in all, it was a fine hotel. Not a very social setting, but a decent nights sleep, though the single bed was a bit uncomfortable for my tall body, but the shower water was hot and the location was nice. I probably wouldn't stay on the Rambla again, but it was right in the middle of the city and I was able to walk everywhere over the course of the week from the beach, to Montejuic, to Park Guell, and everywhere in between. But then again, I like to walk.

<Content>Basic but clean Stopped here for 3 nights - Tue 20th Nov to Fri, Nov 23rd. Like most on here have said the hotel is basic but clean. It's main factor is location. The downside to the location is that at night it's like running a gauntlet back to the hotel. I must have been accosted by every prostitute in Barcelona!! It could have got a bit scarey if I'd been a timid person. Thankfully a polite F*ck off seemed to get the message over!!!I booked a single room through the hotel website. It cost 48 Euros per night which I thought was reasonable.The room was tucked away at the back of the hotel. It was quite small which I expected. The room was clean and the shower was powerful and hot.The air con was a bit too loud but I got over this by making sure I was drunk every night ;-)Overall, the Lloret is a hotel I would recommend to friends, etc and I'd prob stay there again if I couldn't get a better deal somewhere else.

<Content>Perfect Location - Skip the Breakfast I agree with most of the reviews - you cannot beat the location of this little gem for exploring the city. We stayed there for two nights in a room facing La Rambla. There's alot of activity going on into the night, but we had no issues with the noise. As soon as we closed the balcony doors, the noise level was manageable. Be aware that you will need to carry your bags up the first flight of stairs to the tiny elevator. From there you can put the bags into the elevator and go up a floor to the front desk /lobby area. Also, we spent the extra few dollars for the continental breakfast, despite some Trip Advisor reviews that recommended against that. Now I see why. The breakfast was terrible and not worth the money at all. There are so many other nicer places that serve breakfast right on La Rambla. Save your money for them. Also, don't be surprised that you need to turn in your key each time you leave the hotel and then pick it up on your return. It's just hotel policy. Overall, we found the rooms to be simple, but comfortable and clean.

<Content>Great value hotel There were four of us who stayed in 2 rooms. We will definitely stay there again. For the price of 73 euros, it was well worth it. The location was great - right on La Rambla. We felt safe at all hours of the day. It was close to the metro and a couple of blocks from the Boqueria Marketplace. The rooms were basic and plain, but they were cleaned each day with new towels and made-up beds. We felt very comfortable. Although you do hear all the noise in the room from the street, it didn't bother any of us. It was a pleasant experience for our first trip to Barcelona. I recommend restaurants located on the alleys off La Rambla. The food are great and you get better prices than those off La Rambla. I highly recommend the hotel.

<Content>Great location, just remember it's a one-star hotel The best thing about the Hotel Lloret is its location right at the top of the Ramblas, near Plaza Catalunya. This puts you right between the Barri Gotic and L'Eixample, and right next to a major metro stop. Other positives include the friendly and helpful staff and the bathroom, which looked recently renovated. Also, the room price is relatively low for Barcelona.However, it's important to keep in mind that the Lloret is a one star hotel, and just an average one at that. Here are the negatives based on my recent trip there (I stayed 3 nights):-While the room was clean for the most part, there was a stain on my bedsheets and I did see a roach in our room the second night. That could have been a fluke, but it's never fun to have bugs in your room. -I was on the 2nd floor off Carrer Tallers (a side street) and even with the windows closed it was very noisy. I rarely have trouble falling asleep at night but I did here. Bring earplugs!-Skip the breakfast. It's bread with jam and butter and pastries from a box. Coffee from a machine, which was okay. You can get better for less at just about any cafe. If I go to Barcelona again, I will probably spend a little more to stay somewhere nicer. However, if you're looking for something cheap but nicer than a hostal, the Lloret is okay, and the location really can't be beat.

<Content>Great Deal, Priceless Location Hotel Lloret was fantastic for those who want the best location and want to save money. It is right by the metro station on the Rambla. The front desk staff were great, especially Nelissa and Jack. The rooms are average size in European standards, and beds are ok. The weather is nice enough in BCN to forgo the AC, except in Aug when it really heats up. The rooms facing the Rambla are very noisy, but you can't beat the view.

<Content>Great Location... Great Value I booked this hotel after seeing that it was rated highly by single travellers. The hotel was in a fantastic location and the noise wasn't as bad as other reviews had suggested. I expected it to be noisy being right on La Rambla but the hotel is located at the top end so maybe it's not as bustly on this part.I has a single room and it was very tiny but enough for what I needed. If you plan on spending a long time in your room then it would have been too small but WHY would you want to do that...Barcelona is an amazing place with so much to see.The hotal was very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good and cheap. I would stay here again.

<Content>Excellent budget hotel Fantastic location at the top of La Ramblas - just a short walk from the airport bus. Room was a triple (1x double 1x single) which was smallish but absolutely clean and adequate for the amount of time we spent there. Shower was great.Reception staff were really helpful and spoke good English, German and French as well as the ubiquitous Spanish.We did have earplugs as suggested but this was more necessary due to air con than street noise.Free internet access and safety deposit boxes were readily available. All our party (Mum 64 and daughters in 30's) would definitely recommend this hotel and would go back if we go back to Barcelona again.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel!!! We found out about this hotel from the tripadvisor website. The location is superb and right next to the La Rambla. We heard alot about the crime rate in that area however we felt safe and had no problem at all when walking around in the night/day. The hotel staff is friendly and nice. The hotel room is basic but very very clean. It has air conditioning which is a big bonus in this weather. However, be aware that the housekeeper may change the setting of the air con (i.e.turning the temp up) and there are no knobs to change the temp on the air con. But you can always use a bit of brain and reasonable force to change the setting, e.g. covering your finger with sock and turn it forcefully. In conclusion, it has been a pleasant stay.We will definately come back to stay in this hotel again and recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!

<Content>Good Find We found Hotel Lloret through TripAdvisor and were pleasantly suprised. It was a great deal compared to many other hotels in Barcelona. When we first arrived it was very easy to find and was right on the busy Ramblas. The room was a bit dingy at first glance but we quickly realized that it was extremly clean and had everything we needed. We had a room facing the side street. It was noisy but we brought ear plugs as per the other reviews and we slept just fine. We would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable place to stay with a central location.

<Content>Ideally Situated Budget Hotel My wife and I stayed a week in this hotel on the recommendation of her cousin who had lived in Barcelona. We weren't disappointed. It was a remarkable value for being in a prime location and having respectable facilities. We would definitely stay again. The hotel is located at the top of Las Ramblas, just a stones throw from the Placa de Catalunya. This made it easy for us to catch the Aerobus from the airport to the Placa for under 4 Euros a piece. This is a great location to branch out and explore Barcelona. You are within easy walking distance of the Barri Gotic. There are subway stops right on Las Ramblas. And tour buses stop a the plaza to take you to the main attractions. It's just a couple of blocks from Mercat dela Boqueria the main open air market which became a daily stop for us to pick up essential supplies like fresh bread, cured ham and salamis, olives, cheese and wine.The rooms are small and have minimal furnishings. However, the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The desk staff was pleasant and helpful throughout our stay. The wifi didn't reach our room but there's a nice lobby area where you can connect and it has small balconies with tables and chairs that overlook the ever entertaining parade of Las Ramblas.

<Content>Right on the Ramblas! We booked a triple room with the Hotel Lloret and never did we think we would be right on the Ramblas street, that was a wonderful surprise! Our room had a double bed and a single bed for our son. The bathroom was a good size, the place was clean. Our room was not well insulated against hall traffic, whether it was people talking or walking. We could hear the people next to us trying to get their key in the slot and trying to figure out if it was the right floor and right room, but once in their room, we didn't hear them again. On the plus side of that, we hardly spent anytime in the room to be distrubed. The window in our room did not fit correctly into the frame, it was too small, you cold close one side, but the other stayed slightly open, thus never locking. We didn't worry though because we were on the 4th floor and if someone wanted to get in through here, they better be good acrobats! . We paid 81 euros per night and it did not include breakfast, but from my research on Barcelona, most hotels did not include breakfast in their room rates. If you want to be close to the metro, the shopping, restaurants, some of the sites in the downtown area, then this is a good location.

<Content>Great on a Budget I gave this hotel a 4 and not a 3 because it was above average, for the price. However this is an average hotel.It is clean, friendly and the bathrooms are new, which makes a big difference. But the best thing about this place is the location! Right on Las Ramblas. I did not find it noisy, since my room was in the back, But you don't go to Barcelona to sleep anyways.

<Content>Good Budget Option Excellent location, rooms small and in need of modernisation but clean. Ramblas view rooms are noisy at night but worth it for people-watching. Staff friendly and helpful. Would stay here again if on a budget.

<Content>Stay away! We stayed there this weekend.... 10-11 March 07. Great location but thats about it! No hot water in our room and also impossible to get to sleep with the noise on the street. Breakfast is dry bread and yoghurt!Dont really know if this place even deserves its one star. No staff anywhere to be seen at all which didnt help when we realised we had no hot water. There are loads of other hotels on Las Ramblas... try one of them x

<Content>great price for location! right on la rambla, so you're in the thick of the action. great as long as you don't mind noise when trying to go to sleep at night. we booked a room facing a side street(a few bucks cheaper and, i would imagine, less noisy) and it was still a bit loud. just bring earplugs.folks at the reception were super-nice. the room is not as small as we've had in other places. the bathroom was always sparkly. i love that the floors (room and bath) are all tile... definitely better than carpet, which always seems to be suspiciously damp in other budget hotels. this ain't the ritz, but definitely above-average for the price (we paid 75euros/night for twin). also very very convenient if you're coming from the airport. the aerobus stop is just a 3 minute walk.

<Content>I think it's a great deal for the price Hotel Location - can't be in a better location. It is right at the tip of La Ramblas, and the moment you get out of Metro - Placa Cantalunya, it's just within 1 min walk. It faces the main street and not in the small lanes, so at night, you can hang out at the balcony to people-watch  listen to free music by the baskers. Carrefour is next door only, so quite convenient to get water, groceries etc..Room - is small but clean. Was a single traveller, and did not require such a big room. For the price I paid, felt it was pretty reasonable - with own toilet, wardrobe, dressing table  TV. Noise - May be quite noisy at night, but quite bearable. Before staying at Hotel Lloret, i put up at a 4* hotel nearby and the noise was worse! After all the activities in the day, u end up so tired, so no problem falling asleep. Breakfast - They serve bf daily from 7-11am at 5Euro. Pastries, bread, cereals, coffee, milk, juice  fruits. spread is not fantastic but what do you expect with 5Euros.. I find it OK. Living Room - There is a comfortable area with red sofa, plasma TV, fireplace for people to hang around near the reception. If you think your room is too small  clastrophobic, this is one good place to hang out  surf internet. Overall, i think this is a good place for single travellers or travellers on tight budget.

<Content>Clean, Nice  Was a bit worried when we pulled up in the taxi as all you could see what the front door to the hotel. and 1st impressions were scary. However once we got in the place and was met by the reception staff, found the hotel to quant, small and full off character. We actually found this hotel in the rough guide to Barcelona and was everything we expected as the guide was very open and honest about this hotel, so there were no nasty surprises. Although situated on top of the Rambla's the noise was a little loud to begin with and yes we had forgotten the ear plugs, but it was easy to forget about and once asleep. Breakfast was lovely, yet cheap, it can be expensive if eaten on the Rambla, but you really couldn't complain @ 3 euros each. In all found this to be quiet a charming hotel, it was clean and tidy and although only there for 4 nights, I would recommend this to anyone, especially considering the price was so cheap for the time of year and it;s location.

<Content>Frendly stuff I visited BCN with couple of friends two times this year - first in May /5 days/ and than in August /3 days/.Both times We stayed in Lloret hotel.Rooms are indeed basic and small but spotless. Breakfast- fine: fruit juices, several kinds of coffee, pastry, butter, fruit salad,Yogurt...Do not expect various offer. I find this hotel very convinient for budget travelers and young people. Great location. Only 100m from Plaza Catalunia where is the bus stop for special airport bus-costs only 4E. So its easy to get to and from the airport. It can be noisy by night- but hey-you are in the main pedestrian street.Stuff great- helpfull and friendly.So if you want a quite night rest- go elsewhere or ask for room that has not Ramblas view. But if you are in Barcelona for sightseeing, fun you dont have a lot of money-this hotel is a right choice.Metro is just great! Open till 01am-covering all city, so no need to use taxi at all.Dont miss Gaudi masterworks, Piccaso museum, Huan Miro foundation and Barceloneta beach.Imprtant note:use direct hotel web site [--] for reservation- in that way you will get secure reservation confirmed by e mail.They will note charge your credit card- only 1 night rate if you do not cancel on time or do not come at all. Othervise they will charge you when you check out.Have fun in BCN!

<Content>Great location and price - clean and friendly Our family of 15 stayed at Hotel Lloret in July 2006 and had a good experience. The rooms were small and basic but the price was right. It was clean and safe while with a staff that was polite and helpful. You can't beat the location on La Rambla next to the Metro, bus to the airport and tour buses. The hotel also has an elevator and air conditioning which is something to consider in the summer. Also, the front desk can communicate in basic english which helped those of us who didn't speak much spanish. One note of caution - if you get a room on the front side, you may get some noise on popular nights. My sister and husband were on the front side the night of the World Cup finals and didn't get to sleep until after 2PM. Most of us requested a back side room and didn't have any problems. PS Mind your wallet and passports in BCN. My brother in law had his back back stolen at a street side bar in a scam where he was distracted by one while the other stole the back pack. He had to get a new passport at the American Consolate and said the place was packed with Americans with similar stories.

<Content>Be aware Be aware. I booked a room for this upcoming November 2006 and my credit card has already been charged in full 5 months in advance. This fact as well as their cancellation policy is not stated on their web site anywhere. The overwhelming majority of hotels charge your credit card after your hotel stay. Not 5 months before.

<Content>As expected Well, after reading the reviews before booking we packed ear plugs, and needed the them!!The rooms were very clean but a bit dated, small by US standards but not for europe.We had a balcony which overlooked La Ramblas, great for people watching but not for sleeping, fortunatuly we had packed ear plugs and eye masks which came in usefull.The staff were very helpful and we were able to store our luggage after we checked out on the last day FOC.Barcelona is a great city to walk around, didn't use a cab once.Will definately stay here again.

<Content>Wouldn't Stay Here Again Stayed three days recently. As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel is clean as a whistle and the location is right on the Ramblas. But the room was so small that the two of us had to take turns moving around, and the noise from the Ramblas was excessive. Believe me, we were not expecting a luxury hotel, but this was just too small a room. We will stay in the Old City Center (Barri Gotic) area the next time. Just as easy to get to the Ramblas and all points, much more charm, and you don't pay the price for being on the Ramblas.

<Content>Second visit - still great Just got back from Barcelona, where I stayed at the Hotel Lloret again. You really can't knock the location and yet again the staff were very helpful and cheerful.Please don't expect anything fantastic, the rooms are very small and basic (yet immaculate, as always) but it really is the perfect base from which to explore the city.

<Content>Excellent location, very clean and would stay there again Just returned 12th March 2006 after 3 nights in the Hotel Lloret in Barcelona. Excellent location and very clean. Staff helpful. It is an old building, with marble steps that dipped in the middle taking you up to the reception desk. Room small but very clean and bathroom spotless. We had a double room with balcony facing over Las Ramblas. Noisy but full of atmosphere. Hotel easy to find when airport bus terminates at the Placa de Catalunya. Good value for money. Don't expect a 4 star, red carpet hotel. You don't spend much time in the room so enjoy the atmosphere and get good value for money. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>no problems, no regrets Stayed here 11/11-13/05. Had absolutely no problems. Hotel is older but had an updated bathroom that was probably the cleanest I've seen anywhere. Room was a double and small by US standards but average by European standards I guess. We had a balcony room that overlooked Las Ramblas -- if you're a light sleeper bring earplugs, this is not a quiet place and the older door doesn't do much to muffle the street sounds. But if you want a truly fantastic vacation moment (like I did) the noise is worth it just to stand out on your little balcony at night and watch the river of people flowing by below. Really beautiful. Super great location, within walking distance of the cathedral, Barri Gotic, the ports, restaurants, shopping, most of the Gaudi highlights including Casa Battlo, La Pedrera, Palau Guell (although Palau Guell is closed until Dec 06). Even Sagrada Familia is walkable (although a little bit of a hike).Only inconvenience is short flight of stairs from the front door to the check-in(narrow and hard to navigate when dragging baggage) and having to turn in my key to the desk each time I left the room. Staff was VERY kind and helpful, pointing out places to see on the map. There is a younger man that is there most of the time who speaks English and an older gentleman who speaks a little but is very kind and patient with poor Spanish speakers such as myself! There are metro stops really close by if you want to try to get the metro from the airport, other wise a cab ride is 20-25 euro.Great, great location, inexpensive (3 nights for 2 people including a continental breakfast was 210 euro) and clean. Not much else I need!

<Content>Pleasantly suprised Moved into this hotel after leaving hotel we booked on the internet. This hotel is a little dated, but rooms are very clean and relatively spacious. Balcony opened to a side street and it was very noisy when we left the balcony door open. Staff is very friendly and the vibe at the hotel is good. Spacious lobby and dining room with cute balcony tables that you can sit at overlooking the Ramblas. Location is a block from Catalonia Plaza, at the top of the Ramblas.

<Content>Great location! A simple hotel with character and a geat location! The staff are extremely friendly and very helpful (having arrived a day late my room had been cancelled but they offered me a double room at no extra charge). As for breakfast, go to the small dingy tapas bar around the corner. It may be full of old men drinking beer at 8 o'clock in the morning but let me tell you, they make the best chorizos and coffee. Anyway, a good, simple ,affordable hotel. You may think the rooms are a tad small but the location makes up for it....Book Now!!!!!!ps- If you don't mind a little noice ask for a room with a balcony.pps-When you arrive use the stairs to go to reception...the lift does not go to the ground floor.

<Content>great, cheap  my wife and i just came back from barcelona. all the hotels were really expensive. i pretty much checked all the sites (hotels, travelocity, etc.). the decent 3 stars hotels run about 120-150 EUR, and i was told they're not that much different than the 1-2 stars. finally, after reading this site and reading everyone's reviews (granted that this hotel is a 1 star hotel), i decided to go ahead and book it (for 80 EUR including taxes and everything). and it's a great decision. the location was great (located at top of Las Ramblas, 1 minute walk to Pl. Cataluyna, 10-15 minute walk to Gothic Quarter, 30-35 minute walk to Barceloneta (beach), close by train station and bus stops and the airport bus). the price was affordable. it was very clean. service was good. most of them speak English at the front desk. nothing more we can ask for.they were out of double rooms at their hotel, so they offered us an apartment instead (it's about 3-4 euro more). honestly, i would suggest getting the apartment rather than the hotel room. the apartment was great. it has a sink, washer and dryer (at least, i believe it's a washer and dryer-we didn't use it), stove (and oven), fridge, pots, pans, utensils, dishes, etc.). the apartment, itself isn't too bad either. it's good enough for 2 people. it's very clean, has a full or queen size bed (not sure, but it fits the both of us comfortably) in the bedroom. has a sofa outside/living room (which can become a pull out bed), a tv and a (small) terrace. some minor drawbacks:1. no elevator on the first floor at Hotel Llorett (keep in mind, there IS one at the apartment, which is different from the hotel)... so when you do check in, i suggest you leave your bags with someone downstairs, and just have 1 person check in. that way, you don't have to lug your luggages around. unless you're early for check-in, in which case, you can leave your luggages with them (for free), but then, you would have to carry the luggages over 1 flight of stairs.2. the apartment is off the side street of Las Ramblas (and the hotel), but it's VERY safe. it's about a minute walk (around the corner) from the hotel-again, it's very safe, we didn't feel threaten at all. and it's very close by the main street.3. however, they don't offer you clean towels everyday (unless you pay 6 euro for it), but we don't change our towels daily at home anyway... and even if you want clean towels, you can always use the washer and dryer.4. it can be a little noisy (but that's a given if you want to stay at Las Ramblas)overall, i think it's a great hotel with friendly staff and it's (the apartment) very clean with a lot of amenaties.things you should do at barcelona:-if you don't mind the walking... definitely go to the tourist office and buy a 3-5 barcelona train pass (you get discounts 10-30% to many museums, sometimes free entries-which can costs 5-10 euro per visit, unlimited train or bus rides, and 1 free walking tour - we did the picasso walking tour and it was great. *they'll be showing you this churros place - you should definitely stop by there, once the tour is over)-becareful of you bags and belongings. we were lucky enough not to have our stuff stolen, but during the walking tour, we heard that one of the couple was robbed. if you're capable and don't have a bad back, definitely carry a backpack (instead of a one strap across the shoulder bag - i heard from the couple that, a guy ran up to them and stripped the bag off of her, tossed it to his accomplice who was on motorcycle and took off. they both went separate directions, and the couple couldn't catch them)... whereas, with the backpack, you'd have 2 straps around your shoulder and back. also, bring a small combination lock (e.g. luggage locks). make sure your backpack is a sturdy one too, because some off them will use a knife or a sharp object to cut underneath your purse/bag and steal your things that way.)i'm not much of a artsy/culture person, but barcelona was great and i hope you'll enjoy it too... also, it helps to be able to speak a little spanish. the consensus is that the locals speak English, but in reality, unless you're at the hotel, most of the locals, don't speak English (e.g. bus drivers). at least bring a small Spanish dictionary with you.

<Content>Friendly little place. We have stayed here twice in the poast and will stay here again sometime in the future. The rooms are spotless but very basic but no-one goes to Barcelona to stay in their hotel room all the time! Breakfast is basic continental but you can have as much as you want. The location is terrific at the very top of the Ramblas with the airport bus leaving from across the square and the tourist buses from the same spot. Another plus poiunt is the fact after check out you can leave your luggage in a cubby hole next to reception and plick it up later after another round of sightseeing when you are ready for your journey home. at

<Content>Top location! Before booking a hotel, I always look at this site for guidance! I was a little worried by the some of the reviews for the hotel Lloret posted here, but given the hotel's location I went ahead and booked.... I'm so glad I did, the location is fantastic! If you are looking for a clean, safe hotel with a prime location and super friendly/helpful staff, then this is the place for you. I stayed here for three nights and intend to return!

<Content>Not as bad as I had feared. We have just got back from Barcelona.Loved the city, and this hotel is a great place to stay if you are on a budget. It is right on the main street -Las Ramblas,close to all the bars and restaurants,clean, with a small bathroom, a TV and fresh towels daily. It is a bit run down I admit, but for the price -69 Euro a night, it was good value. We had room 102 , looking down on Las Ramblas. We had a small balcony which was very nice, although it was to cold to sit out on in February. Before we set off I was put off by a few posts on here, but it was not as bad as I had feared.

<Content>Fears unfounded The views of this hotel are very polarised, therefore it was with some trepidation that I booked it. I need not have worried. It is not four star, but you are not paying for four star. It is clean, daily room service, towels changed. Staff are very friendly. Free safe boxes, all for 69 Euros a night. I was very pleasantly surprised.If you are looking for luxury you will not find it. If you are looking for a basic, clean room, in the Heart of the city, at a reasonable price, then this represents good value.

<Content>What an overpriced DUMP This over-priced dump is only redeemed by it's location at the top of the Ramblas. Dirty, old, dingy, unfriendly, insecure, over-priced. You would NEVER consider paying the rates for this hotel were it not on the Ramblas in Barcelona and that makes it a pure rip-off. It was the only hotel available on the day of booking and this doesn't surprise me at all because you would NOT stay here out of choice.

<Content>Definitely has character! If you are looking for a great base to explore Barcelona without the cost, this is the place. If you can get over the initial shock of the decor you start to appreciate that the hotel certainly has character! Rooms are small and basic but clean and comfortable. Towels are changed daily. It was very noisy at night but then again you are in the heart of the city here! The airport bus stops just across the square from the hotel. I would stay here again.

<Content>Highly recommend this ideal base for City. Family stayed 4 nights in 2 rooms. Excellent value for money; friendly staff; rooms are basic but comfortable  clean (rooms made up daily); perfect central location; The Rambla is noisy but the hum of the air-con covered it (not sure about a good sleep in winter; but that's lively city centres for you). Breakfast good. Airport bus just 4 minutes walk away (Euro 3.45).

<Content>Great hotel, great location, great service I was very pleased with this hotel and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. It was right on La Ramblas which is the city's most well-known street. Due to its central location, this hotel is very safe and secure. We got lots of help from the front desk as well. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel.
