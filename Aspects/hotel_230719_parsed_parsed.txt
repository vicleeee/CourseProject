<Content>Do not be fooled by its fancy lobby This hotel was the worst place I have ever stayed at. The pictures on the website seem amazing but the rooms they pictured were definitely not the ones we stayed in. My family and I were sent to the lower wing, which was basically a confusing maze of a building that they made into horrible hotel rooms. The room had quarry tile floors(you know the ones you see in a restaurant kitchen); it reeked of smoke and the towels smelled like they have been there for quite some time. The water was yellow when it first came out and then we ran out of hot water after 10 minutes. I took a bath in lukewarm water and when i came out, i smelled like bleach for the rest of the night. When we tried to switch rooms, the very rude concierge said there was no other triple, which i find VERy hard to believe in the winter time when tourism was low. Then my mom tried to use the internet access downstairs and was told that there was wifi- but when she asked for the password, the same rude concierge told her that she was mistaken and the wifi will not work for another year. All in all, we had the worst night there but i was too tired to fight it any longer. I wanted to just sleep in the lobby. So my family and i just lived with it but I am writing this now so that you wont have to go through what we did.

<Content>quite ok Hi We stayed at the grand hotel med in Florence for a weekend. The hotel was ok value for the money. We payed very litle to come to Florence. The rooms where very small but clean and so was the bathroom.The staff was very friendly. The only thing that was bad was the breakfast. Not a vegetable or fruit in sight. Just white bread and very few options to put on the bread.It was a nice stroll in to town, took about 15 min to get to the dome.The restaurant next door a pizzeria served fabulous food and prosecco in a jar. Lovley.

<Content>Group booking in Mediterraneo This way I would like report about my experience with hotel Mediterraneo. As a travel agent I organize business trips for our corporate clients. Last time it was in Florence. I have booked there 35 rooms of both categories single as well as double rooms. Have to say I was suprised how easy and efficient it was to work with hotel staff and the reservation department. Especially with Mr. Carlo Fabiani. All changes and updates were done perfectly and on time. And on the top of it, the same feeling about this hotel had my clients. Next time they go to Florence, they will ask for Mediterraneo again as they informed me. That is the best what we can hear from our clients/guests. Result of it all is that I really recommend this hotel as a perfect place to stay while in Florence or anywhere near there.

<Content>top class hotel Excellent hotel. A ten minute walk along the Arno to the centre of Florence.Although this Hotel is used by many tour bus companies, everything seemed to run smoothly so did not interfere in anyway with our stay. The only thing I would say to anyone thinking of staying here is when going for breakfast use the main restaurant in the lounge area, as the first morning we made the mistake of follwing everyone and ended up amongst the tour groups.Rooms were of a high standard. Staff were exceptionally friendly and when booking a taxi they arrived in about 3 minutes. I would recommend a taxi from the bus station as it would be too far to walk with cases. Taxis are very reasonable. There is a park across the road from the Hotelwhich has tables and chairs and a cafe which is nice way to wind down.

<Content>Your "Classic" American-type hotel. After staying in a boutique hotel in Rome before this one in Florence, this was a big hotel - as far as size goes. The shower was bigger, which was much more comfortable. I even took a bath one night. The room had a great view of Florence since we were on the 6th floor. Location: is just slightly outside the hustle and bustle of Florence, but it's walkable. You don't HAVE TO take the bus to go to places. Santa Croce is actually a nice walk from the hotel.LIKES: (1) Again, the view from the room since we were on the 6th floor. We could see some of the Arno and then the many villas and mountains across the Arno. (2.) The big shower/tub, which we were not used to since staying in a small hotel in Rome. DISLIKES (2) The staff. After getting so much attention at the small, boutique hotel in Rome - the staff here were just not as friendly and willing to help. They had brochures and flyers of tour buses that you could take to explore the city, but I felt they knew little on how a tourist who is completely new to Europe should travel. (3). Internet use: OUT OF SERVICE was the sign posted on each of the 6 or so PCs in the lobby until the very last day when I saw that 2 were working. Come to find out though that you had to pay 5 Euro just for 30 minutes! What a ripoff. I know you don't go on vacation just to get on the computer, but it's nice just to have access to email and write to family and friends. A good tip on how to travel through Florence: pay for the one-day double-decker tour bus (16 Euro each person). It runs 24-hours so you can literally go all day. You can get on and off at sites as you please and there is audio playing as you pass by sites to give you history. One of my favorites was traveling up towards Fiesole and seeing the building/home where Galileo died.

<Content>Good hotel, outside city center Large hotel outside city center (15 min walk) on the river Arno. We had a larger room for European standards, but the bathroom was very small and the shower was really small. We did not have breakfast in this hotel, but we did have dinner in one of their restaurants. It was a very quiet night, but service was still slow. They have paid Internet access in their lobby.

<Content>Beware Of Silly Traffic Fines On Way Hotel is fine though it has parking. Biggest nightmare is the almost 100 euro fine we got TODAY (8 months later) for 'driving in a limited traffic area without authorisation'.Seemingly you have to register your car details with the hotel to avoid paying this rip-off fine. Of course, nobody tells you this. This kind of thing makes me very angry.

<Content>Small space but clean and good location Stayed at this hotel as part of a Globus tour. The room was small but sufficient. Bathroom was tiny but clean. Room required room key to maintain lights and a/c (energy efficiency). Took a little bit to get used to. Stand up shower was very small! Hotel breakfast was poor. Typical selection of bacon, eggs, yogurt, fruit and pastries. Good location. Able to walk around to main attractions and anywhere else you may want to go.

<Content>Tiny rooms Rooms are really tiny. Air con was leaking in the first room given. A technician came and checked, language problem as he didn't speak English. He (I think) wanted us to off the aircon for the night! After much furstration and lots of hand gestering, we finally got a change of room. Another tiny room with an even tinnier bathroom. Abit of a walk from city center, but still alright. We gave up halfway though, because the sun was just too unbearable. A cab ride from Santa Croce cost abt e$10. If walking, just follow the river and you will find your way back to the hotel. Breakfast is pretty standard. Barman at level 1 is unfriendly and stuck up and so is the staff at reception. okay place to rest your head but I don't think I'll ever return for another stay.

<Content>Fine Hotel We stayed at this hotel as part of a Monograms tour. The hotel is in a good location, right on the Arno river and only about 10-15 minutes walk to the downtown area. The hotel itself is fine, not fancy, but comfortable with a good breakfast, helpful staff, and a good-sized, clean room. Only negative was the shower, which was not a standalone unit but was just a curtained off area in the bathroom. We had some flooding issues until we figured out how to use it correctly...There is both a supermarket and an internet cafe within a few blocks of the hotel - ask the front desk for details. We saved a fortune by purchasing bottled water and soda at the supermarket instead of while we were walking around, and the internet cafe came in handy for checking e-mail.

<Content>just a place to rest This is a large hotel, full of American tourist groups. We booked a double room at 89euro a night incl breakfast and taxes. The room is a good size and clean. D茅cor is a bit dated but that ok. The bathroom was modern and looked good and the bed was quite comfortable which was very important. The hotel staff are polite but fairly impersonal which is half expected from a large-ish hotel. There is a restaurant just next to the hotel. Its food is not that good, so only eat there is you can鈥檛 be bothered going into town. The walk to the centre of Florence is about 20mins, which is a nice stroll by the river Arnos.

<Content>Awful and cramped Stayed at this dump as part of a Globus Tour. Room was unbelivably small - we could not pass one another in the room. The shower was two foot by two foot based on the size of the wall tiles. It also leaked. The commode was wedged between the shower and the wall. The toilet paper holder was right at leg hight and stuck out so it made sitting on the commode impossible for a normal sized person. Food was terrible. Three of the seven hotels on this tour were so bad that we received a refund of almost $1000 from Globus.

<Content>safe area,good facilities,efficient staff After researching a fair number of hotels and making ourselves dizzy reading reviews we decided on this hotel because many of the hotels in our budget were too near to the train station (Not very safe area) or were small b and b's 3 or 4 floors up in some building which given my sense of direction we could have been wandering around the streets trying to find our way back to the hotel late at night!I travelled with my daughter who in her twenties found the 20 minute stroll from the hotel along the river bank to Santa Croche no big deal at all. At the end of the day we just took a taxi which for 8 or 10 euro was well worth it or of course you could take the bus number 14.(not sure where the stop is though) This still works out a lot cheaper than staying in a lot of hotels in the centre.The hotel itself is very large (300 rooms approx) with a nice entrance and seating area. There is a small American bar .coffee shop and terrace outside which my daughter and I found pleasant to sit outside in the evening and enjoy a pasta dish or similar. We also ate in the restaurant where we found the food very good and average priced. Breakfast was a good selection of croissants,pastries,cold meat and cheeses ,cereal yoghorts, juices,bacon ,eggs etc enough to keep you going all day. My only criticism would be there was no fresh fruit salad .only canned peaches and very tired looking oranges which considering all the lovely fresh fruit there is in Italy was disappointing.Reception staff were very helpful and efficient. Every time we called for a taxi we only had a 3 to 5 minute wait which was great.We stayed in a standard twin room on the first floor which we found spotlessly clean ..The bathroom was average size by European standards and had a lovely big shower with even a corner seat and emergency bell pull for anyone with a disability or elderly and a bit unsteady on their feet.Our room overlooked the hotel car park but we didn't find it noisy at all .The only noise we heard of minor annoyance was the low hum of the vacuums being used at around 7am (not so good if you want a lie in!)Having said that we were up and ready for breakfast by about 8.30am most mornings as we wanted to enjoy this wonderful city to its full.Overall I found this hotel fairly good value for money and would stay there again especially if I could manage to snap up one of their special offers which they do have from time to time.This is not a luxurious hotel at all but really what you would expect for a good standard 3 star hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel I recently held a conference for 100 participants at the Grand Hotel Mediterraneo. The hotel was wonderful. The meeting rooms are nicely updated and convenient to all sleeping rooms and the restaurant. The staff is so great to work with, everyone in the hotel is pleasant and goes out of their way to make everything perfect. From the front desk staff to the technicians and setup crew in the meeting space to the bartenders and restaurant staff. The service is perfect.I also extended my trip and had my family visit for 5 days. The hotel is so conveniently located on the Arno River and about a 5-10 minute beautiful walk to the city centre.If you go, request a room on the 6th floor, where you'll have a beautiful view of the entire city. The price is very reasonable considering the hotel's great location.This is a great hotel for any size group.

<Content>Great value hotel.15m walk to centre but bus stop just round corner if needed First of all we live in Italy and travel around quite a bit using hotels for long weekends. This is our second trip to Florence using it as a base to travel around Tuscany. I heard about this hotel from an Italian friend who uses it when he goes to visit his daughter at University there. We booked thru Venere.com and got a special offer. 1 night = E.140, 2 nights = E121 pn, 3 nights E.100 pn including breakfast. The rooms were decent sized for Italy with the largest king-sized bed I've ever seen. There was also airconditioning. TV has channels in French English and German as well as Italian. Bathroom was small especially the shower but acceptable and spotlessly clean. The hotel was full but we heard no noise in the corridor or from our neighbours. We looked out onto an apartment building so kept the curtains draw . I understand these rooms with this view are kept for the special offer but it really was not a problem.Breakfast was mixture of continental and North European with various brioches and teacakes, fresh yougurts, muesli and cereals, fresh fruit , canned peaches, cheeses, cold cuts of all types, pate' , hard boiled eggs, and even bacon (italian style) and scrambled eggs. There were 6 types of bread and rolls to select from which you could toast if yoiu wanted. There were urns with hot milk, coffee and hot water and a selection of tea bags but the staff were happy to bring you proper cappucino , espresso or a pot of tea. After breakfast we sat in the large comfortable reception / lounge area to plan our day. There were free Italian newspapers and free newsheets in English with the main headlines. The reception staff were helpful and friendly. They sold us tickets for the bus in Florence but said they would buy them back from us if not used, which they did. they also supplied us with a great street map of Florence, free. There is Internet in the lounge but it costs E.5 for 1/2 hour which I thought was a bit steep.It is a 20 minite walk to the centre but you can get a bus from the street behind the hotel. It still takes about 15 minutes but you can save your feet. We walked back along the Arno and it only took 15 mins. We had a car and although the hotel says free parking there are only about 6 places for the hoteland we never got one of them. There are paying parking places all along the road outside the hotel at E.1 per hour until 8pm and then again from 8 am. You do not pay for Sundays or holidays.I was really impressed by this hotel especially because 2 years ago we stayed in a small hotel in Florence, Hotel Cordova which cost E.90 per night. It was clean but really really spartan and faded to the point of actually not being welcoming, and breakfast was coffee/ cappucino and a cornetto from the bar in the reception area. Our friends stayed in the Hotel Panama 2 years ago and paid E.80 p.n. It was much like the Cordova but the rooms were even more basic. This hotel also compared favourably to other hotels in this price range all over Italy.All in all we would really recommend this hotel to any age groug if you are looking for quality/price..

<Content>Lolved the breakfast On first impressions the entrance and reception area are vert grand. There was a nice bar area and lots of comfortable seating around the bar area. The room was nice and of traditional styling, was comfortable and didn't hear a lot of noise from outside even although we were on a busy road. Breakfast was lovely, lots to choose from all laid out buffet style. Staff were okay but would have been nice to see some smiles from them!!! Barman particualarly was unpleasant and I felt like I was being a burden asking for a drink or coffee!! It was a lovely hotel though and woudl have scored higher if staff had just been more pleasant

<Content>NOISY Hotel This hotel caters mostly to large tourist groups of which are mostly high school  college students. I was with a group so I had to stay at this hotel but our group was quiet. The walls are made of paper  you can hear the people on either side of you as if they were in your room. Also you can hear everyone's shower, bathroom ,tv  blow dryer. Some of our group on the second floor had high school kids running up  down the hall, drinking  sitting on the steps until 3AM  the hotel management would not do anything about it so you could imagine what that was like with the paper walls. The next complaint was at the Breakfast  Dinner that was included. I don't expect much from the meals which were OK, it was one rather chubby waiter that served you that smelled so bad it made your eyes water  he was there each time.I would avoid this hotel at all costs. Don't let the vicinity to the sights fool you or how it looks from the outside. I have stayed here 2 times  each time it was like this, including the same smelly waiter. If I go on this tour again I will get a different hotel. If you do have to stay here, bring earplugs!!!!

<Content>A tree stars hotel The location is about 15-20min. by foot to thecenter of the city,but the walk can be pleasent.The decoration is a bit old.It's a three stars hotel with many groups staying there.The area is nice(on the bords of Arnos river)and safe.There is space for parking a car(on the blue lines) or just out of the hotel for free'(if you are lucky enough).Fair value for the money.

<Content>Great hotel, location litle far We just came back from Italy and stayed at this hotel for three nights while in Florence, including new yar's eve. We had dinner in new year's eve in the hotel, quite expensive, but comparing with another restaurants, it was cheaper and very good, but it doesn't have any ambient music...  The hotel is a very large, modern, quite, clean, and have a very good breakfast. The location is a litle bit far from central Florence, about 20 minutes by foot and 5 minutes by bus. You can catch the bus no. 14CB to the centery, about 150 mts from the hotel.We recommend this hotel! The price is fair for the confort.

<Content>Dirty Rooms, Lousy Food, Could not wait to leave Nothing nice about this hotel. It is a long walk from the city center.The carpets and bedspreads were dirty and stained. I do not think the bedspread was ever washed.Breakfast was cold, raw, runny scrambled eggs. The worst I have ever seen, and the worst I have ever tasted in my entire 40+ year life. Everything was stale. I did manage to get some cereal and yogurt.I guess the room could have been filthier.

<Content>Find a better location did not like this place one bit. the hotel staff was not friendly at all. it caters to large groups. while there we saw nothing but large tour buses come in and out shuffling tourists daily. people sat outside smoking and it just blew inside making the lounge stink of cigarette smoke.the rooms were okay, but the shower in our room sucked and sprayed water all over the floor. the breakfast was okay, but nothing to write home about. the location of this place was the worst of all, not really close to anything which sucked when you wanted something close by to do/eat. consider staying closer in town or at a BB. the ponte vecchio area looked nice. definitely eat at I' CHE CE CE -- best meal we had in italy -- stay close to rick steves' recommendations!

<Content>wonderful memorable break The hotel was excellent and overlooking the river arno although it is mostly obliterated by trees. Ask for a room on the 5th or 6th floor and the views across the Arno to the hills on the other side are just so gorgeous. The windows on the 6th floor slide open to reveal a wonderful view. Watch out for the mosquitos though. The hotel was very pleasant, not a bad thing to say about it although it was a good 25 minutes walk to the Ponte Vecchio Bridge and all the shops etc. All very safe though and the walk is lovely even at night. The rooms are a good size, very clean and bathroom and shower were great. There are tour groups staying here but it wasnt a problem. Breakfast good with plenty of choice and good quality. They have a nice decking area out the front probably for the smokers but we sat there a lot with a glass of wine after a hard day sightseeing. Florence is just gorgeous and so much to see within a very short area which is all walkable. Cant wait to go back but might try and stay somewhere nearer than the Mediterraneo.

<Content>Good hotel for price, close enough to center Stayed here for 3 nights during our recent visit to Florence. While the hotel facilities are really more 3 star, I gave it 4 because of the great deal we got through their website. During a heavy tourist weekend in Florence (first week of September) when hotels were pretty solidly booked or were going for well over 200 euros a night, we were able to get a 95 euro per night rate including breakfast. For that price, this review gets 4 stars.Like others have mentioned, this is (American) tour group central. There were at least 5 groups while we were there, but we only really ran into them at breakfast, and like another poster mentioned, the hotel treats everyone pretty much the same, tour group or not. While I fell in love with Florence, I found Florentines to be a bit curt. However, the front desk clerks were always helpful and friendly. The lobby and room decor is classic 80s, I guesss I'd call it. You can tell it's probably from that era, but it's an 80s look that doesn't really go tacky (i.e., completely safe). We were fine with paying 5 euros to use the computers in the lobby for 30 minutes.Breakfast is only average, but if you pick the right items, you can fill up at least 'til a late lunch. Generally, stick to the breads, cereals, pastries and cold meats, and avoid the eggs and bacon, neither of which looked like the real thing. Our room, 121, was standard and on the small side. It was, however, very clean and even had a flat-screeen tv with about 20 channels (mostly Italian). Our bathroom was big, with two wash basins, a toilet that was a little too high and a space-age type shower. We didn't have problems with noise from neighboring rooms but we were out all day and didn't get back until late at night, when we showered and went right to sleep.Now, as to the location issue-----the hotel is not in the center of Florence, and is more on the perimeter of where central Florence begins. If you find the right streets, Santa Croce is only about 5 minutes away and you can make it to the Ponte Vecchio in about 15 minutes. As the hotel is located behind a meridianed street that faces the Arno, one way to walk from the very center to the hotel is to follow the river-- a beautiful walk. We were actually happy to be staying just a little further as we perhaps got to see some views that visitors staying closer might miss. The only real distant place is the train station. We did make the 45 minute walk once at night, but the taxi was only about 8 euro which was well worth the price when we left early in the morning.My only complaint about this hotel is the lack of irons; there was none in the room and when we called the front desk, we were advised there was no ironing room and no irons to deliver to the room and we'd just have to send clothes out to their ironing service. This is really a cheap and unnecessary way for the hotel to make a buck.As for dinner, we ate twice at Il Giardino delle Follie Estive, the restaurant right next door to the hotel. It's an informal, neighborhood place with basic Tuscan staples (except the pizza) done very well. Despite being next to a large hotel (and therefore, a captive audience), we liked the fact that locals outnumbered tourists, prices were reasonable and the food was very good. Another good (and cheap) option is Negroni---cross the bridge in front of the hotel and walk about 4 (long) blocks going toward the Ponte Vecchio (it's in a little crowded square with about 2 or 3 other bars). Negroni lays out food to nibble with drinks like at many US happy hours, except that this is Italy and the nibbling consisted of a delicious risotto, penne, mixed vegetables, salads, breads and a few sweets. For 8 euro, we ordered a glass of wine each and filled up on the food and better yet, the place was full but without a tourist in sight.Although it's not the lap of luxury, I would definitely stay at the Grand Hotel Mediterraneo again. It doesn't pretend to be something it's not and actually does very well at being what it is.

<Content>Large, Busy but very efficient. Great Breakfast! We stayed here for a 4 day / 3 night break and yes, we agree with other reviews that the hotel is a short stay base for tour groups, coach arrivals and departures constantly ( during our stay, mainly very loud American parties ). Saying that, overall the hotel is very efficient in dealing with this constant guest turnover, and we were more than pleased with the selection and presentation of the breakfast, which set us up for the day exploring the sights of Florence. Yes, the hotel is a walk into the central part of Florence, but to be honest, with the noise and bustle of the town centre, a quieter location may be preferable to some ( although the front of the hotel does face a busy road ).We ate in the hotel restaurant twice, menu was quite limited but we enjoyed the food, and the staff were pleasant and professional. We had a airy room at the front of the hotel, which was very clean and modern with air conditioning, we didnt have a problem with the bathroom as other reviewers have, quite adequate with a bath and shower, although take your own hairdryer as ours blew cold air! We agreed with the view that noise insulation could be better, but then the noise disturbance we encountered was more to do with ignorant, rude guests who couldnt give two hoots for their fellow guests!Overall, good value hotel for the price.

<Content>Wonderful place to stay in Florence We spent 4 nights here. While the hotel does cater for large tour groups it has time for the individual guests too. We booked a superior double with hotels.com for 鈧?51 per night including buffet breakfast. The room was spotlessly clean, plenty of towels, toiletries etc. and had a very comfortable bed. The reception staff were pleasant and helpful. We used the hotel car park for 鈧?0 per night but there is also free on-street parking. Its a lovely 15 minute walk along the Arno to Piazza Santa Croce (try Enoteca Boccadama for dinner one evening if you have time). There is a lovely pizzeria called Gattabuia (13/15r Lugarno Cellini) which is a lovely local restaurant with great food. Bring your phrase book - they don't have an English menu! Thanks to all at Grand Hotel Mediterraneo for a wonderful stay.

<Content>Decent hotel...unfortunate location We just came back from Italy and stayed at this hotel for three nights while in Florence. It is a large, modern hotel that really does have a ton of group tours staying there. The location is quite far from central Florence, unfortunately. It took about 20 minutes of walking briskly to get to Santa Croce and another 15 or so to get to the Duomo. Add more time if you are just walking at a normal pace. The buses in Florence are very confusing but we were able to find a stop a few minutes walk from the hotel that takes you to the Duomo. (Note: the stops and bus numbers are different when going into the city and when coming back.) Walking places from the hotel was ok at first but after a busy day sightseeing and shopping, that long walk back was annoying and tiring.Our room and bathroom was VERY small but fairly clean. Beds were exceptionally comfortable. The maid did not restock any of the toiletries we used for the entire three days but I am sure she would have if we had bothered to ask. The front desk reception was usually busy but helpful and friendly for the most part. Breakfast was excellent, with scrambled eggs, bacon, cold cuts, breads, cereals, fruit and yogurt. The hotel is located on a very busy street and our room faced that street. While we had a lovely view, even with the windows closed we heard cars and ambulance and police sirens constantly all night. Ask for a room facing the back of the hotel.If I were to go back to Florence, I would probably not stay here again, choosing a hotel more centrally located instead.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel with Beautiful People Clean and Safe, staffs are very helpful, food is very good. The Grand Hotel Mediterraneo has a wonderful view over the famous river Arno banks (called Lungarni), near the beautiful Piazza Santa Croce, with a stunning panorama of the city Renaissance beauties along the river Arno and on the Florentine hills. Whether you are staying in Florence for work or for a sightseeing tour, you will find the warmth of the typical Florentine hospitality, in a modern and comfortable setting. The hotel position is ideal for its closeness to the city historical centre. The Grand Hotel Mediterraneo is very close to the most important monuments, including Piazza Santa Croce, Piazzale Michelangelo, the Uffizi Gallery and Ponte Vecchio. At walking distance from the hotel you can find the most glamorous shopping area, such as Via Tornabuoni, Via Roma, Via Calzaiuoli and Via della Vigna Nuova. (Regin Lagaac -Cambridge UK)

<Content>Great Hotel, perfect location The hotel is in a perfect location, directly across from the Arno River, and within easy walking distance to the Piazza Santa Croce, Piazza Signoria, and the Piazza Michelangelo. Lobby is very spacious, perhaps the largest and most comfortable in Florence. Rooms are nicely appointed, with American plug in the bathroom - a rare and nice touch. Food in the hotel restaurant is surprisingly good, and the service is first rate. A top-notch hotel.

<Content>Not very impressed My daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights during a tour of Italy. This was the worst of the three hotels that we stayed in. Room was small and overlooked a back parking lot. The bathroom was even smaller with a shower so small that you could not even turn around in it. It was almost impossible to sit on the toilet which was wedged between the wall and the shower without hitting your arm on the toilet paper hanger. It certainly did not look like the pictures that were posted. It was also exceedingly noisy as many tour groups are booked here, especially teens. Carpets and room decor need some renovation. Food was ok but nothing to write home about. Location was a good walk from everything. The worst part however was the indifference of the front desk. Good luck if you have a real problem. The place has no charm or character (very production line) We were glad to leave and would definitely not stay here again.

<Content>Decent hotel This is a decent hotel just outside the historic center.It is quite large and was used by many tour groups when we were there. It felt that we were the only ones not part of some group - actually, it felt that staff didn't know there were any guests in the hotel not part of a group.Breakfast was reasonable.Parking is very limited, although there is metered parking right outside (free at night).Wireless Internet was only in the lobby (3eur for 1hr, 5eur for 5hrs). Supposedly, rooms on 2nd floor have Internet access as well.Would probably stay here again if the price was right.

<Content>AAA+ Was the best hotel of 7 I stayed at in a tour of London, Rome, Venice, Florence and Brussells. Top notch is all aspects except one -- it's huge and room can be a maze to find. Kinda like Vegas hotels can be. But that's a minor point. This has the best lobby in the world. Great food, great location. You'll love this place.

<Content>Nice Hotel We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in May. Great location, good service, very good breakfast. I left my new designer jeans in the room and I realized that when we were in Rome 2 days later. I called the hotel and they found my jeans and returned them to me with another tour group. I was pleasantly surprised. I appreciate such service and I am very thankful to Sylvia.  I would certanly reccomend this hotel.

<Content>What a shame What a shame! The hotel has good potential but they miss on service level on so many aspects, ok location, impressive on entrance areas but Reception staff that bounce all the questions back to you, pityfully small bedrooms that are claustrophobic, ditto en suites, faded carpets, stained walls, bathroom extractors that dont work, advance email requests ignored, and all this for 拢1,200 a week for a mini twin room which on comparing with a walk around to others was proven to be excessive. Terrific holiday in Florence, and 'ok' marks to hotel. I would say it was more like a 2 to lower 3 star, but if they employed a manager with an eye for detail, they could get up to 3 star. Dissapointed significantly and would choose not to stay here again, with so many other better hotels nearer town.

<Content>Loved the hotel, hated the breakfast We passed the hotel in our search for a night in Firenze, the reception was very professional, the room OK, but at the buffet breakfast we were very happy to find hot omlettes, after some hotels which offered only cold things, but the omlette was cold and had a very funny taste. We told the waiters that the heating is not working and that the omlette was cold, they were very kind and brought us another one, but still, it was lukewarm and not eateable. It's a pity, because in other aspects the staff  hotel were very agreable.

<Content>Nice clean and comfortable hotel Had a comfortable and pleasant stay at this hotel which is about a 10-15 minute walk from the city centre. It is located next to the River Arno and there is a riverside cafe opposite where you can sit out for a cool drink in the evening. The bedroom was clean and comfortable as was the bathroom which appeared to be newly refurbished.Breakfast time is busy. It's a help yourself buffet style with lots of choice (hot and cold). The hotel seems popular for coach parties and if you are not part of a group tour you need to make this clear at breakfast as there are two dining areas for tours and others. The breakfast room for people who are not part of a tour is available until 10 am whilst the one for tour groups closes at 9.The hotel has internet facilities (5 Euros for half an hour if you don't have your laptop with you).You can book the open top bus city tour from the hotel reception which takes you round the major sights and you can hop on and off as you like.The major attractions are very busy during the day but queues for the galleries die down from 4 p.m. onwards when the tour groups leave.Overall a very pleasant hotel in good location. We didn't use the dining room for dinner as there is an excellent italian restuarant next door.No tea and coffee making facilities in the bedrooms so take your travel kettle.

<Content>Great location not so great hotel Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in March. Great location but this is about all this hotel has going for it. Many tour groups of teens book this hotel. I assume because of the price. Don't plan to get much sleep as you will be woken up many times in the night due to noise. The wall are very thin as people have mentioned and kids are up running around until all hours of the night. If you just want a cheap place in a great location to explore florence I would recommend staying here.

<Content>Small Bathroom but very clean Hmmm ok let me first stay I am very used to traveling in American hotels not as much in international hotels. This was the cleanest and nicest hotel I stayed at of the 3 hotels I stayed at in Italy. The room was very clean as was the bathroom. The bathroom was very small the shower stall was tiny... I can see this being a problem it you are a large person. However it was very clean no mold or anything .The breakfast buffet is great. But the biggest drawback is that this hotel is quite far from the main sites. And was a inconvenience in the evening after we finished dinner and the buses were not running frequently. (Taxis were also limited) and we had to walk (which was fine with my husband but was not fine for me)

<Content>Nice Hotel The hotel is very nice, the room was very comfortable and clean. The food is great. The location of the hotel is not near the most touristic places but is near transporation to get there.The attention at the front desk was not very professional in some occassions, they did not show much interest to help the guest and actually one of the clerks was rude.I like the hotel in general despite the attention of the front desk.

<Content>Great place to base your trip to Florence We visited Florence in May 2005 and stayed for five nights at the Grand Hotel Mediterraneo. I found this place to be a fantastic deal. It is not luxurious; however, the rooms were very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was large for European standards. In addition, the breakfast in the morning was plentiful, with both hot and cold choices. I found the location to be perfect. It was far enough away from the traditional touristy places to a bit less expensive; however, close enough for a very pleasant walk. One could reach the Duomo in 15-20 minutes and the main Florence train station in about 35-40 minutes. In addition, we traveled with someone who was in a wheelchair, and the distance of this hotel was not at all a problem for us (although traveling via wheelchair in Florence can be challenging, with narrow/cobblestoned sidewalks!). There is a charming little park right across the street from the hotel, where we relaxed on our first day. If you seek luxurious accomodations, there are better hotels for you. However, don't think this place is spartan - I found it to be a fine hotel for the price and an above average stay. A great place for families or friends traveling together, but I might choose a place a bit more sumptuous for a honeymoon or something special. Keep in mind that we are the kind of travelers who are constantly on the go, so luxury is often wasted on us given that we hardly spend any time in the hotel room!Ciao!

<Content>Paper thin walls I stayed at this hotel 8 yrs. ago and generally had no problems. We just stayed here in Florence in November and I was not so impressed. The room was small and thread bare. The bathroom was even smaller, and the shower was very tiny. I am five feet, two inches, and I was bumping my arms in it.We had a loud group of teenagers staying in the room next to us. We could hear every word. Finally, we had to bang on the wall. I slept with earplugs, and it was still not enough of a noise buffer. The next day, the maid did not supply us with ANY toilet paper or soap. Luckily, I had brought some toilet paper from home, but this was still unacceptable. We bought our own soap and those tiny hotel soaps were not replenished each day. The front desk made sure that the toilet paper issue was rectified about an hour or so later.The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. It was a nice ten or fifteen minute walk from the center of town, which was fine. The front desk staff all spoke fluent English and were moderately helpful, but overburdened with large tour groups. Breakfast was included and consisted of breads, lunch meats, yogurts, eggs, cereal and bacon. I would not stay here again.

<Content>Pretty average all around Hotel is clean. Lots of tour groups stay at the hotel. The standard room we got was really small even by European standards. Breakfast was included which is a plus. 20 minute walk to sites, but nice to be away from the noise. Hotel staff is not-so-great...we missed our tour to Siena because they told us to wait in the wrong place and then didn't want to take responsibility for misdirecting us. Could be just one staffer, but still...

<Content>Good value at height of expensive tourist season I spent three nights at the hotel, which I booked fairly last minute after finding out any more central hotels in Firenze were too expensive or booked out. We had a double room - the bed was pretty big, but the room was small. It came with ensuite, TV, mini-bar and free buffet breakfast, which was ok. B'fast was yoghurt, fruit, cereal, pastrics, hot drinks, etc. The staff were friendly and can sell you bus tickets if you need them. The hotel is right near the Arno River and it takes about 15 mins to walk to the Ponte Vecchio (Old Bridge), from there you're near the Uffizi gallary and then onto the Duomo (Cathedral), which is probs about 30 mins away from the hotel. Also nearby is the area of Santa Croce, which has lots of trattoria, osterias and cool bars. I would stay here again at the last min, but if I had more time would probably go a bit central or rent an apartment.

<Content>A pleasant place in a perfect location! We stayed in Florence for 5 days and the hotel provided an optimal combination of facilities, location and price! 10 minutes walking from busy touristic places, it has a great view on the other bank of Arno and the city. A few excellent restaurants can be found on the way to the center, where mostly locals go - real Italian food and no extra charging.Hotel staff is great. The air company lost our luggage and we've got a big support from the reception desk when contacting the LostFound office. In evening the suit case was already in our room.

<Content>Fine place On a tour with the French club, and the facility was clean and well kept. the tour groups are put in the back of the facility away from the other guests. The staff was quickly impatient with the teenagers, but the stay was very good. Location of 15 minute walk to city center and most sites was perfect.

<Content>Somewhat basic but clean... Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights as part of a tour. Our room was on the small side, but was clean. Rooms have small fridges, so you can store water and other beverages. The lobby is nice, with big sofas where you can relax or meet up with the rest of your group. The lobby also has approximately 4 computer terminals where you can use the internet. (5 euros for half an hour) The hotel itself is located about 20 minutes walk from the center, in a nice neighborhood. We had no problems walking back in the evenings, although there is nothing much around the hotel. We didn't have any dinner at the hotel, so I cannot comment on the meals other than breakfast. Our breakfasts were served in the basement tavern and consisted of croissants with preserves, cold coffee, too sweet juices and warm milk for the cereal. We found the various staff to be helpful and courteous. A good place if you don't plan on spending a lot of time at the hotel.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay As part of a tour group, I stayed at this hotel and found it to be a very pleasant stay. Contrary to what other reviews have said, I was able to walk leisurely down the Arno River to the main sights (the Duomo, Ponte Vecchio, etc.) in about 15 minutes. Thus, while it is not right next to the city centre, it was close enough for me, and the walk was very nice as I got to take in the sights and sounds of Florence. In addition, I did not find the neighborhood unsafe at all, even at night (and I went to college in South Central Los Angeles, so I know a bad neighborhood when I see it). I was lucky to stay in a triple occupancy room, so my review might be a bit different from others, but my room was spacious and comfortable. The bed I slept on gave me a great night's sleep as well. It was also quiet, which was very important for me as I am a light sleeper. While the bathroom was small, it was clean and good enough for me since I was out most of the day sightseeing. While this hotel is certainly not a luxurious hotel, it provided a very comfortable stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Grand Hotel Mediterraneo Florence This is a clean and well presented hotel facing onto a nice view of the river. Being on the river also makes it easy to find. It has a large and spacious foyer area. The room was well presented and clean and tidy. All the facilities one would expect in a hotel of this calibre were present. The only problem I had was that the safe in my bedroom was not working. This was reported within minutes of my arrival into my room but when leaving three days later it had still not been repaired. The buffet breakfast was fine and caters to all tastes. However, my wife and I had dinner here the first night. The quality of the food was no more than average and certainly what not I would have expected. There are many restaurants in Florence where you can eat for the same price but get much more. Apart from these two points, I would recommend the hotel as a place to stay.

<Content>OK hotel This hotel caters to tour groups. It's about a 10-15 min walk to town center and a taxi rdie over there is under 10 bucks. So if the hotel rate is low then it's a very good deal overall.The rooms and the bathrooms are very small. But if you are out sightseeing all day then it's no big deal. The free breakfast buffet is pretty good. They actually have hot food. The front desk is indifferent. Some of the workers don't know what they are doing, others are OK.The big problem is the bedbugs. We all got biten quite a few times. I know other people who had the same problem. Makes one wonder how clean this hotel really is.

<Content>Good base for touring I would totally agree with the review from New York on 28th Jan 05. The front desk staff would indifferent to us, though the restaurant's staff were very helpful  polite.We spent a week there, used it as a base for touring round by car. There're free car parks outside the hotel most of the time - we only had difficulty once or twice. It's a 5-10mins drive to town, 20mins to airport  easy access to the rest of Tuscany. If you're feeling energetic, you could talk a scenic walk to town.The rooms are standard-sized, clean  not noisy (we were facing the road  river). The blinds cut out the morning sun.

<Content>Bombarded by bus tours I was on the bus tour from hell - Grand European Tours, nonetheless - when we finally arrived in Florence. The hotel was packed, with more bus tours than I've ever seen in my life.It was chaos trying to check in, and they didn't have an extra room key for me until I practically had to beg for one ... only to find it didn't work when I got to the room. Room was OK, high ceilings, nice view of close by apartments with dirty laundry hanging from balconies. Fun if you want to people watch and have them stare right back. No screens on windows.We were given the impression everything was within walking distance or close to a bus route. WRONG! The hotel is in an unsavory, unsightly section of Florence, not a place I would want to walk around in alone or without an armed guard. I feel safer in Detroit at night!The lobby is nice and spacious, with so-so food in the restaurants (no restaurants, shopping or other commercial districts nearby, so hotel is only real option), and every night I tried to use one of the four Internet computers, only they were all occupied or not working! The front desk staff was very rude and snooty when asked politely for extra towels, a taxi, or extra room key.I was locked out three times because I stayed more than one night. Cleaning staff and restaurant staff made up for the front desk snobs and management.Unless you have no other choice of accommodation, DO NOT STAY HERE!

<Content>lovely hotel, but a little far from everything We visited this hotel in January, 2005. The hotel is lovely, well appointed, with a friendly, helpful staff. Their restaurant recommendations were very good and helpful. The only disadvantage was that it was much further away from the town center. The online travel service mentioned that it was closer than it was. It is in a lovely residential area across the street from the River Arno. Very scenic.

<Content>Bit out of the way... Nice accommodations, but a bit out of the way. Staff was not friendly and requests to housekeeping took over an hour after a second phone call to the front desk. OK to stay if you can tolerate the arrogance of the front desk and not expect a smile when being greeted. Always expect to wait for front desk acknowledgement - the 3+ staff members will always conclude their socializing before acknowledging your existence.

<Content>Stay somewhere else We stayed here for one night as part of our tour in November 2004. The room was extremely small, there's only a few inches between our twin beds The bathroom was also small, one may feel castrophobic in the tub with the shower doors shut. The buffet breakfast room was packed with many many tourists. It's not too centrally located, as it takes more than 20 minutes to walk to the major tourist attractions. If you can get a good price, go ahead and stay here, if not try somewhere else.
