<Content>worth a stay Booked the spa pool villa via Asiarooms.com at USD 191 for a triple per night. Stayed 3 nights. As this was the first time we stayed at a villa, the experience was very pleasant the moment we step into the property. The rooms were all prepared with extra beds as reserved. Design and decor was modern and the villa was clean. The service level of the villa staff is fantastic. Always ready to serve and conscious of the guest privacy. Although some reviews stated that the main door which could be seen through, it was really not that bad. Breakfast is ordered night;y via a menu and served promptly according to the time you stated in the villa. The portions were generous and we normally did not manage to finish all of it. Overall this villa is a good choice between comfort/privacy/cost.

<Content>The Perfect Villa We stayed at Uma Sapna for just a day and we wished we could stay forever.After the hustling bustling Kuta and two busy diving days in Gili, we were happy to nestle in this quaint private villa in Seminyak. Gili Cat provided transportation to drop us off at Uma Sapna (they didn't know where it was but luckily we wrote down the villa's telephone # and address), upon arrival, we were greeted by our first names right away, they were expecting us! They took us to our 1-bedroom villa which was tastefully decorated, comfortable, clean, and amazing! It has everything you need, definitely your home away from home.The bathroom has glass walls surrounding the bathtub so you get immense natural lighting. There are two sinks, two closets, two towels and two hangers on each side, so you and your traveling companion each get your own private comfort in a way. The private pool is very inviting, and water temperature is just right. You can turn on or off the whirl as you wish. Bottles of drinking water are complimentary, you can request them whenever you run out. Location is ideal, as you can easily walk out to Seminyak street to shop or eat. Made's Warung is pretty good. Or you can take a short taksi ride to the expensive restaurants close to the beach. We tried to walk to the beach around noon, but it was really hot so we ended up hailing a taksi. Uma Sapna also gave us a complimentary 15 min massage. They call your room to remind you about the appointment too. They also proactively call on your check out day to see if you need help with your luggage. The villa is also connected to a small modern art museum. It was a pleasant surprise to discover the little artistic architecture space.Overall we had a fantastic stay at Uma Sapna, we highly recommend this villa and we will definitely come back again.

<Content>love!love!love! there are no flaws found here.. great villas.. great food.. great staff.. great landscape.. uma sapna was our last stop during our honeymoon. the moment we stepped into our villa (which, we were upgraded from the private spa villa to private pool villa).. we know our 2 nights won't be enough. the rooms were made twice a day. breakfast served at our villa (and it was good too!).we loved everything about it. and we left with a heavy heart. will definitely return..

<Content>Loved Uma Sapna, it's the perfect place! We stayed in one of the deluxe villas with it's own private pool and it was amazing. The layout is perfect, very modern, very clean and the service is impeccable. After staying in a number of places in Bali, our last stop was Uma Sapna in Seminyak and it couldn't have been a better place to finish our holiday. It's very secluded and away from it all but only a 5 minute walk to Eats Street and a quick taxi to the shopping area. Breakfast is delivered to your villa each morning and the selection is fantastic. I highly recommend Uma Sapna to anyone who's looking for a luxurious stay in Bali, it was paradise!!!

<Content>Service, luxury and location - what more? We stayed here in February and now 8 months later I'm writing this review. This place is wonderful and would count as a great value by most any 5 star travellers standards. Car transfer from airport was easy and helpful. checkin same. room was spacious and well appointed. breakfast was probably the most average but not awful just, well, average! the pool and grounds were well maintained for our 5 night stay. tip: bargain laundry's located nearby at a 10th price of hotel. also it's probably about 15 mins walk to nightlife like at ku de ta (if thats of interest). but this would be often quicker than by car as the narrow roads and traffic to the beach would often take longer at dusk\night. any measure of a hotel is gauged by the question would I recommend to friend? Answer: absolutely.

<Content>Hidden Gem This review is long overdue. I booked a 1-room with spa pool for 2 nights at USD100/nite and to our surprise they upgraded us to a new 1-room with private pool upon check-in. We were also given 2 complimentary 15-minutes massage voucher to be used anytime.The new section has a chic and modern feel to it. It has an open kitchen and living room. We get breakfast served into our villa. The only drawback is it's location. Although it's just a 10mins walk to the restaurants and bars, but the road is dark and quiet.They also provide return airport transfer. However, on the day of check out, all their cars were out. Immediately they called a cab and paid for it. Overall this place made our trip the more memorable.

<Content>Service and Style!!!! Well after a 2 hour wait in the immigration queue, I finally got out to the arrivals hall, and got into the wrong transfer car - silly me forgot to cancel the other reservation. Although all was fine and the people from Uma Sapna were able to pick me up from the centre of Seminyak anyway.On arrival they did as the booking had stated. I had a welcome drink, bags taken to my room, and then concierge/front desk go through all relevant information with me, where to go, where to eat, what to do.... I pretty much got as much information as I could handle!For a solo traveller, 9 days was plenty, yet on the last day I thought to myself that I could have stayed a couple more even. Uma Sapna was inviting and pleasant to stay in. The rooms were crisp, clean and new. The set up, the furnishing, very chic and modern. The private pool to die for. Room service and mini bar were reasonably priced and at times you would reconsider going shopping for supplies if you had it available there.Definitely will be going back there again.

<Content>Luxury, privacy and great location! This is one of the best hotels I've ever been!We stayed in one of the private villas with our own swimming pool and we absolutely loved it. It was the best of both worlds: your own private villa with all the services of a hotel!The room was big, the pool really nice and you really have a boutique feeling about thsi hotel - exactly what I like.The staff was extremely friendly and helpful: we had a problem with our plane tickets and they phoned friends to help us, the director let us used his office for at least 2 hours to make calls, go on internet, etc.It is on a quiet street just off the center of Seminyak so you are really close to all the shops, bars and restaurant while being in a quiet place.If you want to treat yourself go there!

<Content>Private villas at a great price! We chanced upon this hotel when we shifted out from our legian beach hotel (bali niksoma) after one night. Bali Niksoma was way below expectations - musky room, old furnishing, so we decided to check out immediately the next morning.Desperate for another place to stay, the staff at bali niksoma (was impressed with their service though) helped us to source for a few nearby locations. I remembered Uma Sapna from my earlier internet research, so we decided to call them and check for availability.We were amazed to be offered USD160 nett for a 2 bedroom villa with its own pool! Of course 1 room was locked cos I think 160 USD is the price for the 1 bedroom villa. Was thrilled to enjoy the 2 bedroom villa at a 1 bedroom price, though! Really blessed and it's the favour of God! The villa was very spacious, airy and quite well-maintained. Bed was comfy, bathroom was huge with double sinks, and the shower area was spacious. The bath tub was also very big. What I enjoyed most about this villa was that you could hang out in the outdoor living room, and enjoy the quiet, tranquil surroundings, and even catch glimpses of little birds/toads roaming in your private carpet-grass garden...If you are a couple and want to stay here, I suggest you stay at their newly constructed villas at the opposite compound. the one bedroom villas are gorgeous! Very modern and minimalistic. We took a peek and think if we do come back here, we would want to stay at their new villas. Another amazing thing about this place is that they provide free mineral water (normal, hot or cold) from the mineral water dispenser in your villa. On top of that, they give you up to 10 small bottles of mineral water everyday!Service by the staff was prompt and personal. The main downside is the breakfast. Not great. But you can walk out to Eat Street (Jln Laksmana) for food in less than 10 minutes or eat at the 24 hour diner called Soho that is at the beginning of the Eat Street.Try Ultimo for great and cheap italian fare at Eat Street or take a short cab ride to Ryoshi Jap restaurant (at 17, Jln Raya Seminyak) for delicious Jap food. It's a MUST TRY if you are a jap food fan. We went there everyday! Sometimes even twice a day! The butter fish sashimi, breaded deep fried oysters and red bean and macha ice-cream are out of this world!For spa, you can try the Da La spa at Villa De Daun. In my opinion, it's the most beautiful spa I have ever been too! Check out the Villa De Daun website for the spa rooms. They are very opulent and luxurious. I guarantee you'll be blown away! But it's not cheap. A 2.5 hour package for a couple is about USD 168. But worth every cent!I would stay here again if I were to come back to Bali. Another villa I have stayed in that is prob a class up but more expensive is the Kayana. But Kayana's location not that good. But it's also very private and well-maintained.

<Content>blissful retreat It was a while ago, but we adored Uma Sapna. Having our own pool was fabulous. On the downside it IS quite a long walk from the beach/restaurants etc, especially in the dusty heat. Fabulous restaurants in the vicinity. Great value for money (which is slightly unusual in Bali).

<Content>New Stylish  My partner and I had a great stay in the new villas at Uma Sapna. They are very nice, contemporary, modern, stylish, and beautifully designed. Lovely to have such a big pool and stylish villas right in the middle of Seminyak. Very peaceful and quite!The only downside was the restaurant was not open yet (set to open early feb) and the food quality for breakfast was poor. Staff were nice some however do not really understand English and therefore makes it hard to communicate and we never really knew if they understood us or not. Overall great place!

<Content>overrated and overpriced Overrated villa. Nothing to shout about. Basic and tired looking. Looks more like a normal house or chalet than a villa. Nothing luxurious about it. Tasteless and bland design. Garden is unkempt. Quite a number of mosquitoes flying around. An important point to note is that there is NO kitchen. The so-called kitchen is just a small space with a kettle. Quite pathetic. Another point is that the room space is very small. And there is no door between the room and the toilet. So before you bathe, its really cold in the bathroom. After you bathe, the room is really hot due to heat from the warm water. Staff here just goes about their own business, so don鈥檛 be expected to be pampered. A good point is that the breakfast has quite a good spread. And the staff is experienced and knows what to do. Conclusion 鈥?Don鈥檛 expect too much from this villa. Overrated and overpriced.

<Content>Loved Uma Sapna Modern Heaven! We walked into our private villa with a splash pool and our mouths dropped - beautiful! The outside area is perfectly manicured, with a lounge chair, couch and mini-fridge. Inside, the decor is beautiful with dark wood and a bright orange painting. The air conditioning runs all day so it's nice and cool when we return. The staff is friendly, and breakfast is great. We didn't want to leave the room it was so nice. Besides breakfast we tried pizza and calimari which get a B. It is about a 15-20 minute walk to the beach but walkable to Eat Street and shopping.

<Content>Loved Uma Sapna! We absolutely loved our stay at Uma Sapna. The staff is very accomodating, attentive, and always with a smile, even helped us finding a box and packaging supplies to take all our purchases home. The villas are very nicely decorated in a modern asian style with clean lines. We stayed at 2 different villas (both had swiming pool), since we liked it so much we decided to book for the end of our trip after coming back from Java.Breakfast (included in the price) was never late and had option of American or Indonesian breakfast. You will fill out a card and hang it on your villa door at night and breakfast was delivered exactly what you ordered and the time you wanted it. We opted for Indonesian breakfast which was very good and fresh everytime, including fresh fruit (cut and juice) and option of capuccino, latte, tea etc. served in the privacy of our villa. Someone wrote that you can see through the bamboo doors, yes you could, if you really try to look. The resort was quiet and never felt the staff try to take a peek. We also got the chance to try some local fruits from the little fruit platter that was refilled everyday in our room.The Spa is wonderful and just a few steps from our villa, we tried it a couple of times, once time we lost track of time and were late for our spa treatment but they waited for us with no problem and always smiling. Read another comment that it was difficul to communicate in English. The staff at the front desk was fluent but you may run into someone who's not fluent (for example, the driver that took us to Ubud who happened to be at the office probably filling in for a little while until the front desk person returns, he couldn't completely understand what we wanted but he did try his best and went to get the front desk person immediately).It's true is not located in a busy main avenue, so you have to walk a little bit to get to the main road where you'll easily find a taxi. We don't mind walking and never felt it was not safe, but if you prefer the front desk will call a taxi for you. Maybe a couple of times the taxi driver didn't know exactly where it was located but it was not a problem, they speak enough English to be able to find the place. When we arrived, a driver with a sign was waiting for us at the airport and they also dropped us at the airport on the return home. They even picked us up from another villa we stayed in Sanur, all included in the price!We also rented a scooter just off Uma Sapna's street, where we got the best deal in town, so if you are not the typical tourist that needs a private driver in an air conditioned van i would highly recomended if you want to see Seminyak and surronding areas. But I don't recommend it if you go downtown unless you are an expert driving in traffic jams and caos. We wanted to go to Ubud and were looking for the best way to do it, we opted for having Uma Sapna drive us. The price difference was not huge and since we were happy with their service decided to save the hassle of trying to find a private driver - you can find drivers for a day at very good prices too. We forgot a our trip diary in the villa. I was very sad I left it since it described what we did for all the 3 weeks we stayed in Indonesia and thought they may have trashed it since it was only a few loose pieces of paper. As soon as we arrived home, we e-mailed the manager, her staff did not only saved it but she was mailing it to us at no charge. You may find this very usual in hotels in the US, but it's not common this kind of service outside the states for such great prices. After traveling in different parts of the world i was very pleased with our stay in Uma Spna, they did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable (even after we left) and carefree. I recommend you e-mail them directly to get a better deal, barganing is in their culture so don't be shy and you won't regret it!

<Content>So it was nearly a year ago So I was taking a short stop there with a friend of mine who knows the area well and found this little gem on the internet.I was bowled over by the place... Clean, efficient, luxurious, friendly and most of all.... SAFE. Breakfast delivered on our porch every morning was tasty and the main pool was quiet but clean - could have done with more sun loungers though. Good value for money but contact them direct for a competitive quote.Seminyak is one of the best places in Bali to stay with so many resturants and spas on your door step.One thing I would watch out for is the exchange rate. If you are travelling from the UK watch out for the US Dollar advertisied price on spas and hotels. when you get there, they charge you Rupee's which sometimes means you don't get such a good deal. Overall, I love bali and try and go back most years. Would highly recomend:KuDeTa - One of the most chic and elegant places in the sun I have ever seen. sun bathing during the day and teste their amazing salads for lunch. Cocktails at night but dinner is V priceyItalian food at Tratoria (Seminyak) is the best i have ever tasted outside of italy.Traditional balinese food at Ulam (Ubud) - try the grilled fish and eat the whole lot with your fingers!!!!BBQ on Jimbaran beach and watch the sun set - local fish all cooked on coconut husks - yum!

<Content>Oasis in Seminyak! I can't recommend this hotel enough, especially given the value. The room we stayed in was one with a plunge pool and garden both of which were well maintained. The room itself is tastefully appointed and spacious, and has a generous bath tub which looks out to the stars. The choice of breakfast in the mornings is fairly limited, but you're quite happy to overlook this given it's served in the privacy of your lovely garden. I also found the staff to be incredibly attentive and pleasant. Have told all my friends about this little oasis in Seminyak.

<Content>Great Rooms and a Lovely Pool The Uma Sapna was a great resort. My wife and I stayed there at the end of our honeymoon and it was the largest of the three places that we stayed. We originally booked a 1-bedroom with pool, but they upgraded us to a two-bedroom which was very nice. The pool is very nice and larger than I expected. The bedroom is very nice with all high-quality marble floors and bathroom. Very clean style. If you go to the Uma Sapna, you really want to stay in the larger rooms. The staff is friendly, but we had a hard time communicating with them in english. Also, it is kind of hard to find the resort unless you know what you are looking for. The food was pretty good with a wide selection of room service menu. We did not try the spa, but it looked nice. We wish we stayed in that villa longer because it was so nice. As far as Rooms go, It was the nicest villa we stayed at in bali. Would be great also for 2 couples because it was a very large space and we felt spoiled with all the room. Will be recommending it to all my friends.

<Content>An out of the way treat. . . Uma Sapna is a great villa enclave in central Seminyak, albeit tucked away and a bit tough to find. Once inside, guests will find a nicely landscaped compound, and delightful individual villas, each with a plunge pool. The vibe here is spare, Asian, and modern--with the sound level quiet. Breakfasts are decadent--the Mie Goreng is particularly good--and delivered to your private courtyard overlooking the pool. Bathroom is stunning--lots of marble, separate bathtub and shower, with light from the outside filtering in. . . Downsides include small patchouli scented soap, small bedrooms, and a location that can be tough to navigate; at night the back way from Raya Seminyak can have you confronting various barking dogs down an unlit somewhat broken-up road. Compared to some other spots in Seminyak, this is a great value.There is no restaurant here, but plenty of interesting spots are a 15 minute walk away. . .a particularly great choice is Antique, with innovative menus and inexpensive prices; Antique is on Dhyana Pura.if you want to go to the beach, the sands are about 15 minutes away as well. . .Seminyak's beaches are fine for walking, but the sand varies from the brown of graham crackers to the black of topsoil. NIce sunsets though. For gay travelers, take a cab to Callego Beach--the cab driver will know where it is--there are chaises, a waterfront restaurant, and massage areas, all in a grove overlooking the ocean. A great massage is about $6; lunch is less than $5.I'd definitely choose Uma Sapna again!

<Content>Excellant Villa Experience 3 generations of us went to UMA SAPNA. me, my wife, my mother and my niece. We spent 4 nights here to celebrate the New Year from 30th Dec to 3rd Jan.We could not be any happier with the choice!We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa. The 4,000 sq ft villa is walled in with its own Private Pool; 2 bed rooms; open verendah where one finds the living area / dining / open plan kitchen. And a wonderful garden. Spacious, well designed. The bathrooms are open plan, and I wished the bathrooms had doors. Although there were tvs in the rooms, and being a tv junkie, I wished there was a tv in the living area. Nonetheless, Pure luxury!Uma Sapna and the villa is secluded and private, and is in a quiet street but very very close (walking or very short taxi rides) to some of the finest dining and action and shopping spots in Bali. Although fully booked, we hardly saw the other guests. We couldnt be happier with the location.The service was exemplary. The reception we received was wonderful; we were personally greeted by the managers, who tried to settle us in quickly. Free spa treatments were offered and taken at the in-house GriLoke Spa. The staff were very helpful. They did their best to get us last minute reservations to the best restaurants, including on new years eve! The breakfast, was good and brought to us on time.Overall value for money is better than superb. I will definitely recommend UMA SAPNA, and if back in Bali, will surely stay here again.
