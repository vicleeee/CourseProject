<Content>Good value for location We stayed two nights in November 2008. Second stay here this year. Good value for the price. Positives: price, free parking, location (walking distance to Space Needle), room size, free breakfast and internet. Negatives: scary elevators, a little dirty and worn around the edges. If you need a place to stay that's near downtown and costs less than $120 for up to 4 people, this is not a bad choice.

<Content>Left after one night! I usually have great experiences at La Quintas but have learned now to avoid properties that are not newly built but were taken over by this chain. In general La Quinta Inns have fresh decor, spacious rooms and nice facilities at a reasonable price. However this one had bland, depressing decor, unattractive furnishings, cramped bath with no counter or shelf, moldy odor in room, bad directions given by desk staff, no parking, room looking straight into a buildiing under construction. I shortened my stay here and moved to a BB for my second night. The parking lot was a miniscule square with no outlet so once I turned the corner and found there were no spaces left, I had to BACK my car all the way out! Had to park around the block and walk back in the rain. The price $143 a night was not worth it!

<Content>Comfortable stay! The location allows good access to Seattle sights. Arriving late in the evening, all parking garage places were taken but the front desk kindly arranged for parking at the hotel across the street. We were pleasantly surprised that the 2 room suite was huge. Fridge, micro, sink, popcorn, bottled water were all pluses. The unit was very clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds we had ever experienced- very welcome after a long flight. Breakfast was nicely presented with do-it-yourself waffles. Staff was pleasant and friendly, as was everyone we encountered in Seattle.

<Content>Almost perfect For the price of 150$ for 4 people, this Hotel turned out to be great. The rooms were very good, big and well equipped with microwave, fridge, coffee maker and even popcorn!The breakfast is very generous, there is a hot tub and a nice internet workstation (with a printer, which could be very handy), and staff was very helpful (we asked for a room in the front and not in the construction side).Overall - Great value and a fine hotel.

<Content>Not bad for a short stay We stayed here for one night passing through Seattle on the way from Vancouver to Olympic NP. To be honest we actually found this place better than we were expecting - especially for the price. The rooms all opened to inside hallways - the hotel was several floors and had elevators. The rooms were pretty dated and had a bit of a musty smell, but the rooms were spacious and the beds comfortable with the A/C working fine. You actually had kind of a view of downtown Seattle out your window. The breakfast was the full typical La Quinta breakfast with lots of choices. The hotel does charge for parking (I think something like $10/night). However, we had to rent a car the next morning, and the host let us park for free for a couple of hours while we loaded it up. There's lots of parking meters nearby anyway. One of the elevators was constantly out of service, so you had to wait and wait and wait for the elevator. The area - its not great, but I wouldn't call it seedy - its mostly just remote compared to the rest of downtown, with just a couple of more run-down motels nearby. There were some great restaurants just a few blocks away - and we walked to them. There was also a Whole Foods like 2 blocks away. The price was excellent for downtown Seattle - really could not be beat at like $100/night. And there's really nothing flat out wrong with the place except the elevator. However, I'd only recommend a one or two night stay here at most. The area is a bit depressing, and the hotel a bit dated, dark, and dingy - so if you're just visiting Seattle for the first time or don't make it back much - you might want a nicer place for better memories.

<Content>Better than Expected After reading all of the reviews we were confused as to what we would find once we arrived. We decided to stick to our reservations because of the price and on average all the reviews were good with only a few exceptions. We stayed at this location as a pre-cruise stay to take in the sites at seattle. We also datyed there for one night post cruise and it was a great exp as well. When we arrived at the property, I was pleasently surprised with the location as the bldg itself;some of the pictures do not do it justice. The lobby area was very nicely decorated, clean, and nice to walk into. The staff was awesome, and since our room was available we were able to check in sooner. When we got to our room, we had a King suite and it was awesome. We requested the non-construction side since we had read some of the reviews. Our room faced the city and we could see the Space Needle from our room. The room was like a small apartment. We had a sink, microwave and fridge. The room was separate from the living room. Some one had writtten that the beds were the best beds that they had slept on, and we agree. The beds and pillows were awesome. It was the best beds we had ever slept on in any hotel. The hallways were very clean, room smelled nice as well. My parents stayed in another room and they had a balcony room that faced the city and it was awesome as well. Our main concern when staying in a hotel is cleanliness, beds and overall look of the room. This location had it all as far as we are concerned, and we are an extremely picky group when it comes to hotel stays. The breakfast area and what they offered was awesome as well.They had waffles that you could make and they had on some of the days biscuits and gravy. The location was in walking distance to alot of the locations. And if you wanted to visit the waterfront its was like 8 dollar cab ride. They now are adding 2.00 to each of the fares for gas, but even so for us it was 5.00 a couple. They are right next door to 2 car rental places where you could rent a car if you wanted too. Overall this hotel was better than expected and we were very pleased on the nice stay that we had there. Those that wrote a 'bit creepy' and the worst stay might have expierenced having bad rooms or the const side, but for us it was great.

<Content>a bit creepy As others have mentioned, the parking is VERY tight, and the construction was a bit noisy. We had a room facing the construction. The front desk staff said the construction noise would start around 9am, but of course it started much earlier. We were up early so it didn't wake us. There was limited parking right outside the front door, with the majority of parking under the hotel (I hate underground parking). We had to go through a construction zone to get to that camera-secured parking area, and then once parked we took the elevator directly to our floor. The elevators and elevator doors were jerky, and didn't always stop even with the floor. One day, my husband was checking the tires on our vehicle, and a maintenance guy came out to see what he was doing- basically making sure he wasn't doing anything illegal. This made me feel better knowing they were actually watching and following up on any suspicious activity. Housekeeping left something to be desired. After the first night (we stayed two), they took the soap and didn't leave any replacements. We didn't have enough towels, so called the desk for some to be sent up but they never came so we had to go get them. The hotel is directly across from a motel with questionable clientele - it made me a bit uncomfortable walking by, especially with small kids. The hotel is a 10-15 minute walk to the Seattle Center, which was very convenient.

<Content>Not the best The pictures they show you on the web site must be their top of the line rooms because the rooms they gave us where run done and in need of repair. The pipes vibrated when you ran the shower and sounded like they were going to come out of the wall. Also don't let them call you a cab because they are in with cab companies and will drop you off at the wrong locations. Forget about speeking to a manager beacause there never seems to be one on duty and if they are they just don't care about returning your calls. Next time I would pay a little more and get a hotel down by the water it seems it would be worth the extra money.

<Content>Nice place! Found this place on line, after weeks of searching hotels in downtown that weren't $450. We were so pleased! Especially loving their 1 pm check out time. Great beds, nice leather recliner--tv was smaller. Pet friendly. There was construction next door, but it did not disturb our sleep at all in the early morning. There are 10 parking spots right by the door if you are lucky enough to score one--tight squeeze for our SUV. The regular parking lot is around the block, and it was blocked by a truck--so they let us park right outside the door, until the truck left. Nice shower, pet friendly-- quick jaunt to the market, downtown, art museum, and Dick's drive in on Capitol HIll (which they nicely gave us directions for.) Room was quiet and nice ammenitites.

<Content>Good price, good location Yet another big confy two queens room on our US/Canada road trip. Absolutely clean and well maintained. No problem parking a minivan. Constructions going on at neighbours, but we are awake at 8.00,Maybe thats why the great rates at HW Complimetary breakfast is adequate. We walked to Space needle and downtown but there are a streetcar a few hunded yards away. Would definitely stay again and reccomend to others.

<Content>Not good for parking The hotel itself is older, but clean. Our room was very large, and even had a seperate bedroom from the living area. The parking is extremely limited and extremely tight. Don't try parking here unless your in an economy size vehicle.

<Content>Room with a view... of a building site I stayed in this hotel with my partner during our trip to Seattle. We booked our room via the lq.com website.The hotel is centrally located and very close to the city centre... certainly within walking distance. Ideal if you arrive in the city by Greyhound buses.When we arrived in our room, we discovered that it had a view of the building site instead of Seattle. It was quite noisy during the day and building works were staring at approx 8 am.The hotel computer, which was located by the reception desk in the business centre kept on crashing.The hotel serves cookies to its guests at 7 pm... these were lovely. Breakfast was quite simple, but plentiful.Our room was clean and well maintained.Upon checking out we mentioned the problem about the ongoing building works and computer troubles and we received a 50% discount on our stay.Overall quite a nice stay.

<Content>Great deal near downtown Stayed here while attending a conference, which was based at the Convention Center. It was about a ten minute walk to the Center each morning and a $6 or $7 taxi ride back each night (that includes the $2 surcharge for hike in gas prices). Made reservations online for $125 a night and ended up with a suite--fridge, microwave and a balcony. Queen bed with a pull-out couch. Sink outside the bathroom as well as inside. Also, free wireless Internet access. Breakfast came with the stay. Standard hotel breakfast-cereal, yogurt, fruit, pastries, coffee, juice. Also, could make your own waffle. Room was clean and did not notice a smell or siren noises at night. Construction was going on in back of hotel but my room was in front. Only noticed the construction during breakfast. Hotel staff very helpful. Convenient to downtown and waterfront. Did seem a little dated upon entering the hotel but will definitely stay here again if I return to Seattle.

<Content>Not bad for the price Scored a $98 dollar room here on priceline for a June weekend, a bargain for downtown Seattle in summer, with free parking, which alone saves at least 20 bucks. We showed up at 3:30 and the room was not ready but were told it would be in 30 to 45 minutes, which was fine, we took a nice walk. The place is just a handful of blocks away from the Seattle Center (space needle, etc.) and close to Belltown (clubs and restaurants) so it is well situated. We were given a room facing the city, which is great (construction on the backside of the hotel) and our room was one of a handful with balconies, a surprise given the price we paid and the fact the hotel was sold out that night. We expected a lousy room because of what we paid and the fact that we booked through priceline. Thanks to the desk clerk! (Very friendly staff by the way). The room was well-sized and a bit dated and the bedspread was stained with wine, but beyond that, this is a fine, plain vanilla place to stay in Seattle. It did smell a bit funky, as some reviewers have indicated, but no real complaints from us. This is a mediocre corporate america hotel chain with a mediocre breakfast bar, and overall a pretty quiet and nice place to stay.

<Content>Great Location and Price My family and I stayed at the hotel prior to leaving for our cruise to Alaska. The hotel was clean and neat. The rooms are small, but the bedding is very comfortable, and the bathrooms were spotless. I had read a lot of reviews and was a little nervous. But we did not have any problems with the hotel. It is convenient to everything, and a good price for the area. There was no smell (as others had mentioned), I was not bothered by the construction, and the breakfast suited us just fine.One thing I will note. DO NOT USE THE SHUTTLE SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE HOTEL. We made our reservations in advance, but they did not have enough room for all of us in the van and town car. So, we were stacked on top of each other like sardines. They expected us to pay full price when 2 of us did not have seats. I recommend that you use the standard services as recommended by Seattle tourism.

<Content>Loved this hotel! We were a family of four adults that stayed here for three nights May 21 - 24. We were so pleased, especially after reading some not-so-positive reviews. Our room had two queen beds. It was clean, a great size and we loved the microwave (popcorn provided), small refrig, and two sinks. All the staff were very pleasant and answered our questions and always asked if there was anything they could do for us. The breakfast was excellent and had a nice variety. We loved the location and easy walk to Seattle Center. Within our first hours there we walked to the Pike Street Market and back without any problem.We appreciated the free parking provided outside and in the garage area.We couldn't have asked for anything better. I'd return in a New York minute and I'm recommending it to anyone I know planning to head out to Seattle.

<Content>Everything we expected and more We were a little nervous after reading the reviews but we believe everything deserves to be tried at least once. We checked in with absolutley no problems. We were directed up to the 4th floor where we opened the door to a king suite. It had a king size bed in the bedroom with a sofa bed in the living room. We had a fridge and a microwave. It was great. The location was convenient and within walking distance to everything we needed.The breakfast was amazing, My son especially enjoyed making me waffles every morning. The home made cookies in the evening were a nice touch.Honestly we just have nothing negative to say about this hotel.

<Content>Roomy Place In a very walkable area of Seattle, located by Denny Way park. There was considerable noise from police and fire sirens several nights. The bedroom was very small, just enough room to walk around the bed. The living area is nice and roomy. The bathroom was small with no sink counter space. The only mirror in the entire hotel room was above the sink in the bathroom making it hard for two females to get ready in the morning. Loved the breakfast in the morning that is included in the hotel price. Very slow internet.

<Content>Horrible: SMELLED, DIRTY, OLD, AND NASTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We stayed at this hotel 2 nights it was horrible there was smeared dog crap on the floor, it smelled like [--] in the room, the room was filthy, the bed sheets were hanging out on the floor, the tub had dirt and hair in it, the mirrors were all dirty, the breakfast was out of everything an hour before it was supposed to end and they did not restock it, did not bring us new towels, very poor service!!!! I would not reccomend staying here to anyone, your better off paying more ateast you wont have to pay to park when you actually want to do something its not in walking distance to anything, very bad location..

<Content>It Wasn't All Bad! I enjoyed my stay their. They had a small spa area with a sauna, and jacuzzi. They even had a small gym. The location was ok, space needle was just a few blocks away... but it was a little far from everything else! So we walked to where we wanted to go and then took a cab back. The cab ride ranged from $6-$15 from downtown, chinatown, and pioneer square. There's a whole foods market behind the hotel that i really enjoyed. The construction next to the hotel made it a drag when i was trying to sleep in. So ask for a room on the other side of the construction! The rooms were clean, and had a lot more space than i expected. Breakfast was ok, they had the basic muffins, waffles, coffee, and more. I got the this room for $62.50 a night, so i thought the price was great!!! Really didn't have too much to complain about.

<Content>Run like the wind to another location! This property is horrible. Room is old and dirty. Furniture worn and in bad repair. NOT up to la quinta standards. Was supposed to stay two nights and checked out after 20 minutes! Please find another location downtown. Lots of choices in this price point.

<Content>A Bit Worn, but Great Location Though the building is showing its age, it was a good place to stay. The lobby and halls are a bit beat up, but the room was clean and comfortable and quite large. The free breakfast was fine, better than most. The staff was courteous and helpful. Best part was the location - easy walk to downtown shopping, the market and Seattle Center. And the rate, given that it was New Years, was excellent.

<Content>Good choice for couples, families Really very good value for money and comfortable enough. The location is not a problem - it's a little out of the very centre, but a $5 taxi ride from Pike's Place Market or a 15 minute walk. On the plus side, you're just a few blocks from the Belltown pubs and restaurants - good fun in the evening. It's great if you're dragging a car around - parking under the hotel is free. Rooms are spacious, beds, towels, etc very comfortable. There's a minimal spa pool, a gym, a free Internet computer, wi-fi and ice machines. Breakfast is OK, a little messy at times, but there are pastries, fruit, toast, waffles, etc, and it's included in your room rate. The only downside is the faint musty smell in the rooms that other reviewers have mentioned. It's there, but you'd have to be a fairly sensitive flower to let this put you off a good deal at $75-$100 per room in downtown Seattle.

<Content>Comfortable Beds! I stayed here for a conference in a downtown hotel. Well within walking distance of downtown and less than half the price of hotels there (plus this one had breakfast, which was pretty good). This hotel had the most comfortable beds I've encountered --- regular construction (springs) but with a nice foam topping --- so good support plus comfort. Which was a good thing, because I got very sick (tooth abcess) and spent several days in the bed! Staff knew I got sick, and were helpful.Great value for the price.

<Content>So very smelly I have stayed in nicer, newer La Quinta Inns BUT for the price, location and free parking this deal is really hard to beat. It's only a 10min walk to the retial part of downtown. The area around the hotel is a bit deserted at night but there is nothing to fear. Whole Foods market is a block away at the new Pan Pacific. Besides the Pan, the area is littered with low cost hotels. They are building it up quickly though and I am sure the area will be busier and ever better in the very near future.Ok, now for the weird - this hotel smells so bad. Not on the first floor or lobby but in the hallways and at least in our room. We stayed in room 506 - you could tell it was/is a smoking room but they use so much air freshener - I mean, more air freshener than you have ever smelled in your life. it knocks you over it smells so bad - more than anyone would ever use...ever. (think public beach washroom air freshener x100) Anyway, if you are at all sesitive to scent or headaches, really think twice about this hotel. I am NOT sensitive to scent and it drove me up the wall. I fear what they are trying to cover up. The worst was the next day - me and my friend's hair and clothes reeked of the scent. We kept catching wiffs all day. Anyway, I know that's a weird complaint but I wouldn't stay here again - all because of that. Shame too as everything else was great for the money. Be warned is all.

<Content>Not too bad, maybe bring an air freshener There are a few issues with this hotel, but overall we were satisfied and had a good stay. We stayed here for 4 nights in August and it suited our needs just fine.Beds: comfortable, we slept well. Bedding seemed a bit old.Room: very spacious- we had 2 queen beds and a desk with a chair. It was good to have the extra room as we had a dog and baby with us. It was quiet- we didn't hear any noise from inside or outside the hotel.Cleanliness: needs some improvement here. There were some hairs on the bathroom floor, and they weren't mine.Air conditioning: worked okay, there were 2 speeds. The windows don't open. We didn't have a balcony but that might be something to ask for.Breakfast: pastries, muffins, yogurt, make your own waffles- it was great to have a good breakfast each morning to start the day.Parking: 10 spots above ground, the rest is underground and around the back through an alley. It was tight but we have a truck with a canopy and we managed to get a space everytime. We saw SUV's parked underground, and even a Hummer (taking up 2 spots, grrr). You do need some good parking skills though.Location: Great! We walked everywhere. The area is not the nicest, with parking lots and some construction around, but we were never afraid. If you want to pay more you can stay more in the heart of downtown. There is a Whole Foods nearby. A great place to grab some food if you don't feel like eating out. There is a fridge and microwave in the room that we used quite a bit. Internet: One computer in lobby. We used it to print out some directions and didn't have to wait long to use it.Dog friendly: Dogs were welcome, no extra charge. Our dog seemed to like the room okay. There is a park nearby (Denny Park) where we took her to pee. There were homeless people in the park, but they never bothered us. The hotel is a bit old, so there are some issues. The elevator wasn't that bad, as others have said, it's just a bit noisy. Yes, there was a strange smell in our room. I couldn't quite place it, or find where it was coming from. It kind of bothered me, but was not a huge deal. An air freshener would have taken care of it. The TV remote did not work, but a call to the front desk fixed that. It was a bit hard to open our door with our keycards. We had to swipe them a few times, then had to get it fixed at the front desk.We chose this hotel because we wanted to stay in downtown Seattle but didn't want to pay too much. It still seemed a bit expensive, but considering we got free parking, free breakfast, and our dog stayed free, it was not too bad. If you don't have a dog and don't have to worry about parking, maybe consider a nicer place.

<Content>Nice Location Even though we arrived late at this hotel, we were given prompt attention. The desk clerk was fast and efficient. The room was large enough with a sink and dressing area outside the main bathroom. It was clean and held the normal toiletries and plenty of towels. The mattress was a bit soft and slightly lumpy but that didn't interfere with my sleeping. We were just there for one night to connect to our cruise to Alaska and conveniently, the hotel was just about a 10 minute ride to Pier 66. There was construction going on so our view was more than a city view - a great big hole and a bit of noise in the morning. Not a terribly big deal for us as we wanted to get out and about to see as much of Seattle in the morning as we could. The complimentary breakfast was excellent with a make your own waffle, dry cereal, biscuits and gravy, coffee, tea, milk, danish pastries and a variety of fruit. Pretty good!! I think the room rate for a king size bed on a construction site was just a bit high at $143 plus taxes. But I would probably go back again when the construction is finished.

<Content>Do NOT stay here! Terrible !!! Located in older area of city, lots of construction going on around hotel. Building looks to be from 40's. Parking scarce and spaces under hotel are too small for most vehicles other than Volkswagen beetles. Lobby is terribly dated. Staff friendly, but that's the only good thing I can say about this hotel. Breakfast items limited to standard boxed pastries, yogurt and cereal. Room was suite, but air conditioning is still a window unit...and located in the living area of the suite. It is on or off. Period. The bedroom only gets whatever a/c might float it's way. The small fan provided in bedroom on top of tv unit was louder than a jackhammer and unusable. TV remote in bedroom did not work. Clock radio was impossible to set (button broken). And NO internet in the rooms. And the internet in the business center was not functioning. A receptionist did allow me back into the hotel office to print off a map, but really. Would never stay here again! Don't make the same mistake I made. For $111 a night...NOT worth it!!!

<Content>Pleasant surprise Have stayed at various hotels in Seattle from the Moore to the Westin. Booked a suite at this La Quinta with my wife and daughter last minute for Bumbershoot which is a few blocks away at Seattle Center. Was pleasantly surprised at the price - must have been their weekend rate. Room was clean, comfortable, bright and fairly spacious for 3 people. The view was interesting, but not awe-inspiring. Desk service was good. Was concerned about neighbourhood a little, which proved to be groundless, and have been more alarmed when staying at the Westin a few blocks away. We walked downtown and back late in the evening with no unpleasant encounters at all. Was also worried about open parking, but this again was no problem, and was free. Good, quiet night's sleep, little street noise. Breakfast was alright, if a little chaotic, seemed to be lots of room to sit.

<Content>No Frills, But Nice We decided to travel to Seattle for New Year's and booked this hotel via Hotwire. We got a great deal (I believe it was around $60 per night). As a bonus, we were able to easily walk to the Space Needle and Seattle Center to ring in the New Year and watch the fireworks display there. This was great, because there were cars jammed all up and down the streets during this time, and being able to walk helped us avoid the traffic.Breakfast was good. They have make your own waffles, which were delish, and other goodies to go along with them. A very satisfying meal for a continental breakfast. Also, they have fresh baked chocolate chip cookies at night.Our room was on an upper floor with a blacony. The view was of a vacant lot with construction, which wasn't so great...but who wants to hang around outside on a balcony in Seattle in January, anyway? Once the vacant lot is built upon, the view won't be so ugly. But, that's not the hotel's fault.The room was not super fancy, but it was clean, and had ample towels, and beds were fine. I thougt for the price we paid, we got a pretty good deal. I can't really think of much to complain about.Well...I take that back...the location is a TAD on the semi-scary side. One has to pass a small park on the way to the Space Needle (if one is walking to it) and some homeless men seemed to be living in that park. But, they were just minding their own business, so I guess it wasn't really threatening...just a little weird and sad.Overall, we were satisfied, and have no reason to NOT return again.

<Content>A Good Alternative if the Rate is Right We stayed at this property for three nights in July, 2007.We booked through Priceline at $145 (the rack rate was $152-$195).We were first put into a small room with two queen beds. I requested a larger room and was given a suite with one-bedroom which had a comfortable king bed, two night stands, dresser, TV, and closet. The city skyline could be seen from the bedroom window.The living room was large and bright--with lots of windows that looked out onto a neighborhood of auto dealerships, Budget car rental, etc.The property is located a 10- to 15-minute walk from stores such as Nordstrom and Macy's, entertainment, and major restaurants.Parking and an o.k. breakfast were included in the rate. The business people and tourists in the breakfast room were similar in appearance to those we see at Hampton Inn, Hilton Garden Inn, etc.Nearby dining options include a well-established Korean restaurant, Whole Foods grocery store, a 24-hour greasy spoon (Hurricane), and Amore Italian restaurant (which is a good option if you aren't up to walking more than three blocks).I was pleased with our upgraded suite, but I would have been unhappy if I had to spend three nights in the small room with two Queen beds. I took a peak at a Deluxe King room; it was a better option.

<Content>Not overly pleased.... The room was very clean but we had a handicapped equipped room which we really were not pleased with. We are not handicapped but have stayed in rooms designated this before and have had no problem. Usually the doors are wider and there are hand rails in shower/tub/toilet area. This room was completely different. The entire bathroom area was set up like a gym shower with the shower faucet coming directly out of a side wall and the drain in the middle of the bathroom floor. The toilet was in the same area so everything got wet . After a shower the entire bathroom floor was wet with puddles of water the rest of the day. We totally hated it. If this is the only room left at this hotel you may want to think twice before taking it.Also, there was construction going on in front of the hotel - right outside the windows. There was a two-story hole in the ground with huge cranes - ugh. The sidewalks were blocked and also part of the streets so it was difficult to walk to places. I can say the construction noise didn't start until around 8:30 am. Even though the hotel was within walking distance (eight or nine blocks from the Space Needle and also the waterfront) the area was not real desirable. We made sure we were back in the hotel before dark each night. I would not have felt comfortable walking there by myself at all.There is free parking with the hotel so that part was good and the room was very clean. The breakfast was pretty good. There was only one restaurant within a couple blocks - Korean I believe. There was a Whole Food Market about two blocks away which we went to a couple times although we had to walk in the street to get there due to the walks being blocked.

<Content>nice hotel We enjoyed our stay at La Quinta. The rooms were very clean and big. We stayed in a room with a queen sized bed and a sofa, we also had a small balcony with two chairs.The balcony had a view of the space needle.The breakfast was also very good. There was a great selection (as far as free breakfast goes) and the breakfast room was pleasant.They also cookies in the evening.

<Content>Good Clean Hotel I really cannot think of anything bad to say about this hotel. My cousin and I stayed in a 2 queen room on the top (7th) floor. Slight musty smell as it was raining when we came in and the windows do not open. Furnishings were nice - not worn nor too dated. There is major contstruction going on next door, but no work was going on while we were there. There is a sink inside the bathroom as well as one right outside which is a big plus. The bath towels were large and the shower head was 7 feet high! (That's a shout out to the above 6 feet set that usually have to squat down to wash their hair.) The breakfast was great with the signature free waffles and well stocked. There is also a room off the lobby with a free computer and printer. We actually took the city bus from the airport to the hotel (flew in from Phoenix). It was an express that took us right down town and our stop was about the 3rd one so saved a $30 cab fare. We walked down to the ferry terminal the next day to go to Victoria so an excellent place to stay if you are going on the Victoria Clipper. Our room had a great view of the Space Needle. Absolutely would stay again.

<Content>Good Value The Hotel was near the space needle but not easywalking distance to waterfront but was very easy to navigate around there.The free parking was relatively secure and should not be a worry provided one followed proper precautons of not leaving items in the vehicle.Staff was friendly and the Morning breakfast was about a 7 1/2. to 8. Not Embassy suites but well beyond continental.The room was Quiet and clean and the bed very comfortable.It was a very good value compared to major Hotels unless you had a half price major deal somewhere. I liked the location as it was very easy to get to places i needed to go..Pike Streetand main core by Pioneer place and Convention center.I would say it would be a 10 minute drive to the Stadiums.I will stay there again next time i am in town.

<Author>Hello_It's_Me_21
<Content>Would stay again I was very happy at La Quinta. I used to stay at what was the Travelodge across the street (it's changed names and has really gone downhill) and I like the location. It's an easly walk to the convention center/downtown, to Belltown for good restaurants, Space Needle, or to 1st Ave. (some hills) for the free bus to the Public Market or beyond. My only complaint with the area is that there is no pharmacy or supermarket in walking distance. There are 2 small makets but the prices are really high.The staff were very friendly. I checked-in early and since they didn't have my room ready I was able to leave my bag with no problems in a safe area. I had a regular room and not a suite. My room was large. The bathroom was big with a curved shower curtain rod. There was a sink in the bathroom and in a dressing area outside the bathroom. The room/sheets/towels/carpet were all very clean. There was a balcony which was nice. The room had a microwave and refridgerator although the microwave didn't seem to work right and there was no manual for it. The room was quiet. The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. The towels were plentiful and thick and somewhere between soft and scratchy.The free breakfast was fair but typical: toast and muffins, make your own waffles, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, terrible coffee, apples and bananas. In a 5 or 10 minute walk there is an excellent Thai restaurant called Golden Singha and a good pizza place called Zekes. They opened another pizza place there called Bambinos which looked like realy NY pizza but we didn't have time to try it. The Hurricane cafe behind the 8th Avenue Inn used to be good but it's gone downhill in quality so best to avoid it unless you are hungry really late and nothing else is open.There is a computer with printer off the lobby with internet access (free) and free wifi in the rooms. There is a jacuzzi which looked nice but we didn't have time to use. I come to Seatlle at least once a year and I'll definately stay here again.

<Content>An unusual stay at La Quinta Seattle Downtown La Quinta Inn  Suites Seattle Downtown has its ups and downs, and it will do well to point out both in order for future guests to know what they are getting themselves into.Let me start with the good points first. Its location, while on the fringes of downtown, is not really that bad if you don鈥檛 mind walking. Seattle being a walker-friendly city has a simple lay-out that would not confuse any first-time visitor unless the triangular intersections in some areas get the better of you. If you love to visit the Space Needle though, you鈥檒l be in luck as anyone can leisurely walk to the same in less than 10 minutes. The hotel, formerly known as Hawthorn Suites, has been renovated to reflect the chain鈥檚 features. Although the finishing touches still leave much to be desired, there is a distinct homeliness (and dog-friendliness) that will make you feel at ease, especially that the hustle and bustle of activities in the main tourist sections can no longer be heard. The lobby and breakfast areas are clean, just as the small room providing free internet access. There is also an enclosed part which is supposed to be a pseudo-spa with heated Jacuzzi exclusively for guests. The two elevators, however, are so old that only one was functioning during our stay.The room we got was clean with a good toilet/bath. There is a small fridge and microwave very useful when you don鈥檛 want to eat out and just buy food from a convenience store two blocks away. Also, the cable TV has about 65 channels available. On the debit side, the balcony was obviously broken into in the past so a long wooden stick was placed on one side of the sliding door to reinforce security. It was reason enough for us not to leave our valuables inside the room when sightseeing or shopping. But one thing which terribly annoyed us was an unusual incident which happened during our second day. Since I am used to giving tips to housekeeping before checking out on the last morning, we left the room expecting the same to be cleaned by the time we return. Sure, it was tidied up, but on the notepad on the bedside table, the phrase 鈥淸--] [--]鈥?was scribbled using either a fingernail or pointed object so you cannot easily read without putting the notepad close to your face. This alarmed us but thought it best to complain about the scribble the following morning to the manager. We were not sure yet if it was really housekeeping who did the same. Night came and passed and when I was taking a shower, the bathtub felt like it was rocking like a boat. It made me so dizzy that I stepped out of the room for fresh air after dressing up. At that point, my mother (who was reading the morning paper in her bed) told me that she felt something cold blew at the back of her neck while I was in the shower. She also added that 鈥渟omeone鈥?(or a spirit) quickly walked by the balcony door going to the room entrance. This happened (including the rocking boat shower) for two days and it was a good thing we were already about to leave thereafter. Now, I don鈥檛 want to make this review sound like a ghost story or something, but it surely made our skin crawl.In fairness to the hotel, the people at front desk were very easy to deal with. They always went out of their way for any small request or question we had. The complimentary breakfast items are constantly replenished and it always starts our day full and bright. Never mind the morning 鈥榩resence鈥?in the room. We鈥檙e more afraid of thieves/robbers anyway.

<Content>Hotel was great! Hotel reasonably priced and located near downtown, with easy walking distance to Space Needle and not that far to Pike Place Market. [Little longer walk, but possible].Room was spacious and clean. Had refrigerator, microwave.Staff very helpful and friendly, got us transportation to airport, restaurant, for example. Sent me back my phone charger, which I left behind, at no charge.Neighborhood so so, but never felt threatened, even at night.Decent continental breakfast provided, including self-made waffles.All in all, the hotel was very nice, especially for the price, we would stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel, public transport a problem As first time visitors, I had done some research before picking this hotel. Thinking that the free fare square was just a street or two short of the location, I booked us in. I was quite disappointed with the bus system as the stops were not on every street and not necessarily marked. Where the map showed the fareless square to end on 6th street, the last stop was on 4th so we had to walk four blocks to our hotel instead of two. In the hot sun and with luggage, it was a long walk. However, we were pleasantly surprised when we got into our room and found a very spacious living area with a separate bedroom. We had booked a Queen/Queen sofa and found it very comfortable. The kitchen area, while only equipped with a microwave and fridge, came with real dishes and glasses. There was a grocery store close enough for us to pick up foods for some meals. Breakfast was okay although it got full very quickly. We found we had to go early in the morning otherwise much of the food was gone. When we asked, they did restock, but it took some time. The bed in the bedroom was very comfortable (too soft for my spouse), but the pillows were thin and hard. With an 8-yr old and 80 degree temps that weekend, I would like to have had a pool available. This hotel has only a whirlpool and exercise room.The neighbourhood was well outside of the downtown core and questionable. Not an area to be out and about on foot after dark. This hotel is great if you have a car, but parking in the downtown is a pain.For Seattle itself, I was disappointed that the fareless square didn't run up to Seattle Center but stopped a few streets short. The bus drivers were somewhat helpful, but not very accomodating as we witnessed several times when they wouldn't let someone off at a non-stop even though we were at a red light.All in all, the hotel was a great value for the price. I would stay there again if I had a car.

<Content>Renovations complete! We spent two nights in Seattle at the end of May - the renovations were complete (apart from minor tweaks) in the rooms and the workers were putting the final touches on the breakfast room tiles and finishing up the computer room. This place was great value for the $109 we paid for a large king room with a view and breakfast (waffles, cereal, etc.). One of the workers recommended Cafe Amore (reasonably priced, delicious Italian food and friendly owners and staff), just three blocks away, in a glassblowing studio and gallery. The hotel is situated just a few blocks from the Music Center and about 20 minutes from shopping and Pike's Market. Seattle's business association has friendly bike-riding folks watching for lost tourists and advising on everything from restaurants to safe areas to walk at night. We loved Seattle and would recommend this hotel for its location and value.

<Content>Solid Stay at a Seattle Center hotel Stayed at the La Quinta Inn Downtown for three nights during the memorial day weekend with a friend. I had stayed here previously in October of last year for one night and found the stay to be pretty good. Things we liked:**Once again the La Quinta gets extra points for allowing us to check in early. It was a rainy Seattle morning and we checked out of our first hotel (the Moore in Belltown) and proceeded to walk to the La Quinta. **We had a room with 2 queen beds on the 5th floor that was really spacious, and had a balcony that you could walk out to with chairs, though the view was not the greatest. **We loved that there was a sink and countertop with mirror outside of the full bathroom so that one of us could get ready while the other was showering. **Clean bathroom with great water pressure. **It was very convenient to have free internet access + printer in the lobby area. best of all, there's often freshly baked chocolate chip cookies at the front desk!**All rooms come equipped with a fridge and microwave!**Friendly front desk serviceThings that made us go eh:**good location close to the space needle but a little less convenient than the moore only because as soon as you step out of the moore, there's tons of bars and restaurants at your feet. whereas la quinta you had to walk a couple blocks. but overall it was close to everything so we didn't mind. **the free continental breakfast wasn't exactly anything to wake up between the hours of 630am and 930am for. If you're used to the continental breakfast offerings at the holiday inn express or hampton inns, you'll be a little disappointed. Instead I recommend getting some fresh food from nearby Pike Place Market or walking to 4th Ave and going to Ralph's Grocery store (across from the Cinerama movie theatre). We ate a lot but felt assured knowing we could take restaurant leftovers if we needed to.**My friend found reddish lines on her pillow linen.All in all it was a good stay. One of the previous reviewers mentioned the remodeling of the hotel ruined their experience at the La Quinta. This was not the case for us. Perhaps it is because we arrived so late in May when the construction progress has advanced along and we kept a pretty busy schedule so we only came to the hotel to sleep. But we didn't find the remodeling to be a distraction at all.

<Content>Beware We stayed at this hotel for two nights in May. No one told us on the phone that the hotel is under major renovations. Could hardly get to the front desk with so much construction inside and out. Looked at 4 rooms all missing baseboards, strong paint odor and holes in ceiling where lighting had been. Shower was hocked up opposite of the hot and cold, electric outlet for dryer not working . Lobby had drink machine empty next to the sofa, breakfast room, jucuzzi, halls, all unusable due to construction going on. Small area for breakfast which was fine but the workman were there every morning eating and taking up the tables. Had we not gotten in so late we would have picked another hotel. This is unacceptable not to warn guests ahead. Parking is creepy underneath and very hard to park cars especially suv's in small spaces, also full of used furniture, mattresses and carpeting taking up spaces. You do not want to park anywhere else! Parking is also exposed to an alley with grafetti and not secure. This was the worse situation we have ever encountered our entire life of travel. Young girl at front desk was very apologetic sure she has no control over situation.

<Content>Good value My daughter and I spent two days at the La Quinta in downtown Seattle which is reasonably priced and very comfortable. Our room included a fridge, a microwave as well as an iron, ironing board and a hair dryer. The beds were comfortable and the room, on the 5th floor, was the quietest hotel room either of us had ever stayed in. We thought we were the only ones on our floor, but we were told all but two of the rooms on the 5th floor was occupied.The hotel is in the middle of renovations so there were construction workers around but there were no loud noises on the days we were there - a Thursday and Friday. The room was probably one that had been recently renovated and was very clean and comfortable. There were a few minor incomveniences, such as no hooks for clothes in the bathroom and no TV guide in the room. The phone in the room did not work and was never replaced. We were given a 20% discount coupon for our next stay to compensate for the inconvenience and expense of using our cell phones.This was not a big problem for us as we were there to shop and attend some shows, but could have been a major problem for a business traveller. Both my daughter and I will definitely recommend this hotel to others and will certainly stay there on our next trip to Seattle.

<Content>Great Location! We stayed here for 3 nights from March 16th. The hotel is in a great location - a few minutes walk to the Space Needle and a 10-15 minute walk to Pike Place Market and downtown.There are major renovations going on, as previously stated, but these didn't interfer with our stay there. You may want to check with the hotel directly regarding which facilities are available during their refurbishment. The room we stayed in was clean and tidy, as was the bathroom. The breakfast was good (good variety) and the staff were friendly and helpful.I would stay there again.

<Content>Major Renovations in Progress Stayed one night on the 8th March. The room was nice and big although not the nicest decor (walls very scratched and marked). Beds were comfey and clean, with no bed bugs. The location is good, with the space needle only 10 minutes walk away, and Pike Market about 20 minutes walk. Neighbourhood is ok for walking in with a group, but would not recommend it on your own (but that applied to the whole of Downtown Seatle). Me aware though that their are major renovations in the loby (jackhammer starts at about 9am), so expect a lot of noise. Also the pool is shut during the renovation. Breakfast was good for a freebe (Bagels, Waffles, Muffins, Toast, Yougut, Fruit, Orange and Apple Juice).

<Content>Just excellent My mother and I stayed at this hotel back in 2002, and we were most certainly impressed. We got a room on the top floor, which was a corner room, and it was just one of the largest rooms I'd ever stayed in. Yes, the elevators sound a little scary, but I'd say that they're safe. I would also say that the laneway used to get into the garage was a little scary at night, although the presence of more than adequate lighting and surveillance cameras did make the garage seem safe.Staff were very friendly, and we loved the breakfast and the 24 hour hot tub.The only problem we ever encountered was when a very loud alarm clock went off in the room next to us, which was unoccupied, and we had to get staff to go in there and turn it off.We would definately stay there again.

<Content>Comfy, Cozy, Conveniently Located Pets allowed!! Parking on site. Nice, hearty buffet breakfast included in price of room. Clean, roomy, comfortable, and fresh smelling. Quiet location. Short walk to Seattle Convention Center which has Space Needle, Rock  Roll Museum and Sci Fi Museum (all of which you must visit because they are so much fun). Front desk staff was mostly polite and helpful when they didn't have umpteen guests demanding to be checked out all at once. There's a fab Japanese restaurant right across the street which is a must try luxury evening. Appreciated the quiet accommodations and the chance to sleep very well on comfortable mattress after a long road trip. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A very nice stay I recently stayed at the Downtown Seattle LaQuinta Inn and enjoyed my stay.I got a tad bit lost from the driving instructions given by the inn's website鈥ut there is a lot of road construction going on in Seattle and I chalk it up to that. The Hotel itself is old, built in 1962, I presume for the World鈥檚 Fair, but it has been updated recently in 1999. The parking lot in front is cramped with stalls too small for any vehicle to fit in comfortably. Check in was easy and friendly. The night desk clerk was friendly and had a good sense of humor. The young man put me at ease right away. Once checked in I moved my vehicle to the free parking garage in the basement, again quite cramped. But it is an easy trip with bags and such from the garage to the elevator and to your room. The basement garage was well lit and felt safe. Entering by the back alley was a bit difficult because roads are one way and 鈥渘o turns鈥?so be mindful of getting good directions from desk clerk. The elevators are OLD and sound a bit scary. Doors slamming and cables whining. I only say this because my room was right next to elevator shaft and throughout the night I could hear them clamoring. (I would request a room FAR away from elevators and stairwells.) The room was comfortable, I had a king suite, Non-smoking. I liked the living room area and the windows were large and looked out over the city. I could see that Space Needle through the Seattle fog. The kitchette was nice although the utensils were sparse. 1 fork, two bowls and that was it. The bathroom was nice, CLEAN and spacious for me. (lots of towels but 1 shampoo and 1 soap)The bedroom was also confortable. King bed slept well, and the window actually opened to let in some evening air. (I have had windows in other hotel that don鈥檛 open and that drives me crazy) Good closet space in the Suite. (Just remember to collect ALL your things before you leave)The Jacuzzi was open at all hours and it too was clean and plenty of towels. The Dry steam room had to be turned on and so it was not ready for me to use (but I understand with energy bills skyrocketing.)Breakfast was the usual flair with handmade waffles, cereals, fruit (oranges, apples) and hard-boiled eggs. Get to Breakfast early. By 9:00 it was getting thin.Check out went quickly and again desk clerk (a young lady) was friendly and helpful. I did enjoy my stay and would consider staying again鈥nd next time I will know NOT to sleep near the elevators.
