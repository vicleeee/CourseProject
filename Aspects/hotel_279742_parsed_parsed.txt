<Content>high quality -minimalist experience went for new year package. Beautiful new years buffet (truly fabulous food) we then were taken to the top of a shopping centre (rooftop) for new year champagne and fireworksExcellent staff, beautifully designed room with roll top bath in middle of room. Minimalist loft type feel with Japanes style bed (gave me back ache) Hotel all in fab taste and a nice trendy bar(although expensive)Really Superb breakfasts too and very handy for the S Bahn.(2 minutes) down sides -lack of coffee making facilities in room (this is common in Germany) and I also would have liked a nicer reception/lounge area for occasionally escaping family for 10 minutes. Wasnt really anywhere cosy to sit . Also a bit of a lack of space for clothes.

<Content>Architectural marvel As a Hilton HHonors Diamond guest I have stayed at the Berlin Hilton, but gave this a try and I am happy that I did.Moevenpick transformed the prewar 'Siemens' headquarters from an elaborate office building into a trendy hotel. The combination of old and new is truely worth expIoring.I experienced excellent food and service, friendly staff and very comfortable rooms.Finally a hotel where gourmet food is served at the hotel restaurant at a reasonable price.The S-Bahn station 'Anhalter Bahnhof' is in front of the hotel and places like 'Potsdamer Platz' and the ' Brandenburg Gate' are only a few minutes by train.

<Content>Recommended for sights of Berlin The hotel is excellently located for the major tourists sites of Berlin, with Potsdamer Platz, The Reichstag, Topographie des Terrors, Checkpoint Charlie, The Brandenburg Gate, Holocaust Memorial, etc, etc. all being in easy walking distance. Whilst, the hotel is less convenient if your main reason for visiting Berlin is shopping (as it is some distance from Kurfçœ‰rstendamm), the hotel does lie on the route of an excellent bus service that passes the main shopping area and public transport tickets are available from the hotel concierge. Other public transport links including Anhalter S-bahn (subway/underground) station that is virtually outside the hotel and a U-bahn (another subway/underground system) station at Potsdamer Platz are also close by for things which aren't so close.I found the hotel staff friendly and helpful at all times. Although, it isn't cheap, in the evening, the hotel restaurant serves some of the best food I have tasted. The regular buffets, are more affordable, however, don't appear to be made to quite such a high standard with food often being of lower quality than the main menu. The Buffet food also sometimes has a tendency to be slightly dry due to being left out so long (a problem that also afflicts the cooked buffet items at breakfast).The rooms are clean and comfortable and have a very modern style. The hotel appears to have good facilities, and I found the hotel staff friendly and helpful at all times.

<Content>Berlin Breakfast to die for. Stayed here for a couple of days, whilst my son was on business. The reception staff were friendly and helpful and even found the nearest branch of my favouriteshops - KaDeWe and Kaufhof and marked them on a city map for me.The room overlooked the glass roofed dinng room, so no view but I didn't spend much time there.The room was large and warm, which was very welcoming as there was a really cold wind, despite the sun. The beds were comfortable with lovely warm duvets. The bathroom was big, well designed and tiled -floor to ceiling in the same styleI'm not a regular of hotels so my perception may be a bit biased but the breakfast set me up for the day - sausages, bacon, eggs, smoked salmon, several different cold meats and cheeses, several types of muesli, jams, marmalades, quark and of course as well as white bread and rolls, a huge selection of healthy German sonnenblumen and rye bread, good coffee, several teas and juices. This is probably standard hotel fare but good quality all the same.The location, once I'd worked it out, was great. It was a short 15 min walk to Potsdamerstrasse, very near the Topography of Terror, Checkpoint Charlie, The Jewish memorial, Brandenburg Gate etc - mind you I like walking.I'd definitely stay here again.The thing I disliked the most was having to leave.

<Content>Another great stay at this great hotel This was my 3rd stay at Movenpick Hotel in Berlin. Rooms are big and feel big with the high ceilings of this former Siemens Electric building. Bathrooms are very modern with the stand-up showers with shared tile with the bathroom tile. Vanity is similarly modern chic. The glass block wall lets light into the bathroom and fits the modern loft feeling of every room. Front desk service is polite, not overly friendly, but polite and professional. I always appreciate the complimentary fruit and water (still and gas) at the front desk. The beds are extremely comfortable and their are nice design touches in the room. Great linens and very comfortable duvet.The 19 Euro breakfast is pricey but is of very high quality with an nearly infinite selection of items. Everything is fresh and quality is very good.The location is ideally located close to Potsdamer Platz, which is merely a 7 minute walk to the hotel.Skip the Mexican restaurant close to the hotel. My steak fajita arrived in a sauce that you typically don't expect when steak fajitas come to your table on a sizzling iron skillet!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Amazing City We stayed at the Movenpick for 6 nights in August, and we loved it! From the moment we arrived, we knew we were in for a good stay. The hotel staff were charming and thoroughly helpful. We booked a Deluxe Roof Room (highly recommended), and we loved the layout, design, and size of the room. The many windows provided ample light, and the Phillipe Stark bathtub was a cool addition to the room. At night, it was very easy to make the room entirely dark using the internal and external shades. We were traveling with our three year old son and the dark room helped him sleep until very late each morning. The hotel staff provided us with a bed our son at no cost (arranged ahead of time). It amounted to a very large portable crib, and he was very happy with it. I had read other reviews that said that the air conditioning is lacking, but we did not find this to be so. We were very comfortable during our entire stay.The location of the hotel is perfect--with two train stations at your doorstep (one on the same block, the other a very short walk away). Berlin was amazing--definitely a city worth visiting.

<Content>A great choice for Berlin in a great location We stayed on the first floor of this hotel for a week in August 2008 and found it to be excellent value for the money we paid.Location:The Moevenpick is a modern hotel situated in a fantastic location in Berlin, right next to the Anhalter Bahnhof U-bahn (subway) station. You can also walk to Potsdamer Platz in 10 minutes and connect to many other transportation lines. The neighborhood this hotel is in is very quiet, while still being central. Rooms:The rooms are very modern with adequate space by European standards. The often-mentioned issue of the glass-block-wall bathroom is indeed a concern for anyone who may be uncomfortable being seen (albeit in a fuzzy fashion) while in the bathroom. I can definitely see many people having a problem with this, but I actually enjoy the stylish glass block construction. Beds, sheets, pillows:The beds are adequate, although the mattresses are definitely not as firm or high quality as I like them. Linens were excellent quality and the comforter/duvet was the best. Bathroom and Shower:While there was plenty of counter space and everything in the bathroom functioned well, my MAJOR complaint and really the only reason I canéˆ¥æª› give this hotel a perfect score of 5 is that our shower had the lowest water pressure I have encountered in a hotel in the last five years. I could not get any shampoo out of my hair, even with a 30 min rinse. In fact, using a wet towel to wipe soap from oneéˆ¥æªš body may be more efficient than attempting to use the trickling water from the shower we had. We were on the first floor, so I cannot imagine that this was a random situation, although I am amazed more reviewers have not noted this problem. Cleanliness: Our room, bathroom and bedding was very clean and all surfaces were cleaned daily. The edges of the room where carpet meets the wall were in fact vacuumed often enough in this particular room, such that the common grime one sees in most hotels was not found at all. I was very pleased with housekeeping.Temperature control:This may be a second problem with the hotel for some guests: The minimum temperature setting is set to 21C, which is 70F. However the room really doesnéˆ¥æª› reach this temperature, which means that for those who are used to cooler temperature settings (ie most Americans) things can get a bit uncomfortable when the city gets hot. However I do applaud all the measures like this that the hotel has taken for energy conservation Internet:No free internet anywhere in the hotel, and no real business center. Internet fees were ridiculously high.Noise: The rooms were relatively quiet relative to those next door, with thick sound-protective doors. However we could hear a child jumping around in the room above us. Additionally, right behind the hotel is currently a huge construction site (Aug 2008) and drilling would start early in the morning and we could definitely hear a lot of noise from the construction in the mornings before we left the hotelRestaurant, lobby and public areas: Very modern and well decorated and clean. Staff: The staff were lovely. Excellent English spoken by all, and every single staff member was supremely professional, always nice, smiling, and helpful. They went out of their way to meet our needs.Avoid in this area:By all means avoid the CafèŒ… Stresemann at the corner. Incredibly rude staff (all three people we dealt with in one sitting) with absolutely no interest in clientele, and horrible food.

<Content>stylish rooms, non-central location What a lovely hotel - and really rather reasonably priced, which I'm assuming is because of the somewhat out-of-the-way location.Location: not central Berlin, but right next to a metro line to get into the city. There's not a lot going on around the hotel, to be honest, although the hotel bar seemed nice enough (if not the hotbed of chic that the website would have you believe).Cleanliness: spotless. As you'd expect.Style: warm yet minimalist - kind of a plush Ikea, if that makes any sense. Everything was rather nice.Rooms: we chose a fairly big room, which had both a free standing bath inside the room and a separate shower cubicle in the washroom. It was up in the eaves and therefore you have to be careful with the sloping ceiling. The rooms were great, with a mini-bar fridge and generally well laid out with amenities. Huge bed with crisp white linen.Quietness/privacy: we couldn't hear our neighbours. We had a very relaxed stay in this hotel.Faciliites: we only used the bar, which was fine, but in April 07 at least they seemed to stop serving food very early on. There was no 24 hour room service. Obligatory shoe-shine machines on each floor, and provided iron and ironing board on request. Didn't use the restaurant at all, or any other facilities at the hotel.Check in: the front desk were really helpful and friendly, although when we got back at about 2am on a Sunday morning (this is party Berlin!) there wasn't anyone around for a bit to let us back in to the hotel which was a bit annoying.Overall: excellent hotel, was extremely good value for money, but if you want to be in the thick of things you will find the neighbourhood very quiet.

<Content>Perfect Location and Staff Just back from a two night stay at the Berlin Movenpick. As other people have mentioned, the location is fantastic - within 20 mins you could walk to Potsdamer Platz, Holocaust Memorial, Reichstag, Checkpoint Charlie, Berlin Wall and Jewish Museum.There's a S-Bahn station just a hundred yards from the hotel, plus a U-Bahn station a few minutes walk away.The hotel has stylish decor, is very clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful.We were lucky enough to have a luxury room on the top floor, which was very spacious, loads of roof windows. Even though the hotal was fully booked, we never heard a sound from any other guests, and had perfect sleep in the comfortable beds with super-soft duvets!I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Content>Brilliant Berlin, brilliant Hotel just back from Berlin - and this hotel was great. From the helpful and friendly staff, to the clean well equipped rooms and the little bedtime 'snacks' beside the bed!It's really well located for access to the touristy stuff - or hire a bike from one of the many hire companies for around 12 euros for the day and travel further afield (loads of cycle paths and it seems it's THE way to travel in Berlin). There's also great U-bahn and S-Bahn and bus access all over the city from the hotel. The little mexican restaurant next to the hotel is great for a tasty and filling meal, and the cafe on Stressemann strasse (stressemann cafe) does great (and cheap!) breakfasts. The hotel restaurant is a bit more expensive but the food is really good, the service fantastic, and the Moevenpick Ice Cream to die for!! All in all a fab trip.

<Content>Funky hotel, great location Great quiet hotel that seems to be at first unconviniently located but in reality is central with the new modern Berlin. The S metro station located just outside the hotels helps enormously with touring town if you're not into walking. Lobby and public spaces are modern and the retractable roof in the restaurant gives an interesting al fresco spin to your breakfast or dining. Rooms are quite large, but from my understanding not many of them have an interesting view (we had courtyard view). Bathrooms are also large, however the wall separating the bath from the room is made by glass blocks so lighting up the bath at night means lighting up the whole room :((Staff is helpfull and very cordial. Breakfast is fairly good with a good range of choices. Had dinner at the hotel restaurant one night and chose the buffet, but wasn't too happy with the quality (at best fair).Fit center and sauna are quite limited in space and sauna is co-ed, but if you're into the whole sauna/solarium try the very close LiquidRom (great experience!!)

<Content>Fantastic stay, great location! This is such an amazing hotel.The rooms were beautiful, modern and spacious. The staff went over and above to help make our stay fantastic. The location is ideal, just down the road from Potsdamer Platz and Checkpoint Charlie. There is an S Bahn stop 2 minutes away on the same street. This hotel deserves top marks in all categories and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Berlin.

<Content>Beautiful hotel with excellent staff RoomsSpacious and nicely decorated room with a modern, pleasing interior. Very comfortable bed. The room was equipped with a safe big enough to fit a laptop and other electronic devices. Closet space is sufficient, but not generous.The hotel in general and facilitiesVery nice breakfast buffet.Rooms have Wifi internet access for a fee of EUR 22 per day.The hotel also has a gym with three or four cardio machines and one multi-purpose weight machine. Given that there is enough space in the room, the hotel should consider installing some more weight machines.ServiceStaff was extremely attentive and friendly and paid attention to details, such as always addressing me with my name.LocationThe hotel is very centrally located at Anhalter Bahnhof, about 800 meters from Potsdamer Platz.

<Content>smart and funky We really enjoyed our stay here, friendly and helpful staff, compact size room but enough space. nice interor decor, good restaurant downstairs, we didn't eat there but had some great icecream and if it had been warm enough when the roof was off we would have. Good breakfast buffet and a good location 1 stop from potsdamer platz. would definitely recommend it. Try Monsieur Vuong if you like asian food, shiro i shiro was a little dissapointing.

<Content>Worked for Us We were guests of the hotel from May 16 to May 23 while attending the International Trademarks Association Annual meeting. The hotel was one of many designated conference hotels and our rate and reservation were secured through the conference organizers.Our room was on the first floor-165- over looking an interior court yard used by smokers. On the weekend, we did hear guests chatting late into the night. while they indulged and we did, on one occasion, smell a great deal of cigarette smoke on our floor even though it was non-smoking. The sound of a water feature also located in the court yard, however, was soothing.The room was a little small but adequate. Toiletries, like soap, were in short supply: we were given one bar for both the sink and bath. Bedding was comfortable but towels were thin and small. We did enjoy the large Philipe Starck soaking tub. Tiles in the shower were missing and there was some mold over the tub. An access panel was black with finger prints. The hotel breakfast included in our rate was terrific. The dining room is spotlessly clean and the food beautifully presented and quite tasty. Serving staff were extremely cordial and attentive.Other public areas are a little shabby. The red carpet in the lobby and to the elevators was badly soiled and stained. Front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful. The so-called concierge really wasn't. They provided no assistance with restaurant reservations and dining suggestions were in short supply. The hotel is very well located. We walked everywhere, using transportation only to attend the ICC building.This hotel apears to be a very popular one and is also used for meetings and private parties. On at least three occasions, the bar was closed to hotel guests for private functions. Be aware if this is an issue for you.

<Content>Well Above Average I chose this hotel after reading reviews by fellow travellers.Converted to a hotel in 2004 the building has had a varied past and narrowly missed destruction in 1945.The location is fairly central and quiet, within easy access of transport and walking distance of most sites.We ate in the restaurant trying the buffet which was excellent value.As mentiones by another reviewer the Italian nearby is worth a visit.The breakfast selection is probably the most varied I have seen and should suit everyone.Helpful staff was also a bonus, well done.

<Content>Fab friendly hotel Just stayed at this very friendly and efficient hotel in Berlin. Good location, quite central, which was useful as the public transport strike was still on!! We had a delux roof top room with a bath in the room-well worth it and a nice touch of luxury. The breakfast buffet is one of the best ive seen and we also had dinner in the restaurant which was excellent (the roof can open up in the warm weather). The bar is very funky and serves great cocktails, shame there wasnt many people in there (in fact the hotel was very quiet overall) to add to the atmosphere. Would love to go back and see Berlin in the summer and would stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed from 17th Feb for 3 nights. Excellent stay, breakfast were very good especially the muesli selections provided. You could also get omelettes cooked for you. Room was excellent and very quiet. Location of hotel is also very good - not in a noisy or busy street, but only 100mts from the underground. You could walk to postdamer platz in 10 minutes. Also found a great cocktail bar in Hackescher markt, called Riva - great cocktails there!

<Content>Nice modern hotel in good location. Enjoyed a short break in this modern hotel. Room was large and clean with funky glass wall to the bathroom. Breakfast was good, but a bit busy at times. Hotel is located within walking distance of most attractions. Berlin was a lovely city. We'll be back.

<Content>Nice Nice hotel. Appearance is not conventional - quite funky. Facilities were good. All very modern.Breakfast was not included for me so I cant comment. I didnt eat there at all.Location seemed ok - about a 10 minute walk to Potsdamer Platz. Probably about a 10 - 15 minute walk to Check Point Charlie.All I know is that in December 2007 when I was there even a 1 minute walk was 59 seconds too long because it was so cold.The room was modern and bathroom was fantastic - best I have seen so far in Europe. Big glass shower, free standing bath and plenty of space.Smoking inside seemed all to common - the only negative aspect. Especially on the way to the lifts where there seems to be a designated smoking area so you have to walk through the stench of old smoke on your way to your room.Overall - good hotel. Reasonable price. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Excellent location and brilliant hotel! I reviewed all the hotel's via Trip Advisor and opted for this one - and what an excellent choice! First for the location and closeness to the S  U Bahn 200 yard walk to the front of the hotel. The reception staff could not have been nicer. We opted to take the upgrade if it was available and we got a delux room. The reviewer who complained about the pillows did not avail of the a la carte pillow menu - excellent as I am allergic to feathers. The chocolates on the pillows and the free water we thought to be a nice touch.We also booked the Suprisingly Different package and took the meal on the first night we arrived .... what a delight on the palate .The hotel is within dandering distance to the Potsdammerplatz which is a great location for picking somewhere else to eat. Don't rule out the Italian down from the hotel at the crossroads - a tasty bite without travelling too far.Berlin surprised us on the whole and is in our top 10 of European cities.

<Content>Weekend trip to Berlin Great place to stay for a trip to Berlin:The Hotel is located south of Potsdammerplatz, Brandenburger Tor, Reichstag, Sony Center, and Potsdammer Platz Arkaden are only a short walk away. Public transportation is right in front of the hotel (S- / U-Bahn, Bus).The hotel itself was completely reimburshed in 2004 and following has a modern style. The staff is very engaged and always offered a helping hand. The quiet room was a little bit small, but ok and had a great view.To sum up, we would book it again for a trip to Berlin!

<Content>Birthday treat to Berlin Booked three days under the Surprisingly Different package and applied for upgrade to Junior Suite for 12 Euros per night.Great welcome, room exceeded expectations and the package was great value. The hotel was so quiet at night that we thought that we were the only guests - not so as the restaurant was very busy on Sunday morning.The 4 course, chef's surprise, evening meal was excellent and the huge packed lunch kept us occupied at the airport on day of departure.I had mentioned that it was my husband's birthday on checkout day - a really nice touch was the delivery of a birthday card and small gift that morning.Very well located for Checkpoint Charlie and great access to the S  U Bahn.

<Content>Wonderful hotel What a lovely hotel...its a hotel i will remember - Especially the wonderful room. The only complaint was the lack of English channels and movies - Its not very enjoyable watching american movies dubbed in german when you understand about 3 words in total... An international hotel should always cater for english speaking guests - not only german speaking guests.

<Content>Pick of the best So I went online and booked this hotel through lastminute.com, which also meant the booking included breakfast. It was also surprisingly cheap considering this is a four star hotel. Anyway, the low-down is, quite simply, this is one of the best hotels you can stay in in Berlin for this kind of price. The staff are very well-mannered and unfailingly helpful; the room I was given was clean, comfortable, and pleasant. There's a very nice restaurant downstairs with a glassed-in atrium and you'll notice that many people visit it from outside who are not guests (a very good sign). Coming from the UK, I was very aware that prices at the restaurant and at the hotel were lower than I would expect. This hotel is definitely value for money. I'd say the only slight drawback is that it's about 10 minutes' walk from Potsdamer Platz. That's not great if, during your stay, it's snowing or raining heavily, as it was on both the days I stayed here. But taxis are plentiful and comparatively inexpensive.I'm quite a choosy person when it comes to hotels. But given the price I would recommend this one unreservedly.

<Content>Great hotel, nice experience It is a wonderful hotel. The room I stayed (220) is a huge room, with high ceilings and modern furnitures, with tasteful design. The front desk was friendly and attended immediately everything I asked for. I would certainly stay here again if I come back to Berlin.

<Content>wonderful hotel in a wonderful city Stayed at Moevenpick for 4 nights. Had junior suite on 5th floor. Great decoration. Incredibly comfortable bed. Superb choice of pillows. Loved the sloping ceiling and Velux windows. Bathroom looked cool but not everything worked as it should - tap on the basin was a little temperamental. But that was only a slight hiccough. Best thing was the sound-proofing. You could not here a thing from outside.Restaurant served delicious food and the service was exceptional. Wine list was also extensive with wide range of world wines.Staff were outstanding and helped make the all-too-short trip even more pleasurable. Many thanks.Do not hesitate to stay at this marvellous hotel.

<Content>wonderful room My wife and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in mid October. We booked the ' surprisingly different' package direct with the hotel and were pleasantly surprised not only with the hotel but the extras included with the package. The hotel itself is literally 100 yards from the nearest S Bahn (Anhofer Bahnhof) and on the main Bus route to the Kuffurstendamm shopping area (KaDeWe etc).The staff were extremely pleasant throughout and for 9Euros extra per night we were given superior rooms on the 5th floor (this was an option available at time of booking). The rooms were great with designer bath stuck in the middle of the bedroom (novelty) and wet room plus a very bright colour scheme. Breakfast was substantial and, apart from coffee and cake, took us through to dinner.For just a few Euros extra on the basic price we received as part of the 'surprisingly different package' 2 3day passes for Ubahn, Sbahn plus bus for all areas....would take you through to Podsdam or to the airport at Schoenfelt. We also received complementary drinks in the bar area for 2 nights and a 4 course meal plus wine in the restaurant (I worked out that this alone was worth over 80 Euros and although there was no choice it was still wonderful, my wife said probably one of the best meals she has ever had.The rooms were always clean and chocolates were left on the beds.Overall an excellent base to tour Berlin and one we would return to again someday.

<Content>Pick the Moevenpick We have stayed in many hotels on city breaks but the Moevenpick outshines them all. We stayed in a suite on the top floor and loved our room. We had plenty of space but what we really liked was that the room had a great balance of being contemporary and homely. It was the type of room that you don't feel you need to get out of and into open space. We had a bed with two single quilts - what a fantastic idea! There was no quilt ping-pong for the night - one person throwing it down cause they were too hot and the other pulling it up. A great bench at the end of the bed - a shelf underneath for handy storage and the bench doubles as a seat for room-service. We had a bath and sink in the room with an en-suite toilet and shower. My husband took to the lovely two seater in the room also. Perfect size to curl up in and watch tele for a while. The mini-bar was reasonably priced for drinks. We had a glass of wine with our room-service lunch on the day we arrived. Both were very tasty and reasonable.Besides the room, what makes this hotel is the staff. They were fantastic. It was my birthday during our stay and they went out of their way to make it that bit extra special. It is always the little extra personal effort that doesn't make you feel like a number in a hotel. At the moevenpick we not only didn't feel like a number but we felt really special. Well done staff - and thanks! We ate at the hotel restaurant one night and were sorry we hadn't done it sooner. The food was lovely and great value. We had breakfast included in our package and it was fantastic. We could have spent all day picking. Everything was so fresh and tasty.As others have mentioned we also found this hotel to be very conveniently located with the S-bahn outside the door and Potsdamer Platz only stop away.We went to Berlin not knowing what to expect. We loved the city and spent plenty of time exploring, and we loved the hotel. Well worth the visit to both.

<Content>Pleasant stay This is a truly funky hotel; a lovely mesh of the old and the new. The location is not a problem, at least not for my partner and I when we stayed here for a week. We liked the fact that the hotel was located in a quiet neighborhood. The S bahn is just steps from the front door and the U bahn is a short walk away in Potsdamer Platz, so access to public transportation really isn't a problem. Just be careful when you're walking around...don't walk in the bike lane!The room was fine. It was on the top floor and very quiet. There were two double doors that opened up onto the courtyard outside, so that was a nice bonus. Since it rained and was quite cool in Berlin for most of our stay, we enjoyed opening the windows and letting the breeze fill the room.As another reviewer has pointed out, the rooms tend to be a bit warm. While we were in Berlin, the temperature never got about 20, but we were still sweating in our room at night. The a/c does not go below 23, so it wasn't much use. And when we did open the windows, the a/c would automatically cut off. While this was an admirable feature, since the hotel seems committed to energy efficiency, when it's one in the morning and you can't sleep because you're too hot, it gets annoying.The bed was quite hard, a little firmer than I would have liked. But my major gripe was that the pillows are very thin and you only get two. There were no extra pillows to be had. They might want to invest in larger, fluffier pillows for those of us that prefer them.Also, another gripe I had about the room was that there isn't a proper door on the bathroom. In our room, there was a sliding door that didn't really give you a true sense of privacy. One thing I loved about the bathroom was the shower! It was fantastic. The pressure was good and it has body jets. You could set the shower so that water cascaded down from above while the body jets gave a full body massage. This was a great feature and used frequently, especially after a long day trip to Potsdam.The food was wonderful. Though, as another reviewer mentioned, asking 18.50 per person for the buffet was a bit much. However, the service was top notch.The front desk staff were all wonderful. They were very helpful and patiently answered any and all questions we had. The Anhalter Bar was also a fun place to go. My only gripe there is that smoking is allowed. Germany has yet to go smoke free indoors like the UK has recently. I hope they do soon.This was our first visit to Berlin and we had a wonderful time. We felt comfortable at this hotel and would stay here again, though probably for a shorter stay.

<Content>Exceptionally enjoyable!! We booked onto the 'Surprisingly Different package, and were extremely pleased with the level of service throughout our stay. They even left a small birthday gift and card in the room for a member of our party, even though we hadn't booked the 'birthday' promotion.The staff were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our nights in the Anhalter Bar sampling the varieties of beers and the odd cocktail. The choice at breakfast was varied and set us up for a full day of sightseeing around the city and our meal in the restaurant one evening was wonderful, particularly as we were able to request a change to the set menu without much trouble as one of our party didn't eat meat.The rooms were cleaned to a high standard, as were all areas of the hotel. Location wise, you can easily walk to some of the main attractions with ease and if not, there are buses and the S-Bahn nearby.Overall, we were more than 'surprised' and would certainly visit again.

<Content>Five points from us! This is a very special hotel! It is a perfect mixture of old and new.We liked the contemporary style of our room and the openingglass roof of the restaurant Hof Zwei. At one evening we had dinner there and it was great, service as well. We had breakfast, too. The buffet offered plenty to choose from, I loved the BircherMuesli and all the fresh fruits. The Anhalter Bar is very trendy and has so many different cocktails to choose from, that it takes a while to decide... Service at front desk was perfectin a very friedly way. Location is super, just a few steps to theentrance of S 25 Anhalter Bahnhof.I would love to come back soon.

<Content>Overall solid, but not special We stayed for 4 nights the last weekend of May 2007. The reviews on this site are very much on target, and the property offers a very nice stay, although not perfect. We booked directly on their website, although weren't offered any of the packages mentioned by others on this site. We paid full price for a junior suite, and breakfast was not included. The hip-factor of the hotel is a little overplayed in some reviews -- yes, its a little trendier than most, but certainly not as trendy as lots of other new European hotels. That said, we were pleased with the room (spacious but not large by US standards). We think there was a problem with the A/C which was virtually undetectable even at full blast (and the lowest temperature setting was 21C (~69F), but it certainly didn't cool the room when it was 32C (~89F) outside during the day). Although we would have liked more air circulation (and detected a faint odor at times due to lack of air), we didn't complain because it was easy to open the windows and it didn't bother us much, and we didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel room. The buffet breakfast is pricey (18 Euro) if not included, but everything everyone says it is. We walked most places in the city easily from the hotel, but also used taxis and the S/U-bahn a lot. Location is generally good and where we wanted to be, but I noticed there were several other new properties of apparent equivalent quality that are even better located in Mitte -- next time I'm likely to try one of those.

<Content>Great hotel , good location We took advantage of one of their special offers - 'Surprisingly Different' - this gave us 3 nights bed and breakfast, one evening meal with wine, a 72 hour travel pass and a lunch box on one of the days.We made full use of this package and were able to see much of Berlin using public transport - an S Bahn station is adjacent to the hotel.The Moevenpick is an historic building, which has recently been up-dated and tastefully decorated with all modern facilities. On arrival we were up-graded to a Junior Suite, which gave us a much larger room than we had expected. The bed and pillows were really comfortable and the en-suite bathroom with its glass brick walls allowed a lot of light into the room - a great idea! Everywhere was spotlessly clean.All the staff were extremely friendlly, most helpful and very polite.The Breakfast Buffet offerred a huge choice of both hot and cold food. The evening meal was delicious, as was all the food we ate in the hotel during our stay.We would thoroughly reccommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Cool and well located Great Hotel excellent location just a short walk from Potsdammer Platz. We go to Germany quite often and this is the best hotel we've stayed in there. It had a really cool feel to it (visit the hotel website to egt an idea) The rooms were very clean and comfortable as well as being well styled. The anhalter (hitchhiker in german) bar was comedy for a drink and the breakfast (extra but worth it) was without doubt the best hotel breakfast I have ever had, knocking spots of more expensive hotels with more stars that we have stayed in over the years. If you are going to Berlin you have already made 1 good choice, make another and stay at this hotel.

<Content>Modern and Good Value This is an excellent hotel in a good location close to Potsdamer Platz and visitor attractions such as Checkpoint Charlie.Other attractions are also in comfortable walking distance but there are the alternatives of the S-Bahn and bus stop right outside the hotel, and the U-Bahn at Potsdamer Platz. The 72 hour Welcome Card (available at reception) gives unlimited travel on bus and train and is good value at 24 Euros.The éˆ¥æ·ªurprisingly Differentéˆ¥?package includes the 72 hour Welcome Card plus a free evening dinner, free drinks in the bar for two evenings and a free packed lunch. The buffet breakfast is extensive and excellent quality.The hotel has a fresh, modern dèŒ…cor and rooms are good-sized and well laid-out. The modern style extends to the rooms where the bathroom is enclosed by glass bricks, possibly a problem if one was excessively shy !!Overall an enjoyable, good value hotel, well located with excellent services and pleasant staff.

<Content>Very good Arrived late (11.30pm) on a Saturday night in February to a very welcoming receptionist who informed us the restaurant was still open! Quickly checked in to a fab room with the glass walls! Had a really good meal, which was so good we came back the next night! Breakfast buffet (we found an inclusive rate with otel.com) was excellent with masses of choice so we stuffed ourselves stupid.Found the sauna which we had all to ourselves. Also found art/sculpture dotted around of bits of machinery which was interesting. The old part stairwell was impressive as well.Located close to the underground, Anhalter Station ( S-Bahn), which is very easy to use, also very easy to walk places in this interesting city.We would definately recommend this hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>A Great 3 Night stay Just returned from a 3 night stay with my wife at the Moevenpick, Berlin. We stayed in a Junior Suite (via an upgrade at the hotel) on the 'surprisingly different package'. From the moment we arrived we were looked after - the room was very large with a small sofa and two chairs, a glass wall screened bathroom with seperate shower cubicle and a separate room for the toilet. Fittings were excellent and the bed comfy but firm and our inner courtyard facing room was wonderfully quiet at night. Aircon wasn't a problem but can see that the19C minimum may be too warm for some in the Summer.Breakfast buffet was excellent - the fresh fruit particularly and the package allowed us two free drinks each in the bar from 1700 to 1900 as well as an evening meal in the hotel including wine, a packed lunch and two free 3 day passes for buses, U  S Bahn trains  trams.Location right next to Anhalter Station ( S-Bahn) and 10mins wlk from Potsdamer Platz though the immediate location is very quiet at night.Berlin is quite superb and I would recommend both the city and this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Very nice and friendly This hotel is very nice, new and central with very friendly and helpful staff. It's ten minutes walk from Potsdammer Platz and 20 from Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag. The rooms are quite big, very modern and clean. Breakfast is fantastic with a lot of choice. The S-bahn station Anhalter banhoff is less than a minute walk from the hotel.

<Content>A great hotel: location, quality and value I was incredibly impressed with the Moevenpick in Berlin, though I must admit I was not expecting too much. I say that because my friend and I booked a room for 89 euro a night on Easter weekend; I was shocked that a major European city would be offering hotel rooms at such a low price for a holiday weekend. Anyway, we were instantly impressed. The hotel is located just off a subway station, Anhalter Bahnhof, and a 5 minute walk from Potsdamer Platz, which is a major transit hub and home to some big banks and embassies.The hotel itself is very modern--the beds were comfortable and the bathrooms very modern and up-to-date.NOTE: If you book your room on the hotel website directly, you can sign up for this great deal to get an upgrade. Instead of paying for a higher priced room, you can sign up for an as-available upgrade at the time you make a reservation. When you check in, if they have a room of a higher category available, and you've signed up for this program, you get the better room and just pay a few euros extra. My friend and I got bumped from a standard room to a junior suite and just paid 106 euro a night, versus 89 for the standard room. If we had booked the junior suite outright, we would have paid a whole lot more.The staff was incredibly helpful, professional...and spoke with impeccable English. They had nice touches like complimentary juices and water and fruit at all hours, and gave each guest a chocolate Easter bunny on Easter Sunday.The one complaint I had was the high cost of internet--it was 4.50 euro for a half hour if you wanted to access their wireless. But the positives far outweighed the negatives.I would very much recommend this hotel and would stay there again without hesitation whatsoever.

<Content>Perfectly located great, hotel. This hotel is steeped in history, Its quirky and the staff are more than helpful. We stayed in a deluxe room which cost 134 euro per night (no breakfast) and was excellent value, I wont repeat all the other reviewers comments , I will just thank them for sending us there,The hotel is so close to the underground that when we got off we couldnt find it / We stepped out of the underground station and were so close to the hotel we were looking everywhere but at its sign directly above us.It is within walking distance of checkpoint charlie where food and drink was unbelievably cheap. Berlin is so underrated as a great value for money destination. We will definetely be going back.Ask for directions to schoneberg which has a huge choice of restaurants and is really good value for money.We didnt get to stay long enough but the lovely reception staff made us feel really welcome.( Although they found it hard to believe we had no post codes in rural Ireland.)For sightseeing take the 100 bus as it covers all the same routes as the tour buses at a fraction of the cost. The cafe across from the hotel does great breakfasts too. (Go upstairs for non smokers)Enjoy.

<Content>Hated Moevenpick Booked at the Hauptbahnhof--their service was great with the help of an American agent.But this hotel at over USD200 is the most over-priced I've ever been in. The room is the size of a walk in closet. The bathroom has translucent doors. Cleanliness is marginal. The view is terrible. It's Internet service is extremely expensive and my emails to friends were bounced back because they would not accept multiple addressees. The hotel refused to make an adjustment.Although the location is fair, the garage charges are also excessive.After having spent more than a week in Germany, from Nurnberg, Bayreuth, Dresden, Bamberg and Leipzig where we received great and gracious service, this place was the pits.The food is mediocre and expensive in an unattractive room where guests roll their baggage noisily along a walk to the elevator.There is a really cool bar next door but I would have spent a lot of time in it to make up for the deficiencies of this place.Avoid it at all costs.

<Content>Fantastic. Loved it! Date: March 2007Reviewer: A TripAdvisor Member, Dromore, N. IrelandWe stayed for 3 nights on the 'surprisingly different package' deal at the beginning of March. This is a luxurious hotel (we upgraded to a junior suite) and certainly one of the best we have ever stayed in. The bathroom was to die for, and just like everything else in the hotel, was sparklingly clean, very stylish, and worked perfectly. We will be back.

<Content>Great location Just arrived back from Berlin staying at the fabulous Movenpick. We stayed on the first floor with nice views across to the park. The breakfast is fab with so much choice - delicious. During the day the bar is closed and there is no food available but there are great resturants close by. Berlin is interesting - very quiet - hardly anyone around. Even the tourists spots were quiet. The hotels is fresh and welcoming -staff are friendly and courteous, no problems at all. Would recommend the Movenpick.

<Content>Stunning and refreshing One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. First of all, the stunning design bowled us over - we didn't want to leave the room. The staff was very friendly and did their best to please us. The hotel is still new, so their bar wasn't open, but their sauna was great. Room service was on the pricey side - two coffees were 11 Euro. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel. Note that the hotel offers great packages on its website - the best way to go. They offeryou a choice of pillows - a neck roll, a spelt pillow, a hot water bottle - they encourage you to ask for them and that really made the trip special. Also the location is excellent - right next to the SBahn, 10 minutes from the Reichstag on foot. I can't wait to go back, my husband and I considered the hotel a high point of the trip.

<Content>What a lovely find I decided to surprise my wife with a getaway in Berlin this weekend and after reading the excellent reviews it has attracted on Tripadvisor I decided to book this hotel. I was not disappointed and would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this wonderful city. I fully endorse the detailed review of the hotel as written by the Tripadvisor member from Uxbridge. I will definately be returning here in the future.

<Content>Perfect Hotel! This was our second time at this hotel and we love it. Clean and modern with a excellent buffet breakfast. The beds are so comfy, like a cloud... the rooms are incredibly clean and my favorite room has the bathtub in the middle of the room! The breakfast is worth getting out of bed for and the staff is friendly. Good choice for anyone who wants to make sure they have a nice hotel to relax in after a long day of shopping and sight-seeing.

<Content>Superb Hotel This is a fantastic hotel in a good location for visiting Potsdamer Platz and the Brandeburg GateThe staff are very courteous and efficient, the food was excellent although I would be tempted to ditch the buffet breakfast which I found a little expensive at 18.50 Euros per person. There are plenty of small cafes only a few minutes walk away.The Restaurant food is faultless and the Anhalter Bar is very different from the usual hotel offerings.Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.

<Content>Excellent My partner and I stayed at the Movenpick Berlin in December on the 'Surprisingly Different' package. I shall not repeat the comments that have been made by other reviewers, other than to say that this is an excellent hotel, providing a high standard of service in contemporary and innovative surroundings.The Surprisingly Different package is excellent value for money and is strongly recommended. Well done Movenpick

<Content>A Movenpick, Berlin Christmas. Guten Tagwe are just back from another wonderful stay in the Movenpick, Berlin, and have to say that this is a great hotel. We booked the Surprisingly different package , to which we added a few days. The staff were very friendly and helpful, as last time we stayed. In fact, some of the staff even knew that we had stayed there in the summer.The room was of a very good size, and also the bathroom. Perhaps some people would want much bigger, but we spent most of our time not in the room, but out and about in Berlin. Perhaps the room was a little cold when you come out of the shower, but we found the room very comfortable, especially as it was so cold outside.The hotel is in a great location, with the S-Bahn and bus stop right outside the hotel, and the U-Bahn just down the road, perhaps a 3-4 minute walk. For getting around Berlin, this is a good location for staying in.Be warned, it did feel a little cold when going down for breakfast, but perhaps we felt this more after just coming out of a really snug bed! Also the packed lunch that you get with the package is huge, it comes in a large bag, and is perhaps too large to carry around Berlin on a cold winters day. So we actually left some of it in our room to eat later!We can not believe that a week has passed by so quickly, but Christmas in Berlin is fantastic. This is one of the best cities in the world to visit.Frohes Neues Jahr.

<Content>Good location A friend and I stayed at the Movenpick for a few days in November. The good points were the hotel style, the restaurant food, large rooms with big windows that open, and excellent bathroom facilities. We also had good service in the bar when there was some confusion about the cocktails we had ordered, immediately rectified by 'on the house' - something we should hear more often when mistakes are made. Despite booking a twin room we were first showed to a double, and then to a smoking twin when we complained. We had booked a non-smoking room but because of their mistake with the twin/double we were left with no choice but to take a smoking room - not good and the staff weren't particularly helpful. That said, we couldn't tell that it was a smoking room and it was very comfortable. The hotel is well situated near Potsdamer Platz and Berlin is a walkable city. We had a good Italian meal in a restaurant on the main road about 100 yds from the hotel and excellent breakfast every morning in a cafe on the corner.

<Content>Movenpick was good We stayed at Movenpick Berlin for four nights just before Christmas. Booked via Hotwire for 62 EUR/night. Very good, clean hotel with nice rooms. The bathroom privacy wasn't an issue for us, but it might be for some people. There is a sliding door with a gap and the glass wall, so you can quite well see and hear what's happening in the bathroom...Didn't eat the 17 EUR breakfast, had one drink in the bar.Location was ok, a bit too quiet neigborhood in our opinion. S-bahn station elevators directly to the platform are just across the street. Potsdamer Platz is 700 m away, it's very modern sterile area with theatre, movies and shopping center.Staff was helpful.

<Content>Great Hotel We really enjoyed our stay at Movenpick. The rooms were modern  very clean, and the bathroom was really cool! It's very close to Potsdamer Platz (7-10 min.walking) and in 'the middle' of west  east Berlin. The standard rooms are on the small size but very adequate for a few nights.The only negative i can find is that although the bathroom was very nice and special with the 'glass wall', somehow you can't have total privacy in the bathroom. Overall it was a great hotel and i would definitely recommend it!

<Content>A good hotel, not a great hotel. It's difficult to fault the hotel. It's in a great location, the rooms were clean and had all the mod-cons, the decor very retro. However, the athmosphere was a bit sterile. Perhaps it's just the Germans! All in all though I'd recommend this hotel. We enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Loved it! We used Tripadvisor reviews of this hotel , took the plunge and booked it! We were not disappointed - we have just returned from 3 nights stay. The hotel is really fab and in an ideal spot. Its in a really quiet area within very close proximity to Potsdamer Platz and many tourist attractions; Anhalter Bahnhof underground station is just outside the hotel. The room, the staff and overall ambience of the place are to be recommended. The hotel bar was great too - we used it on our first night there - if only we hadn't been so tired from all that walking or we might have tried it again!Berlin is a wonderful city with so much to offer - go soon and stay at the Movenpick! Check out Insider walking tours too - great!

<Content>Great Hotel, Good Location Had a wonderful 3 days here in August. Hotel was outstanding in every way, including the staff who were very helpful. Breakfast was fantastic and set you up for the day. You could walk to most places of interest, but the train system was very good and easy to negotiate. Berlin was a lot better than I expected, very modern with great buildings both old and new, and there was a nice feel to the city. We thought the people of Berlin were very nice and only too willing to help us when we requested assistance. There was a marvellous Italian restaurant at the top of the road which we eat in every night and the food was of a high standard. Would definately go to Berlin again and stay at the same hotel.

<Content>Wonderful hotel! We have stayed in several 4 or 5 star hotels in Berlin, and this is our new favorite one. The hotel is in a great location close to Potsdamer Platz. The neighborhood is a bit quieter than many central locations and we felt safe parking the car on the street at night. The hotel itself is, of course, very colorful! This is done in a stylish way that makes you smile in appreciation. I liked the little details like the quotes painted on the walls and the inlaid flower designs in the hall carpets. The staff was always very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was excellent, especially that Mæžšvenpick yogurt and marmelade. We had a familly room with an extra bed for our little boy. There was a lot of space there with a very high ceiling. The bathroom was certainly large enough and stylish like the rest of the hotel. The air conditioning issue was a bit annoying, even in early October, as it didn't work so well and things got stuffy. We tried opening the window -- our window faced the inner courtyard, which is generally the quieter place to be -- but then we could hear breakfast being set-up downstairs through the courtyard's glass ceiling at 3:30 a.m.There was no pool, but there's a great-looking swim complex a street away. We didn't get there but would have liked to. There was just so much else to do! So definitely stay here at this lovely hotel, at least from mid-October till it gets warm in the summer!

<Content>great place to stay We travelled to Berlin to see the Scorpions in concert and stayed for two nights at this hotel. Our room was very spacious and decorated in a very contemporary style. The bathroom in our room was huge but unfortunately we only had a bath (which was also enormous) but no shower which was a shame. Our friends' room was much smaller than ours as was the bathroom and they had a lovely shower but no bath. If you have a real preference it may be worth checking this out at time of booking as I did not read anything which told me about the difference in bathrooms. We used the sauna one day which was very nice and absolutely immaculate.The reception staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, if you want any information about the city i wouldn't hesitate to ask them. You can also buy the day/2day transport passes at reception. We bought them on our last day and ended up not using them and the nice man at reception refunded our money!We ate at the restaurant on the first night not something we had planned to do but the heavens had opened so we decided to stay put. The meal we had was truly delicious and very reasonably priced for hotel food. Our room price included breakfast and as commented by previous reviewers the breakfast is truly wonderful we were really spoilt for choice and felt it was the best breakfast we had seen in a european hotel of comparable quality. We had a lovely meal at theitalian restaurant which can be found by turning left out of the hotel and it is situated under the accor suites hotel, past a and pizza were both lovely.We walked miles in Berlin and found it a really interesting city the hotel was perfectly located as we could use both the buses and the underground to get around but could also explore the city on foot.If travelling back to Berlin we wouldn't hesitate in stayig here again and recommend it unreservedly.

<Content>Memorable stay for a moden hotel As mentioned in previous reviews, this is a convenient location for sightseeing and a very comfortable base in Berlin. Got the train from Shoenfeld airport, then the underground.Reception are helpful and professional. The duvets and pillows are feather, and they had run out of synthetic on the 1st night, but they helpfully found me some cotton sheets etc.The junior suites have a small 2 seater sofa, a couple of chairs and quite a high ceiling. I donéˆ¥æª› think the hotel is really airconditioned though, as the system will only cool it if it goes over 21C at night! Needed to open the window instead to let the cooler air in. This was fine as it was quite quiet as the windows faced into the courtyard over the restaurant. The beds were also really comfortable. There was a mini bar fridge in room, no tea/coffee facilities but I donéˆ¥æª› usually expect these in a European hotel.Good spacious bathroom, large bath and separate shower, plenty towels, kept spotless, slightly unstable controls trying to get the temperature right at peak times in the morning. Slightly quirky design with the glass brick wall around the bathroom which is at a slightly raised level above the room - the sofa and chairs are on the other side, sort of facing the loo. If you put the light on in the bathroom at night it of course illuminates the whole room. Lovely breakfast restaurant with glass roof that opens. Lots of choice éˆ¥?coffee brought to the table and self service food, with speciality breads, several types of cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruits, cheeses, smoked salmon, scrambled eggs, well worth having and good value compared to the cost of 4-5* hotel breakfasts in the UK. You didnéˆ¥æª› really need lunch after it and could get on with the sightseeing.

<Content>Great hotel, really different. My partner and I have just returned from a 2-night stay at the Movenpick booked via a Priceline bid of æ‹¢40 per night.I had read reviews here so sort of knew what to expect but was still taken aback by the uniqueness of the place. It is just REALLY cool! I had emailed ahead to request a king bed and this was granted with no problems. The staff were very polite and helpful.The room was beautiful and as described in other reviews here. Location was great for visiting the Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie and others.I would not hesitate in staying there again.

<Content>Uber modern, great location We have just returned from a weekend at the Movenpick in Berlin and thought that the hotel was very stylish and trendy. We got a good deal on the room rate which made it excellent value and although breakfast wasn't included we felt it was well worth the extra cost - huge choice and kept us going until 6pm. If you fancy a change or a later breakfast Cafe Josty at the Sony Centre do a buffet brunch from 10 -2 upstairs with as much bubbly as you can drink for 14.50 euros.Unlike other reviewers we felt that our room (559) was rather small and this was mainly due to the fact that we were on the 5th floor and the room was in the eaves. The sloping ceilings really ate into the space in the room and made things difficult for my 6ft2in partner. However we had asked for a quiet room and it was certainly that. Like others we were surprised to find no tea/coffee making facilities and I was shocked that there was no bath. I don't think that is acceptable for a 5 star hotel and my aching limbs missed it after a hard days sight seeing. We did have a fancy walk in shower in a wet room, however, the floor did not slope towards the drain and so our bathroom was an unpleasant swamp most of the time.The hotel design is very attractive if you like the industrial look, which we do and the dining room ceiling is a great feature. It has a lot of character and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The reception staff particularly were excellent - check in and check out were very fast and efficient, and I have never received an iron and ironing board so quickly. They also allowed us to use their own internet access to check in on line for our flights. Twice they called us a taxi and it arrived in just a few minutes. There is also free juice and water available at reception.We ate in the hotel several times and found the food to be excellent, if rather limited in choice. The staff were again lovely, but at both breakfast and dinner they seemed understaffed and we were often kept waiting. At breakfast we had to ask for cutlery, napkins, cups, coffee and then no milk was brought so we just went and got our own from the buffet. It was very busy, but more staff were needed. The same applied in the bar where the lone barman was producing complicated cocktails, although another waitress did arrive after 20 minutes. Apart from the wait this was one of the best hotel bars I've been in - it was more like a trendy club.The hotel is well located near Potsdamer Platz with its bars, restaurants and shops. Tourists beware though that many of the shops shut early on Saturdays and don't open on Sundays - we couldn't even find a shop to buy crisps and water at 6pm Saturday. At Potsdamer Platz there are several open top bus tours available which cost 15 euros and cover all the sights. We spent most of Saturday riding around on the bus. If you fly into Schonefield Airport as we did, a taxi from the airport will cost about 27 euros, so including the tip it is about æ‹¢20 - not too bad if you are sharing. Certainly an easy option late at night!To sum up we had a great stay and on the whole loved the hotel. If they got more waiting staff and sorted out a few design flaws it would be nigh on perfect!

<Content>lovely hotel This is a very stylish and comfortable hotel conveniently situated very close to the Ahalter Bahnhof S-Bahn stop (although the station itself has vanished apart from the facade). The hotel is in a renovated former Siemens building and is very modern and contemporary both in the foyer and dining room and in the bedrooms. Breakfasts were outstanding with a huge choice of yoghurts, breads, cheeses, fresh fruits and cooked items. The staff were very helpful and spoke English. We went for a walk on our last day and discovered a local supermarket and small cafes and bars nearby as well as a park. Thoroughly recommended and outstanding value..

<Content>Loved it!! We stayed here after reading all the reviews and so glad we did. We travelled with 2 boys 11 and 13 and could not fault anything. The rooms were spotless and spacious. The breakfast buffet is still talked about and we also enjoyed a fantastic dinner in the hotel. Great location and all the staff were fantastic and very helpful. Have recommended this hotel to everyone we know. Great value for money.

<Content>Pray it's not warm! Yes, the location is great. Yes, the place is trendy. Our suite (for which read large room) was also very spacious, clean and comfortable. The buffet breakfast is excellent. But, boy, do they have a real problem with the A/C - just as other summer reviewers have pointed out. My complaint is not that the system only cools to 21 degrees - this would not be an issue in the slightest if, in fact, it were actually capable of cooling to anything approaching this temperature in summer. The simple fact is that it isn't, and this detracted hugely from my enjoyment of the property. To make matters worse, the staff are clearly trained to deny that there is an issue, instead implying that it is unreasonable for guests to expect the system to work any better than it does. Moevenpick management - I suggest you read the sheer volume of comments here and draw your own conclusions. Until you do, this will remain a quirky, interesting, well-located but fundamentally flawed hotel. (P.S. While you're at it, you might consider investing in a gym worthy of the premises - or, if you believe that just one treadmill is sufficient for a large hotel, please at least ensure that it functions!)

<Content>Superb Location The Movenpick Berlin is pretty much in the middle of re-unified Berlin. Most of the main sights are within walking distance and the ones that aren't are easily accessible via the S Bahn opposite the hotel (including a direct link to out-of-town Wannsee and the compelling exhibition in the villa which housed the Wannee Conference in 1942). Don't miss the booklet in the room entitled A House with a History - your visit will be the richer for knowing more about the building. It's been lovingly restored only a few years ago into a funky, modern hotel, yet retaining original features and casting more than the occasional nod to Bauhaus.Beds are exceedingly comfy and rooms immiaculate. Surprisingly peaceful,.too - although you'd be well advised to go midweek if you want to guarantee avoiding noisy party goers arriving back in the middle of the night! Yes, the air conditioning appears to be stuck at a minumum of 21 degrees, but this was cool enough in July nonetheless. Bizarrely, no tea/coffee-making facilities in the deluxe room - something we missed more than we thought we would.

<Content>Wow!! My husband, daughter and I have just spent 4 days here during the Soccer World Cup, a booking made from reviews and ratings on this website and we were not disappointed. What a wonderful find - great location for shopping, transport and eating. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the breakfast was a good reason to get out of bed and the room was one of the best that we have ever stayed in - plenty of room, cupboard space, tourist information, an expresso machine, complimentary bottled water and bowl of fruit and a welcome place to relax in after a hectic day. We highly recommend this hotel to any traveller to this wonderful city - we will be back.

<Content>Great Hotel and Better Location Stayed here a few days during World Cup 2006. A great hotel and unbelievable location. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were nice sized, especially for European hotels. The hotel was spotless. We did not use the restaurant. The AC could have been better, but many German hotels are lacking it completely. The location more than made up for this. We were 5 minutes from Potsdamer Platz and the trains to get us to Olympiastadion. We were 10 minutes from Brandenburg gate and Fan Fest. Great location to see Berlin with tons of dining and shopping opportunities nearby.

<Content>Ok Hotel My wife and I were in Berlin for the World Cup and decided to stay at the Movenpick due to the reputation. We felt it was ok. Here are the positives:nice modern interiorgreat breakfastnice staffgreat housekeepingNegatives:No bellboy, had to schlepp our bags to our rooms ourselvesRoom Air Conditioning does not go below 21 C and we even changed our rooms...Do not use the Gym, it is over 100 F in there. I complained about the heat in the gym several times.....Sauna before 4pm is on request only (go figure.....)Towels in Showers were handtowels and not bathtowels (we all know how much fun it is to use small towels after a shower...)No turndown service (no biggy though....)All in all I would not call this a 4 Star Hotel in terms of ammenities but it's nice for the price. The location is pretty convenient with the S Bahn close by and Potzdamer Platz and Check point Charly all within walking distance. Several Restaurants around. Very safe area.

<Content>The decor is the thing. Well done indeed! This hotel, especially for the price, which is low by most standards, was a great find. We loved the super stylized decor. So fabulously done. They have made the absolute most with what they've got. This is the poster child hotel for that sort of thing. It also has a very young, fun, casual vibe resounding strongly in it, which is also refreshing after sometimes staying in stodgy, if nice, chain hotels. The bed was right in front of the window, which was much better looking that it sounds, and the bathroom, separated off with glass bricks was also very nicely done. I wasn't a huge fan of their breakfast, most especially not at $15 a person, but it was a fairly trivial matter. The location is quite good just near the subway stop and within walking distance of the Potsdamer Platz if you really needed to get there that way. The staff was quite helpful and cheery. They had a small gym that was quite clean, though like most hotels, really not worth much with its small amount of equipment. All in all, I can see why this hotel is ranked so highly when you factor in the hip factor with the low price. Thumbs up.

<Content>Surpassed all Expectations I stayed at this hotel last weekend with my Mother. It was fantastic. The staff are attentive and efficient and dealt with all our queries faultlessly. They delivered toothpaste to our room at 1am when we realised we had forgotten ours, brought extra pillows, ordered taxis, made restaurant bookings and changed money with extreme efficiency. Our room was beautiful and spotless with nice touches such as fresh fruit, chocolates and free water. The breakfast is exquisite - our rate included breakfast. The selection was vast - cereals, yoghurts, bread, croissants, eggs, an omlette bar amd more besides. This was a perfect bas for our stay. The location was also excellent - opposite Anhalter Bahnhof which was extremely convenient. Only a 10-15 minute walk to Brandenburg Gate.Two restaurant reccommendations - Aigners in Gendarmenmarkt and Gugelhof in Penzlauer Berg. We had a brilliant trip and the hotel made out stay!

<Content>Magnificant Moevenpick! We booked this hotel after reading Trip Advisor. The hotel is absolutely fantasic! The rooms, service and everything about the Hotel were amazing. We booked direct with the Hotel and had an excellent deal. Our room was upgraded and included breakfast, two free drinks each at the very funky bar in the Hotel, a four-course dinner at the Hotel restauarant, a free packed linch (which was enormous) as well as 72 hours free public transport!! This Hotel is certainly one of the best we have ever stayed at and we would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Berlin. We loved every minute of our stay!! Thanks, Trip Advisor.

<Content>What a treasure! We stayed for 3 nights at the Movenpick Hotel Berlin, a choice based on Trip Advisor reviews.What a treasure! It truly deserves being rated #1 of 407 Berlin hotels on your popularity index.The hotel is conveniently situated on a quiet street just off Stresemannstrasse a short walk from Potsdamer Platz. Other major attractions within comfortable walking distance are Judisches Museum, Topography of Terror, Checkpoint Charlie, Kulturforum, Reichstag, Brandenburger Tor and Holocaust-Denkmal. There are U-Bahn and S-Bahn stations as well as a taxi rank very close to the hotel so it is well served for getting around the city. Our room was stylish, very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was modern and spacious with a separate glass shower cubicle which amazingly remained spotless and never bore any traces of water or soap residue! One feature we appreciated was that the height of the showerhead could be adjusted. The buffet breakfast was expansive and delicious with great variety in all categories - breads, pastries, fruits, cereals, hot and cold dishes. We also had a dinner at the Movenpick restaurant and were very pleased by the high standard (try the duck!) including the level of service.Which leads to our final comment about our Movenpick Berlin experience. Apart from the favourable location, attractive accommodation, amenities and restaurant standard, what places this hotel up front and ahead of the pack is the level of service provided to its guests. From the moment of check-in to departure we received friendly, efficient courteous and personalised attention. To elaborate, we had arrived after an overnight transatlantic flight without our luggage which was stranded at our connecting airport in London. When it still had not been delivered as promised by next morning, staff went out of their way to help us by telephone (constant ringing and no answer) and eventually by fax to the carrier involved. They even encouraged us to leave for our city sightseeing while they continued their efforts on our behalf. In addition, with their consummate attention to detail, upon returning to the hotel, I was surprised with a letter of birthday greetings and a beautifully wrapped gift from the management . Someone must have noticed the date from the registration details!Without any reservation we would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely return ourselves on any future visit to Berlin.

<Content>Good high quality hotel, but some problems to note This is a very well kitted out hotel with a fantastic restaurant and very helpful staff, but there are a number of issues to note1. The style of the double rooms has a see through effect for the bathrooms. Warped glass tiles allow you to kind of see into the bathrooms which I guess is ok but sometimes you'd rather just have some privacy, even if it is your partner whom you're in the room with! :-)2. The air conditioning units are set at 21 degrees with a maximum either way of 2 degrees (so the coldest you can make it is 19 and the warmest is 23). It was getting hot in Berlin when we were there and 19 degrees for the air conditioning is just too hot. We confirmed this limitation with the information in the hotel leaflets so it wasn't a case of not being able to operate it.3. They kept adding breakfasts to our Bill that we had not had which was annoying. They were quite fine in taking them off but it was annoying. Right at the end they said that actually we had been entitled to free breakfasts all along which was also annoying as we had checked for this when checking in and were told that we were not.4. We watched two movies on the in-room movie system, however, one of the movies played in a reversed manner, that is the image was flipped (like watching it in a mirror with all the words backwards etc.). Also there was no sound for that movie. They took it off our bill as we could not watch it but it was very bizarre.However, it is a lovely hotel with very good staff who were always very helpful. The restaurant was fantastic, we ate there for breakfast once and dinner twice (once for a-la-carte and once for a buffet, both were outstanding). It is also very well situated and we got excellent room rates. The cleaning staff also had very good attention to detail and noticed when our shower/body gel had run out and replaced it.I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at the Moevenpick Stayed at the Moevenpick Hotel, Berlin from 28-30 April 2006. We were 7 women and had reservations for two twin rooms and a triple room. Unfortunately we were all given rooms with double beds, not twins as requested, but the hotel was full so we couldn't do anything about it. Our Junior Suite had only one double bed in it and was not a triple room as requested, but the reception organsed an extra bed to be put in the room straight away. The bathroom had no doors on the bathroom area though, so this was a little weird - would be alright for couples, rather than friends! The room was spotlessly clean.  I thought the hotel was excellent value for money, couldn't fault the staff in this Hotel - very professional, especially in the breakfast room. The breakfast buffet was terrific and was included in the price - I booked through Hotel.com. Huge choice including boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, tomatoes, cold meats and cheeses, pastries and cakes, fruit, yoghurts, cereals etc. The breakfast is served in a restaurant which has a retracting glass roof letting the fresh air in.One problem we had was that the room was too hot at night and we could not turn the heating down under 19c. So we didn't sleep very well. There are no tea/coffee facilities in the room unfortunately, but water was supplied.Several sites are just a short walk from the hotel, including the Reichstag, Unter den Linden, Potsdamer Platz including the Sony Center, and the Berlin Film Museum (which has a lovely Marlene Dietrich exhibition). Do not miss the Anthaltern bar. Hot food and sandwiches are served, and a good range of drinks/cocktails at reasonable prices. There was a pianist on the Friday night who was very good. The bar had a great atmosphere and was of a lovely design.Across the street is an Italian restaurant on the corner and the pastas were very nice indeed and so reasonably priced. Staff were excellent here.Taxi rank and Anhalter Bahnhof station right across from the hotel.

<Content>Amazing! The other reviews have got it. This place is way above average. We did one of the packages they offered and were astounded at the value. The meal at the restaurant way way beyond what we expected, and having unlimited metro tickets included was a real perk! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

<Content>Fabulous The location is only just not perfect but I have had to struggle to think of a resaon to say something negative about this hotel. The service was delightful. The rooms are very modern in design and very comfortable. Just a short walk to the Tiergarten, Brandenburg Gate, Jewish Museum etc.

<Content>superb hotel We applied for an upgrade (just additional 9 EUR/ night) that we managed and got a larger room. Designer bath in the middle of the room by Philip StarckVery good and rich breakfast, however, a bit pricey for EUR 17/person.Only negative was the heating system ; it cannot be switched over 23 Celsius...

<Content>Lovely Hotel - Exceptional staff, very reasonable My girlfriend and I chose the Movenpick Berlin for our sightseeing break based entirely on the reviews we had read on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. Overall it was a very pleasant stay. The room (we were upgraded to a junior suite on arrival) was spacious and spotless. The staff in all cases were mannerly and attentive to our needs - we could not fault them in any way. To top it off the price for our 3 nights was very reasonable given the quality of our experience. We would certainly recommend the Movenpick Berlin for any travellers to that historic city.

<Content>Quality hotel at reasonable prices - recommended I stayed in the hotel on the first weekend in February with friends who were celebrating a wedding. Found the hootel to be spotlessly clean, convenient for the underground and most of the sites, the staff were very friendly and all spoke good English. I only ate there at breakfast, but this was excellent with lots of choice and good serving times. The bar was lively in the evening and the barmen were very helpful in recommending places to visit. The receptionists also helped to locate traditional German food and everyone enjoyed the hospitality of our hosts. It was my first visit to Berlin, but I will definitely be going again and will stay at the Movenpick.

<Content>An awesome surprise! I was very skeptic when I found out that I would be staying at the Moevenpick and not the Marriott for my visit to Berlin. The Hotel, however, had everything and more than the Marriott could offer. The rooms, although a bit too modern for the average taste, were very accomodating and spacious. The beds were comfortable, and the bathrooms are comparable to what some homeowners would dream to have in their rooms: a big and spacious tub, a separate shower, and a toilet that had everything except an ottoman. The Moevenpick's secret weapon is their staff, who are helpful, cordial and knowledgeable. Most, if not all, speak English, German and perhaps one more language. Throughout my stay, they went above and beyond to ensure that I was enjoying my visit. The breakfast served at the hotel is to die for. Even if you don't stay at the hotel, you should swing by and try it. Make sure you pack an appetite, because there is a vast selection of meat, dairy, cereals and fruit to choose from. Additionally, the hotel is located a few blocks from Checkpoint Charlie and only a block from the nearest S-Bahn station--Anhalter Banhoff. All in all, there is no doubt that I would stay there next time I visit Berlin.

<Content>Awesome! Stayed Dec. 21st to the 28th. This is the best hotel my girlfriend and I have ever stayed at.Before I start I read the last review and the guy complained that the train wasn't running properly to Anhalter Bahnhof, while we where there from the 21st of Dec to the 28th we didn't have a problem there are loads of trains going both directions, less than 5 minutes between trains.Now on to the hotel,1. Check in was quick and easy, the staff were very fluent in English. Extremely helpful from the start of our stay until the end, allowing me to use the computer at the front desk to check email for free. They were polite all the time, from 6am until 1am.2. The room was outstanding, the bathroom was spotless, I almost walked into the shower door. The rest of the room was excellent and you got nice chocolates and or mints on the pillow. We got an extra bag of goodies on Christmas Day too. It had gingerbread, chocolate and some other treats in it. The bed was excellent, and it had two nice big duvets on it to keep us warm. The bed was so comfortable, and so was the room as a whole, it was funky and homely and made the stay just perfect.3.The breakfest buffet is worth it, we booked straight through the hotel and got the same price as on expedia, but we got the breaky with the hotel booking.IT WAS AWESOME! Omlette Bar (made to order I had ham, bacon, mushroom, tomato and cheese, mmmmmmm omlette), scrambled eggs, potato rosti, grilled tomato, bacon (perfect bacon, nice and crispy), sausages, hard boiled eggs and that is the hot stuff. On top of that you had a load of breads to select from, and spreads for them. A crazy cereal bar with loads of nuts, grains, dried fruit, yogurts, and so on. Then you also had a load of quality meats, cheeses and a fantastic fruit bar with watermelon, kiwis, and so on. IT WAS AWESOME!4. The location, you cannot beat this location you have Anhalter Bahnhof station at your door with the old station ruins still there, a nice little bunker close by too. Potsdam Platz is 5-7 minute walk away, Checkpoint Charlie is around 10 minutes away, Topography of Terror is 5 minutes away and so on. We were able to travel everywhere from Anhalter Bahnhof with some transfers but saw East and West Berlin it was excellent. There was a load of restaurants near by, by Anhalter Bahnhof station across the street is an Italin place it is small and on the coner but the pizza and pastas are AMAZING! Nothing was that far away at the end of the day.Overall if I was to go to Berlin again I would stay at this hotel without a doubt. To be honest in the future I will continue to choose Movenpick hotels over others.

<Content>Ditto all the raves - LOVED it. We would most enthusiastically recommend the Movenpick. Thanks to TripAdvisor for turning us on to this fun hotel and excellent value. We got a two-night weekend stay in early Dec., WITH air fare from London on lastminute for about æ‹¢235 per person. We arrived before noon on Friday, but were able to get into our room immediately - AND were instantly upgraded. The room was very spacious and, as others have said funky.The front desk staff was not effusive, but was always helpful (and completely bilingual). We had both a buffet dinner and a breakfast buffet at the restaurant and enjoyed both.We also enjoyed the location. Do realize that you'll most likely need to take a cab if you want to go to the former West Berlin - but most of the top sights are in the East and therefore quite nearby.ONE THING TO ASK ABOUT - is whether the S-Bahn at Anhalter Bahnhof (which is right across the street from the hotel), is now running in both directions. When we were there, the subway stopped at Anhalter going NORTHBOUND ONLY. Thus, in order to get to the hotel via underground from central Berlin you had to take the S1 or S2 south and exit one stop beyond Anhalter (Yorckstrasse). You then took the train back north to Anhalter Banh. An alternative would be to get off at Potsdamer Platz and walk about 6 minutes to the hotel - but it was VERY COLD when we were there. I think the southbound exit at Anhalter Banh. is due to reopen in January 2006, but I suggest you check with the front desk. Also feel free to explore the restaurants right around the hotel. The neighborhood looks somewhat deserted, but we had a VERY good breakfast at the informal restaurant that was east of the hotel, across Stresemannstrasse.Finally, DO NOT MISS the Jewish Museum - which is otherwise a bit off the beaten track, but is less than a 10 minute walk from the Movenpick.
