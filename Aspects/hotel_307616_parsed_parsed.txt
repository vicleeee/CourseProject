<Content>Loved the Kartika Plaza We travelled as a family with teenage children ,a daughter and son aged 17 and 16 and we all loved the Kartika. Kids keep asking when they can go back. The pool was fantastic, never crowded which you would expect with the size of the hotel. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful if you needed anything. Buffet breakfast was fabulous, so much to choose from. We had a late breakfast then didn't need lunch most days. The location of the hotel was great, so close to everything. You can walk to Kuta, and nearby shops and restaurants, the discovery mall next door was a great place to shop as well. Waterbom park is also close by which the kids had a ball at. We stayed in the Family Suite and found it very comfortable and clean, the only downside was only having one bathroom between the four of us. I would stay here again next time we go to Bali.

<Content>NOT THAT GOOD The hotel room air conditioning was always on. No way to adjust the temperature. It was either off or on.The instruction is also unclear as to which water was complimentary. Apparently, the water inside the small refrigerator is not free.The outside environment is nice though. Hotel shower also terrible. Way too low and have to crouch to wash hair. Furthermore, there was very little water flow from the shower so it takes a long time to wash.

<Content>Lovely Hotel but ..... I have just returned from three days at the Discovery Kartika Plaza hotel. The hotel is nice with friendly and welcoming staff.The Thumb Up of Discovery :~ Nice hot buffet breakfast with variety western and asian food.~ Simple decoration of room and comfortable bed.~ Just beside shopping mall and walking distance to kuta area.~ Cheap spa and massage compare to outside spa. Only cost us 175 000 rupiah for 2 hours balinese traditional massage compare to outside spa cost us 350 000 rupiah for 1 hour balinese traditional massageThe Thumb down of discovery :~ small Cocroaches in the wardrobe and toilet.~ smelly water all the time.

<Content>We wont stay anywhere else I stayed at the Kartka with my mum and husbandWe had a fabulous time there. (Mum being a supercritical ethnic has stayed at many hotels/resorts in her life time and she made the comment that it is the best hotel she has ever stayed at! Now that is saying something!!!The rooms were although minimilist (but had all that you really needed) were very nice and clean. Some superior rooms even had a lovely view of the ocean from the balcony.The breakfast was fabulous and tropical and had a variety of local food but also catered well for the Westerners. They had a number of food stations so there were no queues. The theme buffet dinners were cheap enough but mroe importantly very very nice. We did not try any other eating places at the Hotel.The Pool I think was the nicest I have ever been to. Its huge.The location was just out of the hub of Kuta and as you may have read, right next to the major shopping mall. (Try the reflexology place there!!!)Now for the people!! They were very friendly, humble and always willing to help you. We befriended many of the staff there and the reason why we have booked to go to Bali again. and of course we will be staying at the Kartika. We look forward to seeing them again.To sum up: Book this hotel.

<Content>Amazing Hotel, In a Fantastic Location Hello All,Before i booked this hotel, I noticed there were a few bad reviews on trip advisor. but i just thought id write a small review, to say that this is a fantastic hotel. Not sure why there are any bad reviews. The hotel is located approximately 15 mins drive from the airport (no you cant hear any jets overhead). in south Kuta, and is situated approx 20 metres away from the beach. The beach directly outside the hotel isnt very good, but if you walk 50 metres either way, then it is much better. If you head out right along the beach, then you come to Legian or seminyak beach which are amazing at night. You can watch the surfers whilst the sunsets are truely breathtaking. Because you are in south Kuta, you are only 5 minutes walk from the truely hectic nightlife of Kuta. The good thing is, you cant hear a thing when you are in or around the hotel. It is really well protected, with great security. Our vehicles were searched before entering the compound, which was good to see. We booked a deluxe room, but to our surprise, when we arrived and checked into the hotel room, we had sea views. Truely awesome. The perfect picture postcard. Palm trees, Ocen views, amazing. The hotel was extremely clean, as is the rooms. Everytime we went for breakfast, by the time we got back our room had been cleaned and sheets and towels changed. So efficient. Speaking of breakfasts, well, they catered for every tastes. They had western food, chinese foods, fruit, selection of meats, fish, eggs, breads, fantastic. We never left hungry. They had a different type of evening meal on every night, like bbq's, pasta, Seafood and Roast Nights. Although we did find these to be quite expensive. It was much cheaper to head into Kuta to visit one of hundreds of local and international bars or restaurants. To get around Bali, i recommend using one of the many private drivers that you can hire. They normally charge around 200,000 rupiahs for half a day, or 300,000 rupiahs for a full day (dont pay more than this), and they will take you anywhere you want to go, whether it be to the north of the island to the volcanoes, or east to the beach resorts, monkey forest, or the zoo's. They will then wait for you, and bring you back to the hotel, great. Be careful when booking a driver, be firm and tell him where you want to go, as sometimes they will tell you they can take you to a wood carving place, but you go to probably the most expensive place, and the same with the local art places. I think they get a commission. Just a warning, be careful with the guys on the street corners giving away scratch card type promotions. They ask you to scratch a card, you obviously win, then you get free transport to the desired hotel to have a socalled look around, and then they try and sell you a holiday for the next year. In my opinion just say no. The sellers on the street can be quite aggressive, but just be firm and say no thanks if you are not interested. If you are after a fantastic hotel, in probably the best location in Kuta, with great views, great food, and fantastic staff, then this hotel is definately the one you should pick. I looked at many of the 3 and 4 star hotels in and around Kuta, and im so glad i didnt pick them, as i saw many of the moving around Kuta. Yuk. Pick this hotel, you will not be disappointed. The tourists are slowly starting to come back to Bali (after the truely horrendous bombings here) which is great for the balinese people. They really do need help. Well thats is. We had a fantastic holiday here, im so glad we picked this hotel, it made our stay so much more enjoyable. Highly recommended.

<Content>Paradise found What a fantastic hotel!My husband and I have been back to this hotel many times and it is our preferred hotel in Bali. Great location right next door to a big department store.We have stayed in a superior, ocean view and private garden room before. I prefer the ocean view of all the 3. The private garden room is great, but can get a bit noisy (being on the ground floor) with the food carts rattling outside your door all hours. This time we stayed in an ocean view room/left wing in one of the newly renovated rooms. The cleanliness of the hotel room and the bathroom was outstanding, the bed was super comfortable. There is an inroom safe, mini bar, all the facilities you would expect from a 4 star hotel. The only negative was that the pillows were a bit large and uncomfortable (woke up with a stiff neck a few nights), however new pillows were quickly brought up which sorted out the problem. The shower was super powerful and can easily be adjusted if you do not require a high pressured shower (especially if you have a bit of sunburn!). The food at the many restaurants in the hotel is of a high quality, we have never gotten sick (Bali belly) from eating at the hotel and food and beverages is reasonably priced. This holiday we ate all our meals at the hotel due to the great variety, quality and value. Breakfast was included and was open until 11.00am which is handy if you want to have a sleep in. As we stayed 7 nights we were given a free dinner for 2 persons and also a free massage for 2 persons. My husband had a massage every day at the fitness centre as it was so reasonably priced. Very relaxing and worth it. You can also have your massage on the beach in one of the huts that overlooks the ocean. There is a swim up bar in the pool where you can get a bucket of beer (pay for 3 beers and get 4), french fries, nibblies etc, they also had a band that played during happy hour at the pool bar, 3 guys on guitars...amazing! You could throw just about any song at them and they would play it. Superb harmonies! The staff at this hotel are the best I have seen and are the friendliest I have come across. I would thoroughly recommend paying the extra and staying at this hotel. I am a travel agent and this is my preferred hotel by far. Check it out!

<Content>Great Hotel We heard from friends about the Kartika and that it was nice so we decided to stay there in August 2005. We were disappointed when told we were not able to get an ocean view room, but suprised when we were given one. The view from the balcony was fantastic. 180 deree view of ocean, the pool and garden surroundings. We were on the third (top) floor in the Left wing.The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was quite large. We had a main bedroom with king bed and TV, then a loungeroom with 2 couches, a TV and two single beds. The main bedroom and loungeroom were seperated by a door. There was also a hallway and nice bathroom and the main bedroom led out onto the balcony.The Discovery Mall (often known as Centro) is located right next door to the Discovery Katika Plaza. We completed most of our shopping there as it was out of the centre strip of Kuta and had better prices/stores than Matahari. When we werent out sightseeing and shopping we were in the MASSIVE pool the whole time or walked over to the beach.

<Content>Nice place to discover Stayed here in May 2008 for 10 enjoyable nights. Great location for shoppers, great pool, great breakfast. Only small prob was that we booked for a late 6pm checkout but the hotel said that was not the case and that it was a 12 noon check out Infinity / Flight Centre had not arranged such. However we negotiated the 6pm so all was well.

<Content>another visit to kartika I have stayed at discovery kartika plaza a few times over the last 4 yrs, most recent was 4 nights in june and on night on the way home,I'm getting to know the bell staff and the front desk staff since I've been every year for the last 4.They do a great job at the hotel but it may just be me, but I remember just about all the staff saying hello when walking into the front of the hotel, and this year it didn't seem like they were quite as attendive, although it may just be my imagination.The hotel seems to be managed by a german company or something as all the senior staff is european/german.AS most have mentions the hotel's rooms are clean and roomy, grounds are right on the beach very near the access to the local surfspots reefs off to the left of the hotel.....all in all a good stay, if not getting a bit pricey,4 yrs ago it was 75.00 and night , it is now more like 125.00 USDthat's at a corp discount.Most who have been to bali know that you can find very decent accomodation for much less , if you look around a bit.......but for a once a year splurge......kartika is nice

<Content>Good for an overnight stay or two, but no longer I recently travelled to Indonesia for work, staying overnight (twice) at the Discovery Kartika before heading off to Sumbawa.I arrived at the Kartika, after a long journey from London. The room was ready and waiting for my tired body to rest. The shower was large, bathroom clean (on par with Mandarin Oriental bathrooms), and marbled.The bedroom was quite spacious and was adorned with interesting pictures of topless ladies - all in an artistic fashion - perhaps a local delicacy!The room had a balcony with a slight sea view. The hotel has all the features and facilities required for a business traveller too, computers, swimming pool, meeting rooms.Its all good, but a bit boring. I wouldnt recommend staying longer than a few nights. Plus Kuta is a bit like benidorm, Australias playground. The rest of Bali is lovely though.

<Content>discovery experience We arrive at 16:00 and being told that our room wasn't ready.It took 45 minutes + 2 times back and fort to front desk till it is ready. Room is clean but amenity is average (no tooth brush? for 4 stars hotel? ).The tap water is salty and un-drinkable.in fact the shower water too.facility is goodview is averagelocation is goodbreakfast is good (they did serve a lot of kind of cuisine international + local touch in rotation) - one won't feel bored if you stay there for 1 week.consider the price + what we got - for us the hotel is above average.

<Content>Awesome Place To Stay- Wonderful This is the 6th -maybe 7th time we have stayed at The Kartika and it seems to get better all the time. It is our home away from home. Very laid back and comfortable. Wonderful staff. The grounds are immaculate and the room- ground floor private garden pool view room- was fantastic. Every thing is close by. The themed buffet nights were great. We took our 4 year old and she loved every minute of it. Pool food was good and you can choose between Japanese or the pool menu or the italian restaurant menu. The sushi was yummy !! The location is the best too. BOOK IT !!!! I am back there again in 7 weeks for a girls 10 nights away-- cant wait.xx

<Content>Great Stay at the Discovery Kartika Plaza Hotel My partner and I have just come back from Bali and stayed 7 nights at the Discovery Kartika Plaza Hotel, South Kuta. We really enjoyed our stay here, comfortable rooms, great pool area (big pool) and close to restaurants, bars, shops  markets.The buffet breakfast at the hotel is excellent, anything you can think of is there. The Kul Kul Pool Bar is also very good, great to relax around the bar with a cool drink on a hot day - reasonable prices too. The pizzas from the Italian restaurant were also brilliant! We shared a pizza and had a couple of cold Bintang beers for lunch (served around the pool) - couldn't be more relaxing than that.We had a couple of massages in the beach hut by the beach, approx AUD$ 27 for 1 hr. Great to relax with a massage and listening to the waves from the sea.The beach here is not brilliant, it has brown sand, but it is OK to swim here. You can walk a little further towards Kuta and the sand is a little bit better.The Discovery Kartika also has a gym, looked good, did intend to use it ..... but ran out of time .....We had a Oceanview room, well it sort of had ocean view. You could see the ocean through the trees  bushes. The gardens around the hotel are very well kept.Overall, a very enjoyable stay. Comfortable rooms, nice  clean, close to everything. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>A great spot for families My family and I have just returned from a Bali holiday. I spent a lot of time looking for accomodation with two rooms to suit a family. I was thrilled when I saw that Discovery Kartika Plaza offered a family suite. It included two rooms, with two TVs (an excellent range of satellite TV), one bathroom and a balcony.The rooms were perfect for a family. The hotel is just across the road from the Waterbom Park and next door to Discovery Shopping Plaza, which includes a department store and many speciality shops.The hotel is on the beach and has a large swimming pool. The breakfast buffet did have a large choice, but if you went too late they struggled to keep each section supplied. They also were a bit slow with the tea/coffee service. The egg stations were good, but the pancakes tasted like they had been made with UHT milk. We enjoyed one meal at the Italian restaurant, La Cucina - suitable for families as it does have a kids menu.Overall, a great location and good facilities for families.

<Content>Paradise in Kuta The Kartika Plaza is an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Kuta. This is our second trip to Kuta and our first stay at the Kartika plaza. We Loved loved loved it. The location is outstanding. Everything is within walking distance. The hotel is just finishing up a renovation. We had a new room. It was fantastic. The view of the ocean and pool is worth the extra dollars and upgrade. The spa services lacked for a 5 star hotel, but we used them and they were just adequate. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. We stayed two weeks and never tired of the breakfast. The restaurants were overpriced and the food was bland ( except breakfast). We ate off site quite a bit. The pool; there are not enough words to rave about it! There was construction on the beach, but it didn't bother us. The ocean is too rough for a relaxing swim, excellent for surfing though. The rooms were clean and fresh with no complaints. Even the grass was swept clean everyday. Great mix of guests. Alot of Australians and Europeans. Don't let the hotel web site turn you away, it doesn't do it justice. While we were there, several conferences were hosted, but did not inconvenience us at all. We will stay there again and recommend it to everyone.

<Content>Overrated- not at all 5 Star Upon entering the Kartika Plaza, we were quite impressed. The hotel has great security, which made us feel safe. The lobby is gorgeous, and the gardens are nice enough.When we were shown to our room, we were quite disappointed.The room is very small by Bali standards. The furnishings were nice enough, but quite average. Annoying, was the fact that our Ocean Facing Room (which is more expensive than just a standard room), looked straight into the back of a frangipani tree. No Ocean in sight. (Not even a glimpse!)The bathroom was nicely fitted out, all marble. However, the shower constantly went hot/cold/hot/cold. And also something quite dangerous, is that part of the shower, near where the taps are, gets BURNING hot when you have a shower. Not just a little hot, but scalding! I accidently touched it on my back, and ended up with a large red welt accross my back! I couldn't believe it!The soundproofing in the room is also quite bad- every time anyone of our neighbours ran the tap, had a shower, flushed the toilet... we could hear it as though it was in our room.However, I think the worst part was that there seemed to be mosquitos in the airconditioning system. We were very careful to never leave the doors open, yet our room was constantly full of mosquitos. (Always hovering around the aircon vent). We bought fly spray, and sprayed the room everytime we left- and whenever we came back, we counted literally DOZENS dead on the floor and on the bed.I do not recommend the food at the restaurants (except the buffet breakfast, which should be included in your room rate).The restaurants service quite average food, at extortionate prices! We tried a couple of the hotel restaurants, and were disappointed each time. As for the hotels good points:- VERY comfy bed!- Good buffet breakfast, with a great selection. Everything you could possibly imagine for breakfast was there.- Great location. Next door to the new Discovery Shopping Mall, and easy walking distance into the Kuta shopping areas, and Kuta Beach.- Nice pool area. Huge pool!In addition, the Kartika Plaza is quite expensive. It is one of the more expensive hotels in Bali, but DEFINATELY not one of the nicest.I would rate it on par with other 3 star properties I have stayed at.

<Content>Family Holiday This was our first time at Discovery Kartika Plaza, having stayed previously at hotels including the Dynasty,Padma, Legian Beach Hotel and Bali Intan. As a family of 5 we had a 2 bedroom suite with views of the pool and beach for 9 nights. The room was great with plenty of roomto spread out.Advertised as a family friendly hotel we were very disappointed to find a business conference (American mattress association) at the resort for 3 days with about 300 + people. This meant breakfast time was a feeding frenzy (7-9am) and not enjoyable. The hotel also had weddings on each weekend and hundreds of guests descended on the hotel with loud music late into the night. With 3 young children it was not the quiet hotel we expected. On a positive note the kids loved the huge pool and the childrens pool was covered with two sails providing plenty of protection from the sun. If you were looking for a quiet holiday for families, I would be reluctant to recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel with Great View Overall fantastic hotel. My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights. On arrival our bags were taken to our room by the bell boy. We booked an ocean facing room which we received and had no problems at the hotel lobby. The room was great, spaceous with king size bed. The bathroom was clean and tidy. There was a great view of the ocean and hotel garden from the balcony. The hotel offered several restuarants which we ate at in the evening. Continental breakfast was served from 7am to 11am each morning and offered good food. Location of the hotel was good, 5 minutes away from Kuta beach in a cab, costs about 10,000 rupiah. Kuta has lot of resturants and bars for night life. We only spend 1 night in Kuta. There are a number of restuarants just outside the hotel which we ate at in the evening. Unfortunately at the time of our visit, the beach front at the hotel was being redeveloped, best to goto to Kuta or legian beach. I think legian beach is better, further up from Kuta beach. The hotels offers spas, tennis courts, gym and pool with sun loungers. I think this was the best hotel in the area and would recommend it.

<Content>Great Hotel within walking distance to Kuta's night life My husband and I stayed at the Kartika Plaza for 11 nights after moving from the Hard Rock Hotel (which was pretty terrible).We found the overall ambience and experience a pleasant one, very suited to a relaxing holiday whilst still being able to walk into Kuta for shopping and nightlife.Good Points:1. Beachfront Location - so has nice breeze.2. Lovely pool and grounds that were maintained very well.3. Beautiful lobby that has been designed to make the most of the sea breeze.4. Great Breakfast - especially for a buffet. The odd thing was cold, but a very good quality of food.5. Great massages.6. Next door to Kartika Shopping Plaza - definately a plus point for shopoholics.7. Nice pool, never to crowded.Not so Good Points.1. Building work was being done along the seafront whilst we where there.....so a little noisy at times.2. They where renovating some rooms, which again was a little noisy but kept to a minimum. The rooms were OK, I think ours had been repainted, however some of the furniture was looking a bit dated. The bathrooms were the most disappointing, looking quite dated indeed. Cleanliness could also have been improved in bathrooms with a bottle of bleach and some elbow grease.Overall a great stay - much better than the Hard Rock Hotel. The best thing was that it felt like a hotel away from all the hustle and bustle, but a 10min walk and you could be back in the centre of things again. One really nice surprise was that we celebrated my husbands birthday in the Hotel. The maid obviously noticed birthday cards and a birthday cake appeared in our room which was a really thoughtful surprise.

<Content>Best Hotel in Kuta The Discovery was the first hotel in Bali we stayed in. We arrived on Jet Star at around 10:30pm and it was only a very short trip to the hotel. On arrival the staff were very welcoming and we were soon off to our room. Once there we found they had made a mistake with the room and the only 鈥渄eluxe ocean view room鈥?had two single beds, we brought this to there attention and asked to be upgraded which was not a problem and we ended up in a room 10 meters from the ocean with the best view of the sunset I had seen in a longtime (ocean front room). We were at the Discovery for 7 nights and in this time my girlfriend and I got engaged. The staff were very helpful in making arrangements for the night and all went very well. We ate in the hotel restaurants a number of times; the meals were very nice and reasonably priced. However if you want some of the best international cuisine you will ever have head next door to the back of the shopping mall (Atmosphere) or to Kuta beach (Rosso Vivo). Conclusion is the room rate is a little more expensive than some of the more remote locations (Nusa Dua) but they do not charge a fortune for drinks and food, also the service charges are all included. The staff are very friendly, pool with swim-up bar is very nice, gardens are large and very well kept and spa services excellent and cheap for a hotel. Excellent Hotel will go back.

<Content>Great Hotel, not for youth Great1. Rooms are great, every amenity, comfortable bed, great housekeeping2. Breakfast buffet unbelievable, everything and i mean everything you could possibly imagine to eat.3. Great Pool! and amazing sukken pool bar4. Very polite and friednly staff5. right on beach and next to the discovery mall6. 3 min cab ride to nightlifeThis is a great hotel for a family with younger chilren, below 14. Or a couple who justs wants to relax. However, this is not for someone looking for a Crazy party. Also the beach right in front of the hotel is not great, however the better part of the beach is just a fews steps away. A feel of relaxation and seclusion, like Nusa Dua, but not far from the bustling night life of Kuta.

<Content>Nice hotel close to Kuta I moved to this hotel after leaving Nikko Bali Resort and its rocky beach.Good Points:- Right next to the Discovery Mall- Can walk to central Kuta via the beach- Private beach without a lot of peddlers- In the middle of Turban area- Price is average- Excellent staffs- Swim-up bar from the poolNegative Points:- Towers supplied are worse than Holiday Inn - another word, they are kind of used up and darken from too many washes and abused- A lot of mosquitoes - you even have your own mosquitoes spray in the room- The beach is ok, but the sands are kind of dirty grey (far from looking like Bahamas white sandy beach)- No Internet unless you purchased either 1-hour or 2-hour package from them. And the signal is available in the lobby area onlyThe hotel is rated at 3 stars, and it is very much like a 3 stars in the accommodation.

<Content>Amazing hotel in the heart of it WOW another fabulous hotel in Bali. I couldnt recommend this enough!! It was perfect for the second week of our honeymoon right in the middle eveything. They gave us a lovely honeymoon cake and petals on the bed! This hotel is by far the best in Tuban area right next to The Discovery Mall with shopping galore and the Water Bom Park opposite.This hotel was only 拢50 a night for pure luxury and I know thats quite high for Bali but for a top end 5 star it was well worth it!

<Content>Up and Down Ok, I'll try to be as objective as I can here:Positives:Good location on Tuban Beach. Although the ocean is not great for swimming there, it's a short walk to Kuta beach and from the beach at the hotel you have a good view looking to Kuta beach with Mt Agung towering over. Great view of the sunsets from the pool area, clean rooms. Friendly staff. Breakfasts ok, not spectacular but decent variety and fare. Good, well maintained grounds with nice pool.Negatives:Beware of costs and money. A room works out to be US$140 per day. We had found a cheaper room on expedia, but of course it turned out that their advertised rates do not include tax (as most other places we saw or stayed did). For this price you can stay at some of the most luxurious hotels on Bali - and that includes Ubud, Legian, and Seminyak as well as Nusa Dua.Also, I regret to say that money was taken from my wallet after being left in the room for a short period. Whoever took it decided to take some notes but leave one left, presumably so you assume you spent it, however I'd just been to an ATM so knew the exact amount in my wallet. Overall:Decent choice of place with a few minor problems. If it were about US$100-$115, (including tax) it would be worth it and I'd probably stay here again. Be ready for the hustle and bustle of Tuban.

<Content>Excellent Hotel I spent my honeymoon last year at the Discovery Kartika Plaza Hotel and it was a great experience..when we arrived we found a nice cake, champagne, rose petals all over our bed..service was great and we really enjoyed our stay..The best mall in bali is next door and the waterbom park is accross the street...lots of good resturants close by too..The hotel beach isnt that great, but it is one of the few beach front hotels in Kuta/Tuban..most hotels dont have their own beach and u need to cross the road to get to them.We are returning to bali next wek this time with our 4 month son..we will be staying at Discovery hotel again.The rate is a bit expensive compared to the other hotels in kuta, but the service you get there is good.

<Content>Stay for the breakfast and pool area My husband, daughter and I stayed this December 13-23 at the Kartika. It was an excellent hotel yet, we likely won't stay there again. I know that sounds contradictory but we like to try out different places. We only go back to the same place if it was exceptional value and although I can highly recommend the Kartika, it isn't exceptional value for Bali. It is exceptional value in comparison to what you get in other resort areas like Cancun or the Carribean Islands, but not for Bali. What we liked:1. The buffet breakfast in the AM was outstanding. Definitely 5 star quality. 2. The grounds and pool were beautiful, garden, huge pool with bridge and fountains. Very quiet and peaceful. Clean, cushie lounges, big towels.3.Great view from the room of both pool area and garden as well as the ocean. (we were on the 3rd floor closest to the ocean). Everything in our room worked. I liked having a fridge but most of the 3,4 and 5 star hotels have fridges. 4. Elegant lobby5. Superior treatment by the staff6. Location, Centro mall next door wiht post office and market for water, soda, beer, etc. Good restaurants, and airport.What was okay1. The room was clean and everything worked but it wasn't very spacious for a 5 star and there was no room to put your clothes away. Yes, there was a closet with a few shelves, but it wasn't great for the 3 of us for 10 days.2. The balcony was small.3. Furniture on the balcony not comfortable.4. It had coffee making (this means kettle, instant coffee, tea bags, whitener, sugar and mugs in all Bali hotels, no coffemakers) facilities but not a suitable area in the room for making tea/coffee.Just a note: Beach out front has too many rocks and shells for swimming BUT no big deal, just walk a ways down the beach and you are at a better part of the beach.

<Content>last visit - stayed there 20 odd times I rate this hotel as excellent - even though I have read all the reviews including the bad ones and have experienced all the best and worst of things commented upon in this hotel. I have an advantage, I live in Indonesia - I get the Indonesian rate because I have a Kitap - but I will not let this influence what I have to say. I have lived in 4 countries and been to 52 staying in hotels most of the time on business and pleasure.I like this particular hotel because it is natural and easy going. By this I mean you feel you can do what you want when you want. It has recently been refurbished which has put the price of rooms up, which I'm not suire was worth it- except for the third floor where some of the roof leaked!.To stay in a hotel in Indonesia you have to be prepaired. Nothing is straightforward and you have to ask for most things in 2 to 3 ways to be understood. This is not through ignorance - it is a way of life and culture that is not western, then again not really asian either - just call it Indonesian!!!!! It is like this all over the country although it is getting better. I'm not sure if this is good or bad.Once you have and understanding with the staff the hotel is fantastic. Indonesians will do almost anything to help you, even though at first it may seem to you that they are going out of their way to annoy you - not true! Bear in mind too that the staff get paid per month about 50% of what 1 NIGHT costs you to stay there. (True in any hotel again).Most of them send most of that back to their families. This does not mean that you should over tip though - infact service is included at 11% (gov. tax 21%). IF you understand what I am talking about and I know it is not very clear, this is the hotel for you. You just have to learn to deal with a different lifestyle and priorities - this is esential, but it IS also what travelling is about. In Indonesia be cool, be patient don't get riled - it can make things worse. The people really do have your best interests at heart.The foods good. The pools good, the bars good, the nightclub is good the shopping is good the tours are good and just doing nothing is great!.The rooms are usually very good too - get a bad one ask for another, c'est la vie. Want a room with a bath - you have to ask, want a room with a double bed you have to ask want a smoking room you have to ask want 2 keys for the room you have to ask, want a safe key you have to ask.I think you get the picture - basically, don't ask, don't get! This is very true of most places in this country.Yet - again next time I go to Bali, this is where I will stay - it's the best out of about 15 I have stayed in.

<Content>Mixed impressions we had to stay in another hotel the first night as they overbooked.They picked us up the next day and offered a seaview room for the night as they didnt have the room that we asked for. We declined as we didnt want to move again. The room we got was a twin bed and we asked for a double. They put the beds together and was a bit uncomfortable waking up on the join.The bathroom is very tired and needs a good scrub. Our toilet cistern kept sticking. The room we were in you can here the toilets flushing all night.The breakfast was good and they make a good ommelette.Staff are friendly but the men seem a bit layed back sometimes.My friend had a daughter who was getting married there and they did'nt know anything about it. So she had to organise it within a week.Overall we had a good holiday but I would try somewhere else next time.

<Content>Best Holiday Ever! Our family spent a fantastic 2 weeks at this hotel between 22nd July and 2nd August. We cannot praise the helpfulness and friendly attitude of every staff member we encountered too highly! Our daughter took ill with dehydration and stomach upset and the 1st class care that was provided by the hotel nurse and doctor was exemplary. Our room was spotlessly cleaned daily, although on our next trip I would probably upgrade to a larger room category.Spa facilities were fantastic and the beachfront massage huts sensational!We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel on any of our future trips to Bali and will highly recommend it to our family and friends.

<Content>Bad choice We stayed in Bali for 6 days, with the last 3 days at Discovery Kartika. Our first impression were disappointing - the room we were given was in bad need of repairs, balcony doors could not close fully, the knobs to control the tv volume on the bedside table was falling off, the short power failures were frequent - and because of that the air-con kept shutting off. Finally the air-con broke down. At 12 midnight, we called the front desk continuously for 15 minutes - but there was no answer, finally we had to go downstairs to complain. We were told to wait for the technician to come into the room to take a look at the air-con. The technician came after a few minutes and verified what we told the front desk about the air-con. Finally we were given a room at 1am - but the short power failures were still occuring and the air-con shutting off now and then. The night before we left - the toilet broke...and we were just glad that we were checking out the next day.The room was definitely not worth what we paid for. It was a good thing that the people, the culture and the atmosphere of Bali made up the good part of our holiday.

<Content>Very good hotel We stayed 3 nights at the Discovery Kartika Plaza. It was recommended by an Indonesian colleague as one of the best Indonesian 5-stars (as opposed to multinational chain 5-stars). We completely agree. Location is great for those who like to be near the action (the city with its shops and restaurants) rather than a secluded resort. Just 10 minutes from the airport, right on the beach, with nice landscaping and a huge new shopping mall right next door (although it did not disturb hotel guests in any way, since the hotel is set back from the main road). Our room was large and had all the facilities, large bathroom, fridge, tea-coffee making supplies and free bottled water (but you must ask for it). The pool was well-designed with a pool bar and the included breakfast was excellent with a wide variety of choices for the health nuts as well as everybody else (and we had all kinds in our group). As everywhere in Indonesia, staff are very friendly and courteous. The hotel management went out of their way to move us promptly when the a/c in our room died on the last day. We recommend this hotel highly, alhtough it was pricey ($113 per nght off seaon) compared to several other 5-stars that could be obtained on the internet for $60-80 per night at Kuta and Sanur. One cautionary note when travelling in Indonesia: All merchants refuse to accept US$100 bills/notes that were printed in 1996. So check your wallet before going and don't accept the 1996 series bills.

<Content>dissapointed I have been to Bali 6 times now and I have allways stayed at the Nikko Bali,so I wanted a change this time.I was travelling with my wife and my daughter aged 7 months.Sorry to say I was dissapointed.The rooms were ok but in need of a renovation specially the bathroom.There is no beach just a small road between the pool and the sea with sand on it.The pool is ok but if anyone needs shade because of small children then forget it there is about 20 sun shades for all the guests which is far from enough.A good friend of ours -a young indonesian girl aged 21 came to visit us at the hotel and when she left got held up at the security and they hit her she needed medical care afterwards.I complained to the general manager and I must admit he reacted and fired this guy.I booked for 5 days but checked out after 3 days with sorry to say no regrets.Dave -Switzerland

<Content>Outstanding Hotel I spent four nights (March 10-14, 2005) at the Discovery Katika Plaza and I can highly recommend it. It is situated on the beach, surrounded by several acres of gardens. Although right in the heart of Kuta Beach's commercial district, it is isolated from the road and has the feeling of being on an uninhabited island. I enjoyed the fact of the quiet and beauty of the hotel's grounds, yet being able to quickly walk to restaurants, shops, etc. My room was large and well-appointed, but I would not consider it luxurious, although no amenity was lacking and I was very comfortable. Best of all, I had a memorable view of the beach. The pool was beautiful and very large. The included breakfast was up to high-class international standards. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I would return in a minute. You can't go wrong with this hotel and at the price I paid, I considered it a bargain.

<Content>Fabulous time @ Kartika Kartika Plaza was a fabulous hotel. Fantastic food and one of the best pools I've ever seen...it resembles a lagoon. Rooms are slightly 'above average', but everything else makes up for it. It's situated on a wonderful, quiet portion of Kuta Beach. Far away from the 'touristy' section. The beachfront sushi bar is an absolute must, as we ate there at least once a day. Your privacy is respected well by the staff. If you order room service, they won't even knock on your door ff the DND tag is on the doorknob. They call and ask if it's ok to bring it by. Good to know if you are wary of keeping anything remotely valuable in the room...as leaving the DND tag on the door is a fairly safe bet. If I went back to Bali, I would definately stay there again without even looking around at other hotels.
