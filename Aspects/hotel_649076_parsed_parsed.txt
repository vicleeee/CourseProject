<Content>Good price for a 5 star hotel with average service You can see when you arrive at their lobby that its a new hotel with contemporary decoration. Reception staff doesnt smile at all and not friendly. Tried to call from the room once and a guy answered in sleepy voice. They just provide one key in each room. We asked for an extra key for our convenience since we had two suites but the reception guy told me that they only provide one and answered me that we will just open the door for you if you need an extra key.?!? When we insisted, they said we need to pay 50 dollars in case we lost it. For a five star hotel, at least provide two keys and this should not be an issue.The room is good, clean with two queen beds. Big enough compared to other hotels. Housekeeping staff are nice and they make up the room very well. The only problem is that the water drains very slow in the bath tub. Location wise, its very far from the central major shopping malls. There is one small mall- city walk next to the hotel but not all the shops are open. The hotel is also near a market and 5 mins walk to West Rail (KCR). They do provide a shuttle bus on certain times but you have to pay 15 dollars. I think they should provide this for free as their location is not too convenient at all. We called for the luggage down when we checked out but nobody came to collect our luggage.

<Content>5 star hotel look, 4 star hotel service and price booked my harbour view room for 5 nights thru booking.com, came out to be like $100 USD a night. The hotel itself construction is completed, but the business center and shopping mall part is not. The room is very big compare to typical HK hotel room. The bedroom is kind of strange: yeah the glass wall looks nice, but not very practical when you try to sleep and your wife and kids want to take a bath and keep the light on. watch out for the shower because the drain is not designed to drain quick enough if you turn the shower on full blast. a safe, a fridge, a coffee pot is provided free of charge, and there's international plug (not a transformer though) available right below the plasma TV, but the provided hairdryer uses that plug too--another thing to keep you awake when they are done taking a bath. Service has been prompt when I needed them to open doors for me. One thing that I would like to see improvement on is internet access. they charged $30 HKD an hour or $120 HKD a day if you want to use the ethernet port in your room. If you want free internet, you must use their 8 computers setup for you at the lobby. But there's always couple of kids down there playing internet games and hogging up all the computers. They should have restricted access to computer to 1 person per room or setup a free wifi access point at the lobby so people can get some work done. transportation is very good: the back side of the building is 2 bus terminal, and a 5 mins walk get you to the tsuen wan west MTR station. several bridges still under contruction will take you directly to the shopping mall across the street. Overall a very good experience, will likely stay with them again next time!

<Content>very new hotel,but service so so We stayed at this hotel for one nite.The corner room is much bigger and facility better.So if possible,choose corner room.All the hotel sparkling new.Though I am disappointed that there is no buffet breakfast(we reserved thru travel agent,I didn't notice there is no breakfast).The sea view is great from our corner room. Service is terrible.You can hear impatient voice from the front desk staff especially toward yellow faced guests.This made us very unpleasant.They don't show their respect toward tourists from taiwan ,china,etc.If this happens in third world country,I can understand.But it's in HONG KONG,such attitude is totally not acceptable.

<Content>Great value 5 star hotel in Hong Kong for $100 per night! I could not find anything slightly comparable for families for under $220 per night. There were 2 queen size beds in the room and a lovely bathroom. Nice view over the harbour and not too costly from the airport.Sure it is at the end of a line but you travel everywhere by train anyway. If you go on the Tsen West line to Hong kong it is a quick trip.We found the shopping in Tsen Wan to be more interesting the down town.We loved Disneyland.

<Content>Second Stay This is my second stay at the hotel following a good experience in May 2007. The hotel's facilities still are not opened yet, like the business center and the pool area. They did add a few more computers down in the lobby that provide free internet but they were pratically always occupied. I've had to wait for a turn quite a few times. Staff was pretty courteous and helpful. This year they changed the policy to one key card per guest room which strikes me as a pretty odd policy. When we requested an additional card key in Chinese they replied that they couldn't but the person can just come to the front desk and be let into the room. This seems kind of dangerous as not every person is registered under the room and our friend easily got into the room w/o her name even mentioned. However, I called down and requested another room key in English and all of a sudden the policy was banished. Overall, the staff was pretty good and so was housekeeping.Our room this year was a bit smaller than last year, they offered us an upgrade but it only had one king so we could not accept. The bathroom had a 'wet dog' smell but didn't spend much time in there so it didn't bother me too much. There is a fee for in room internet but you can just go to the lobby if you really need to get online. The new Citywalk mall opened up but it has a limited amount of stores open at this point. the West Rail  bus depot are minutes away and the MTR station is about a 10 minute walk depending on how fast/slow you're walking. Plenty of food options, Jusco (dept store), ParknShop (grocery), and launry places. This year they did not offer the free buffet breakfast like they did last year but I wasn't too broken up about it. The shopping area in the hotel has not opened yet either. All in all, great place but will probably be much better once everything is opened.

<Content>Great hotel a little out of the way Stayed 4 nights in October 2007 half term. Rooms were comfortable Harbour view fantastic but not 'THE HARBOUR'. We were on 32nd floor of 42 in the completed block. Food in restaurant pricey but excellent quality. Our room had more storage space than the childrens room. The downside were a little far from the action as a tourist but transportation good by metro (oyster card best value). A walk of about 5/10 minutes to the nearest one. The only other minor complaint I would have is that we had pre-booked breakfast prior to the trip then they tried to charge us a 2nd time. When you are a family of 5 that is not a cheap option. They did sort it out but it did take time. The staff were friendly,professional  spoke Good English. The free internet access was great in the reception area with several terminals. These were not hogged by other travellers.

<Content>Gorgeous View! Because they were still in the process of building the hotel, we got an excellent price for a room on one of the top floors with amazing view over the harbour. Despite the fact that they are still building the hotel, the building work did not bother us at all. The space in the room is very well thought out, everything looked modern and worked well. Our ownly problem with the hotel was that there was nowhere in the hotel to hang out and get a drink (although presumably this will change). The hotel is quite far from the centre of HK, but it is very easy and speedy to get where you want to go. All in all, a very pleasant stay in the type of hotel I could not normally afford!

<Content>Brand New Hotel, good value I stayed in this new hotel with my family for 1 night in January 2008 and we wish we had longer (we went to HK Disneyland hotel after this for the children鈥檚 treat). The pool was not ready it was a bit chilly for that anyway in January, but they gave us a magnificent harbour view room, the breakfast was excellent and the hotel check-in, check out process one of the fastest ever. The MTR is just next door to this hotel, there are good food markets around the area in the morning selling all types of fresh fruit, veges, etc and shopping centres, etc and the public fitness park next door is good to walk around and lots of swings and playground equipment for children. It is quite convenient if you want to be out of the hustle and bustle of the main city, but want easy access to it and would like a larger room. I would stay here again.

<Content>worth the money Lhotel is a new hotel at is still being built,so at the moment it is a very good price.The rooms are very nice and well thought out.Our toilet was leaking all over the floor and we reported it everyday,but it was still not fixed when we checked out.The staff at reception,bell boys,housekeeping and doorman are so helpful and happy.The same can not be said with the breakfast room,99% of the staff there never had a smile for guests.thier uniforms were often very dirty,if you finished one course they would lay your dirty knife and fork on your place mat,so what ever your second course was it would taste of the first,no what I expect for a 5 star resort.The asistant manger contacted me,the night before I was leaving to say how sorry he was about the staff and leaking toilet and offerd me a late check out free of charge,but i was leaving early.When I went to check out the next day I was told they were very sorry about the things that had gone wrong and I did not have to pay my internet bill,which was $150,which was a nice touch.The other staff in the hotel are very nice they must just sort out the breakfast room and its staff,as they really let the hotel down.The hotel os very easy to get to buy airport bus,or you can take a taxi and that costs $230 HK,for shopping it is also very easy,you just take thier underground subway system from just out side the hotel

<Content>Location IS Everything L'hotel Nina has nice big rooms, overlooking Victoria Harbour, but it is actually in New Territories, so it is a long way from Nathan Road and all the attractiions there. There are 13 Metro stops from Tsuen Wan (where the hotel is) to Tsim Tsa Shui, which is where lots of tourists start their holiday (The Space Museum, Star Ferry Pier, Nathan Road shopping, etc). Would I stay there again? No. The property is still under construction, there is no bar/lounge, the one coffee shop is not that terrific, and although you get a lot of bang for your buck, it is not worth the inconvenience of travel time. The hotel shuttle to the Penninsula Hotel (right in the heart of Tsim Tsa Shui) is 15 RMB apiece, and the hours of operation are not condusive to a late night out (last shuttle leaves from Kowloon back to the hotel at 7:30 pm). I ended up buying an octopus card @ 150 RMB, which I highly recommend. That allows you to go on the MTR, the ferries, and is very convenient. I used mine up in the 3 days I was at L'hotel Nina. I agree with another reviewer that the hotel caters to local Chinese clientele, and for foreigners who have a limited time and want to see a lot, this hotel is just too far out in the boonies to make it worthwhile. You can walk from the hotel to the metro, it takes about 10 minutes, and goes through a colorful local neighborhood with lots of food shops and markets. Or, you can take a taxi, which cost me 26 RMB, too much $, but I did this when I first arrived and did not know any better.Save yourselves a lot of hassle and book something in Central (near Victoria's Peak) or in the heart of Kowloon.

<Content>A bad experience I agree with the Location, location reviewer, this hotel gets a zero for location. It takes 45 to 90 minutes to most attractions and transfer or transfers between different forms of transportation are often necessary. I am familiar with the streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon, but it did not help. Other than a few small local shops and a wet meat and fish market, there is absolutely nothing around there.I booked my stay with a well-known travel website. Even after I produced a copy of the email confirmation of my booking, the hotel manager refused to honor the price quoted because We have no direct contract with that website. I ended up paying more for my stay.The hotel caters mainly to tour group from China and other Asian countries. I only saw Asian faces during my stay. The lobby is always crowded like a mad house. The buffet, the only functioning restaurant in the hotel, is simple and forgettable.The worst part was that my bathroom reeks with the smell of urine which lingers even after repeated cleaning by housekeeping. I moved out after two days. The hotel is new, the view is good and the price is reasonable, but this was truly a lesson of you get what you pay for!

<Content>Excellent for our needs! Stayed on previous HK trips in Kowloon (BP International), but this time wanted a different Hong Kong experience and booked L麓Hotel Nina for 7 nights despite the fact that the hotel is not ready yet. There is construction work going on in the other tower (e.g. swimming pool not ready yet) plus a building site next door, but this caused only minor disturbance. We liked the hotel very much:*rooms are huge in HK standards*bathroom design is unique*excellent housekeeping on floor 32*good buffet breakfast*free Internet in the lobby*next to Tsuen Wan and 10-minute walk to the MTR (Tsuen Wan)*one-way taxi to HK airport HKD 220 (130 per person for the shuttle bus)Took the MTR daily to central HK (25 mins) and felt very safe coming back to Tsuen Wan for the night. Tsuen Wan has a small town feel as many shops close 8-9 p.m. but this was just perfect for our needs. Had two different worlds on one trip, which made it much more interesting.

<Content>Location Location I had to be in Hong Kong twice over a three week period this past July. My booking was for a one night stay at the end of trip, to catch a flight out in the early am. I booked this hotel as it was extremely cheap by Hong Kong standards $55 USD. It for only one night and the proximity to the airport was a plus. I thought at the onset of my trip to HKG I should check this hotel out as there was only a couple of reviews thus far.......I'm glad I did. It took what seemed an eternity to get there by MTR. The station is immense(brand new) in Tsuen Wan. I then walked as the previous reviewer stated around 7-10 minutes before entering the lobby. Total time from start to finish was 40-45 minutes to reach Kowloon!!! There was NO signage to the main entrance of the hotel from the street???? I found it difficult to find. There is NOTHING around the hotel.......Just locally owned stores and a few small restaurants. The hotel was still in the midst of construction. I found the staffs level of english proficiency to be very poor! The pool and gym were both unavailable. If your booking strictly on the basis of price over anything else, I would say go for it. Otherwise, your best to think twice! The location is a MAJOR problem!!!!! It gets a 0 out of 10 for convienience. The hotel is clean  new but, that's about it. You can do alot better for not much more money elsewhere. Not too mention the location would be a huge improvement over this.......Its safe to assume I cancelled my booking and spent the extra and stayed at Langham Place. My third time there, highly recommend it. It's more expensive but, the location, facilities, service cannot be beat.

<Content>Great 5 star Hotel Stayed 8 nights at L'Hotel Nina et Convention Center located in Tsuen Wan from 19th Sept.,2007. Booked 3 city view rooms from Hotel.de website. Room cost HK$800 (about US$105) including buffet breakfast. We were given an upgrade to harbour view rooms. Requested and got non-smoking rooms even though we checked in around midnight.Very friendly check-in staff as were all other personell. Very good hot and cold buffet breakfast, includes both Western and Asian food. Large room size about 34 sq. metres with 2 queen beds in each room. Kids stay free on existing bedding. Most hotels in Hong Kong only allow one child in each room because of their small size. Entry way and bathroom has granite tile floor and bedroom has hardwood floors. Comfortable bedding and linen. Very large bathroom with tub. You can see into bathroom from bedroom as it is seperated by clear glass although you can draw a curtain for privacy. Seperate shower stall and seperate toilet covered by obscure glass enclosure within bathroom. Nice toiletries, although they only leave 2 bath towels in bathroom. Had to request extra towels almost everyday! It is very humid in Hong Kong and we like to shower at least twice a day. Fresh slippers provided everyday. In-room safe in some rooms only. Free internet available (about 10 computers) in very nice large lobby of hotel. Lots of security personell. Cameras in all elevators. Located in safe area. Beautiful children's park directly behind hotel. Great view from Harbour view rooms of Tsing Ma Bridge and park below, although city view rooms also have nice view. A little bit out of the way from Central District or Tsimshatsui but only 7 minute walk to subway. 25 minutes travel time by subway to Tsimshatsui (cost about HK$7) or Central (about HK$11) or travel by taxi to Tsimshatsui for no more than HK$100. New mall across the street will be ready in early 2008. Lots of convenience and drug stores very nearby. Because the hotel had a soft opening in early 2007, the only negative is the gym and swimming pool won't be ready until mid 2008.Overall, a very positive experience. I strongly recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>Excellent hotel, a little out of the way. We have just returned from this hotel, the room was fantastic. We had a sea view on the 34th floor. We booked the hotel with GT hotels they advertised the hotel as being on Hong Kong Island. We were initially a little disappointed in the location as the hotel is in New Kowloon ( bordering the new territories), the hotel is 30mins on the MTR to central station..... however the quality of the hotel more than made up for this. Breakfast was a little odd as with all hotels in China, however this was included in the room rate. There is still construction work going on as the second tower is not yet completed, we could not hear or see anything at all from our room. The airport is only half an hour from the hotel, taking a taxi to Tsing Yi ($28) and the MTR to the airport ($60 per person). Overall I would recommend the hotel but be prepared to use public transport to get around.
