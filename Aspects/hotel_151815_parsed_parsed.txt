<Content>Looking its age This supposedly 5-star hotel is long overdue for renovation. Its architecture and facilities are aging visibly. I had a double room with one queen-size bed (I liked the pillows). Internet comes at extra charge, which makes me wonder why bother with a 5-star hotel when you can get free internet at many hostels nowadays. Location-wise, it is close to a nice lake (within walking distance). But there aren't that many restaurants or bars in the near vicinity. I was there for a conference which was held in another tower and access was a pain because you had to go down to the first floor, walk over to another elevator and go up. They should really build a skybridge connecting the two towers. The Function Room which we rented was full of garbage when we arrived and the white covers of chair were quite dirty and the new ones we got were not that much whiter.I would not stay here for personal pleasure and unlikely to choose it for business meeting either given the price and the quality of the service we actually received.

<Content>Don't waste your money Stayed at the Melia for one night. I was ready to leave Ponce after an hour. City was dirty, lots of trash on the streets (and everywhere else people could dump it), lots of boarded up or abandoned stores and homes, lots of aggressive homeless. The rooms are dirty, tiny, and smelly.The only redeeming part of our stay was an evening spent at Mark's (the hotel restaurant) chatting with Mark and his wife Melody. An important note: The hotel put $780 worth of holds on our credit card for one night's stay...This put a serious damper on the rest of our stay, as we had no access to that money. Ridiculous.Overall, have a great dinner at Mark's, but skip the hotel.

<Content>I hope this review will be helpful to others I stayed at the Melia Ponce in July while attending the Caribe Gyn conference. I am not an MD but the company I work for was promoting a product to Ob-Gyn's attending the conference. I have to admit that I called American Express travel and, being told that the Ponce Hilton was sold out, promptly accepted their suggestion of a 鈥淢elia Ponce鈥?under the assumption that this property was affiliated with Spanish-based Hoteles Melia. This was my first mistake, because they bear no relation (it鈥檚 only after you get to the Melia Ponce that you鈥檙e constantly reminded of the hotel鈥檚 鈥減roud independent heritage鈥?. The second mistake was not trying to get into a different hotel upon discovering the first mistake (and besides, the hotel's 5-day cancellation policy was probably designed with that in mind). And what a bad hotel this was鈥?I suggest not allowing yourself to be fooled by those who describe it as 鈥渢raditional鈥? 鈥渞omantic鈥? 鈥渃ozy鈥? 鈥渇amily-owned鈥? etc. This is really a glorified two-star motel -- sans the heart-shaped jacuzzi. Built in the early 20th century, the building does show its age at every step: old doors, filthy carpets, dusty and smelly linen, signs of poor maintenance everywhere. To be fair: the walls are made of concrete, if that is any consolation. The room reeks of cheap disinfectant and air freshener, and the wall-mounted A/C unit produces significant noise, but not nearly enough to suppress the techno-electronic music piped in from the 鈥減laza鈥?in front of the hotel. The 鈥渇ree breakfast鈥?was a joke: bad food served in orange plastic trays and flies everywhere in the sun-drenched 鈥渞omantic rooftop鈥? Coffee was served from pots that I saw abandoned on the floor the night before. This is a cheap motel in every sense, except in the daily rate (+/- USD 110/night). In summary: avoid it like the plague, unless you really want a more 鈥渢ypical鈥?or 鈥渁dventurous鈥?stay in Ponce (I can鈥檛 comment on the city because I did not have a chance to visit). P.S. The hotel leases ground floor space to a restaurant called 鈥淢ark鈥檚鈥? The areas surrounding the hotel do not make you too excited about going out for dinner, so I decided to take my chances 鈥渋n house鈥? Surprisingly, I had an excellent dinner at Mark鈥檚. Its US-owners have created a great place, with awesome food and good service. In the end, leaving the restaurant and heading back to my room at the Melia only made it seem more depressing than it should be, and I was lucky to spend only one night at this poor place.

<Content>Excellent place! This hotel is just nice and is very well located and very close to everything. The only thing that I didn't like about this place was the bathroom. They don't have AC and the are really hot. The rest is nice!I recommend this place!

<Content>Older hotel with average amenities Based on prior reviews, I was a little skeptical of this hotel, but my husband had stayed here several years ago and had a positive experience. I have to say that overall, I was okay with the choice, but if left to my own devices I probably would not have picked the Melia. This is an OLD building with a good location right in the center of Ponce and across the street from a nice park. It is nowhere near the water and the entrance to the hotel is more than a little confusing, as is the parking. The amenities were minimal, continental breakfast very basic. If you are used to the US 5* rating system, you will probably give this hotel a 2*, but for the area it is better than most. Not super clean, but no bugs or anything that you would notice if you aren't super picky like I am. The bathroom was tiny with old fixtures and limited hot water. I would not recommend for a young crowd however as this hotel appeals to a quiet, seemingly older crowd . The elevator is extremely small also. The pool area looked nice, but we didn't use it as it was pouring rain the entire time. There was a basic continental breakfast on the rooftop that would have been very nice if it had not been raining. Staff at the front desk were helpful but they recommended a few restaurants within walking distance that were closed (We didn't know that lots of places are closed on Mondays). After we walked to both of them and realized they were closed we also realized that we probably shouldn't be walking the streets at night. Lots of local loitering going on and there is an increase in crime in Ponce over the past several years. Overall I would say this would compare to a 2* hotel in the states.

<Content>Yuck!!! And no historic feel/charm will convince me otherwise. We stayed at Melia Ponce for one night on Christmas 07 and had a room overlooking Plaza del Delicias. Overall our experience was negative, but mostly because we were caught off guard as we did not realize such properties exist in the US Commonwealth (any one-star american motel will beat this property when it comes to cleanliness). Cons: unreasonably high rates considering the property's caliber - we paid $140 i believe for the Superior room, the hotel is smelly and unkempt (pubic hairs on the white bed blanket, and the room overall was phenomenally dirty - and i was hoping if we order the most expensive room we'll avoid the perills other travellers were describing on this site) Pros: located on the main plaza, not that great distances are an issue in this city, it's fairly small and all the attractions are within 5-15 min walk.Overall, in the hindsight, having travelled in Europe, i would bypass Ponce all together due to it being way too rundown for my tastes or possibly avoid staying there overnight - the city's colonial architecture, art museum and Parca de Bombas are nice to see, but i did not feel they warrant spending the night in what seems to be a city with no decent hotels.

<Content>Nice Hotel My husband and I stayed here for one night in a room on the second floor. Room was decent sized, with a King sized bed. The hotel is beautiful, and the pool looked nice, though we didn't end up using it.The complimentary continental breakfast was lacking. It runs from 7:30-10:00 and we arrived around 9 to find no milk and very little orange juice left. The only whole fruit they had out was hot from being placed in the sun. They provided donuts and some sort of pastries with jelly, neither of which were very tasty. We left rather hungry (and thirsty).

<Content>Friendly staff; room good for one night We stayed in Ponce for one night. We wanted to do two things: visit the museum and visit Caja de los Muertos (the island.) Well, the museum was closed for renovations and the island ferry needed reservations, the phone number for which I could never find until we checked into the hotel (the room conveniently had the numbers for several activities and things to do.) So what then? La playa de Ponce was okay. Not really the most beautiful beach I had read about. It's definitely not much of a swimming beach. But back to the hotel. It faces the plaza, but the entrance is located on the little side street. We knew this, so we didn't have any trouble. But if you don't know, it might be a bit confusing.We stayed one night and we arrived a little earlier than regular check-in; the gentleman at check-in was cordial and friendly. He got us into a room, no problem, even though our room was not ready yet. I was a little put off though, when he couldn't find our reservation at first. Apparently, I mispronounced our name, so he was polite enough to correct it for me!! We have a Spanish family name (my hubby is Mexican) so naturally I pronounce it with a Mexican dialect. I guess it's true what they say about Ponce帽os--they think very highly of themselves. But he was nice, nonetheless. Just a tip to him: never correct someone when they are pronouncing their own name. You are the one who is wrong.The room was pretty clean and the shower was HOT. We had come from a not-so-clean place, so it was pretty refreshing. The hotel is just across from La Plaza de las Delicias and within convenient walking distance to see the area. The parking lot is down the street a bit, so keep this in mind. We knew it ahead of time and just unloaded at the door before we parked. We went dancing at the Hilton Ponce Golf  Casino Resort and had no problem getting our car back into the locked lot when we got in that night/early morning. The lot attendant was in the lobby, so we had to ask him to unlock the gate. There is a little business center with internet, which was convenient since our laptop battery died. We used it to figure out our itinerary for the remainder of the week.The next day, the gentleman at the front desk was very helpful with giving us directions and making suggestions. When we went for breakfast on the roof, I was impressed by the attendant who kept the area very clean and well-stocked. The food left a little to be desired, but I'm sure that's not his fault. There were mostly sugary cereals, breads, and sugary pastries. There were bananas, but no other fruit. I bet they could offer healthier items for the same budget if they just tried. Maybe some oatmeal? All in all, this was a good little hotel. I wouldn't want to stay in Ponce for more than a couple of days, but when we go back (after the museum is done with their renovations) we will probably stay here again.

<Content>Nice historic place We stayed here for 2 nights in May 2008. The hotel is very conveniently located to the main plaza (just 1/2 block away), and you can see the Parque de Bombas from the roof. It's a bit tough to find while driving with the one-way streets (and our GPS had a couple of them as 2-way which made for some fun), but once you have that figured out it's easy. Parking is right next door at $3 a day.The hotel rooms are nice; you can tell it's an older hotel (as things are rather small), given that though it was fine. The balcony views are excellent, and our air conditioner worked well. The staff were very friendly and welcoming, and the lobby is very nice looking. The pool is also very nice, especially after a long day, though it's a bit small.The only downside I'd mention is the breakfast. It's really no more than what you'd get at a run-of-the-mill cheap chain hotel in the US; I expected at least fresh fruit or something. Other than that, we were very happy.

<Content>YUCK - hotel and Ponce Once we found the hotel, the staff was friendly and helpful. The lobby was nice and gave a historic feel to the hotel. The good ends there... The room was small and cramped. The bathroom needed a serious overhaul or at least a really good scrubbing. The 鈥渁ir conditioning鈥?was controlled with just the speed of the fan 鈥?not the actual temperature. So, we messed with it all night long as we were hot then cold then hot. The bed did not have a fitted sheet and the flat sheet wasn鈥檛 positioned correctly so we struggled with trying not to sleep on the bare mattress. We thought the city of Ponce was going to be a neat place to stroll while viewing historic buildings. We felt scared at night and the daytime wasn鈥檛 much better in some parts of the city. Our next visit to Puerto Rico will be without Ponce. It was hot and dirty and unsafe.

<Content>Friendly staff, fairly comfortable stay We stayed at this hotel 1 night and found it to be fairly comfortable. The bed was a little hard and the room a little small but we weren't in Ponce to hang out in the hotel room. The breakfast wasn't great but the rooftop where they serve it was very enjoyable!

<Content>Great views of the square My family spent a couple of nights at the Melia in October, our second stay there, and it was lovely. If possible, ask for one of the rooms that overlooks the Plaza Las Delicias. We had 2 rooms with balconies overlooking the beautiful fountain, the cathedrals and the hillsides around town. The restaurant, Mark's, is also highly recommended with some of the best food on the island. The hotel is a little worn in places and the breakfast was not much to be desired, but otherwise a great place to stay.

<Content>Rooms need a thorough cleaning The hotel restaurant, Mark's, is expensive but fantastic. The hotel staff is very helpful and the location is ideal. We stayed in two different rooms over a long weekend, and my only complaint had to do with the cleanliness of the rooms - the carpets and bathroom floors were dirty, and I suspect that the air conditioner filters had not been cleaned in some time because our noses always ran when we were in the rooms. Whenever our two year old dropped a toy that rolled under the beds, it was pretty scary trying to retrieve it. We also didn't want to be anywhere near the toilets in bare feet. New carpeting and better vacuuming and bathroom mopping by housekeeping would have made for a completely different experience.

<Content>Old World Charm An old spanish hotel with a lot of charm. The rooms were small, but very comfortable, with hairdryers, ironing boards, shampoos, etc. The rooftop continental breakfast was quite nice, and overlooks the hillside of Ponce. The staff at this hotel was very impressive, especially the front desk. They were VERY helpful and up to date on the local information. The restaurant there is a bit pricey and I did not eat there. Downtown Ponce virtually shuts down at 8 pm during the week, and wound up eating at Churches Chicken. I was there for two nights, but one would have been more than enough.

<Content>Old Just like everyone else is saying-it's an old hotel. Tiny rooms, old windows, old decor, but clean. Really nice lobby, but I wasn't comfortable using the elevator-can barely fit two people. The new pool is a nice add on, but they should start updating their rooms. We only stayed there for one night-don't think we could do much longer is such a small room! Plus, the nightlife is next to none, police are everywhere and alot of boarded up buildings, makes me wonder how safe it is?

<Content>What a Nice Hotel We're staying here and are very impressed. The hotel itself is very charming with its old Spanish style. There's a nicely sized pool, rooftop terrace with continental breakfast. and free internet. Location is great right by the central plaza. Parking is available for $3/day just down the street. Definitely a find.

<Content>Nice stay, great location Good hotel, has quite a bit of character, is in the best location in town - totally met the expectations.Good quality rooms, showers, etc. Nice restaurant on premises. Very good value for money. Reception desk is very responsive and goes above and beyond in finding information you need. Minor downside is that the parking is in the back, and you have to drag your luggage pretty far back to the entrance - and since you have to turn in the key to the parking attendant, leaving much stuff in the vehicle is not an option. They do not have the porters, so we were a little stuck with our many bags - but the manager was nice enough to help us get our bags in. Overall, good experience. We stayed for just one night, and would stay again if we are back to ponce.

<Content>thumbs up Ponce rocks and Melia is incredible. If you like small, old fashioned places with Spanish revival style architecture stay here. sure there is a little peeling paint, but that's all part of the charm. the rooms are spacious with very high ceilings, most with small balconies. the prices are more than reasonable. you get free, unlimited internet usage, a pool, free continental breakfast, and you are right there on the plaza next to the Parque de Bombas and the Cathedral. it was a highlight of our trip.

<Content>A very European feel.... My husband and I spent 1 night at the very quaint Melia Hotel in Ponce. The location was great since it is right on the square. Upon walking into the lobby the ambiance is such that you feel like you are somewhere in Europe. The staff were very friendly and for a historic hotel you can tell the grounds and the building are very well maintained. Parking at the hotel is very convenient as there is a large parking lot next to the hotel and the cost is only $3.00 a day. Our room was small but very clean and very cozy. A continental breakfast is included with your stay. It is located on the 4th floor and is very simple but nice. If you want a good place to go to for breakfast, have the hotel direct you to the Gladiola Cafe. It is wonderful. We did not find out about it until later in the afternoon, but had we known we definitely would have went there for breakfast. We did have some wonderful flan and ice cream there and the ambiance is great. Walking around the square is so nice, many little shops and the Parque De Bombas is a must see. If traveling to the Ponce area the Hotel Melia definitely gets our vote....

<Content>Melia - a bit dusty, but charming and friendly After driving through the outskirts of Ponce, I was really glad to arrive at Melia - as others have noted, the location can't be beat and you can leave the car in the hotel's parking lot while you explore the city. (Not that the outskirts are bad - just filled with American chain stores and restaurants, which I can see anywhere in the U.S., thank you.) If you arrive on a Monday night, as we did, give things a chance - the city was quite deserted and it was tough to find a restaurant that was open. I thought What the heck was I doing, booking a hotel for two nights here? The next morning, though, the city square was filled with school groups, vendors, and people hanging out in the park, and much more vibrant. Be sure to walk around and see the different styles of architecture! And be sure to buy your Alto Grande coffee here as opposed to San Juan ($9.59 vs. $14).Melia itself is quite charming - the Moorish-style tiles and stucco made me think of the Mediterranean coast - but a bit dated. Don't expect the amenities of a larger hotel chain, like an in-room mini fridge, a writing desk, or room service. There IS a business center for guests, though, with internet/fax capabilities. Breakfast was almost exactly the same fare as a Comfort Inn or Holiday Inn Express - cold cereal, toast, pastries, coffee, juice. (Don't expect hot water for tea or skimmed milk....when in Rome....) On our second day, there was no breakfast at all; I don't know what was up with that! But there are cafes around the square where you can get breakfast. Melia's breakfast is no longer served on the roof, but poolside. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant (Mark's) so I can't speak to that.I'd like to go back to Ponce in a few years and see what more has been done to rehab the city and its buildings. At first I thought the city looked a bit bedraggled, but then I came to prefer it over the overrated San Juan. The mountain setting is beautiful, and the people are friendly. We would definitely stay at the Melia, too.

<Content>Great Location The hotel is right in the centre, opposite the Parque de Bombas and the park. The location could not be better. The hotel itself is fine, with large rooms and good bathrooms. Unfortunately the breakfast buffet on the rooftop was located on the terrace during our stay, as the rooftop was being renovated. The breakfast itself is abysmal and to add insult to injury someone had left a box marked tips on the buffet! I'm not sure who the tips were supposed to be for as there was no member of staff in sight on the one day we breakfasted there. There are a couple of decent cafes within 5 minutes walking distance where you can get a cooked breakfast for under $5 for 2 people. Apart from this we had no complaints. We only stayed 3 nights and ate at Mark's at the Melia once. The food was good though not cheap. All in all I would recommend the Melia as a good place to stay for sightseeing in Ponce.

<Content>a little oasis This is a great little hotel in Ponce, PR! The staff was grateous and courteous and knew all the regular touristy things (Where is a good restaurant) as well as being able to help set up my computer for the WIFI network (A Free of Charge Extra that is quite nice). The continental breakfast is nothing to brag about, but the pool in the couryard is GREAT especially after a long day of touring. The room was smaller, but not cramped. It was an older style, but not bad. We were inside the courtyard, which cut down on street noises (good for light sleepers) and up on the 2nd floor. If I was to do it again, I'd try to get the fourth floor (minimize traffic noises  be closer to the breakfast). But in all reality, this is a nice hotel although a little older in it's fashion.

<Content>So glad we picked Melia over the others We stayed at the Hotel Melia while on a driving tour of Puerto Rico. It was definately a treat to come around the corner and see we picked a great option.My boyfriend and I stayed in one of the original rooms in the Hotel which was wonderful - definately the best hotel we had stayed in yet on the trip. Bathroom was small but efficient.Our friends were in the newest portion of the hotel and that fit their lifestyle perfcetly (I thought the room looked a little like the inside of a Holiday Inn).The pool was wonderful - great little cubby tables tucked in throughout the hotel to talk or play cards. We had an AMAZING dinner at Mark's at Melia. I think everyone fell in love with the chef at the first bite!

<Content>Decent considering it's in a small town Hotel staff were great. Hotel clearly spent most of their money on an impressive lobby. The rest of the hotel is pretty dated, especially the rooms themselves. I liked the outdoor corridors that lead to the rooms. They have a nice feel. But the rooms themselves felt a bit old... sorta dirty, even if technically clean, if ya know what I mean. The included breakfast is really nothing to speak of. A few dried cereals to choose from with milk, coffee, something tasting like imitation orange juice, and some assorted pastry... nothing of any quality. They also offer some doughy sliced bread (think Wonder Bread) for toasting in the toaster. Overall, the breakfast was rather depressing as they really didn't seem to care to put any effort into it.The hotel restaurant, Mark's, was pretty nice, again, considering this is a pretty small town. The food quality was very good.We didn't really look into other hotel options for Ponce, but I guess I'd say this place is ok.

<Content>Melia preferred in Ponce My wife and I spent two days at the Hotel Melia and enjoyed it very much. The staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. The location was perfect; less than a block from the Plaza, so everything was walkable.The complementary breakfast on the rooftop provides a good view and was an enjoyable way to start the day. Parking ($3/day) is next door. The room was adequate and suitable for the price.

<Content>Great location and front desk staff We enjoyed our stay at the Melia (Feb. 6) but unfortunately didn'tbook ahead so were unable to get one of the deluxe rooms.However, our room was comfortable and the staff very friendly--the manager was wonderful. Parking was a few steps down the street at $3.00 per night, and the main plaza a few steps in the otherdirection. The hotel's design is rather rambling and quirky, butpleasant. I would recommend skipping the included buffet breakfast on the upstairs terrace--cardboard cups, paper platesand very sugary pastries. We had dinner at the Argentine steakhouse a few blocks away. Lovely outdoor terrace with tango music, but bad food and service--would have been better off at the Melia's restaurant where we had coffee and dessert. We loved Ponce--but didn't allow enough time to see everything.

<Content>This hotel was okay This hotel was just okay. Although our room was clean and a good size, it had a faint odour of cigarette smoke, which as a non-smoker, I found unpleasant. The hotel definitely had character of a byegone era and was pleasant enough, although the rooms seemed a little past their prime. The location of the hotel is excellent and is close to the main square. Also if you're driving, the $3 per day secured parking (with in and out privileges) next to the hotel is useful. The breakfast was minimal and I found it disappointing.

<Content>Hotel Melia, great location in Ponce This is a very nice old hotel located by the Parque de Bomberos. I can highly recommend it. It was clean and the room was nice. We had no problems here. Well, after we found it that is. Since it was the eve of Dia de los Tres Reyes, all the streets around the plaza were blocked and there was a concert at the Parque de Bomberos. After circling for a long time without being able to figure out how to get to the hotel, a motorcycle policeman escorted us up a one-way street to the hotel parking lot. There is a nice little pool and a very good breakfast on the penthouse level. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant. Ask them how to get to Cafe Tomas, a couple of blocks away. That was so good we kept going back there.

<Content>A Very Nice Stay This was my and my wife's first trip to Puerto Rico. I loved this hotel right in the middle of downtown Ponce. You have to remember, that this is not a big name brand hotel. We stayed at a few of those as well. However, this was my favorite.  The hotel sits directly across from the town square. You are right in the middle of the heart of the small friendly city. The hotel and the location are well matched. It is on a City block (this is a small friendly city - along the lines of Ithaca, New York.) A hot dog man resides outside the entrance. The Lobby is beautiful. It houses an upscale restaurant. Nice easy going sitting area - very quaint.   Hotel wireless works great. No charge. Breakfast on the roof of the hotel (enclosed) is OK - complimentary. Coffee was fine.  Staff was great. Genuinely friendly and concerned. I cannot say enough. Helpful and eager to accomodate. Rooms are old style - again- this is not a big name brand hotel. Air Con is either on or off. Big switch over bedboard. I would turn it off and on to regulate temperature. But when it is on, it is cold.  My room - (Deluxe) has a terrace that overlooks the square.This was a fantastic experience. Far more interesting than San Juan. Ponce is a great place to visit. Humming pedestrian mall in the street first thing in the morning (at night - a bit quiet) - museums nearby - $2 Trolly rides, and lots of bakeries. I will most certainly stay at the Melia again.

<Content>Great location, looking forward to renovation This lovely building is undergoing a renovation, and I wish I had known about the already renovated rooms. Mine was very small and quite worn. Things worked, but it really needed a thorough cleaning and much updating. The pool looked lovely, although I didn't get a chance to use it. The breakfast was pretty basic.The assets: the location and the staff. The desk staff couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. The location - right off the main plaza -- made walking the charming streets of the old town a pleasure.Mark's at the Melia is one of the best restaurants in Puerto Rico but was closed the 2 nights we were in Ponce. We did have lunch there the last day, which was wonderful. King's Cream has great ice cream; 3 other great restaurants: Rincon Argentina; Cafe Tomas; and Restaurant de Las Tias (that's not the exact name, but close).The Art Museum is outstanding (note: contrary to our guidebook listing, it was open on a Monday, but the cafe wasn't). Israel, our guide on the Ponce trolley/tram, is very funny; he's worth finding.The History Museum guide was as knowledgeable as any history professor I've encountered.Don't miss the carnival masks!!

<Content>Skip Ponce all together I stayed at the Hotel Melia at the end of November 2006. We had a room on the 3rd floor. The room was approx $105 + tax. It had air conditioning BUT it didn't seem to make a difference which setting you put it on because they were all the same. In the morning I was all stuffed up. Our room clearly needed renovations. The BIG closet smelled like moth balls and everything was worn.The only place to eat nearby was the hotel restaurant which was very good but pricey. Nice location in the square and there's a parking lot around the corner for $3 a day.

<Content>Very Friendly Hotel I stayed at the Melia this November and had a wonderful experience. Mr. Albors, the manager, is very eager to please and pleasant. The rest of the staff is also extremely accomodating. The Melia is located right in the center of downtown Ponce and is near everything there. I was there as a tour escort for a group of college students and they loved that they could find shopping and bars right by the hotel. They also loved the little pool that the hotel has.The rooms are pretty nice, but nothing overly special. I didn't have any complaints and none of my group members had problems either. However, the best part of the hotel has to be the convenience.

<Content>Great Hotel After reading the other reviews about this hotel we were a bit worried but decided to stay here, glad we did. This hotel has a great location for the price. It offers continential breakfast on their patio, has a great pool that is never very crowded plus free internet. We picked one of the renovated rooms facing the square which was clean and comfortable. This room was one of their higher priced ones but worth the extra and still a great bargain. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Waiting for the renovation In researching Ponce for upcoming art tours, I'd heard that the Melia Hotel was the only hotel to consider for our clientele. Given its central location, I decided to check it out. However, instead of the historic and charming hotel I had hoped to find, I was surprised to see such a tired and dated hotel. I was uncomfortable about the cleanliness of the rooms and the dated furnishings, and the stale odors and poor natural lighting in some rooms were definite liabilites. For those simply seeking a place to stay, but nothing more, this will certainly do. It is true that this hotel is preferred over others in Ponce (some which don't have windows in the guests rooms for example), however, I will have to wait for the renovation that will return the Melia to the glory it deserves.

<Content>A Historic Hotel We went to Ponce at the last minute and had heard about Hotel Melia as a quaint, historical hotel. We are always looking for interesting places to stay, so we decided to give it a try. The location is convenient since it is located on the Central Square and the ice cream parlor is definitely a highlight. Twenty-four hour security parking is available, so be sure to ask at check in. The hotel was in fact old and certainly gave us a view of Ponce during its more glamourous years. However, the rooms were disappointing. The furniture is old, which isn't bad since it is an old hotel, but there are stains on the cushions. I asked for my room to be changed when the bathroom floor did not appear to have been clean, and numerous hairs were found on the bed. The room I was changed to was not much better, but since we were only staying one night, we decided to settle in. This is truly unfortunate because the hotel has much potential but seriously needs some TLC and better housekeeping. On a more positive note the continental breakfast was quite good consisting of fresh pastries, juice, and coffee. The staff was also very accommodating and assisted us with many inquiries about the area.

<Content>Best place to stay but not to dine in The hotel Melia has rooms of many prices, but the best are the newer ones (of course the most expensive, but still reasonable) which have balconies facing the plaza with its Cathedral and fantastic old firehouse. The older balcony rooms are OK, but smaller. The least expensive rooms have windows at the 0utside corridor, so you only have a choice of privacy or daylight. Great location, friendy staff. But...the restaurant Marks at the Melia is way overrated and expensive; don't eat there. Best restaurant in town is the Rincon Argentino, about 3 blocks from the Plaza on Sol Street.

<Content>Need sleep? It's always nice to check into a hotel lobby where the ceiling is leaking. Kind of gives you a cue as to what to expect. This old beauty, needs major restoration to bring her back to her former glory. Our room was on the town square and we had a beautiful view of the castle and cross from the balcony. However, it was extremely noisy all night long, and we didn't get any sleep. The room also had junky furniture and the bathroom was dingy at best. The hotel's restaurant (Mark's) is excellent and is its saving grace.

<Content>Great Location We were four adults moving through from San Juan (after a cruise) to Cabo Rojo. Wanted some local flavour so booked the Melia prior to our trip. Read the reviews first and booked a superior room in the new section $105.(We had a look at some of the rooms in the old section, and it seemed to me that the rooms facing the street were quite large while those across the hall were rather small.)Everything about the place was pleasantly surprising, but especially the location right on the town square. We shopped explored and took the free trolley ride around this very interesting and dynamic city. Lots of renovation going on. We walked along the streets at night, even the quiet ones, and found a restaurant, recommended by the front desk, with many local regulars in attendance. Although our stay was short, it was enjoyable, rounded out by breakfast on the canopied rooftop cafe. We made a final tour around the city before heading on to Cabo Rojo.

<Content>Great budget accommodations in downtown Ponce Hotel Melia is a great value and is right in the middle of downtown Ponce. The hotel staff is very professional and friendly and helpful if you ask for suggestions/recommendations/directions. Like someone else said, the hotel looks like it was once very elegant and is now older and just holding up. It is not in bad shape but is just old. Overall I thought this place was decent. Included in the price of the room is a continental breakfast which is small, but I wouldn't expect much more for free. A couple cleanliness issues though: Two times, on different days, I found women's hairs in our bathroom towels, which is just gross. Also there was a small ant problem in the bathroom. Lastly, one night I was in the shower, and I saw something fall from the nozzle area, and I looked down to see an inch-long roach near my feet, trying desperately not to drown. Kinda gross. About the area: Ponce gets really dead at night. We had to really hunt to find good restaurants at night. We found an Argentinian restaurant not far from the hotel which was good. In downtown Ponce, the police are EVERYWHERE. It was crazy. Our Continental flight came in at 4:30am and we rented a car. A cop pulled us over as we drove through town, just to find out what we were doing on the streets. Well, we were looking for our hotel! He then told us to turn the car around and gave us an escort there, which was nice, but still, a bit daunting. Cool stuff to see in the area: Tibes archeological site, Camuy park, Arecibo radio telescope, caves near Arecibo, Cabo Rojo lighthouse (beautiful views, cliffs). To avoid, in my opinion: La Parguera bioluminescent bay- it's a scam! In the photos they make it look like it just glows and they take you on a boat ride and then 5-10 people (employees) jump off the boat and as they move their arms around in the water, you're supposed to ooh and ahh because the water is slightly blue. Ponce is a great place for all the rest though and I would definitely recommend it. People in the area are very friendly and welcoming. It is an affordable vacation spot.

<Content>It had character We stayed here for one night. The hotel was probably quite glamorous several decades ago, and we enjoyed all the charm and character. The rooms are old, however, and the bathrooms are tiny. The continental breakfast was pretty lackluster, but dinner at Marks at the Melia was wonderful (and expensive!). I swam in the little pool and the business center, though small, was great. We did not realize that the city center was going to feel so abandoned in the evenings -- everything closes up quick and there are some rundown and boarded up buildings, so walking around at night was not fun. We were glad we only stayed for one night.The service was very good and this will probably be a wonderful hotel again when the city center is more revitalized.

<Content>Better than expected My boyfriend and I are originally from Ponce, but this was our first time staying here--we are getting married back home and needed to take care of some stuff, so it was business, not pleasure. Hotel staff was very polite and helpful, although I wouldn't say all out friendly. The room was bigger than I expected--although a bit dusty--and the bed was truly comfortable, sheets were clean. My one hotel pet peeve is bathrooms. I know it's an old building and big bathrooms are a hassle to clean. At a quick glance, our bathroom seemed clean, but once you took a closer look it was just poorly tended. During our 3 night stay, the tub had hair and soap/dirt film (we always showered standing on a hand towel), the sink had traces of the previous guest's toothpaste and toiletries looked re-packaged. We did get clean towels and we should have probably requested that the bathroom be cleaned, but we were on a tight schedule and didn't stop to think about this.If you suffer from dust allergies, try to avoid this hotel. In addition to being an old building, it is also located in the heart of a traffic congested area--which otherwise, also makes it a great location tourist-wise.The reception is beautiful and the complimentary breakfast (local pastries, cereal, juice and coffee) at the rooftoop, overlooking the city, is a real treat. Because we suffer from allergies, and bathroom cleanliness is a big issue for me, I would consider other options before the Melia. But for its value, it's certainly the best choice.

<Content>Can't beat the location Right on the main square. Room was a bit cramped, which was not helped by the fact that the bathroom door swung into the bedroom towards the bed. Still, a decent value considering the location, charming old-world ambiance and free internet.

<Content>pleasant melia hotel on the square ponce is an old town about 75 miles and a 90 minute drive from san juan, with several tolls. it has many art nouveau and art deco buildings and homes, some of which are in the process of being restored. there is a lovely art museum with a small but excellent european collection, including a pre-raphealite room, and currently an excellent frida kahlo exhibit that travelled from moma in nyc, an excellent history museum and adjacent music museum in art nouveau style,etc--take the guided english, free tours. we stayed for two nights at the melia hotel on and off the plaza-family owned for a century, with the newer pre-(1960's added rooms) in better shape than some of the the other rooms. the double bedded rooms in the newer section which face the inner courtyard are the equivalent of a 2 star hotel-clean, basic, air conditioned decent sleepable beds, and a small bathroom. the staff and the front desk are very pleasant, friendly, and helpful. marks at the melia is a well-known 4 star restaurant on the island. the melia has a small pool which makes you fell like you are continents aw ay and not in a charming city. if modern is your desire, 4-5 miles out of the city and a 15 minute drive to the city, are the hilton or holiday inn which could be in anywhere usa.good traditional criollo and other food is in easy walking distance on isabel street-including don juan lunch buffet for $5, acafe topmpy for inepensive criollo fare, portos, a nautical design interio with pasta, a grill, and excellent pizza with a semi-baked mozarrella topping and shrimp (very large and good for 2 at $15), vegetables, etc, el rincon for argnetine/steak and other food, very large portions at $18-23 entrees, and fusion which we did not eat at but is on the order of el rincon in price. the wonderful chef's creation is 2 blocks from the square with lunchtime 3-course meals at $6, including a soda. a 30-45 minute drive on route 52/118 and turning left at the 3rd traffic light on 118 in guanica brings you to cana grande public beach-$3 entrance fee-- which is a nice crescent shaped beach which the copamarina beach resort shares at one end. the public beach has a small snack bar at which food can be purchased and chairs can be rented. if you want to also hike, the nearby guanica state reserve,semi-tropical, like aruba, 2nd traffic light on 118, and a several mile uphill drive, has several trails from short to long and is known for its bird life-but hiking in 90 degree weather is not for everyone.

<Content>A very reasonable place to stay in Ponce We stayed at Hotel Melia for one night in May 2005. At first, we have troubles finding the place, not the hotel but the central square where it is located. Once you are in the center of Ponce, the hotel is in the heart of it. I thought that hotel's location could not be better. It is located right in the main square of Ponce. They also had a limited number of free parking spots by the hotel, which was nice. You literally do not need a cat while you are in Ponce. In addition to hotel's great location, there is a free tourist train that departs from the old fire station right on the plaza. We thought it was a great, great tour to touristy places and neighborhoods of Ponce you would not go by yourself because you would not know about them.The hotel was clean and nice. They have the internet connection near the lobby on the first floor, which could be useful. There was a pool there as well. We had a very good experience there. We had no complains at all. I would definitely stay there again if I were in Ponce.The only problem we had is to find a place to eat. There is not much around -- it is a pretty small town, at least the historic part of it. So, we ended up eating at the same place several times. But this has nothing to do with the hotel -- just a heads up.

<Content>great location Hotel Melia is perfect for a first time visitor to Ponce who wants to visit the museums and historic sites. We rode the trolley around when we first got there and got a feel for the city. Most within walking distance of this hotel. We arrived early and they allowed us to check in, AND they upgraded us to one of the balcony rooms overlooking Plaza de delicias. The view from the room was great, except at night, as the street noises are audible even with the AC on high. Try to get a room farther from the street. The pool was very nice. The setting for breakfast on the roof was beautiful, even if the food was basically cereal, cake and bread. There is a secure parking lot adjacent to the hotel where we parked for just $3/day. All in all a good experience and we would stay here again.

<Content>Maj Oscar Palermo -- US Army I always stay at this hotel. I was borned in Ponce 40 years ago. The hotel management is great.This is the best hotel to stay since you can go out, buy your souveniers, then come back to your room without taking any transportation, secure your souveniers and go back to either visitng other places and/or continuing shopping.Everything is walking distance from this hotel, including Ponce best historic attractions.I recommend stay at the Melia. Price is fair.
