<Content>Nice place to spend your 50th We stayed at the ayodya for 9 nights recently in a Grande Ocean facing room I must say I was somewhat concerned after reading reports on the hotel on the web prior to going but all I can add now is our stay was fantastic...........the room was lovely.............the food (breakfast) was more than ample......the staff were very helpful.........and the weather sunny.We did have one issue one night re very noisey neighbours around 3am (drunk) they left the next day however someone must have said something because we got a letter of apology and free wine....not bad service at allThe entry and reception and grounds of the hotel are fantastic and for the price of the rooms I simply cannot understand what some people are wanting with their comments.We will be going back we cant say more than that

<Content>Great place at great beach! Probably the best deal at Nusa Dua! First of all, this is a great hotel at great rates! Great area as well! Definitely, 4 - 4 1/2 star experience. I would say - not 5 star due to few things that could be improved. In this review I will focus on negatives (cons). Too many positives to write here. Think of it as a great hotel where everything is great except next few things.Cons:Somewhat slow service, but that seems to be everywhere in Bali.Breakfast could definitely be better. It is sufficient, but not 5 star. It can be crowded at times.Hot water in the shower takes a while to start running. Drain was also partially clogged, but they fixed it immediately.Travel tours desk was dismal. Look elsewhere for meaningful tours.Don't buy souvenirs inside a hotel. Everything outside (right outside of Nusa Dua gated community) is much cheaper.Good luck!

<Content>Needs refurbishment We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. I had read many positive reviews of this hotel on this website, and was thus quite disappointed with the hotel. The hotel is the former Hilton, and it is probably a reason why Hilton sold it - it no longer lives up to the required standard.Positive:1. Outdoor area  common facilities are beautiful (although far to walk between buildings)2. Beach - nice with many beach chairs etc.3. Many different restaurants (but this means they are almost empty most of the time)4. Close to shops etc. (walking distance)Negative:1. Rooms - the rooms have not been refurbished for a long time and the standard is low - especially the bathrooms were very bad ( we stayed in the cheapest room). The door opener to the bathroom fell off.2. Frogs, ants and other insects in the room3. Aircon - the aircon didnt work properly and the room did not get cool at all4. Electricity - we lost all power in our room and we had to call the reception 4 (!) times before someone was sent to fix it5. Gym - closed due to refurbishment and the temporary gym was small without toilets etc.6. Price - Although the hotel was old and especially the bathroom badly needs refurbishment, they still charge quite a lot.After 4 days in this hotel we swapped to another Nusa Dua resort that had newly refurbished rooms and charged only USD 80 per night (Kinds Villa Bintang). I would rather recommend this last resort!

<Content>Lovely hotel, but long walking distance to the room... I stayed here with my wife for 7 nights during christmas last year. It is a very beutiful and exellent hotel with great rooms, restaurants, spa etc...but you really need to be fit to walk to your room because it is about a half kilometer from the reception to the rooms..

<Content>Needs a face lift The reviews we'd read about Ayodya just before our visit were apt. One person described it as a 'tired old dame' and I'd concur with that. To say it's 5* and formally a Hilton, it has been left and is now somewhat dated. We asked to upgrade our room on our first day, but actually, once we looked at the more expensive rooms, we decided to stay put. They weren't worth paying the extra cash for. As you'd expect, hotel drinks were expensive and the entertainment wasn't good. That said, the staff were very friendly and helpful.

<Content>A Joanna Lumley of a Hotel Just returned from 10 days at the Ayodya and the hotel fa莽ade and grounds are nothing if not impressive.But it鈥檚 a Joanna Lumley of a hotel, the exterior is undoubtedly beautiful with an incredible entrance past those glorious lakes and fountains, and even this is outdone by the beautiful lobby area, and the central lagoon where the herons dive for the fish you feed and the lizards swim alongside them. But this is where it stops. Like the beautiful Miss Lumley, nowadays gorgeous on the surface, but not sure I鈥檇 like her in the early morning sunshine.The rooms are shabby, poorly maintained and need a whole new make-over. Showers don鈥檛 work properly, (when there is water, only hot properly morning and evening and sometimes switched off) furniture is stained and old, and air con barely copes. (And we were upgraded to a 鈥渄eluxe鈥?room).In the bars expect VERY high prices, 26,000 rupees for a bottle of water that is 1,500 rupees in the supermarket, we ordered a coke, a beer and a bottle of water, and later that night ate out for four people three courses for the same price as the three drinks. No wonder the bars are empty after the first night. The restaurant food is OK-ish, but again ridiculously high prices not justified by an increase in quality. (Eat anywhere outside the south-gate Mai Mai particularly recommended)Breakfast was a joke, drop a croissant and add to the broken marble they were so hard, and how do you take ALL the taste out of a pineapple? Staff here, unlike the rest of the hotel, were surly and not very helpful. Still the daily omelette helps to bind up any cases of 鈥淏ali belly鈥?br/>Pool area is nice but take goggles, after ten minutes the massive chlorine will have your eyes streaming with tears for a couple of hours. Beach OK, but not safe for children to swim due to very nasty undercurrents with the waves and it gets deep quickly, OK for a strong swimmer but not much else. Don鈥檛 eat at the beach restaurant next to the hotel, hot and cold running salmonella. Don鈥檛 book any tours on the beach, crazy prices go into town and buy them for at least half the price.Nice try guys, but the hotel needs a complete refit to be given a 鈥渨ould go back鈥?and then reduce all the prices by 75% for food and drink and maybe.

<Content>A very pleasent stay We stayed in the Ayodya for 15 nights the whole set up was lovely apart from the rooms which could do with a refurb. Staff were great very willing to please. We decided to extend our stay for a further week but moved hotels because Nusa Dua isnt the most happening place in Bali

<Content>Pleasant staff but hotel showing its age One of the large hotels in Nusa Dua. The large foyer is the most impressive part of the hotel. The rooms were large but the fittings were starting to age. For example, the air conditioning was not really cold - a problem shared by the people we travelled with. The taps in the sink and shower were difficult to turn on and off.The pool is nice and large and you will make use of it as the beach is not pleasant and we were not able to swim in it. The food (especially the breakfast buffet) is average at best.One thing of note was that the majority of the hotel was catered for large tourist groups (especially from East Asia) - something very noticable at the breakfast buffet.Overall a pleasant experience but will be trying another hotel in another part of Bali (like Seminayk) next time.

<Content>Fantastic Resort! I had a great time at Ayodya Resort. The hotel/rooms/pools are all very clean and well cared for. Whether you will be traveling to Bali as a tourist or business travel, it has both conveniences.The good: large, bali-style resort, fantsastic service  restaurants, clean rooms, Upgrading your room is absolutely worth it, for 20$ per nigh extra.The bad: Far away from Kuta (where there are many bars, shops, restaurants etc.) In Nusa Dua there is almost nothing to do, except for the one boulevard Mall + 1 outside massage place.Overall, a fantastisch hotel that is absolutly worth 5 stars!Tip: rent a cab for a whole day and visit the non-tourist side of Bali, worth every penny!

<Content>Beautiful Grounds, Room dissapointing I stayed at the Ayodya last September for a confrence and I like some of the others that stayed here was very impressed with the lobby and the whole grounds of the property. The beach was very nice. The rooms however were very dissapointing, I would say the rooms qualify for 3 star at best. I'm not really one to spend alot of time in the room so it was okay. I did have a view out my balcony in just one of the standard rooms so that was nice. Overall I was pleased and the value is so good in Bali you can't really complain about the price. Breakfast was good too, internet was frustrating at times but I think this is common all over Bali.

<Content>Palace and Suites are great, resort rooms are below average We just came back from 6 nights in Bali. It was the last leg of our trip to SE Asia. When we first got to Ayodya, we were amazed at how beautiful the lobby, entrance, and landscaping was. The grounds really are spectacular and are very well maintained. We had booked a Deluxe Oceanview room. When we got the room, we were very disappointed. The room was quite rundown including the bathroom. There were 2 single beds when we had explicitly asked for a king/queen. There was no oceanview. We complained and the manager, Ms. Putri, told us that all the oceanview rooms are obstructed view because the hotel is shaped in a U form. Obstructed is not the word - this is a con - do not bother with oceanview - you cannot see the ocean at all. When we asked about the king bed, she simply had a staff member join the beds together and put a sheet on top. It was very frustrating. We asked to be upgraded to a Palace room but they didnt have any. After 2 more days of complaining, the moved us to a suite for a charge of US$15 per night. It was well worth it. The suite was really nice, marble floors, pool-side view, couch on the balcony. Really lovely. The overall service was average.The resort itself is quite good - nice pools, and spacious grounds. However, because the grounds are so massive, it does take a while to get to the beach area. Not a huge issue for us though. The breakfast was good - quite an extensive variety. The only thing was that on the last day, there was a lot of fruit flies around the carrot bowl and the staff did nothing about it. As for the beach, its okay. Bali is not white-sand beaches. There was no garbage but quite a bit of sharp coral that washed up onto the sands. The water was gorgeous though - we swam everyday. It was also easy enough to get sunbeds which was nice. The checkout was fine except they tried to charge us for consumption of the mini-bar when we hadn't. We actually noticed this scam in a couple of the other hotels in SE Asia. They dont check the mini bar carefully and then try and charge you for it at check out. The other thing to be wary of is that the hotel will always try and offer you their own transportation when you ask them to order you a taxi. You can negotiate with them but I prefer to use a metered taxi. Overall, if you are going to stay at the Palace or one of the Suites, then book Ayodya. If not, then its not worth it to stay there. On a side note, they are planning to renovate all the rooms - so maybe the standards will go up in a few years.

<Content>Luxurious but can be better Ayodya resort in Nusa Dua is a luxurious hotel which has a wonderful rustic ambience. I loved the settings which were very Baliesque and did not pretend to be post modern. The facilities were satisfactory but i guess one expects a lot from these high end resorts so it did not measure up to expectation. Language is a bit of a problem with the service staff. Rooms are quite spacious and the balcony is also well furnished for a nice sit out. The whole area is in a well secure zone which is comforting but if you want to shop you need to head out. The welcome music and drink was quite nice and brought in the holiday mood immediately. overall, nice resort and would recommend a stay surely.

<Content>Great holiday My fiancee and I stayed at this hotel just over a year ago now. We had10 days in the hotel and it was very relaxed and of high quality. There was not Brits at the hotel and we went out of season so it was lovely and quiet and the pool was never crowded. We had a lovely big airy room that was kept very clean.The staff were very helpful. The only very small thing was that the iinternet connection was quite expensive. Otherwise we had a llovely relaxing holiday, would definately recommend.

<Content>Impolite employee I had nice holidays at Ayodya Resort but my impression about the hotel was spoiled by one of the employee. When I just entered the hotel I was really impressed to see architecture of the lobby. Everything was fine till I came to the desk to check-in. Very unfriendly and impolite lady, she looks like from Eastern Europe, name Viktoria if I鈥檓 not mistaken, asked my second name and then she began to talk by mobile and went somewhere for long time. I was shocked to get such kind of service in 5 star hotel! Finally, after waiting more than 20 minutes I asked another receptionist to assist me to check-in. During my stay at the hotel I communicated only with local staff and everybody was always willing to help me and always smile.Bali is wonderful place for spending holidays and Ayodya Resort is good hotel to stay in.

<Content>Loved AYODYA Uma Sangaran from SingaporeWe reserved a Superior Room through our agent and before my arrival i sent an email to the reservations to upgrade myself to the Honeymoon Grande. Being a fellow hotelier i was offered US$40 nett for my upgrade which was very acceptable. Upon arrival at the Hotel was amazed by their magnificent architecture. Beautiful Statues wherever you turn and the greetings and smiles of the friendly staff blew me off my feet. The room was equally beautful. The beach is to die for. To top it off i was offered a complimentary massage by the hotel. Well hae ran out of words to further describe this wonderful place on earth. If you are looking for one truely balinese resort to stay then this should be your ultimate choice. Cheers

<Content>Unbelievably beautiful I spent just over a week at the Ayodya Palace with my wife for our honeymoon and it was a fantastic week from every aspect. Also, due to a misunderstanding with our travel agent -which was resolved in a matter of minutes- we were initially checked in at the standard Ayodya, not the Palace, so I had the opportunity to see both types of rooms and compare. I must say both hotels are beautiful but it is definitely worth paying something extra to upgrade to a room at the Palace. In addition to everything else you get a more luxurious room and the chance to use the Palace's private pool where refreshments and snaks are served all day free of charge. You also get to have breakfast at the private pool which is pretty cool, plus the Palace is the closest you'll ever get to the beach. It even features a private Spa, just for Palace guests, although due to our excursions at the island we never had time to try it. Besides the palace, the whole setting at the Ayodya resort is magnificent, with a huge lagoon and a traditional Indonesian theatre in the middle, where there were shows almost every night, a masive pool and fantastic restaurants, all within the resort. We also had a chance to arrange for a private romantic dinner at the beach the last night. The entrance to the resort, with its massive fountain lakes and stone dragons, and the huge lobby is very very impressive, and the staff are very polite and friendly. Another plus is that the Bali Collection, a beautiful shopping and dining complex at the Nusa Dua area, is only 10 minutes' walk from the resort which makes for a very pleasant evening walk. I haven't seen the other hotels at Nusa Dua but I would definitely recommend this one, especially the Palace.

<Content>It ain't 5-star Spent three nights there during December with our two teenagers. The rooms were tired and rundown needed repainting and bathrooms retiling- obviously no money spent since Hilton gave up the franchise. Staff had a problem with English and it was frustrating. Pool loungers were tatty and there was a shortage of umbrellas. Very disappointing.wouldn't recommend to anyone as there are better hotels on this stretch of beach. It was overpriced.

I would definitely recommend the Ayodya (former Bali Hilton) to older couples looking for a beautiful, quiet, picturesque and peaceful place to spend a week or so. Dates of stay were April 27 to May 7 and with the exception of some brief showers one day in the morning, the weather was perfect. Service at the hotel was great (room serviced at least twice a day). Everybody was really friendly. Great beach (though the first few days there was quite a bit of trash in the water...wrappers and papers and things floating, which would then wash up on the beach...but hotel staff were pretty vigilant about cleaning up...keeping in mind that Bali beaches are all public). Pool is awesome. Excellent exercise facilities with lots of machines and bikes, saunas and jacuzis which are all free to hotel guests. I never used the business center, but there was one. There is renovation going on...but we only noticed it in the lobby...that is, it didn't disturb us at all. Breakfast was included in our rate and it was great. Make sure you take a few extra pieces of bread from the buffet on your way out to feed the koi fish and the dozen our so lizards swimming in the lagoon. Would not recommend eating there for dinner or lunch as it's kind of pricey...you can get more food for a fourth of the cost by walking off grounds ten minutes to one of the commercial strips in Nusa Dua (or even to the Galleria Mall about 20 minutes away), you just have to put up with a few touts/cab drivers asking if you want a lift, and keep a watchful eye on the money changers! Lot of good shops nearby for souvenirs in the Bualu village. Bought things like masks, paintings, batik. Make sure you try to haggle, but be pleasant about it...don't get stressed over a few dollars (you're supposed to be on vacation)...I write this just because I was in a shop making a purchase when a guy passed by, asked the nice old shopkeeper how much something cost, she quoted him a price (which obviously was more than the item was worth, but that's the point, right?), he got upset, yelled why don't you just tell us how much it really costs? and stormed off down the road.Overall a great experience and would love to go back. Though next time might stay at Kuta, just to check it out and compare (plus you see the sunset from that side), might be more to do/see and I think it might be a little cheaper.

<Content>Impressive place but ...... I stayed at the Ayodya Resort Dec 22 鈥?28, 2006. Occupancy was ridiculously low and the place felt empty. Generally, the resort presents an impressive fa莽ade. However, it appears that the rooms and general facilities are suffering due to the striking downturn in occupancy seen throughout Bali. We stayed in a Grande Ocean View Room (actually we had two rooms 鈥?since we are a family of four). Although very clean, the rooms are dated and due for refurbishing. Beds were comfortable. Negatives - only petty things really. Grande Ocean View room occupants are to receive a fruit basket on arrival 鈥?we did not receive one even after calling the front desk. Should also have received 20 min of free internet access per room in the business center each day 鈥?had to argue with staff to avoid being charged. There is no ATM (cash machine) in the hotel which is unbelievable given its size and relatively isolated location. Breakfast 鈥?Sorry, but certainly not up to par with a hotel of this stature. There is a buffet breakfast provided but it is very, very basic in nature when compared to other similar hotels throughout Asia.Positives 鈥?We enjoyed the large pool with plenty of loungers. The beach was very clean and the small group of vendors was kept at bay by a very clear delineation between the grassed hotel grounds and the sand beach. Vendors were not allowed to come on to the grass and pester the guests, although they did their best to pester guests from the sand !! The gardens, sculptures, waterfalls and lagoons are fantastic. Disregard the earlier comment regarding swimming in the lagoons. These lagoons are of course man made but have naturalized and are a very beautiful and unique part of the overall landscape master plan. There are birds, fish, lizards and other harmless things living in the lagoons which give the property a more authentic feel.The staff were generally well behaved 鈥?no complaints there. Overall we enjoyed out stay at the Ayodya. I was sorry to see the low occupancy and know that the hotel must be struggling to maintain standards.

<Content>Upgrade to The Ayodya Palace We stayed at the Ayodya palace hotel for 4 days at the end of July. Great room on the 4th floor with views of the ocean. The Ayodya has its own pool and breakfast area, but you can use the services and facilities of the Hilton to which it is attached. Superb (and I mean superb) service. Best we have had anywhere. Room rate included breakfast, free soft drinks throughout the day (brought poolside to you with a plate of fruit), afternoon tea and cocktails in the evening. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Not a Hilton and not quite a 5 star either! We spent 6 nights at the Bali Hilton (a Hilton until Aug 2006), we upgraded at a cost of 拢200 to the Ayodya Palace which is the 鈥渆xecutive鈥?wing. Apart from a superior room equipped with a CD and DVD player and access to a library, guests were also entitled to a full breakfast, complimentary soft drinks, tea and coffee throughout the day, afternoon tea (sandwiches, pastries and nibbles) and cocktails and canapes from 5.30pm to 7pm every day. These are served from the Ayodya lounge or pool area.On first glance every thing looked wonderful, nice setting, impressive drive to the main lobby, we soon noticed that the room was a little shabby. If you have already booked, don鈥檛 panic as this will not detract too much from the overall impressions of the place, it鈥檚 just that prior to staying here we stayed at the Sheraton in Bangkok, now that is a real 5 star.  Staff were very helpful and polite but not the standard of a true 5 star. They did make the effort to call you by your name and this was a nice touch. However, they also made an effort to engage you in conversation about trips you may have arranged during your stay on the island, if you had none arranged they attempted to 鈥渟ell鈥?you various excursions at a so called 鈥渞educed price鈥? This was not a service we appreciated while we ate breakfast! As this Hotel no longer belongs to the Hilton Group (it becomes the Ayodya Resort in August), you feel that in certain areas of service they are trying save money as we had to ask several times for replacement packets of creamer for the coffee in the room and during the cocktail hour we had to ask several times for a refill. As our stay progressed the bathroom products appeared to be watered down and differed considerably in consistency from that of the first day. The room did smell a little of 鈥渄amp鈥?especially the fabrics (even the pillows), this may be a feature of the tropical climate/air conditioning combination but somehow I think not. There was also some maintenance being carried out and we were disturbed by the sound of drilling (this was minimal as it was carried out during the day) and when we reported this to the reception desk, it was stopped immediatelyThese gripes are all very minor but it鈥檚 these little touches that make the difference in a genuine 5 star hotel..Overall we had a very nice time at this hotel, and would even consider staying again, but it鈥檚 no longer a Hilton and you won鈥檛 get any reward points

<Content>An amazing place We have just returned from the Bali Hilton having had a two week holiday there. The hotel was amazing, a grand entrance, huge lagoon filled with fish and iguanas, lovely public areas and really friendly staff. When we arrived in our room we were a little disappointed by the slightly damp smell. The room itself was very nice however the smell was enough to make us upgrade to a grande room. This cost us $200 for the two weeks and was well worth it as we had a big walk in shower and more pleasant views. The pool area was really nice and very quiet. The cost of drinks and meals in the hotel were hugely inflated compared to the prices you paid if you walked into Nusa Dua. We had several meals at the Bali Collection, which was a shopping centre not far from the hotel with a few good restaurants and well worth a visit. It is worth while checking that your trip does not coincide with the Balinese New Year as a couple who had arrived the day before us had had to stay in Kula Lumpur for the day before getting their flight to Bali as the Balinese do not work on their New Year and all activity stops. During our stay we went sight seeing, and would recommend hiring a car with driver and guide for the day. This cost an amazingly cheap $30 and was really good value for money. (Hiring a car looked very scary as there does not seem to be any rules on the road.) We were taken to see the volcano, temples, monkey forests, artist areas of Ubud and other places of interest, gained lots of insight from the guides knowledge and also gained an understanding of how difficult their lives have been since the bombings reduced the number of tourists visiting. Our guide comes highly recommended and can be contacted by e-mail:(---). He was not a part of a business but just worked for himself with his brother as driver. He was extremely accommodating and helpful, ensuring we enjoyed our trips. The temple at Tanahlot is well worth a visit as is the temple at Ulu-Watu and watching the Kecak dance is a must. We really enjoyed the monkey forests but would advise people not to buy the nuts or bananas as the monkeys see them and try to snatch them away. I put a big bunch of bananas is my bag and the monkeys saw me, which resulted in some screaming and a monkey swinging on my bag trying to take it off me! Dreamland Beach in the south of the island is also a must-do day out. The beach is spectacular, reached via a steep walk down the steps carved into the cliffs. When out shopping bartering is the custom, and we were advised to offer a starting price of 40% lower than the vendors asking price, negotiating someway in between. The only fixed prices seemed to be in the supermarket, which is worth a visit to stock up on Bintang beer at cheap prices. We had a fantastic time and would not hesitate to recommend Bali to anyone considering a holiday there. The Balinese people were the most welcoming people we have ever known on any holiday we have been on.

<Content>Great Service at the Bali Hilton My Friend  I arrived in Bali on February 16th for a 2 week stay. We were greeted by the friendly, smiling faces of the porters and taken to the customer service desk. An attendant immediately brought cool towels to wipe our faces and offered us refreshments. We had booked our trip a little late and didn't have a choice of rooms so we stayed in a smoking room for one night, then were moved to a non smoking room. During our stay we always had a fresh fruit bowl in our room, compliments of the hotel and when we moved to the non smoking room we were given complimentary t-shirts for any inconvenience we might have suffered. Our room was kept spotless by the cleaning staff and when our beds were turned down in the early evening, a flower was left on the pillow - a very nice touch. Bottled water was replenished daily and whenever we saw any staff in the halls or out on the walkways, they always greeted us, asking about our stay. We found the service to be excellent. The pool was kept spotless and the hotel provided classes on snorkeling and scuba diving. When we walked out to the beach front, we found that the hawkers were not allowed onto the grassy area. This was a relief because with so few tourists, they can be quite persistant if they think there is a possible sale. The location of the hotel is very good, being right next to the golf course and the south gates into the resort area are a block away from the front gates of the hotel. There is security at all of the main gates and also at the hotel gate. It is a very easy walk to the village. There are several good restaurants, lots of shopping and a mini mart right outside the south gates. There are also free shuttle services which will take you to the Bali Collection which is a higher-end shopping/eating area in Nusa Dua and also to the Bali Galleria in Kuta. To take a taxi to the Discovery Mall in Kuta from the hotel costs about 70,000 rupiah which is about $10.00 CAD. I found that the hotel Spa was very good. I had reflexology a couple of times and the fellow was very knowledgable. My swedish massage was also very good. My friend did not like her Balinese massage.We had breakfast every morning at the Waterfall Restuarant. There was a great variety of breakfast foods plus an omlette maker and a banana pancake/waffle maker. We liked it. In fact we ate at several of the restuarants in the hotel and enjoyed them all. The service, again, was excellent.The lagoon in the center of the complex has a nice variety of birds plus there are some swimming reptiles that are pleasant to watch.On the whole we really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton and found the Balinese people exceptionally gracious and hospitable. Always ready to laugh and very helpful with our attempts at speaking their language.The few things we did not like were; every couple of days the hotel gets fogged with bug repellent. Huge billowing white clouds - very gross - All of the resort hotels do it. Also in the quiet areas of the lagoon there is alot of sludgy algae - very unattractive. They were painting one area of the hotel. It was a little inconvenient, obviously using this slow period to do some refurbishing.We truly enjoyed our visit to Bali, we found it very safe and we did it all. From white water rafting to snorkeling, we had many laughs with our Balinese guides. We could asked any question, about their culture, politics or economy and we would get truthful answers. We would highly recommend a visit to Bali and a stay at the Bali Hilton.

<Content>Not great Stayed there for three nights and decided to move. It is a shabby place with paint peeling off the hotel. The rooms are nice but not modern. The food is over priced. It cost 78 pounds (uk) for a buffet which was very poor. The staff are quite down beat and keep on telling you how the bomb has affected there tips etc.Go and stay at the bali intercon at Jimbaran bay it is great!

<Content>Impressive! We stayed at the Bali Hilton prior to our wedding in April this year. We were extremely impressed from the second the taxi pulled into the driveway. It is an enormous hotel, with lavish grounds and beautifully decorated lobbies, restaurants and rooms. We had a standard room but it was huge, immaculate and cleaned spotlessly every day. The grounds are terrific, with lagoons and bridges interconnecting everything. The breakfast that was included was awesome, and the location of the hotel was particularly convenient - just a short stroll to the main street of Nusa Dua for shopping and eating. The only downside in my husbands opinion was the pool. There is just the one, and it is in full sun with no shade, so it could be quite scorching - if you're like me and love the heat, then this is no problem. In general, we were very satisfied, as it is quite a good bargain for what you get - would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Bali Hilton Facts not Fiction for the Potential Honeymooner As a senior employee with one of the Big 4 Global accounting firms I often stay in 4/5 star hotels all over the world on business trips, so I should have a moderately good understanding what is a 4 or 5 star hotel. The Bali Hilton in my opinion IS NOT a 4 or 5 star hotel, in fact I would rate it 3 or 3 plus at best. The principal reasons for this rating are:An overall lack of service, as a guest I felt that I was a type of commodity rather than a valued customer, hotel staff while not rude were not in my opinion concerned with providing services to me or seeing if everything was acceptable to me.The lack of variety of quality foodThe lack of romantic aura of the hotelA feeling that I really did not get value for my money after visiting other hotels in Nusa Dua that charged similar prices.I have detailed below my principal issues as to why this is not a 4 or 5 star hotel below. I would strongly advise anyone against honeymooning at the Bali Hilton if you are expecting to pay for a romantic holiday or alternatively are looking for a value for money holiday. My poor opinion of the Bali Hilton was reinforced when we started frequenting other Nusa Dua hotels for dinner in order to get an impression of the range of quality hotel accomodation and services available. Based on our assessment of the hotels in the Eastern Nusa Dua area I personally would only stay at the Sheraton Lagoona if I wanted a romantic holiday.My Issues with my stay at the Bali HiltonThe massive entrance and lobby that contain two bars are a pure facade, the two bars are rarely used by large numbers of guests, in the evening there is a singer at one of the bars but no one is ever there to really listen and the quality of the entertainment could be questioned.The hotel looks to be aging rapidly, both in structure and vegatation (I believe it was built in the late eigties or early nineties) and is in need of serios renovation. The vegatation and tropical plants in places appear to be on their last legs and the gardening is shabby in a lot of places particularly when compared to other Nusa Dua Hotels such as the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and the Sheraton Lagoona. The lift in our Grande Room block is not modern and regularly was out of service during our stay, which when you are on the 5th floor can be kind of annoying.Do not get an ocean view room it is not worth the additional expense as you WILL NOT be on a beach front looking out onto the sea but will be looking at the sea from a tight angle and from a distance of several hundred metres.The reception area is understaffed and the staff or assistant managers seem incapable of multi-tasking so guests are often waiting to be served while the assistant managers sit around. This happened to me on a number of occasions where I was waiting 10-15 minutes to be served.The pool is ok in my opinion and the beach is probably larger in both width and length than most of the other hotels but is steeply inclined and it is about a 30 second walk from the sunbathing area to the waters edge. Note there are no sun loungers on the beach so you are not close to the water's edge i.e. 5-10 metres away.The hotel has a massive green lagoon area around which most of the restaurants are situated, which appears to be a kind of nature area. However, certain areas i.e. the north-west corner of the lagoon start to smell strongly of sewage during the evening. I did mention this to the management.The hotel gym-workout facilities are NOT owned by the hotel and therefore are not free of charge, you are required to pay USD 4 for a day pass to use the gym facilities.Issues with our room included the shower needing to be run for 5-7 minutes prior to the hot water coming through which seems hypocritical considering the hotel's reccomendation that guests try to save water. Obviously the quality of every room may not be the same as ours. The balcony table wobbled so badly it was difficult to eat room service on it while not a major issue it was sometimes inconvenient. The TV reception quality was poor for the majority of satellite channels, I did mention this to management while I was there.The hotel does not in my opinion openly market the menus and locations of its restaurants, it wasn't until the third week of our stay that we found out where the Meditteranean and pub bar were.At the towel area you are required to sign for towels and put your room number, however when you return the towels nothing is requested of you. Why not a real is, why this process is necessary except for statistically gathering the data of how many towels each room uses I do not know.In my opinion one of the main issues with the hotel is that it has no real open air restaurants, ok the waterfall and the indonesian restaurant are open air but they are not really romantic in my opinion. For example at the Sheraton Lagoona you can have have a romantic evening meal by the beach or in one of their special romantic canopy huts, this is not possible at the Bali Hilton.The menus of the pool bar is limited, and tend to have a lot of deep fried items, I did not think that the food had a kind of care about it that would make you think it was high quality. About 10-15% of the time the staff would bring me the a drink I did not order but more importantly they did not check guests requirements that often, for example in my opinion at the pool the staff would walk around checking guests may be once an hour and generally it was quicker to go to the bar and order.Breakfast is kind of a third US/UK, a third continental European and a third Asian. In my experience the breakfast hostesses were not that friendly. The strength of the tea served at breakfast is poor as it turns a grey-cream colour when you add milk. I suggested to the manager that they put the tea bags on the table for guests to choose and have the waiters serve boiling water.

<Content>Great Honeymoon with the Kid! We booked our honeymoon in Bali very late (ie, one day after the wedding) and basically went for the Bali Hilton as it was the best of what was left. When we arrived we were shown to our deluxe garden room, which was nice with a pretty satisfactory view of the gardens (my new wife thought it smelt of damp, but didn't notice it myself). However, after 2 days we got a free upgrade to a 'grande' room with a view of the stunning lagoon, the pool and the sea. It was fantastic....a lovely spaceous room with a spectacular view in a great hotel. I would highly recommend spending a little extra for this type of room as it would be well worth it. The pool was also great, especially the shallow kiddie's pool which our son thought was the bee's knees. When we were there (early to mid Sept) the hotel seemed half empty...this worked in our favour as we could take over 4 or 5 sun-loungers and make a play pen for our son. All in all, we had a wonderful time and the bali hilton is a great place to visit and (despite the recent tradgedy) we will definately be going back to Bali and most likely to the Bali Hilton.......only negative was the price in the hotel restaraunts, which was steep for Bali and the 21% government tax reserved for the 'Western' owned hotels racks up the price even further. If you go, try out the little cafe next door which has nice standard fare for a fraction of the price in the hotel (directions: go out of hotel, down to beach and turn left...you can't miss it) BTW, I was also in Bali on business in Aug and stayed at the Westin, which was a great hotel as well, but would not suit small families....much more of a business/couples hotel.

<Content>Nice but not Luxury As we booked our accommodation in Bali only days before we were due to arrive we had fairly limited choice of hotels. We wanted to stay in Jimbaran but could find no free 5 star rooms. We decided on the Hilton in the sculpted resort and booked an Ayoda Palace Honeymoon room expecting to pay extra for better service and surroundings.I still do not understand the difference in the room standard. They all look the same in size to me (faily small) and the service was certainly not exceptional. We often had to wait for long periods before our drinks arrived or, indeed, even to find someone to order the drinks.The staff did not seem to know which guests were new, how long they were staying, although they were always friendly and helpful when approached. My husband and I did not sleep well during our week at the hotel and on the last day I realised that this was because of the constant noise in the mornings in the corridors caused by staff shouting to each other and the rooms not being sound proofed.The good points were the private pool and lounge. Afternoon tea was sweet and breakfast was good. However, the general hotel itself was poor value for money in terms of food and drink and service felt a bit chaotic - lots of staff everywhere but no one attending you.We got roughly what we expected and were lucky to get a good driver who showed us all round Bali. Whilst we will be coming back to Bali, it wont be in Nusa Dua or the Hilton. Next time Jimbaran - definitely.
