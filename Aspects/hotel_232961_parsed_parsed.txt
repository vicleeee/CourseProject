<Content>good for those on a budget We stayed at hotel rapallo for 3 nights. The hotel was a 15-20 min walk from the train station, once you find the road its very easy to find cause you just keep walking straight. On our arrival the staff (two men at front desk--one young, one old) got us settled and gave us maps. Our room did not look like anything that was presented on the website. It was very basic, two single beds, basic sheets, tv, tiny bathroom that divided the shower and toilet by just a shower curtain on a rod. The room could have been cleaner as for the carpet which was a dark brown but overall if your on a budget, this hotel did the trick. They did have internet but you would have to get a code and pay a fee. The computer room is downstairs in a tiny closet like room that can only fit one person BUT if you have a laptop you should put the code in and off you go. The breakfast was satisfactory. You got croissants, buns, ham, cheese, yogurt, juice, cereal, tea/hot chocolate/coffee --all luke warm. Definitly not hot like the coffee u get in the states or canada. We were able to get to all the main attractions by foot (bell tower, santa maria churck, uffizi, accademia-where David is etc). The hotel will recommend a traditional italian restaurant to go to--we went there twice for dinner and it was pretty good. Beware of the street vendors on that street trying to sell you sketchy items such as purses, belts, clothes etc. I felt really uncomfortable walking down that area at night with all the vendors present--all men saying 'prego' and staring at you. If your on a budget as for food, there is a grocery store on the main street you can buy snacks/veggies/fruit from and store in the minibar. Over all the hotel was good for us cause we didn' t want to spend too much money. The rooms could have been cleaner and more appealing--at one point when I went to open the window, it almost fell off the hinge. BUT in saying that, I wouldnt mind staying here again. \It did the trick, it was close to everything and we were able to walk to everything we needed to. I dont think the staff were creepy at all...they were quite helpful.

<Content>Creepy We arrived here later in the evening after our reserved accomodation turned out to be terrible. We saw this place and it looked nice from the outside. We checked in and got to our rooms which turned out to be not so nice. It seems cleans but has a weird smell through the whole building and its just a generally creepy feel to it. BUT more importantly the guy at reception is AN ABSOLUTE CREEP! there was no way we were staying there another night for 100鈧?when we found a much better hotel (The caravaggio) down the road towards the train station for cheaper. When we went to check out the next day, he started questioning us - why wont you stay? where are you going? Whats the name of your hotel that your going to? it was none of his business and its not worth the price you pay. he was a jerk. I will have nightmares about him as he's just creepy. Dont stay here. Not worth it.

<Content>Doesn't deserve its 3 star rating This place was terrible the bathroom was so small, you had to dry yourself in the room, there was black mould in the shower, the water only dribbled from the shower  it took 4 minutes to get any hot water. We had cigarette smoke coming from the a/c vent, the TV remote was broken, there were no blinds or curtains on the windows, only the shutters, no hair dryer, no English speaking TV channels, the bed and pillows were like boards. The lift did not work.There must be a hundred better hotels in Florence for the price that we paid. The only thing going for it was location.

<Content>Excellent Hotel in the centre of Florence Just happened to stumble on this hotel as a last hope in a booked out city...It turned out to be a gem - the rooms are great - very French in decor and quiet and comfortable with good facilities - even a stocked and reasonable bar fridge - a first so far in Italy for us :)We are indebted to a particular member of the Hotel's staff - Andrea - he looked after us very well, helping with parking and even carrying our heavy luggage up 4 flights of stairs whilst the lift was being repaired!Breakfast is supplied in the reasonable tariff.Highly recommended - we were very happy.email them on info@hotelrapalloofirenze.itweb: http://www.hotelrapalloofirenze.it/comThe only thing missing was tea/coffee facilities in the room but that seems to be normal for Europe :(

<Content>Lovley hotel, good location We have just returned from a short stay in Florence  Portofino and stayed at the Rapallo twice. The hotel was great, easy to find and get to from the Santa Maria Novella train station and well located for all the attractions.The staff were very friendly and helpful and recommended a great restaurant for our first night.The only downside was the room on our first stay (Room 501)was next to the lift and therefore quite noisy late at night and early morning but when I asked for a different room the following weekend they were more than happy to accomodate and that room (56) was really good.Would definitely recommend this as a place to stay and we will be going back there next year for another weekend as we didn't have time to see everything on this trip!

<Content>Small, clean, friendly hotel My boyfriend and I (both aged 27) have just got back from a 6 night stay in Florence at the Hotel Rapallo. It is a tiny hotel but we really enjoyed our stay there. the decor is traditional and has character. Our room was as the photos we had seen suggested although maybe slightly smaller than they would have you believe and the bathroom was more of a wet room and wasn't water proof but was fine and as the bathroom was kept spotlessly clean it wasn't a problem. Breakfast is a simple affiar-Italians do not do fry ups (much to my boyfriend's chagrin) so it was cereal, rolls, ham, cheese, boiled eggs, croissants but was set out in a buffet style so you could have as much as you wanted. The waiter at breakfast was also very friendly and helpful. The guys on the reception desk were friendly and offered to recommend restaurants and told us about trips outside Florence we could make. They were very hospitable and even indulged my nightly request for a corkscrew so we could have a drink in the room before going out! The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from all the main attractions and in a fairly nice area.If you want a place to stay in Florence and cannot afford 5 star luxury then go for this place. It is extremely clean, friendly, has character, is fairly centrally located and none of the guests are noisy. We also got free internet access-only one computer but there was never a queue and anyway you don't go to Italy to sit at a computer!If you want a nice, friendly cafe, which is chilled out then turn right out of the hotel, cross the road and about 50 or so metres down is a great one-I can't remember its' name but it's on a corner and is really nice.Oh, by the way, expect the smallest lift you have ever seen-very funny!

<Content>Nice Small Hotel and Good Value Our family, 2 adults and 2 children (ago 14 and 10) stayed there for 3 nights, Dec 25~28, 2007. Here are the things we like:1) Great value. We booked through venere.com, used a 3% off coupon found online, and paid 77 euros per night. We can't find any better rate to house 4 people in the entire Florence area.2) Nice staffs. The day shift guy is a Brazilian, and speaks good English, and patiently answered all my questions, like attraction sites, restaurants, bus routes and phone cards.3) Great breakfast. Ham, cheese, boiled eggs, croissants, rolls, cereals, yogurt, orange and grapefruit juice, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and milk 4) Free wireless internet access. You will have to request the login ID and password from the receptionist, the access is good for two hours, but it is totally free. However the wireless reception was very bad in our room at the 2nd floor, and I had to bring my laptop to the ground floor. I paid 5 euros for the safe in my room to store passports and cash.The location is OK, about 600 meters from the train station. The bathroom is very small, and it can hardly fit two people.We are generally happy with this hotel, and would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Great location Booked through Venere.comGreat location... minutes from the train station. Fairly clean. Decent breakfast. Very helpful front desk. Quiet. Bathrooms are pretty tiny, and the shower IS the bathroom. But bedroom is big, as well as the bed. Would stay again if we were on a budget.

<Content>A good experience overall This hotel was good value for money. Although the facilities were fairly basic and not exactly modern, the staff were very friendly and helpful which made up for a lot. It's about a 10 minute walk to the centre. The bathroom in our room was not great, cluttered and a bit smelly! However, the rest of the room was clean, spacious and comfortable. I would recommend this hotel if you are on a budget but still want a decent place to stay.

<Content>Old world charm After having stayed at one of the worst, this little hotel was a welcomed respite. My sister and I were received very warmly on our first afternoon. We arrived late because we hurriedly got on the wrong very slow train to Florence. ETA 3:10 and we had a reservation for the Uffizi at 3:00. The concierge quickly called a cab and told us to hurry to the museum - that our chances of being allowed in there were good. We got to the museum at 3:30 and we were graciously allowed entry. The concierge also made a reservation for us at a restaurant near the Uffizi. He took care of our luggage. For a second I thought we were in another country - our experiences with Italian hotels and concierges up to this point were awful.Many hours later we walked back to our hotel, and found ourselves in a large double, it was almost as big as a junior suite. There was antiquated furniture. An armoire functioned as the closet. There was a large bombay chest on one side of the room and a small sofa on the other side near the window. The ceiling appeared to be 10 ft. in height with a fresco painted above. Our window did face the street but the traffic/noise was not overbearing, as we kept the window open at night.The bath was spacious. A combination shower/bathtub. This one had a glass door to keep the shower water from splashing all over the room. Unlike the previous review that I read we did not have any problems whatsoever. The room was very charming and old, but not dingy. It was very well kept. Even if I could afford a 5 star hotel, on a return visit to Florence ( and I will be back ), I will most definitely stay here.As far as the breakfasts are concerned - as a traveler I would spend my dollars on coffee and croissants elsewhere. I don't care what hotel I've stayed in the breakfasts are never worth the money you pay. My sister and I walked 2 streets down from the hotel and had our continental breakfast at Cafe Barbano. It was open even on May 1 - Labor Day.Enough can't be said for the concierges at this little hotel. Instead of indifference and pretention we were treated with congeniality and attentiveness. For us this was the RITZ!!

<Content>Shabby and depressing My travel agent booked this hotel for us based on price (around $200/night) and location, but I knew we were in trouble the minute we walked in. The hotel is very shabby and probably hasn't been refurbished in 20 years. The first room we were given had peeling paint, threadbare linens and furniture that looked like it came from the IKEA damaged goods sale. When I pointed out that the room did not look anything like the room they show on their website, the desk clerk explained that that room was not available for that night (so maybe they only have the one?), but that we could have it for the rest of our stay.They moved us into the better room the next day and it was significantly better, but still sadly in need of new paint and such. Not what I was looking for on my 25th anniversary.Also, the building next door is being remodeled and the jackhammers started at 7 a.m. each day.The hotel breakfast was dismal: stale croissants, terrible coffee and weak tea.On the plus side, the evening concierge was wonderfully jovial and recommended several good restaurants.

<Content>Central but very basic This hotel was very disappointing. I cannot fault the staff and level of service in the hotel- very helpful people indeed. However, the hotel was old, rooms dingey and the bathroom in terms of size and quality was appalling. The shower only worked as a power shower when on cold temperature, as soon as you switched to hot the water just dripped out like a tap. The bathroom was no larger than a wardrobe in size, and the placement of the shower head (not enclosed behind a shower door- just bolted to the wall amongst the sink and toilet cistern, wetting everything once turned on!!) was very poor. The bathroom door would not close properly...the only word to describe the whole experience was grotty!!The bedclothes were clean but very worn, as were the curtains. This is a hotel in drastic need of refurbishment!! Quite pricey for what it was at 鈧?30 a night (I got a fabulous hotel in Pisa for only 鈧?5)Breakfast was disappointing also, as are most in Italy. Location was central, and staff were friendly. These are sadly the only positives the hotel has going for it!!

<Content>great location, elegant room We stayed 3 nights at this lovely hotel. The room we had was a very good size for the four of us. The hotel is very clean and quietly elegant. The staff was friendly and somewhat helpful. We were a bit disappointed with the breakfast. I guess we were expecting more than Americano coffee. Also, the room we had was on the front side of the hotel, right on the main street which was very loud from the traffic. We had to keep our window shut at night and sometimes it was a bit too warm for that. The a/c was shut off for the season we were told. If I were to stay there again, I would ask for a room in the back if possible.

<Content>Great place to stay! We had a wonderful experience in this hotel due to the lovely staff (especially Ottavio), the good location, nice atmosphere and good breakfast. We would definitely stay here the next time we go to Florence. The only difficulty we had was with the air conditioning which could have been a bit stronger. However, the staff said that the hotel is due to obe remodeled soon... maybe that includes the air conditioning units.
