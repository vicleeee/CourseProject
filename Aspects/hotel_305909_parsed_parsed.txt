<Content>Royal Plaza was ok I stayed at the Royal Plaza with my husband  2 teenagers. We had booked 2 rooms. When we arrived we were told that we had been upgraded to the executive floor, but had no access to any of the amenities. Access to the executive floor was via elevator to the 8th floor and then we had take the stairs to our rooms. 1 room was fine, but the 2nd room was smelly (like it was damp). We asked to change rooms, which they did, but the new room stunk of smoke, even though it is a non-smoking floor. Finally we got a room that was ok. The rooms were reasonably spacious. Breakfast was included and was ok. The variety was reasonable and flavour was fine. I was impressed that they had soy milk! The position was ok. It is attached to a shopping centre, a bit of a walk (but easy) to the station and close to the Ladies Market. The Mong Kok area is great area to be in, with a variety of shops and places to eat. Overall the hotel was fine. I don't know if I would rush back, but I wouldn't mind if we ended up having to stay there again.

<Content>super far, lousy staff  We stayed at the Royal Plaza Mongkok during Dec 24-28. The hotel made our trip a totally unpleasant HK trip I've ever had.We have to wait till 4 PM to have access to our room. At the day we checked in, there was x'mas eve gala dinner. For whatever reason it is, the dinner is arranged at the lobby of the hotel. As a result, they only allow one person of each group to go inside the counter area to check in while they're preparing tables. It was chaotic. The rest of us and other groups have to stand nearby the lift, waiting for our room for an hour!. staffs were so rude and do not manage the queue at all. they didn't care who came first .. it's a matter of who yelled louder. the room was smelly. i guess the hotel is quite old and the carpet didn't feel clean. Luggage delivery to the room very slow, it was 30 mins after we got our room. At the check out, there was no bell boy coming up to pick up our luggages either.the worst part about hotel is the location. they claimed the hotel is 2 mins from MTR. it's true, but that station is MONG KOK EAST, not MONG KOK. they're 2 different stations. Mong Kok east is a small station and it is very hard to go anywhere as u need to transfer and connect to other stations. at the end of the day, it's easier to walk to Mongkok ... and that makes u 15-20 mins from subway station. be careful when you're about to book this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel, but not perfect I was in HK  Macau for a short vacation with family and my in-laws who are elderly. Knowing that hotels in HK are pricey and generally have small rooms after a bit of research (mainly on Trip Advisor) I chose this hotel. My key considerations in choosing this hotel was the ranking on Trip Advisor, comments from members, room rate, location and proximity to subway stations.I booked using the Hotels.com website and the experience was generally hassle free except that I did not get a confirmation email after I had completed the booking. However a couple of emails subsequently reassured me that the booking had been successful. As there were 6 of us in all, I booked 2 Family rooms which have a queen and a single bed each.We took 2 taxis from HKIA and paid about HKD 250 - 300 for each, including extra fares for our luggage. Checking in was a breeze and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the rooms were spacious with the standard facilities including an ironing board and iron, hotel slippers, flat screen TV, minibar, bath  shower and in-room safe.We did not experience any issues with service, except on our last day when upon checking out the porters were tardy in collecting our bags from the rooms. However they could have been busy as it was about 1 pm which is I think a peak time for the hotel with guests checking in and out.The hotel is conveniently located next to a large shopping mall (Grand Century Place) which has a good number of eateries. It was relatively easy for me to get to our preferred mode of transport, the HK subway or MTR as they call it. The nearest station is called Mong Kok East and is accessible from the shopping mall - a 5 minute stroll. However this is not the line that leads to the key tourist areas of Tsim Sha Tsui and HK Island. To get on that line (called the Tsuen Wan line) I had to walk about 10 minutes to Prince Edward station or, by cutting through the shopping mall which leads to a series of overhead bridges, to the Mong Kok station which is 15 or 20 minutes away. The distance was no problem to me but posed a bit of a challenge to my in-laws who are aged and couldn't walk very far.Did not patronise any of the FB outlets in the hotel, HK has way too many eateries.Service from hotel staff was generally polite at worst, and enthusiastic at best.Summary:Likes- room size.- locationDislikes- location (a bit problematic for my in-laws)- room rates. During my research they were selling the family rooms for HKD 1000 per night on the hotel website. Unfortunately I did not book then. When I tried to book a few weeks later the offer was no longer available and Hotels.com provided me with the best rate but was still expensive.

<Content>Great value,service and locationj I have just spent a week at the Royal Plaza. The rooms are spacious, elegant and clean. Service and attention to detail are outstanding. The buffet meals are superb quality with lots of variety. Location is excellent, very close to markets for shopping and train access to other parts of the city and Hong Kong island.Staff were fantastic, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>very nice hotel Had an excellent time at this hotel. Stayed in a family room, which is a queen bed and a single (meant for 3 but we stayed the four of us). It had a simple cooking area and a microwave, and was quite spacious / enough for our needs. It is a bit of a walk from Mongkok station (it is very near east mongkok, but that station is less connected to where we tended to want to go), but there is a covered walkway to mongkok station. Furthermore on the way back we could stop by to get fruits or other things we needed. Ladies and other markets were quite near by. To put it into perspective, we needed to walk quite a bit no matter where we went in hong kong, so it wasn't bad at all. If you are muslim then Islam food on Lung Kong road is excellent - around HK30 each way for taxi. The hotel has a shopping center attached, with a mcdonalds.

<Content>when is a doubled bed not a double bed ?? I spent numerous weeks researching a HK hotel that could provide a FAMILY room as that's what we normally prefer, plus also due to the expense. I thought I'd hit the jackpot when i finally found a HK hotel with a decent family room. According to the website it was perfect. Some may call me fussy, but when we were shown to our room (after having check in delayed due to room being checked for you) it was a triple, and not a family room. The website says one king or queen plus one double. It turns out that its actually one king or queen plus a single (albeit slightly larger than a UK single). When the managemnet were questioned all our family rooms are like this and  our single bed is a double bed I kid you not. WE specifically chose this hotel becasue of the website's description and even had an email dialogue with their staff before booking the so called family room. If I had known what I know now I WOULD NOT HAVE BOOKED THIS HOTEL due to :a) obviously the bedding config b) family breakfast cost us short of 80 pounds!! (just the one day)c) location d) hotel was cold e) main lobby lounge area even more cold and dark. WE would have been better off booking a king bed (plus an extra bed) in a better located and more modern hotel with breakfast INCLUDED in the rate, rather than this old hotel that doesn't know the difference between a single and a doubled bed. RANT OVER!

<Content>Nice and roomy We (3 adults + 2 kids) stayed at Royal Plaza for 4 nites with connecting rooms. Room are spacious with a queen bed, 2 seat couch, coffee table, kitchen facilities (e.g. sink, microwave, fridge, cabinet, etc).Location wise, next to a shopping mall, short walk to street markets, abit far from MTR stations though. Hotel provides free shuttle bus to Tsim Sha Tsui but not very frequent. Area was mostly typical blue collar working class area unlike the business district in HK island.Comparing to other hotels in town, I would say its good value for money.

<Content>Great Location Great hotel in excellent location. Large rooms, a little bit outdated but very clean and comfortable. Shopping Centre next door with MTR Mong Kok a short walk way. Direct access to Lo Wu for shopping in Shenzhen.Had the breakfast included in my room rate, very nice choice, more than I could eat. Staff friendly and attentive.I can recommend this hotel, I will definitely stay here again when in Kowloon.

<Content>Nice hotel with a great business rate I booked the Royal Plaza hotel because it had a great rate that included breakfast and free internet. The room (1551) was very nice and had a decent territorial view. The bathroom was rather luxurious.The included breakfast buffet was quite good, and included everything from standard western fare to Chinese dim sum.The outdoor pool was nice, although it was closed the first day that I was there because there was a minor typhoon warning. The gym was decent but small.The location is fine - the hotel is right over the East Mong Kok train station, and there is a long covered walkway that goes to the Mong Kok subway. Instead of paying extra for a fancy waterfront room with a view at another hotel, I spent the two evenings I was in Hong Kong at the Intercontential hotel lobby bar, which has an amazing view and great service.

<Content>Great hotel in an excellent location This hotel is in a great location on Kowloon Island. It is within walking distance to the Prince Edward Metro Station and also to the attractions of the Flower Market and the Bird Garden. It is also close to the electronics district. We visited the hotel in September and it exceeded all our expectations. The hotel is modern and located right next to a large shopping centre with all the shops you could wish for. The rooms are really well appointed and modern and above all clean, cool and quiet. They also offer Wi-Fi at a cost. The pool is fantastic and provides a lovely getaway after a day of walking, sightseeing and shopping. It has a lovely setting and the music playing underwater is very calming. We experienced one of the restaurants which was buffet style but also served a-la-carte meals. We wanted to dine at the other restaurant, but because of the mid-autumn festival we were unable to do so as the restaurant was booked out in advance. Our only minor grievance was that at check out we had a long wait as a whole load of new guests had arrived in addition to a load of others checking out at the same time as us. This is hardly the fault of the staff who handled the crowd well. In short, we would happily stay at this hotel again as it provides a great launching pad to seeing all the sights of Hong Kong.

<Content>Absolutely first class Stayed here with family in two rooms, same floor. Having often stayed on the island, we were a bit unsure of how we would take to the Kowloon experience. As seasoned frequent travellers around most of the world, can say with complete candour that this is my first and only choice for Hong Kong in the future. Staff at the desk, on the floors, in the business centre, restaurants and health club areas were all attentive, polite and ultra competent. The restaurants all provided such an array of choice for any meal that we couldn't fail to find lots to please. And with a huge and diverse mall adjoining, along with real street life within a block away (with its combination of local shopping and food options), this was an ideal blend of posh inside, and genuine Hong Kong outside.We strongly recommend it for business and tourist travellers. Overall, it was a wonderful experience that, after seven days, we were very sad to leave.

<Content>Great value comfortable hotel in Mongkok area Stayed here for a week. Got upgraded to a large family room. Hubby and I were very happy with the space, it was like an apartment. Particularly good value for stays of a week long as they built additional discounts in for a longer stay.Location is not close to harbour, but as this was our third trip we decided to try out Mongkok.Very bustling area, close to markets. The fact the hotel is connected to a large shopping centre was excellent. There is also a MTR located in the shopping Mall too so not difficult to get around. We hopped across to Hong Kong Island several times and did not find it an inconvenient location . We have stayed in nicer hotels but have paid double the price. We felt for the money we paid it was great value and if you have a number of days you won't find the location too inconvenient as it is easy to hop on the MTR.Staff were nice, we didn't opt for breakfast and there was no need with plenty of places in the shopping mall and we preferred changing where we ate so there was no monotony.The pool was well used and was quite pretty although not a huge number of sunchairs were available.

<Content>Good value for money Stayed at the Royal Plaza in early October '08. Check-in was pretty smooth. We stayed in a suite which seemed to be bigger compared to other hotel rooms in the same area.Breakfast was good. But it tends to get a little repetitive if you are staying for 3 or 4 nights. The hotel is well connected. There's a MTR station nearby (10 - 15 minutes by walk). There's a shopping complex adjacent to the hotel which has tons of shops, a few restaurants and fast food places. Quite handy if you want to do some quick shopping or have a quick bite.Overall I found the hotel good value for money.

<Content>it's underrated our group went on a short trip to hk last october 2008. i searched the hotel before leaving manila and found out it was 4-star category, and the location was quite far from downtown (the nathan road thereabouts) but near the mongkok area. anyway, turned out this 4-star hotel is relatively new, the rooms are spacious and tastefully designed with flat screen 42 in tvs. they have goosedown pillows and comforters. their buffet is very good. service isnt bad, either. the only downside is i think they have smoking floors and we ended up in one.it was also situated beside a mall, altho most shops dont carry international brands...but they have a bossini store which has a sale area and a supermarket at the 7th floor for convenience. there is a door connecting the hotel to the mall so you dont have to go out of the street. it is open till 10pm. the hotel is also near the mongkok night market, so you can also check out the stuff.they also have a shuttle service going downtown, which leaves like every 30 minutes, so its location shouldnt be too much of a disadvantage. well, i think this hotel exceeded my expectations. wouldnt mind stayng there again sometime.

<Content>Crowded and out of the way I stayed here for a single night on a business trip and when I arrived my room was not ready. I had to hang around in queues (which seem to be a feature of the hotel) for quite a while. In addition the hotel is off the beaten track and the hotel shuttle bus driver from the airport seemed reluctant to take me there and wouldn't give me a receipt. The hotel seems to cater for the Chinese market and some staff had difficulty understanding English. The hotel is adjacent to a shopping mall but is otherwise quite a distance from any of the tourist sites or the downtown area. When I checked out I again had to join the endless queues and wasn't give a receipt which I still have to chase. Breakfast however was great, plenty of whatever you could want. This hotel seems to cater for large numbers of guests but could do with more staff to cope with them.

<Content>Excellent hotel in an intersting part of the city The Royal Plaza has a slightly dated but elegant charm. We were upgraded on arrival to an Executive Room but instructed not to use the Executive Lounge - this didn't bother us, we weren't fussed about getting a few extra snacks or drinks. Room was excellent and difficult to fault - it was clean, nicely laid out and the bed was comfortable. The view was also fairly stunning and very to different to the much talked about Harbour views of Tsim Sha Tsui. We thought the location was great. Both Mongkok stations are easily accessible (KCR particularly so) and if you step off the raised walkway to Mongkok MTR you are instantly immersed in the vibrant life of the local area. That said, if you plan to spend most of your time on the Island, you might want to consider somewhere else. We didn't and had a great time exploring Mongkok and going north to Kowloon Tung and Sha Tin, as well as down to Central; but if you want to spend most of your time on the Island, the train journey and the walk to the MTR might wear a bit thin.

<Content>lot of surprise i stayed at royal plaza for four night during my family trip to hongkong. I fell unhappy when i know that this hotel is far from the harbour. This makes my dream to have a hongkong bay panoramic window dissapeared. But, royal plaza hotel keep impressed me continously during my that make me glad to choose this hotel. The hotel lobby was very glamour despite it's an old hotel. The front desk staff was helpful and nice. In my first night i was upgraded to the club room. The room is new and stylish with new furniture and modern electronic devices. The bathroom was good in size and luxurious. I cannot enjoy the club floor lounge because we're arrived late night. The rest of the night we're stayed at superior room. The room still comfortable for us despite of it's outdated decors. The breakfast is superb with variety of food to choose. The hotel location is also strategic because it connected with century place shopping malls, mrt, and bus station. For people who likes to bargain, there's some flee market near the hotel too. I really enjoy my stay at royal plaza hongkong

<Content>You will not be disapointed A very nice 4 star hotel. Me and my wife loved the swimming pools (especially the hot water with jakuji pool). Breakfasts were very good with lots of options. Staff was very polite and helpful. Also the location of the hotel was easy to travel to and from any place. A clean and nice place to stay with an average price.

<Content>will return for sure This trip to Hong Kong was the first for me and I'm so glad I chose the Royal Plaza Hotel.The Hotel interior is pretty. It's design is of Western taste and it felt like home for me. The room is an appropriate size and the bathroom was big. I was pleasantly surprised since space is limited to begin with in the city.The Hotel staff was outrageously polite and nice. It was refreshing to see that considering I'm from NY. And believe me, the last thing you want is to have someone give you a bad day on your vacation.The location of the Hotel did wonders for me. It was connected to a large mall packed with shops, restaurants, and a movie theatre. So on downtime, just feel at ease strolling around. The Hotel is also connected to the tunnel that leads to the subway and loads of buses are just right outside the hotel.And last but not least, the price was right. For a young traveler on a budget, this allowed me to use my extra money for other things on my itinerary. I thought the price was very affordable and I definitely got more than my money's worth. I plan to return to Hong Kong soon and I'll be choosing the Royal Plaza Hotel again. The place enhanced my traveling experience for sure.

<Content>Great hotel with excellent service. Thumps up!!!! I stayed four nights at Royal Plaza with my boyfriend. It is highly recommended for couples. Our room is on the highest floor and is furnished with executive design, very clean and neat. The room service is excellent! They will tidy the room and replenish all the shampoo, tissue and even slippers supplies daily. They are thoughtful when they clean the room that that they will place the mineral water and cup by the sides of the bed and slippers underneath the bed. It is not so convenient when you want to go to HK island, but they provide free shutter bus to TST. However it is located near to the ladies street, goldfish market.. with many other great shopping lanes and Hong Kong Caf茅s that ideal for traveler who wants to experience Hong Kong Culture. I am so sad when I check on the last day. It's really a memorable stay for us. We will definitely go back again.

<Content>Royal Plaza, not bad, just kind of a hassle. The Royal Plaza hotel is ok, but the Monkok East station is incovenient if anyone knows the MTR (Subway) lay out of Hong Kong. While the east line at Mongkok station is new, that line is kind of a hassle when connecting to other stations and lines there. Very out of the way. Also, that station is actually a pretty good walk away from the hotel. I was under the impression that it was in the same MongKok station as the Langham with the same super nice mall there as well. Not so. That hotel (Langham) is in the regular Mongkog station, not Mongkok East. The Royal Plaza does connect to a very nice mall though and it has an ok food floor court. The mall and food court at the regular Mongkok station is far better!If you want to save $40 (US) a night, when comparing other like hotels, then do so, but the compromise is the MTR (at least it has that!). I always look at it in the sense that I can then buy an extra nice meal somewhere that night with the money saved.My room was exceptionally clean and my only complaint would be this: The room had a slight musty odor because of all the trapped humidity. This is so hard to get away from in Hong Kong as it is so humid, but other hotels that I have stayed at were not this way. (the Langham, the Intercontinental) Even the pricier Hong Kong Hotel had that smell to it when I visited the summer before. It's interesting though, when we stay in hotels in similar humid places (like in Orlando) they don't have that humiditiy (musty) problem. Maybe a central de-humidifier if that's possible? Some might then say that that's what airconditioners do (de humidify) but the longer I ran the AC the wetter that room felt. Call me picky, but I have a borderline asthma problem and I have felt my chest get tighter in these places. So it does make a difference.By the way, the gym there was pretty decent. IT had good treadmills, eliptical trainers, universal machinese and free weights with a very nice pool. For those tired of traveling and having to stay in a hotel, this can really help.

<Content>Business Class Stopover at affordable price It's much more civilised to break your trip to Australia with a stopover, and Hong Kong remains popular. We spent two nights unwinding at this very grand hotel situated in Kowloon and with far -reaching views of the ubiquitous skyline that is the hall mark of this great city.Very large and comfortable beds, huge flatscreen TV and small but stylish bathrooms, not to mention a courtesy bus that obviates the need to take taxis or public transport by regularly dropping you off/picking you up at Harbour City for the ferry to HK, or the shopper's paradise that is Kowloon.The hotel is located just above its own shopping centre, furthermore, so you may never even need to leave the precinct if pushed for time.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at this Hotel on the first leg of a world trip. Was a great start to our trip with nothing to complain about here. Room was very spacious with Flat Screen TV with English channels. Pool and Spa was great, Breakfast was reasonably priced and a huge choice from Western and Asian foods. Only minus for us was our friends lived on Hong Kong Island and this Hotel is in Kowloon so if you want to see more of Hong Kong Island you would need to stay there. The trains are great but still takes a good 30 - 40 minutes to get there.

<Content>Very good Stayed at the royal plaza for 5 nights. very large room, flat screen tv with lots of channels. Next to a shopping mall and 10 mins walk to 2 subway stations; one can be walked to without going outside. lovely outdoor pool and hottub. only annoyance was staff ringing to find out when they could clean the room when a do not disturb sign was on, which kinda defeats the purpose of the sign! apart from that, no complaints. would go back.

<Content>Our favorite Chinaspree Hotel This was my favorite hotel on a Chinaspree tour in China and Hong Kong. I would rate this hotel 5*. The rooms were spacious and had the finest sheets (1000 thread) I've ever slept on. We had a great view of the city. We ate at the restaurant in the lobby and it has a good selection of Western food. The hotel is adjacent to a huge modern shopping mall. My only complaint was that they wanted a deposit to use the phone, even for a toll free call they charge $4 per call.

<Content>Good Hotel We stayed at the hotel for two nights. Then we tried to book one more night but the hotel was fully booked and we had to search another hotel. This hotel is very big, very clean and the room was very big and really comfortable. The bathroom is huge. The staff is kind and efficient and they speak english and help you to communicate the adress to the taxi driver. The hotel is close to a mall and subway station is 5 min. walking. The location is very good. Just some advices: To stay in common areas (lobby, reataurant...) pick up a sweater because air conditioning is icy. Second is that we tried to get info at the travel desk about a couple of trips and the hotel booking prices are higher than the real cost and the information about duration and prices if you want to do them by yourself is not very precise (they told us that it would take three hours to get to Giant Buddha if we wanted to go by ourselves and it took 1.30 h) Despite that, this hotel is really comfortable, well located, comfortable, clean and nice and the swimming pool + jauzzi in the roof is...simply wonderful, specially after a day walking

<Content>great rooms It was a great hotel, with the Mong Kok east station below it. Prince Edward station was 10 mins away and Tsim Sha Tsui( a major tourist area) was 12 mins away by taxi. The prices were quite competitive and there is a free shuttle bus from the hotel to Tsim Sha Tsui, which compensated for its slightly inconvenient location.

<Content>Not Bad The hotel is very accessible since it is adjacent to the East Rail Line. It also has a shuttle going to Tsim Sha Tsui. The nearby mall offers many retail stores. It is also a 10 min walk to the Mongkok street market.The hotel's employees are not that attentive. Will totally ignore you unless you approach them and ask questions.The K-6 shuttle offers free transportation to the Kowloon Airport express.The rooms are not that great. Looks old but is big enough. The toilet is also OK.Breakfast buffet offers numerous food. Good food.

<Content>Outstanding Don't be put off by hotel's location, Airport Express to Kowloon and the K6 coach to the hotel's front door takes care of your arrival and departure, and the local MTR station (less than 10 minutes stroll through the flower market) gives rapid access to much of Kowloon and the main island attractions.The hotel room (Superior) was just that....large, well furnished, spotless with crisp laundry and deep feather pillows. The food choice (served on a buffet, come and come again basis) was outstanding, it was well cooked and thoughtfully presented.The staff were universally attentive and polite with no hint (as suggested by one or two others) of a don't care attitude. We were rapidly and efficiently booked in, greeted by every staff member with a genuine smile, and when it came to paying the bill we were truly amazed at how little the whole experience had cost us.We ourselves are quite picky people but we would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to even our most fastidious of friends. True, it is not a second Peninsula but it is certainly the best hotel we've stayed in for many years.

<Content>The best so far... We stayed at the Royal Plaza Hotel from March 27-30, 2008 and it is by far the best hotel experience we had in HK. We were pleasantly surprised of the clean, big rooms! (much bigger than those of the other hotels we've stayed in in HK). We requested for 2 connecting rooms and was impressed when the reception staff upgraded us to the 18th floor where 2 connecting rooms were available. Breakfast is good too! The hotel is connected to a big mall which is a big plus. It is also very near the Fan Yuen street market (about 5 minutes walk) and walking a bit further will get you to the Ladies Night Market. One can walk to the Prince Edward MTR station in 10 minutes.After a tiring day of shopping and sightseeing, it feels nice to come home to our room. My family and I would definitely stay at Royal Plaza on our next HK visit.

<Content>Pretty average I spent a week here in March and I wasn't impressed. The hotel is ok but nothing out of the ordinary. It was my first visit to Hong Kong and if I had to book a hotel for a new trip I would chose on close to the harbour overlooking the beatiful views there. Kowloon is a bit like the backstreets of Shanghai so if it's a Chinese experience you're after go for this hotel. If you're after a more upscale, Euro/US like stay go for Hong Kong Island.

<Content>Nightmare stay at Royal Plaza We stayed at the Royal Plaza for 4 nights at the end of our honeymoon. From start to finish it was a complete disaster.My husbands grandfather had died just the week before and we arrived in Hong Kong to find our luggage lost, neither of which were anyone's fault.But on the morning of the funeral my husband slipped and fell in the hotel bathroom cutting his nose open. He had to go to hospital having 5 stitches and because of this missed his grandfathers funeral.The hotel staff were totally unhelpful and didn't even seem to care that a guest had such a serious accident on their premises.Nobody came up to the room to see where he had fallen or to take details of the accident.I spoke to the manager asking for a letter from the hotel stating how he had obtained the injury which would make my travel insurance claim easier. They were not prepared to do this and they basically wanted to wash their hands of us.I could have understood this reaction if we had been claiming liability from them, but all we cared about by this point was getting home.We took advantage of the spa facilities and both booked a swedish relaxation massage with reflexology. This is serious misadvertisement! The ladies were definitely not trained in reflexology and the massage was the least relaxing hour of my life. if I wanted a painful Thai massage I would have asked for one.We then paid for a shuttle bus connection from the hotel on the morning of our departure, informing them we needed to be at the airport for 6am. Whilst on the bus the driver told us he was picking up from another hotel at 6am so we would not get there by the time we had requested. My husband called the hotel asking them why they had booked us onto a bus which would not get us to the airport at the time we had requested. The reply was that if we did not think we would make our flight we should get off the bus and make our own way to the airport. I am making a full complaint to the hotel now that we are back home, but I would not advise anyone to stay there if they expect friendly and caring staff, and a safe envioronment for their holiday.

<Content>Excellent hotel Stayed at the Royal Plaza Hotel on our way to Australia. Did a 2 night stopover in Hong Kong. Had no problems checking in and our room was huge. Couldn't ask for a better location, and a shuttle bus took us back to the airport (wasn't expensive) After a long day shopping, we booked into the spa for a full body massage and reflexology, for the 2 treatments it cost 拢50 and was worth every penny. We were pampered for 2 hours by adorable staff (they didn't speak much English, but had fun trying). Couldn't fault the hotel in any way, and what a bonus to have the shopping mall on your doorstep.

<Content>Always a good experience I have stayed at the Royal Plaza in Mong Kok several times over the last year after trying other hotels in Hong Kong. Each stay has been consistently excellent. There are many good reviews about this hotel so instead let me share some insight, especially for US travelers. First of all, Hong Kong is very easy for English speaking people to get around. The mass transportation is well marked and all stops are announced in Cantonese, Mandarin, and then English. Do not feel like you need to stay near tourist trap alley. You will be glad that you did not. I found the hotels in Tsim Sha Tsui to be noisy, dirty, and always hawkers standing around outside trying to sell fake watches. The Royal Plaza is a welcome retreat and only a 15 minute subway (MTR) ride away.The Royal Plaza is a short walk from the subway (MTR) and train (KCR) stations. Those traveling into ShenZhen will enjoy the recently opened border crossing at the KCR Lok Ma Chau station. The hotel is attached to the Grand Century Place mall which houses many restaurants including the Spaghetti House (in case you need a break from Chinese food). There is an ATM machine in the mall right near the KCR station (sort of under the escalator).One of the rituals I enjoy while staying at the Royal Plaza is an early morning walk past the fragrant flower shops and the chirping of birds in the bird garden. Puts me in a good mood. Both are right across the street from the Royal Plaza (take the elevated cover walkway).I have stayed in several different rooms. The 19th floor is the executive floor which has the same standard room as elsewhere in the hotel but also has a private lounge where you can enjoy cocktails, appetizers and breakfast (they charge for breakfast). If you can upgrade free to a suite you will be pleased. There are different sized suites, with the ones at the higher floors being the largest. Even the standard room is a good room.

<Content>Excellent stay at Royal Plaza We stayed at Royal Plaza between 26 Feb - 1 Mar this year. Arrived in the evening after a long flight. Check-in was smooth  was upgraded to deluxe room at no extra cost. I had requested to stay on higher floor  on a non-smoking level and I got it. Our accomodation incl. b/f at La Scala rest. Good range  service effiecient. Staff  expecially to Houskeeping were always very friendly. H/k is very fast to make room ie we went down to have breakfast  when we returned, toiletries were topped up, beds were made. RP is above Grand Century Place  connected to a big shopping mall. Also, East Mongkok mtr is under shopping complex. So, even though it may be far from the cbd, transportion makes it easy for one to travel between areas. This is the first time visit to HK for us, I can that HK has the best transport system, very user friendly. Overall, I will not hesitate to stay at Royal Plaza for my next visit.

<Content>Half Term Holiday in Hong Kong We stayed at this hotel for seven nights with our 5 year old daughter. The room was large with a settee and kitchen area which meant we had use of a full sized fridge and a small freezer compartment. The hotel was clean and the heated outside swimming pool was nice. When we went swimming a lifeguard was on hand. We found the check in service quite slow and as there were only two queues available for either check in or check out it was hard to be able to speak to the front desk if needed as it meant that you had to join either one of the queues.The hotel was connected to a shopping centre that had a MTR train station. Another MTR train station was within a ten minute walk via an over the road walkway which was undercover. There was a free hotel shuttle service to Kowloon MTR station where you could check in your luggage on your day of departure (Our flight home wasn't until the early hours of the morning).The concierge desk tended to ignore you if you went over to ask a question. Even though there were about six staff behind the desk with possibly one other customer. We went to ask if they knew what time Disney opened and I nearly walked off.There was an information desk in the shopping centre who were always willing to answer any questions or queries.This hotel is situated next to the flower market which we could see from our hotel window. The goldfish and ladies markets were within close walking distance.The hotel was very good value for money. Don't be put off by the front desk comments as hopefully you won't need to have contact with them except for arrival and departure.The cleaners were always very friendly. We would choose to stay in this hotel again if we ever went back to Hong Kong.

<Content>Not Impressed We just came back from a two night stay at the Royal Plaza Hong Kong and were not impressed with the hotel. Firstly, the lobby area has a certain smell which is very off putting. The hotel was not able to provide us with one bed and we asked if any upgrades were available. We were given the option of upgrading to a suite for $50-60 extra a night. Sounded reasonable so decided to go for it. Upon entering the suite, I was dismayed to say the least. The suite had a couch that looked beat up and just plain dirty. The kitchenette area may be useful to families, but just gave the room an outdated look. Due to the pool renovation, we could hear a constant and loud hammering noise from our room. I asked the front desk to switch rooms and was given a room on the Executive/Club level and was pleasantly surprised. Although it took us almost 30 mins to get to the new room, as the new hotel keys we were given, would not operate the executive floor and had to go back and forth with the front desk. Our new room was a vast improvement - looked modern and clean and bonus included the afternoon snacks and cocktails in the club room.Pros: shopping mall underneath bldg; near MTR stationCons: funky smell in lobby; poor service at check-in

<Content>It was fantastic! We needed a hotel with a great location and found it. We were upgraded to the executive suite so it made it even better. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We have 2 kids (15, 11) and therefore needed to pay for a supplement bed. However our stay was still great. It is linked to a big mall that is opened late.Did not eat in the hotel. The pool was to die for. Heated and relaxing.Although it was only for the night I would definately book again.

<Content>Fantastic break at the Royal Plaza Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Perfect location for what was our first visit to Hong Kong with transport systems being easily accessed from the Hotel. Check in was a bit slow and our room was not what we booked, but we were moved to the standard of room we booked the next day. All in all, hotel staff were extremely accommodating and helpful. Only ate in the hotel restaurant once, which was excellent (buffet restaurant). Have no complaints whatsoever in regard to the hotel.

<Content>We would not hesitate to book at the Royal Plaza for our next visit. My husband and I and our adult daughter spent four days at the Royal Plaza Hotel in January. Through Qantas we booked two rooms for which we had paid A$1000 in total for the four nights. We thought that was a very good price. We arrived at the hotel about three hours before check-in time and were unable to access our room until sometime after the official check-in time. This was because we were keen to have adjoining rooms with a connecting door on a non-smoking floor. There is a large shopping centre attached to the hotel so we used the break to rest, read or window shop.But it was well worth the wait. We had rather more luggage than usual but the rooms were large and well set out. One room had a king sized bed with a sitting area, the other had a queen and a double bed. Both rooms had a kitchenette but no cooking utensils. The hotel as well as being located next to a large shopping centre is also above the Mongkok East railway station on the KCR line to Lo Wu (Luo Hu) in Shenzhen. One can also change lines at Kowloon Tong to the Kwun Tong line or from the new East Tsim Sha Tsui station one can walk to Tsim Sha Tsui on the Tsuen Wan line and continue to Hong Kong Island.We have stayed at a number of Hong Kong hotels and would not hesitate to book at the Royal Plaza for our next visit.

<Content>Huge room Stayed at several hotels in HK before and this one beats all the other ones comparing their prices. Lots of places to shop and eat. Check-in took a long time but after that it was wonderful! There was a microwave, large refrigerator, stove, etc. in our room. Only stayed for 3 nights, too short! Would love to stay there again.

<Content>One of the biggest room in HK Stayed at Royal Plaza for 5 nights at the end of December. Several things I like it :(1) room and even bathroom are big considering a lot of HK hotels' rooms are small(2) you need room key to use the elevator which feel the security is quite good.(3) a huge shopping mall is right beneath the hotel. You can shop and dine inside without going out(4) train station is beneath (5) nice big flat screen TV(6) I put the room change tag outside the room when we headed out for breakfast. Room was changed right after we finished the breakfast (less than an hour). Very quick service.Dislikes,(1) it is quite a walk to MTR station (15 mins). My kids hated to walk back to hotel after a whole day event. We ended up taking taxi all the time. But taxi is quite cheap in HK.(2) Nearby Mongkok area has lots of good food and shopping (again 15 mins walk). But the setback is it is quite crowded during weekend. My wife likes to stay at Harbor Plaza more because the nearby Whampoo has less people and air quality is better.Anyway, it was a very good stay.

<Content>Good Spacious Hotel shame about the logistics I stated at the hotel over the christmas vacation 2007. It was what could be expected and nothing to add to what the other reviewers have commented upon. However, I have stayed in several hotels in Hong Kong/ Kowloon and hasten to add i did not like the location/logisitcs of the hotel. The hotel is almost located on top of a hill - to get to Mong Kok downtown you have to get out of the hotel you could either go through the main entrance, presumable take the escalator and take a 15 minute walk to the nearest metro or what i did and had no alternative to do was to go through one of the hotel's side doors which leads to a shopping mall full of people then you have to cross Mong Kok East Station, get on a covered walkway and then after 15 minutes ( with young children or elderly in tow) you find yourself on the main high street. I found this was not good practice when returning to the hotel at 2 or 3 in the morning after seeing friends as the walkway was very deserted and the thought of having to cross a deserted shopping mall at night to get to the hotel was a bore and chore in itself. Another thing, the side entrances are shut at 1am so you have to go on a hike to get to the main entrance which is a bit of a pain, some guests have strayed into the multi storey carpark as a result of the poor logistics. I will not be staying at the Royal Plaza again purely for this disadvantage otherwise if you do not mind the walk, do not mind returning to the hotel early, do not mind the treipze through a busy shopping mall to get downtown then this is your hotel!

<Content>It was fine! I stayed there for 2 nights on Jan 1st  2nd.the hotel was fully booked for regular rooms, so when i checked in i was upgraded to an executive floor, just for the room, not for the service.the hotel is just above a big shopping center with ok food, and a subway station which isn't the most convenient, but it will do.the room was clean, the service was ok, but definitely not something to write about either way, if you need a good hotel in HK, and Mongkok is your region take it, but only if they give a good price, i wanted to extend my stay but they gave me a ridiculous offer so I switched hotels.

<Content>Nice hotel Above average hotel. Good service, more so on the effort than the actual service. Not as polished as some other places. Overall the staff was very helpful. Close to nightmarkets, about a 5-10min walk to the Prince Edward MTR Station. Conveniently located next to a mall. Maxim's restraurant on the top floor of the mall. Nice clean updated rooms.

<Content>Love...love..love....Royal Plaza, Mongkok Short review: best hotel for first timer to HK, family with little childre/eldery. Very recomended! Big clean beds -big clean room/batroom, good price!Detail review: me and my family of 4 stayed there for 4 nights last december. When we got there it was christmas eve. They closed the main loby entrance and we have to stop at the mall entrance and greeted by their staff. They took care the luggages and accompany us until we get to the reception desk. It was quick checked in and the luggage came very fast too. First impression when we open the room was, oh no ,it so old. No automatic light. all light is old fashion, turn on and off individually. no extra security door lock too. Did we get the wrong hotel?But thats all, we found the beds quite bigs, enough room for 3 luggages, there were sofa and area that can be use for extra queen size airbed( which we brought but didnt need to open since the beds are big enough). the bathroom are cleaned. They have grohe shower that can give you water massage after a long tired day. We saw some western swimming at night hmmm it must be hot water in that pool...The mall attached was just great, many shops closed at 11, the foodcourt was excellent. the KCR train station and MTR station just inside the mall. Remember to use East Mongkok MTR, not Mongkok MTR or Prince edward. Mongkok MTR is ok if you want to walk a little but East Mongkok MTR is the nearest. just use the exit from the hotel to the mall, pass a couple shops and voila, the MTR is on the left. very nice!The area are save too, easy to get anywhere...there is a fruit market nearby, easy to get food, even yashinoya beefbowl from japan was 10 minutes walked.All the linen and all the towel (small, medium, big)replaced everyday. fruit market just a walking distances. A lot of cheap laundry too around the hotel. We will definitly comeback to this hotel if travel with kids.... just perfect. thank you to all staff at Royal Plaza Mongkok.

<Content>A Pleasant Stay My wife, my 8 year old son and I had a pleasant stay at the Royal Plaza. The staff were courteous and efficient. Check-in was hassle-free. The superior room that we got was large by Hongkong standards. We got a double-double bed with each bed approximately 4 feet across. The room also came with a kitchenette which came in handy when heating up some snacks that we bought from the night market. The room was clean, except that the decor looked a bit tired. Also the bathroom tiles could do with a little bit of cleaning up as the mildew stains were quite visible. The hotel would do well with little extras like a daily newspaper and free wireless internet which the front desk said did not come with the package that I booked. As it was marketed as a five star hotel, these extras are what one would come to expect. The MTR station is just a short 10 min walk away along elevated sheltered walkways. There are lots of shops and eateries in the hotel's vicinity, so you don't really need to eat at the hotel. Cafe de coral and Fairwood can be found in the adjoining Grand Century Place Mall so you can practically have breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner there if you are not so adventurous. Btw I had a scrumptious hotpot dinner at Cafe de coral for only HK$45. A good dimsum place, called Maxim's can also be found on the 7th floor of the Mall. If you are planning to go to Shenzhen, the train station is just practically downstairs at the Mall. On the whole, an above average stay barring those little shortcomings that I mentioned

<Content>the royal plaza rolls on... I have been staying at the RP for years now and every time I come to HK I re-book. It's a friendly hotel and the service is commendable.The hotel internet-rate is competitive, the rooms large, the buffet resto top-notch [although the oysters seem to have disappeared], as is the pool. The place has clearly much going for it.Nonetheless, the management need to be 'kept on their toes' however, eg I had to ask for a bath-robe as none were on hand, there was no complimentary fruit-bowl and so on. Additionally, I could certainly do without the excessively loud vocal 'entertainment' in the bar-area, all very 'naff'. A quiet piano-trio might be a better idea. The management might indeed try to go a little more 'up-market', given they claim 'four-star' status.

<Content>Classy, prompt and convenient Came across this hotel 7 years ago, when I was staying in Royal Park, Shatin. Back then, Royal Park was in the same group as this hotel ie. shared same shuttle bus and routes. Both are similarly linked to shopping centers and train stations, which are huge advantages for me. Just found out from recent trip, that both hotels are no longer linked. Still, the shuttle bus is still operating from this hotel to Tsim Tsa Tsui (TST), which is another big advantage for me, considering how TST is a tourist location for sightseeing and shopping.The hotel still looks great and classy after so many years. Service is prompt eg. housekeeping, bellboy, etc..Highly recommended

<Content>The Best We stayed at the Royal Plaza for 4 nights. Upon arrival we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to an Executive Suite on the 14th floor. We decided that we would and the extra amount we paid was worth every cent. The price included, check in and out on the 14th floor, afternoon tea for 2 hours, evening cocktails for 2 hours, a daily paper, internet facilities  meeting facilities.All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is located in Mong Kok and although it's a fair way from the harbour the MRT station is next to the hotel and it's close to where the shops are, in fact the hotel is located in a shopping centre.I will definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great room and location for young family We just came back from HK and we stayed 5 nights in Royal Plaza. We loved the location of the hotel as we went with two children below 4 years old. It's adjacent to the Grand Century Place mall with restaurants. Convenient for breakfast and dinner after a tiring day out. The 8th floor of the mall has a big restaurant with good dim sum which starts service at 11am. 7th floor has a Wellcome supermarket.Room size is good. The two double beds in our standard room was big enough to accomodate all 4 of us and we still had plenty of space in the room for all our luggages, strollers and play area for the kids. Service at the check-in and check-out counter was fast and housekeeping is also very efficient when you call them for anything. The La-Scala restaurant seems to be doing a roaring buffet business but we didn't eat there.The Mong Kok MTR to go anywhere including Disneyland is 10-15 minutes walk away via a covered overhead pedestrian walkway so you don't have to fight with the crowds at street level but be sure to use the exit with lift to get down to street level if you have kids in strollers. Beware, HK's MTR stations have more exits/entrances with stairways than lifts/escalators. Very stroller/wheelchair unfriendly.Overall, if we do go back to HK again, we will definitely stay at this hotel. P/s: taxi fare from the airport to the hotel is roughly HKD280-HKD300.

<Content>good hotel, great location Have just stayed for 5 nights in The Royal Plaza, Kowloon. On arrival, check-in took awhile and the staff didn't seem in any hurry to make it quicker! The foyer is really nice, and we stayed in a family room to accomodate 3 adults. Rooms aren't very big, but ok as we were only really in them to sleep! The only problem was that the beds were really hard but I think this is the case with all beds in hotels in Hong Kong!The bar dowstairs in the foyer was great, had happy hour from 6:30-9pm with 2 for 1 drinks, the staff were really friendly and nice. The pool area and gymnasium were fantastic, so anyone who wants to workout would love it.Location was great, just a short walk to the Ladies Market which I consider was the best of the markets. It is also very close to the MTR subway which takes you practically everywhere. It is also next door to Century Plaza which is a big shopping complex with all the usual shops, restaurants and cafes that you would expect to find in a big complex.Overall, a good place to stay, not brilliant but it suited us.

<Content>Great place to stay! I booked a executive club room using the hotel website. The accommodation was sexy, in the sense that it was spacious, cosy, comfortable.The hotel is located in the Great Century Place, with both the MTR and KCR stations at a walking distance, and plenty of places to shop from nearby.I enjoyed the food at the hotel. The staff was helping and friendly.The place offered great value for money, and an excellent quality of stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to experience quality time during stay at Hong Kong.

<Content>Royal Plaza, Mongkok, Hong Kong Excellent hotel in Kowloon with easy access to public transport. Hotel adjoins a shopping mall which makes for convenient shopping. Interesting street markets are a few minutes walk away.Downside was that we were unable to get a non-smoking room.That aside the Royal Plaza get our thumbs up. Staff were courteous and helpful during our weeks stay.

<Content>Very good value - But not great luxury We stayed at this hotel from 28th September to 4th October. On our arrival, we were impressed by the hotel driveway and fountain. We were less impressed by our check-in because we had to queue for several minutes. As we queued, we noticed that the wall behind the check-in desk was shabby.We had booked a 鈥楧eluxe鈥?room. Our allocated room looked dated and needed modernising. However, it was clean and its bed was comfortable. It overlooked various flats. (The hotel website stated that rooms have a, 鈥榖eautiful city view鈥?) Our room rate included buffet breakfast. It had a selection of oriental and western food. The quality of the food was acceptable. Plastic stirrers were left alongside the jugs of tea and coffee. We always asked for teaspoons for stirring our tea/coffee and for eating yogurt from the small plastic pots. Some of the waiters were unwilling to find us herbal tea. However, at least one of the waiters did want to help us and so we regularly sought after them. The hotel is above Mong Kok KCR station and it is connected to an upmarket shopping mall. Outside, the temperature was always around 30c but both the station and mall had good air conditioning.The hotels open air swimming pool and Jacuzzi were excellent. They were both large and it was great bathing in them on warm evenings.We believe our package deal for this hotel was very good value. However, we have stayed in much better, 鈥榣uxury鈥?hotels and we would have been disappointed if we had paid the regular rate for our stay.Mong kok is a great area for shopping because it has numerous markets and many small shops. However, we also found it to be dusty and extremely busy. We believe that first time sightseers to Hong Kong should try to book a hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui. That area has more attractions and it is close to the harbour.

<Content>Lovely hotel, near the MTR As soon as we arrived at this hotel we were impressed with the look of it. The lobby was spacious and very bright. The reception area was easily located to the right of the main doors. The recptionists were very friendly and helpful. The hotel leads on to a large mall, which has 7 floors of shops. Ideal for the tourist who wants to splash out on things. We bought so much we had to buy another case to bring the presents home.The area that this hotel is situated is near Mongkok, close to all the markets and near the MTR for trips to Hong Kong island. The MTR is excellent, it is cheap, quick and regular. The room in the hotel was good, not overly wonderful, but good it had all the necessities in the room for you to enjoy some relaxation time.The bathroom was clean with enough towels to enjoy a comfort hug.The lounge area of the hotel was large, it had 3 big TV screen's playing throughout the evening time. It is in this area that they serve cakes by the bucket full (provided you pay for them). The lounge had an excellent atmosphere in the evening when they had a duo who would sing requests...by the way they were very good.The food in the restaurant was really good and presented well, and the buffet was..WOW.Everyone of the staff were really helpful and we had no complaints. We could actually cash our travellers cheques without any problems..Woohoo!I would definately stay at this hotel again. It was a diamond in the rough.

<Content>Location is the only problem Very nice hotel, for some reason got upgraded to an executive suite with 2 bathrooms. My only words of caution if you don't know Hong Kong well is the location. You are a good 30 minute walk from the bay area and there isn't much of a view (despite the height) of anything but the run down Mong Kok area. Of course the magnificent underground (its built on one of the stations) helps you get around, but next time I'll stay in one of the numerous hotels with views of iconic Hong Kong.

<Content>Fabulous On our 4-week round-the-world trip, this was the joint-top hotel that we stayed in.We arrived mid afternoon after a couple of long flights from London and were delighted to be told that we were being upgraded for free to an executive suite on the top floor.After a welcome shower in the best hotel bathroom I have ever seen, we got some sleep in the amazingly comfortable bed. We woke up later that evening to find a note from the management informing us that we should not leave the hotel due to a typhoon. Even though we were on the top floor, we couldn't even hear the wind - it was only when we looked out of the window that we saw the damage that the storm was wreaking. The building felt very safe and our room was very quiet.We had dinner at the hotel restaurant which was reasonably priced and had very good food. Due to the storm's presence, we didn't leave the hotel until almost checkout time. We had a complimentary newspaper delivered to us. The staff were happy to store our bags for us while we browsed the attached shopping mall. There were excellent options in the mall for eating with large food courts, and we also found a place that could develop our photos.The airport bus is pretty reasonable and we plan on staying here next time we are in Hong Kong. The staff were excellent and I don't see any reason to look for a different hotel.Highly recommended.

<Content>Excellent in every respect Stayed here for three nights in August 07. Hotel: a large luxury hotel right in the middle of Kowloon. Due to its services and location, suitable both for business as well as leisure travellers.Location: a large shopping mall is next to the hotel (walk straight from the hotel into the mall) as well as excellent transport options. Surrounded by areas where shopping for clothes, mobile phones, electronics and various other items is great. If staying in Kowloon, this is definitely an excellent hotel option.Room: we had booked the room online at a good rate, and upon arrival were offered the executive package upgrade at HKD 360 per night. As we planned to stay close to the hotel, this was good value so we took it. It includes a room upgrade to one of the executive floors (18 or 19), plus breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks. Various other items are also included, and we found it well worth the cost. The room was excellent, very clean, of good size, with one of the best super king-size beds we ever experienced in a hotel (large, firm and very comfortable; great pillows too). Good size flat-panel TV, DVD player and around 40 channels on the TV; views over Kowloon and surrounding areas from the room. A good bathroom too, with shower over bath tub. Other items in the room included writing desk, minibar, electronic safe, wardrobe, and excellent air conditioning.Breakfast buffet: good variety, better than most others (a full range of continental and cooked items, with the usual egg-chef who does the eggs the way you like on demand). Staff: excellent experience with everyone working at this hotel, from the General Manager to the housekeeping people. All employees we encountered were very friendly and smiling, professional, and always trying to go the extra mile, offering to assist in various ways. When my girlfriend developed a shopping foot (foot hurting from several days of walking more than normally walking in a year or so) and we asked for advice, within minutes four people including a senior manager appeared, concerned about her wellbeing, organising a wheelchair and offering assistance. This hotel appears to be very well managed in all respects. After submitting the feedback form from the room at the end of our stay, received a personal email from the General Manager. Booking: we booked the hotel online at a competitive rate. The room we had booked was ready upon our arrival including a personalised welcome letter from management. When we upgraded to the executive package, the executive room was also available right away.Internet: the hotel has cabled and wireless in-room Internet at HKD 120 per 24 hours. However as we had booked the executive package, which comes with complimentary broadband Internet in the business area on the 19th floor, I only used the wireless in that area, which was working well.Restaurants: we only experienced the La Scala restaurant in the hotel itself which was excellent. Other than that, there are numerous, usually economical eating options in the area within about 10 minutes walk, ranging from Japanese sushi places with menus in English to tiny Chinese eateries hidden away in alcoves that have menus only in Chinese and serve very interesting looking dishes. In the shopping mall attached to the hotel are various fast-food style Chinese, Japanese and Western food outlets.Shopping: the large shopping mall that is attached to the hotel has a hundred or so shops of the kind that are typically found in large malls around the world (clothes, cosmetics, electronics, household goods, etc.), as well as a supermarket on the top floor. The whole area surrounding the mall and hotel is a shopping mecca, with clusters of specialized shops in specific areas (one street or block has dozens of cellphone shops, another many sports goods stores; there are several markets nearby, actually clusters of shops, including the goldfish market which is a cluster of several dozen shops selling aquarium fish, tortoises etc., the ladies market which is a street full of stalls selling cheap clothing and related items, and the flower market which has a large variety of potted plants and flowers for sale. The whole area around the hotel is one big shopping zone, and very busy. Shops typically open from around 11am till 10 to 11pm, with some closing a bit earlier.Transport: the hotel is built over a major train station and there are many city buses operating in the area. However to get to the hotel from the airport, the easiest is to take a shuttle at the airport which is a luxury coach that goes directly to the hotel. Enquire at booth #16 at the airport after passing through customs (Terminal 1). Cost for us was HKD 130 per person (Note on HKD: at the time of our visit the exchange rate was around 7 HKD to the US dollar, 6 HKD to the Australian dollar).Climate: we were there in mid-August and the weather was muggy; days were hot with clouds in the sky, high humidity and frequent drizzling rain. However all undercover areas are air conditioned which made this less of an issue.Conclusion: this is one of the best hotels I have experienced. Excellent in every respect, no negatives at all. Apart from the high quality of the facilities, a very big plus at this hotel is the friendliness and professionalism of all staff we encountered without exception. The hotel is also in a great location in Kowloon. I highly recommend this hotel without any hesitation, and will definitely be back here in the future.

<Content>Comfort and Location.. I had it all.. My family and I stayed at the Royal Plaza Hotel early June this year for 2 nights, and I have to say, we had a wonderful time there. The hotel is attached to a shopping mall and an MTR (mass transit railway) station which can take you almost anywhere from Disneyland to Mainland China. A few minutes walk out of this hotel, and you will find thousands of shops and boutiques. Finding food outside this hotel is also within 5-10 minutes walk.Now, on the hotel itself, we stayed in a deluxe room, which consists of 2 thick comfortable bed you would expect from any decent hotels. Nothing special about the room or the bathroom. It is however, very clean and comfortable. Breakfast buffet was just about average to me. Lots of fresh local fruits which is good to keep you hydrated because HK is extremely hot this time of the year. The pool was also nice with a jacuzzi and a steam room on the 8th floor.Overall, if I do come back to HK again one day, (which I'm sure I will as it is truly a shopping heaven), I will definitely stay at the Royal Plaza Hotel again, mostly because of it's location, and the comfort I know it offers.

<Content>Perfect location! My husband and I stayed at the Royal Plaza for 2 weeks in March. We had previously stayed at the Hotel Concourse (now the Metropark Mong Kok) so were familiar with the area. We decided on the Royal Plaza because it seemed like a good deal for a great rate. We were not disappointed.We travelled from the airport to Kowloon station via Airport Express (approx 20 mins) and then took a taxi to the hotel. I think there are buses available but this was the most convenient option. I highly recommend the Airport Express.The hotel is located in Mong Kok near Nathan Road. This area is less touristy (so you may see fewer Westerners around) but you do see how Hong Kong people live. It is very close to Ladies Market, Flower Market and Goldfish Market too.We loved the location as it is right on top of Grand Century Plaza shopping centre and the KCR station. The back entrance of the hotel leads into the shopping centre. The hotel is also connected by a covered raised walkway to most of the local attractions and Prince Edward MTR station (a couple of mins walk). The hotel room we had was located on the non smoking floor. We were very impressed with the size of the room considering this was Hong Kong. It was very spacious. The bathroom was also very nice and the power shower was great. The room was very quiet (I'm a light sleeper so this is important). The view of Flower Market wasn't great but that didn't bother us.There was a complimentary copy of the South China Morning Post delivered every morning which was great. The TV also showed quite a few channels including about 3 devoted to football which pleased my husband! I couldn't get away from English football even in Hong Kong.Our room rate didn't include breakfast so we made a trip to a local bakery most mornings for fresh Chinese cakes  buns (Jimmy's in Prince Edward). We only ate in the restaurant once for an evening buffet (La Scala). It was good but the Langham Place Hotel's buffet in Mong Kok is superior for a similar price. There are so many places you can eat in the area you are spoilt for choice. We would recommend the food court in Langham Place shopping centre near Mong Kok MTR. At the end of our stay we took a taxi from outside the hotel entrance directly back to the airport. It was quicker as we had an early morning flight. We would not hesitate to recommend the Royal Plaza hotel and are looking forward to staying there again soon.

<Content>wonderful wonderful stay The hotel enterance is rather unique as it has a long drive way. Lucky we took a taxi and he knew where it was. The staff were friendly and helpful and the standard room was excellent.It was like an appartment - with a massive bathroom with two showers and two sinks. The bedroom was spacious and elegantly designed. The living room had a sofa and dinner table and a small hall way. We were so surprised. It was shame we only stayed one night. I didn't want to leave.Prince edward mtr was about 7/8m minutes walk away. Lots of shops and resturants nearby and a great big shopping plaza next door - what more do you need!!!Top class hotel.

<Content>On Second thought, great location . . . . When we first arrived at the Royal Plaza we were a little bit concerned about it's location, the coach from the airport kept dropping people off and we were the last ones, seemingly getting further and further from the action. (Quick tip, buy a return coach ticket from the airport, it's $40 cheaper than buying it at the hotel)However, once we established our bearings the Royal Plaza is in an ideal location to visit Hong Kong and see all the sights. The hotel itself has a very grand entrance lobby, check in was very efficent. The rooms are clean, spacious and have an in room safe. The bathroom was nice apart from the actual bath which if you're under 5ft 5 tall won't be a problem.The hotel is connected to a large shopping mall called Grand Century Plaza, it's right at the heart of Mong Kok in Kowloon and is also home to the bus station and a KCR station. It'll cost $5 each on the KCR to the harbour and takes under 10 minutes, alternatively it's a 35-45 minute walk (doesn't feel that long though as there's so much to look at).The hotel is minutes away from the bird market, fish market, flower market and Fan Yeun St. market.We had a great time and would strongly recommend this hotel and location. It's close enough to everything to make it easy, but far enough away so that the traffic doesn't keep you up at night.

<Content>A 4-Plus Star Hotel Just got back from an eight-night stay at the Royal Plaza in Hong Kong, we paid for an upgrade to the executive floor during check in and it was well worth the extra cost (wireless internet at the executive lounge, breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktail drinks daily) plus being on the top floor with city view (don't even book here if you definitely want harbour view rooms - where it is located, it's mission impossible).You get an above 4-star hotel for a 3-star price (in fact I'd say even 3-star hotels in Hong Kong may cost more at times). We got a pretty spacious room and really good service. Staff members speak decent English (though in my case even if they didn't, it wouldn't have been a problem because I spent a few years in Hong Kong thus able to speak Cantonese), would go out of their way to assist you in whatever way possible. I won't say it's a 5-star hotel as it clearly can't compete with some of the 5-stars in Tsim Sha Tsui or Central. For the price point, its location, quality of the room and services though, I wouldn't mind staying here again. Those of you who want to stay in the touristy areas, Mong Kok (the neighbourhood where this hotel is) may not be your cup of tea, but if you truly want to experience real, local Hong Kong lifestyle this could be something you may wish to consider.I would recommend this hotel to business travellers as well (especially those needing to visit mainland China - you can take the train all the way to the border town of Lo Wu in less than an hour), Hong Kong has one of the best public transportation network I've ever seen anywhere in the world. All you need is an Octopus Card (you can get one from the Tourist Information Centre after exiting from the Arrival Hall at the airport) or at various ticketing outlets.One minor downside with this hotel is that there is no wireless access (at all) in the room and even after purchasing the executive package you will need to pay extra for in-room wired internet access. It didn't bother me too much as I wasn't there to stay in the room to net-surf hours on end while the hours the executive floor remained open were sufficient for doing what I needed.

<Content>Finally a good hotel in HK My family and I spent 5 days in Hong Kong. This is the 5th time we have been to Hong Kong and we have constantly been disappointed with the standard and costs of the hotels. Until now. The Royal Plaza is located in Mongkok on top of the railway station that takes you through to Shenzen. It is also on top of a large mall which has all the basic shops and restaurants (including a supermarket). The hotel is huge (~600 rooms). The staff (especially room service) are very prompt and efficient. The rooms are clean and quite large compared to others we have stayed in.My only gripe was that although the hotel has many signs indicating it is a non smoking hotel, it wasn't clear if this is the case in the rooms. We had a non smoking room but you could still smell the faint whiff of smoke. We figured out that near the lifts are some seats which appeared to be used as smoking spots by guests. The smoke was drifting down the hall. I can understand a non smoking rule being hard to enforce (read Chinese mainlanders), but for everybody's comfort it should.All up a great hotel, well priced and located in a non touristy spot. If your after a taste of the real Hong Kong but within 10 mins reach of the touristy side as well, then the Royal Plaza is a goer.

<Content>A Fantastic Stay! My wife and I just returned from an 8 night stay at the Royal Plaza. I booked an Executive Level room through the hotel web site. However, when we checked in at after midnight, they had filled all of their executive rooms. They put us in a two bedroom corner suite instead. The entire floor appeared to be recently renovated. The bed was comfortable and the bath linens were thick. For some reason, there wasn't a clock radio.Breakfast in the Executive Lounge on the 18th floor was fine. There was a decent selection. However, the selection of food at La Scala on the 2nd floor of the hotel was a better variety. Cocktail hour at the Executive Lounge was nice. You can easily make a meal of it. The pool and hot tub were nice. However, they close at 9:00 PM. Our only complaint was that someone was smoking on our floor or the floor below us. When we contacted the front desk, they sent someone from housekeeping to spray our room to cover up the smoke smell. The airport shuttle to/from the hotel is very convenient. The hotel is connected to a large shopping mall that also has a KCR train station. It's a 10 minute walk to the Prince Edward MTR station. Overall, a nice stay. We'll definitely consider it for a return visit.

<Content>Outstanding I stayed at the Royal Plaza in Mongkok for over a week in November/December 2006.The overall experience during my stay far exceeded expectations based on numerous trips and previous Hong Kong hotels. I would describe staff - from check in to check out - as quite outstanding: friendly, well-informed, helpful, polite and efficient. It was always a pleasure to deal with hotel personnel and to feel welcome and valued without a trace of servility and this began with my first e-mail contact well before booking a room.Even the airport shuttle bus connections arranged by the hotel worked without a hitch - something of a boon for tired travellers, though limousines can be arranged for those with deeper pockets!The rooms and other services were well above average for a hotel of this class - comfortable beds, airy bathrooms, and good facilities in general. The buffet breakfast and evening meals were certainly not conducive to those 'weight watching' - abundant good food and plenty of choice too. One word of advice: buy the pre-paid vouchers for both breakfast and evening meals from reception as you'll get far better value for money.The hotel is extremely well situated for Hong Kong's very efficient public transport - it sits atop Mongkok KCR station and is but a short walk from the MTR as well. It also runs a free shuttle bus to Tsim Sha Tsui something of a Mecca for unwise shoppers many of whom have been caught out by unscrupulous traders though the hotel can't be faulted for that in any way!The nearby markets - mainly the province of locals - are well worth visiting not only for bargains but the atmosphere too.I'd recommend this hotel without reservation to any traveller wishing to stay a little distance from the frenetic noise of Nathan Road - it's about 10 minutes' walk away - and who wants excellent service and good value for money.

<Content>Great Hotel, Recommended! We stayed at the Royal Plaza Hotel for about a month during Dec-Jan 2007 and it was a comfortable nice stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The cleaning people were great and were very curteous. They were professional and likable. We also recieved a free daily newspaper from the Hotel each morning which I looked forward to. The hotel is efficient and is maintain extremely clean and bright. A four / five star earned establishment. The rates were extremely reasonable too. We booked a special monthly rate from the hotel manager directly. This is one hotel I would recommend. Gary

<Content>A Memorable Experience..... Having not visited HK for nearly 10 years, I was there for a week and The Royal Plaza was home for that time. It was certainly 5 stars and it offered a cosier and intimate feel once you enter the lobby - a world apart from the hustle and bustle of most large 5 stars hotel. Some of their staff members did have problems with english but you would expect that in a country where english is not the first language. We stayed in a room on the third highest floor, or something like that. Not much of a view, but the room was comfortable and clean. It wasn't contemporary in design but somehow more nostalgic or English which added to the uniqueness of the hotel. Oh, did I mention that the corridors were really long and it does give your legs a great workout if you stayed at the end of the corridors! Breakfast at the hotel was good with a large selection of hot and cold dishes. Location wise, it was 15 minutes or so away from the heart of Tsim Tsha Tsui with the hotel shuttle BUT the area itself was self sufficient with loads of shops and eateries. If you want to experience HK and not stay in a too-touristey area, this is IT!

<Content>Not worth the trouble This hotel fell far short of expectations. The room was respectably sized, but smelt strange, and the air conditioning unit was cheap and didn't work well at all, perpetually either too hot or too cold. The beds were very hard and no spare blankets were provided. Sound-proofing was nonexistent. We asked to change rooms after four days and were moved to a higher floor, but the air conditioning still didn't work.Internet was slow and expensive, although a glitch meant for half of our time there we weren't charged for it. The only time period internet could be bought for was 24 hours, when all we really needed was 20-30 minutes. The minibar had very little in it - beer but no wine, chips and cashews but no other snacks.The hotel was overstaffed with people who didn't speak much English and were not particularly helpful - there would be three people standing in the lobby doing nothing, yet no one would open the door for you. We asked staff at the desk for places to go locally and they were unable to help. Bar and restaurant staff were pleasant but generally didn't come to the table or offer drinks, and on one occasion entirely lost our order. Room service staff didn't listen particularly well or couldn't understand, and brought us the wrong things.Additionally, the hotel is miles from anywhere. It is on the KCR rail line, certainly, but the KCR goes very few places and to go anywhere not on it (eg. Central) you have to walk ten minutes to get to an MTR station. The ladies market is nearby but we found that rather unpleasant - all the stalls sell the same things, and shopkeepers are either far too persistent or refuse to help. The only worthwhile attraction in the area is the Langham Place shopping mall - this is worth a visit even if you aren't staying in the area, it's quite excellent. Other attractions such as the flower market can be covered in half an hour.

<Content>Had a comfortable stay Just stayed in Royal Plaza Hotel for 2 nights. Its supposed to be 5 star but whenever I tell Hong Kongers that the response was How can there be a 5 star hotel in Mongkok? True enough it wasn't exactly luxurious and the surroundings are clearly not glam. But its clean and well maintained and the rooms are spacious. I had a very comfortable stay there. Location wise its quite good. Maybe a 10 minute walk to the nearest MTR station which would take you to most places you would ever visit in Hong Kong (Causeway bay, central, Tsim sa tsui etc etc) within a maximum of 1 change of train (except to Disneyland). The walk to MTR isn't uncomfortable since its sheltered all the way. Then there are all the cheap bazaars around at ladies market and fa yuen st. And cheap food all around, the hotel being situated in Mongkok.Breakfast at the hotel was quite bad (or maybe its because our group was huge and the prepared food separately and served us substandard food) but again, this being Mongkok, it your stomach is relatively strong, it shouldn't be hard to find yummy local food to fill your tummies.

<Content>Good hotel but a little was from Hong Kong island The hotel is of a high standard. Rooms are very pleasant with an LCD TV in each room with there being a surpring number of English channels on TV.Food is excellent although a little expensive when considering the number of local and cheaper restaurants.The hotel is in a great location fro shopping - it is located on a large shopping mall and is only a couple of blocks from large street markets which are ridiculously inexpensive although many of the items are, of course, fake. The hotel is, however, some way from Honk Kong Island, being at the edge of Mongkok (although only a $30 HK (拢2.50 / $6 US) taxi ride from the ferry to Hong Kong Island).The gym and leisure centre is superbVery nice hotel with few major detractions.

<Content>Great location Just came back from HK, stayed at the Royal Plaza for 2 nights. Was upgraded to a deluxe room at no extra charge. The staffs were friendly and helpful. The room was clean so is the toilet. The hotel is also located near the night markets. The sheltered walkway from the hotel to Mongkok MTR is a plus point as well as the shopping mall attached to the hotel. The train station below the hotel goes to China so its convenient for those who want to go to Shenzhen for day trips. I would stay in this hotel if I visit HK again.

<Content>Not too Bad I stayed at this hotel based on the recommendation of my travel agent. Initially I was told that this is a 5 star hotel but found out from some of the online hotel booking websites that it is more of a 4 star hotel instead. However, do not be put off by all these as the service that you will receive once you step into the hotel will make you feel like you are in a 5 star hotel. Front desk reception staffs were friendly and helpful throughout my stay there and facilities like the swimming and Jacuzzi pool were acceptable. I was allocated a smoking room and was duly informed by the reception when I checked-in even though I requested for one when I did my booking. However, the reception reassured me that the room had undergone a treatment beforehand. Once in it, I found the room very comfortable and don鈥檛 reek of cigarette smell at all! Everything was in the room as also in a good condition unlike some of the 5 star hotels I've been to where the cupboard doors were virtually going to drop! I requested for an ironing board and iron almost everyday and the hotel always promptly delivered it to my room almost immediately after my call. One thing however, was that the pillows were too soft and you may consider requesting for extra pillows. The location of the hotel was also superb as it鈥檚 located close to the goldfish market and the ladies market. If you are looking for cheap bargains, go to the shops along the alleys off Prince Edward Road as the stuffs that you will find at the touristy markets are generally more expensive. If you are taking the MTR to the hotel on a rainy day, alight at MongKok MTR station (Not Prince Edward Station) as it鈥檚 linked to the hotel's shopping complex by a sheltered overhead bridge. The walk will take you around 5 to 10 min depending on your walking speed of course. The hotel is also located above the MongKok KCR station where you can take the train to China or other more sub-urban shopping malls like the New Town Plaza at Shatin station. Overall, this hotel was a superb choice and I will definitely choose this hotel when I go back to Hong Kong again.

<Content>Great hotel and very good value Spent 4 nights at the hotel and was very impressed. Impressive entrance, good sized rooms and very clean. This is a top notch hotel.Nicely located outside the hustle and bustle of Kowloon. Has good links to train and the underground. If you like walking you can hike down to the touristy Kowloon or walk up to the New Territories.Sits on top of a shopping centre. Taxi to Kowloon Airport Station is around $HK40. We took the airport bus to the hotel and it was a very long trip. On the way back we took a taxi to Kowloon Airport Station, checked our bags in at the Station (you can complete your airport checkin at the station) and then took the very comfortable and fast Airport train ($HK90 each) - would recommend this option over the airport bus.I would say it is a fantastic hotel if you like to use your feet and be mobile - but if you want to be right in the middle of the action then you might want to select another hotel.
