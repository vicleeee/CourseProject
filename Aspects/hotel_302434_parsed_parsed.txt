<Content>maybe i just had a bad time! i was very excited about this place. i was let down. its certainly nice and plush, but the building is sideways to the coast it sits on, making all the views rubbish by default. our room's wooden fittings were very scuffed, but there were some nice touches here and there in the room itself. its miles away from anything, it didnt matter to us as we were staying with friends beforehand down the road. however cabs are so cheap you can get anywhere for less than æ‹¢5. the guys on the desk werent that friendly, and the shuttle bus they put on every hour to central was very late when we got it. maybe that was a one off, but its a nice touch.

<Content>OK hotel in very quiet area I stayed in this hotel for three nights whilst attending a conference at the adjacent cyberport centre.The hotel is good quality and does the basics well. It wouldn't survive in HK otherwise.Criticisms include hotel's location which is quite isolated and if you want to see HK Island you have to taxi into town and elsewhere. Also I found the style of the hotel a bit antiseptic. I was staying in the SPG club floor but still found the rooms small and lacking any charm. The use of mirrors everywhere creates the illusion of space but thats sort of cheating really. My room, despite being informed it was sea view, actually faced onto a hill and overlooked a busy road. No free internet service either. Nothing major just not my cup of tea.That said the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful.I would only stay here again if the room rate was well discounted as all the traveling about was wearing particularly in HK's heat and humidity.

<Content>Best Hotel I've Stayed In! I stayed at Le Meridien Cyberport during a recent business trip, and I didn't want to leave! The rooms were clean and modern, plus I had a lovely view of Telegraph Bay. The staff were extremely friendly and responsive, and the breakfast offering was wonderful. Everything about it was pure enjoyment. I didn't mind the distance to Central at all and the bus shuttle was efficient. I will stay again and again! It's possibly the single best hotel experience I've ever had.

<Content>rooms good as usual but service cold as usual Stayed here for two nights.....because wanted to use all the coupns before it expires.....stayed here in the deluxe suites... there is only two here..rooms as usual excellent big clean..42 inch plasma Bose surround speakers..super thick soft slippers..only in the suites...the premier suite here only one there is ,,, is not worth it... it is bigger then the deluxe suite but how they place the things in the room and the bed sofa and toilet makes it looks way smaller then the deluxe suite... the premier suite has less place to walk in the suite and to enjoy it... i would recomend deluxe suite or if you are in a budget then the deluxe harbour view room..

<Content>Worthwhile within its limits My last review from DC was long and rambling. This will be a little shorter, as I'm pole vaulting out the door to Shanghai / Hangzhou for business / holiday (which will spawn yet more reviews).I live in Hong Kong and scored a complimentary night in Le Meridien Cyberport as part of my gym / swimming pool membership at the hotel. So I know the city, local area and the hotel itself quite well.As it has been reviewed so many times now, I think I will make some very brief points:1. Do not stay here if it is your first time in Hong Kong. It's too isolated and quiet. You want to be either in Central or at a harbourfront hotel in TST. If you're looking for an affordable hotel on the Island that overlooks the harbour, try the Island Pacific or the Hotel Jen. They're not in a fantastic area but they're a short cab ride from central, are affordable and have good views. I would hesitate before staying in Wan Chai / Causeway Bay - Wan Chai is a bit seedy / scrappy, Causeway Bay is a bit far and you probably won't get much for your money (although the Park Lane is quite nice). 2. If you do stay in the Meridien Cyberport, go for a Deluxe Sea View Room. I really can't see how it would otherwise be worthwhile. You get jawdropping views of the Lamma Channel (effectively the entrance to Hong Kong harbour). As one of the world's busiest ports, there's a huge array of ships coming and going - it's always more interesting to watch a working harbour (cf a harbour largely of leisure like Sydney). I also love the way, in Hong Kong, mountains seem to meet the sea.3. Have a meal in the hotel if you wish. The food by the pool area, which is a great place to chill out, can be good if you want a casual meal. It's also fairly reasonably priced. The Japanese restaurant is pretty good, but overpriced. I daresay the Chinese restaurant is in the same boat. You could venture to a few of the restaurants in the Cyberport shopping mall. Remember, though, that the mall has been a bit of a flop and deathly quiet. Hardly an exciting night out. 4. Given 3, you should try to have a meal outside the local area. Go to Soho if you want. My recommendation, though, would be take advantage of your proximity to Southside. Try the Verandah restaurant in Repulse Bay or ask the cabbie to take you further down to the Stanley waterfront. If you want a relatively isolated stretch of beach with a nice bar, shell out a bit more for cab ride to Shek O (not super-close but a v nice drive). There's also some great hiking not far from Cyberport - trails start from the Parkview area, a short cab ride away. 5. The hotel is very contemporary and tasteful - only once or twice in my life have I walked into a hotel and thought I would happily let the decorator choose my wardrobe. This was one of those occasions. The staff were attentive and pleasant. The idea of Cyberport as a technology hub is simply marketing - the Meridien has no more or less technology than any other hotel. However, things seem to run smoothly.6. A few picky points. Given the design of the hotel, if you are in some of the deluxe sea view rooms, you are actually visible from an adjacent such room (some of the rooms jut out slightly to create this effect). If you walk into a room like this, I would promptly ask to see the alternative sea view rooms. Secondly, the bathroom is nice but has some annoying features, eg no hooks for towels near shower entrance, floor slippery without enough strategically placed mats, difficult to switch between various shower modes. Lastly, the gym is not super spacious and not all of the tv screens attached to the equipment work that well. Within its limits, the hotel is well worth a visit. Enjoy soaking up the decor and views, visiting scencic southside and munching on a burger by the pool!

<Content>Smart new hotel This was the second stay I had for business. I like this place mainly as the rooms are smart and modern (lots of glass walls etc) and the whole hotel has a good feel to it. Not too large. Staff are friendly and efficient. The breakfast buffet is well stocked and varied. both the rooms I had enjoyed views of the point. the location has its advantages and disadvantages - it's not exactly lively where it is. Not much around bar an expensive small shopping mall and a couple of restaurants - but being out of town could be a good thing. The office we were going to was in central and this was only 15 mins in a taxi.

<Content>Great Hotel ,If only the Taxi drivers knew how to get there! The Meridien was areally nice base for our stay in Hong Kong, the rooms are great, the staff was fantastic, the only draw back we found was that a lot of Taxi drivers did not know where it was!And it's a long way (by HK standards) out of town. (there are no rail links).We probably would not stay there again although that's no reflection on Meridien, just the location. There is also nothing really around there, in the way of bar's  the like !

<Content>Too remote for Hong Kong I booked the hotel direct and as I was staying for more than 21 nights, I got a great deal, averaged 105 dollars/night incl. breakfast, for a family of four. The hotel is relatively new and very modern. Beautiful minimalist architecture, very classy, none of the gold-gilded decor that is so common in Asia. The room was spacious and immaculate, flat-screen TV, rain shower, etc. The fitness room, small but adequate, nice overflowing pool. Speaking of pool, it sits next to the terrace of their continental restaurant, therefore you provide the show for nightly diners. The restaurants in the hotel are pricey and really nothing special. The breakfast buffet was ok but I have seen better for Hong Kong. Recommend going to the mall across the street to find cheaper and better eats, 10X cheaper!I really would not recommend this hotel to someone who is coming to Hong Kong for the first time and not well-versed in the local dialect, Cantonese is the first language here, not English! This hotel is far from everything that you would want to enjoy in HK, shopping, eating, night life. There is a bus depot right behind the hotel, with one express going to Central, but good luck with the others if you don't speak Cantonese, of course, cabs are never in short supply in HK but will eat into your shopping budget after awhile and there is not much around the hotel except for the movie theatre at the mall, even the mall seemed desert.  If the crowds, craziness and pollution of Hk is getting to you, then this would be place to sit and have a drink at the beautiful bar and take in the view with those dazzingly lights at bay!!

<Content>A Silly Hotel I decided to utilize my Starwood points on my short trip to HK so I only had 2 choices. I chose Le Meridien as I had good experiences with them in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur. It's a small hotel (it felt small anyway) and the first impression was as the name implies, quite high tech. The first impression of the room was quite positive too! Modern, straight lines everywhere, comfy bed. However things start to go wrong once you start 'using' the place. First of, they charge a service charge of HKD 40 to bring room service?? Then, wireless internet was free IN THE COMMON AREAS! To use your laptop in the room, you had to PAY! Then the taxi's oh boy. The first few trips to Central, we ended up paying over HKD 100 a pop. It turned out we were being driven around for fun. By right, the trip should not cost more than HKD 70. Oh well, it was not so much the money but the fact that it took a lot of time to run up the bill. The hotel was ok, but I constantly feel like they were trying to make it the guests' fault for not running a fuller ship. They even have a HKD 10 lucky draw in the lobby where you can win things... kinda desperate?

<Content>Stylish, Comfortable  I stayed at Le Meridien Cyberport in November for four nights with a friend. In general, I have only positive comments about the hotel.Upon arrival, my friend and I were upgraded and placed on a high floor. The check-in went quickly and the staff was friendly. The room was stylish, modern and, by Hong Kong standards, fairly large. I slept like a babe in the large, comfortable bed.The bathroom was also large and well appointed, with a very refreshing rain-shower shower head.I did not use the pool or gym, but did take advantage of the free internet service in the lobby. In addition, I found the breakfast buffet well stocked with American and Asian breakfast foods, plus many fresh fruits, juices and pastries.Many have commented about the disadvantageous location. This was my second trip to Kong Kong and I found the location only a minor inconvenience. Most of the places that I frequented in Hong Kong were only a short (and cheap) cab ride away; think 15 minutes and $7 or $8. For me, the comfort of the room definitely outweighed the inconvenience of the location.Moreover, Le Meridien offers great value, with very high quality furnishings and common areas, at a price much lower than more centrally-located five star properties.I recommend the hotel and would definitely stay again.

<Content>Great, stylish and modern hotel A very modern and smart hotel. Rooms had great views over the sea to lamma Island. Nice pool. sauna etc and a pretty chilled out place to relax. Cyberport isn't the best location and is just another of HK's many souless mall type spaces, but the hotel was great.

<Content>Fantastic service, shame the pool is in the shade! I stayed here on holiday en route to Oz using my SPG points and it was a great experience. We got upgraded to the top floor and the service was first rate; especially the concierge.Internet in the bar on the 4th floor is free - contrary to another review on here.The room was outstanding in terms of cleanliness and size - only complaint is the shower that flooded the bathroom each time but the pressure was great for those os us with long hair!And why put the pool at the back of the building which is in the shade by midday? Wasn't too crowded at all when we stayed.If on holiday in HK or relaxing I'd recommend this hotel as it's away from the hustle  bustle and right next to the bus station if you need to get into the city (though you'd never know it - no disturbance at all).

<Content>Different kind of hotel First off, the rooms are really interesting and different. Clean, comfy beds, lots of space, huge shower and bathroom and cool amenities. The pool is a very warm lap pool with the water overflowing the edges (not sure if its an infinity pool) but it was really beautiful. The air is fresh and you can see the ocean from the poolside lounge chairs. The restaraunt served good food although the breakfast did not have a huge selection, yet good enough for me. As a woman travelling alone, I felt pretty secure and the extra security lock on the room door was a bonus.The only negative is it is a good twenty min ride to the nearest subway. The MTR Central is the closest and they do offer a hourly shuttle for a price. Cheaper then the taxi I took but still inexpensive by western terms. The hotel is more of a business/boutique style with very interesting and creative flowing curtains, coloured lighting and wide open space in one of the bars. There is also a Japanese garden outside with goldfish in a little pond.I'd recommend it for business only, not for tourists as it is really out there.

<Content>A really nice hotel The Meridien Cyberport was a great experience! We stayed there for 10 days and were not disappointed! The rooms are nicely designed, comfortable, pleasant to spend time in. The views from it were breathtaking (mountains, tropical forest, buildings in the middle, plus the sea with huge ships coming by...)The pool, the gym, the bar, everything is a success. The staff was very friendly and helpful.The negative points: it's outside town (you HAVE to take a cab to get there, which ends up being a little expensive) and since it's a newly built area, it's still a bit dead and empty (even in the hotel).Although the stay was really great, I think I'd pick a different hotel if I should go back to Hong Kong, really because of the location. I guess Central or Lang KwaèŒ‚ Fong would be more lively.

<Content>Nice and modern, but not the best I stayed here because it was close to a friend's place in Aberdeen and the price was right. I had some concerns about its location on the other side of the island, but the hotel shuttle is only HKD 29 and can take you to central in about 15 minutes. Taxis are not that expensive and there is a bus terminal conveniently located nearby as well.The rooms are nice and modern. What bothered me the most, however, is that I got the feeling this place is really trying to nickel and dime their guests to death (and that they are not doing so well financially). The room desks have this tacky stand of things to buy, such as flip flops, t-shirts, etc. The Web site says the rooms have Hermes soap, but actually they give you a small sliver of house soap, but you can purchase a bigger bar of Hermes soap. The Internet is not free, which is silly considering that Cyberport is supposed to be Hong Kong's high-tech hub. As another poster mentioned, there are no robes and the pool does get crowded and noisy. Adults who want some peace and quiet will be disappointed at the pool (noisy kids everywhere), as well as everyone in the coffee shop being able to stare at them.The price, however, was over USD 100 less for other hotels on Hong Kong, and there is a post office, supermarket and a hard-to-find Starbucks located nearby. Forget the dead mall next door.I only ate the breakfast buffet, and thought it was very well done.

<Content>Nice rooms The rooms were quite nice but we had to have 2 with having 2 children, which made it very expensive. I would also agree that the pool area is quite small and crowded. It was not very relaxing to go for a swim as there were no bathrobes in the room so you had to go down to the changing rooms to get changed for a swim. The ladies changing room was way too small and overcrowded and I was worn out before I got in the pool. The concierge were very good and helpful as were the front desk staff.The breakfast and meals I felt were overpriced for the quality. Also no free Wi-fi outside the bar areas when the hotel is a cyberhotel.This is a pleasant trendy hotel in a pleasant quiet area . There is nothing nearby though really apart from a couple of very quiet restaurants and shops.

<Content>Very comfortable and quiet We stayed for 4 nights in the summer of 2006 in a standard smart room. We were delighted with the room and the facilities and were comfortable right away. We looked forward to relaxing in our room at the end of each day. The bathroom, with the fantastic rainforest shower, was great. The room is spacious, modern and definitely a lot nicer than the run-of-the-mill Mariotts and Hiltons in Canada I have previously stayed at for similar prices ($1,000 HKD per night). The pool (good size) and fitness centre (floor-to-ceiling glass overlooking the ocean) were neither too busy or too pretentious. The staff was friendly and helpful, but not overly intrusive.The only downside to the hotel is its location which is removed from the city core. However, this actually turned out to be a positive as it provides a much-needed escape from the crazy intensity and density of Hong Kong. Furthermore, there is a bus terminus right next to the hotel and taxis in Hong Kong is very affordable (compared to Toronto); so getting around is actually very easy.We definitely plan to stay there again for our next trip to Hong Kong.

<Content>nice unpretentious hotel We hiked the Pokfulnam Trails daily while we stayed in Hong Kong.A convenient place to stay was the Cyberport Hotel.We could jog from the hotel up to the entrance of the trail at Pokfulnam reservior easily. The outside and setting to the hotel is simple and smart, quiet and modern. There is a huge plasma tv inside the room, but only for televison , no port exposed for own dvd player.We got a bay view on the top floor. The inside is ultra modern, with huge bath room , but only shower is offered, but you can sit down doing it.We tried the italian buffet one night , but it was quite expensive and the food is subpar to what I had in italy.Cyberport shopping center is only 5 minutes walk away, and there are many good restaurants there.The hotel bus goes to the Hong Kong center station hourly, until 11 pm. But one has to pay for the trip.The only complain is the hotel must be trying to be very efficient. There isn't much helpers around. It is not top level when compared to JW Marriott etc.

<Content>Thumbs Down!! We were very unhappy with our stay at Le Meridien Cyberport, which started off a big disappointment as the front desk staff who checked us in were cold, unfriendly and not helpful and made many mistakes. One would expect that the front desk staff would be more friendly and smile at their guests, but not at Le Meridien Cyberport - they had no eye contact nor did not show any teeth!! Their English was also not very good.The so-called technology at Le Meridien Cyberport seems to be working to their own detriment. Even their own housekeeping staff canéˆ¥æª› seem to tell the difference between a blue light outside the door (which means please make up room) and a purple light outside the door (which is supposed to mean do not disturb). One of their housekeeping staff actually opened the door to our room one morning while we had the purple signal on which meant do not disturb. Good thing we screamed really loud do not disturb and he closed the door right away. I would not want to imagine the consequence if the housekeeping staff (who was male) had walked into the female guestroom if she was undressing. The only good thing about the hotel was the restaurants. We tried both the coffee shop and the Chinese restaurants, both were good and the staff were more friendly. The restaurants were pricey but the ambience was good. Overall, the room itself was fine and the view was nice, but the service was terrible right from the start. This was a big disappointment for us, and we will never go back there again.

<Content>I Just Love Le Meridien Cyberport Stayed for 1 night and I wish that I could stay more nights. The room is just AWESOME!!! Very high tech and everything is combination of glass(ceiling to floor) and stainless steel..very stylish and sleek looking and baby crib that we requested is made of very good quality wood and beautiful shape. Our room overlooked ocean partially. Staff are friendly and courteous!!! The only con is that it is too far away from Kowloon but if you are visiting Repulse Bay and surrounding area, not a bad choice to stay in this hotel.

<Content>Hop on 69X We just returned from 4 nights stay at Le Meridien Cyberport. The hotel design was really modern, and we really enjoyed the big space of the room. And we didn't have any problem with the location, since the hotel located exactly next to bus terminal. Just hop on to light bus no. 69X and it will bring you to the heart of Causewaybay(not far from Sogo). And not to mention it's much cheaper than taking a shuttle bus provided by the hotel. Overall, I would say Le Meridien Cyberport it's one of the best hotel that we have ever stayed in Hong Kong

<Content>Beautiful Hotel We stayed at this hotel for a week at the end of September. I was travelling with family. The pictures that were posted on the site is exactly what you see when you get there. Service:Check-in was a bit slow because we checked in at prime time, but overall front desk was helpful and friendly. The agents working the door were acceptable. They could have been more attentive at times. Also, after 2am-4am there was no one at the door or front desk. I liked housekeeping overall. They were friendly and kept the room very clean. Rooms:Moving on to the rooms, there were beautiful and comfortable. The room is spacious, especially for Hong Kong. There was a large closet, electronic safe, nice TV with decent channel selections, minifridge, amd desk. There were no Hermes amenities as I see advertised, but I was happy with the amenities that were supplied. My only complaint was that there is a strong smell at times coming from the toilet. I thought it was only my room, but there was a similar smell from my parents' room across the hall.Extras:-I did not use the pool, but it appeared very small and faces the restaurant. -The steam room/sauna were small, but designed to be like a spa with good amenities. Each room only fits 4 people max. Sitting in the steam room actually felt confining and could be quite awkward when there is another person in the room because if its size. -The gym was sufficient for its size with new equipment-Two computers with internet connection are available 24 hours by the bar. However, after hours, it is pretty dark in there. I would always ask someone who is cleaning to turn on the lights. They should have a switch there or leave that lighting over the computers on 24 hours.-We did not try any of the restaurants because they seemed overprice and we came to HK to try the different foods out on the rest of the island.-There is an Arcade nearby (what we in the US called shopping complex). The food court is fairly priced, but there is not much real shopping in there. It can be further developed.Location:Hotel is in a safe, high-end neighborhood. It is remote and in a residential area. Since I was travelling with family, I like that this hotel is remote and farther away from all the noise and sounds of the city life when we returned to rest in the evening. However, I can see how travelling is a concern. I did not use the hotel shuttle since it was not free and I was with 4 people. It is actually cheaper to take the taxi when you have so many people. Taxis are readily available at this hotel. It costs about $60-80 HKD and 15 minutes to get into Central. Be careful with taxi drivers. One taxi driver tried to take us for a ride when we were visiting. Note their names and license. There is a number you can call to file complaints. Needless to say, that one sketchy driver caused me to look into alternative transportation options. If you would like to save money and are in no rush or if you are with 1-2 persons, public transportation is inexpensive and easily accessible right next door to the hotel. I took the bus from Cyberport to Kowloon for $10.6 HKD pp and got there in 30-40 min (depends on how far into Kowloon) We are crossing islands here. I cabbed it to TsimShaTsui for about $150 and saved only 10-15 min.You can get to Causeway Bay via the minibus for a $8.5 HKD pp and 20 min. Those minibuses are amazing quick and an interesting HK experience. It operates like jitney buses and stops along different routes. (I would only take a minibus from the starting to the teminal stop) It takes about the same time as the taxi, but the taxi sets you back about $80 HKD. A minibus is also available to get to Central for about $5-6 HKD pp.

<Content>Good Hotel, Out of the way location Had a great stay at this hotel - the rooms are really well turned out and the bathrooms are out of this world!My main criticism was that the pool and leisure area was very overcrowded at the weekend. As the weather was very nice on the Saturday, we wanted to take a dip in the pool, but were greeted with a sign saying that the pool area was full and we could not use the facilities. Having a quick look, every bed was taken around the pool and the pool packed. This was very dissapointing, especially as we had specifically chosen a hotel with a pool!My only other criticism would be the location, which is out of the way, and whilst there is a shuttle bus you do have to pay a small fee to get into town.

<Content>Cool and sleek, but out of the way The service was excellent and the staff was very accomodating! The room itself was modern and sleek, I felt like I had been launched forward in time. They provide shuttle service to and from the train station and metro so it's not a problem getting to places. This is a necessary service because the hotel is located a bit out of the city center, but it overlooks a beautiful bay so that's a plus! No complaints besides the distance factor!

<Content>Great Deal at Le Meridien Cyberport My wife and I stayed at Le Meridien for one night courtesy of AMEX and my wife's support of the local retailers (I guess). We are Australian but have lived in Hong Kong for several years and have stayed in many good hotels throughout Asia, often for weekend breaks. Our stay at Le Meridien Cyberport ranks up there with some of the most enjoyable.We were originally booked to stay in a Smart Room. These are the LM standard, face the mountain and have a shower only. The Hotel offered us an upgrade for HK$500 + 13% tax ($US72) which included:- Deluxe Ocean View Room (much larger than smart room and with a bath tub);- Buffet Breakfast for 2;- 'Standard' drinks in the Podium and PSI Bars until 10pm;- discount on clothes pressing and other benefits that we didn't use.Wanting an ocean view and bathtub in particular, we took the upgrade and were shown to our room (1203).The room had a 180 degree view of the sea (actually the Lamma Channel, which is a relatively busy shipping channel, but still relaxing to look out on) and was well appointed with slick, minimalist but quality furnishings and the various 'techie' mod cons mentioned by other reviews. The overall effect is smart and edgy, but it lacks the luxuriousness of, say, a Peninsula room. That said, the bed was devine, with a 20 inch mattress and rich linen. The bathroom was also modern and minimalist. The Hermes bath products were a nice touch and the rain shower worked well with good pressure. The bath was a bit on the small side, but adequate, and looked out over the hillside and the Channel. Modesty will dictate that many users will lower the blind, which is helpfully push button - controlled.The first of several pleasant suprises occurred when we went down to the Bars (Podium and PSI are adjacent, with the latter non-smoking) for a pre-dinner drink. Both overlook the water, have modern, comfortable furnishings and on the Friday night we were there, a pleasant 'half full' ambience.On being handed the impressive drinks list we were surprised to be told that 'standard' drinks were everything apart from the more expensive whiskies. As neither of us are whisky drinkers this was of no import and we proceeded to make our way through several cocktails (list price from HK$75++ or US$10++) which were among the best I've had in Asia.We had dinner in the Japanese restaurant, Umami, which was very reasonably priced. On the way to dinner we were provided with a couple of flyers offering complimentary Saketini's in the restaurant - do the free drinks ever stop we wondered!. These were very good also (esp the Lychee flavour). The Sushi and Sashimi platter was good, but the rest of the meal was average. Beware the calamari appetizer dish which, unbeknownst to us, was raw, very slimy and for us, inedible. After dinner we returned to the Bar and had very good espresso coffee and liquers (yes, all still 'complimentary') and a couple of good if not great desserts, whilst chilling out to some fine music and watching the lights of the passing boats on the Channel.Next morning we had the buffet breakfast in Prompt. It was excellent, though at HK$190++ per head if not incl with your room rate, is a bit steep. The restaurant itself is smartly decorated in a modern, stylish fashion, the Villeroy and Boch plates were large and well heated and the range of Asian and Western food fresh and more than adequate for most palates. Order a delicious cafe latte, incl in the price. Service here was, if not perfectly polished, certainly very enthusiastic as it had been in all areas of the Hotel.The restaurant overlooks the infinity style pool which, whilst a tad small, is certainly adequate for a decent swim and smartly decorated in granite with comfortable recliners strewn about the deck.On checking out, a quick calculation indicated that with drinks, coffee and breakfast we had been 'comped' approx HK$1500 (incl the tax and service charge) for our HK$565 upgrade. The room itself was worth paying the extra for.The downside of this hotel is that there is little else to do in the vicinity, esp if it is too cold to swim. The adjacent indoor 'mall' is a ghost town on weekends and the short waterfront walk (which in inimitable Hong Kong fashion has been obscured by a scraggly hedge), occupies a scant 10 mins or so. And whilst you can get a shuttle or cab to Central, you would feel very much out of the action if staying here. For this reason, I would hesitate to recommend the hotel to overseas visitors who want to see the real HK. But for HK locals looking for a brief respite from, visitors who may be attending conferences at Cyberport or others who simply want a smart, boutique-like hotel for a short stay, and who intend to drink and dine at the Hotel, the Deluxe Room at Le Meridien offers extraordinary value in a city where 'Hotel'  'Value' are too frequently oxymoronic.Lost in HK

<Content>Out of the way, but comfortable This hotel (as described before) is trendy, techie, and comfortable. -Rooms-I found the rooms to be very quiet, probably because of their location away from service doors, elevators, etc. I stayed in 3 different rooms on both sides of the hotel. Cyberport side with views of the buildings in the Cyberport complex. The other side with views of a hill and a very nasty looking -pink- multi-family home (but is probably valued at several million $$ US). The rooms had a musty smell and caused 1 change from a very musty smell to mildly musty smell. The Quiet Corner with a basin of scented of water was good attempt at something, but probably adds to the musty smell.Overall the rooms are nice, comfortable, with the bathrooms being the best part. The plasma displays are good also. The beds are comfortable.-Staff-The staff is mostly friendly, with the front counter help being a little stiff. The bellman were always willing to spend time on giving directions and marking up maps.-Food-The food in the resturant is overpriced, but their are other choices nearby in the Arcade. Primarily 2 resturants, 1 upscale, the other is unprentitous no-frills.Bars didn't have a good selection of beer. The bar did have a great view of ocean going container ships and assorted harbor traffic. Kinda makes up for poor beer.-Transportation-Yes this hotel is not located near central Hong Kong. But there are many ways to get to the Central station or other points in northern Hong Kong. The hotel has a shuttle ($25Hk) to central, making a round-trip every hour. A taxi (~$70Hk) is fast and convinent. Buses (a main bus stop is located on the 1st floor of the adjacent Cyberport) cost ~$5HK. The M49 to Central leaves about 5+ times hour. The 69X to Causeway Bay also leaves several times per hour. Once at the Central Train Station use the subway to get to places. It's probably the best urban rail transit in the world. Clean, on time,well planned and resonably priced. Note:Taxi scheduled for early morning pickup (5:30am) costs an additional $25Hk.

<Content>Modern and a little too young Stayed here over the New Year. Very modern and stylish decor and high quality furnishings in the room. The shower is glass walled to look out to the bedroom which is fun though with no door on the toilet it also means you can look in from the bedroom which is a little disconcerting. Breakfast buffet in the open kitchen was good. The staff were always eager to please but seemed to lack experience. That and the longish trip in to town, 150HKD to get to Tsim Tsa Tsui by taxi, were the only negatives though for what was a nice stay.

<Content>Great hotel if you don't mind its off-the-path location Le Meridien is a nice hotel in the western side of Hong Kong island. This is the more remote part of the island, and hence you are 15 minutes (by either taxi or minibus) away from tourist centers (a taxi ride to Central costs about HK$65, or US$8). If you are used to those hotels in Tsim Sha Tsui or Causeway Bay where you are minutes away from tourist attractions, Le Meridien is not for you.I found the room spacious and clean, and the hotel staff very friendly. Roomrate includes breakfast (nice buffet) and broadband internet connection. I had seriously considered Peninsula or Shangri-la that costs twice as much but decided to try Le Meridien. I was not disappointed. Highly recommended.

<Content>Excellent service. Overall an excellent 7 night stay. The room was spacious and well equiped and I have nothing but praise for all of the friendly and professional staff.A few things others may wish to consider:Out of centre, 15 mins by reg free hotel shuttle. Suited us but may not suit everyone.Not the quietest hotel in the world, lots of odd noise at night, loos flushing/phones ringing etc.Hotel partic resturaunts and bars very quiet, again this suited us.Not much to do around hotel, small mall and cinema.Overall however I would have no reservation in staying here again

<Content>Great Friendly Service My second stay here and it was even better than the first. The place is much busier and really buzzing now. I can thoroughly recommend all three restaurants for service and quality. There's a Chinese, a Japanese and a Buffet - Style that does a la Carte as well. What I like most is the friendly service - the staff remember your name and treat you like a person, not just another guest. Try and book a sea view - it is great to wake up to!
