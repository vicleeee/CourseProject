<Content>excellent location, close to everything! Lovely place. Complaints on expedia mainly had to do with the lack of restaurant, the rude man at the front desk - honestly, I didn't have any problems. I was in a single room facing the street/canal - it was conveniently located across from a tram stop - down the street from the museums... and walking distance to a wonderful assortment of shops. I was visiting near xmas (21-24) so it was beautiful - weather was warm and no snow (compared to -where I had traveled from - Munich - there was snow all over the place). So I would definitely travel again to this hotel.

<Content>Nice Hotel Our group of 4 stayed here for a long weekend.Hotel is in a good location and of a nice standard. All the rooms were in good condition and very comfortable. The bathrooms were nice.Checkout is at midday which is very civilised!The only gripe is that breakfast is not included. Breakfast costs 12.50 euros. There are loads of places within walking distance that do breakfast, so this really isn't a major problem.I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Perfect location, comfort  This was my second stay at the Dikker  Thijs hotel and found it great this time and last. This time we were mid week in the height of summer, a very hot couple of days (29 C), and air conditioning worked well - we were very comfortable in our generous-sized room which was immaculate, with very comfy beds.If you want peace and quiet, it is quite difficult to find in the centre of Amsterdam (capital city, after all!) so maybe go for a hotel further out (or take earplugs - then you can sleep thru anything!) The manager (Peter) was extremely welcoming and helpful, as were all the staff we encountered.

<Content>Little room on the canal We booked a room at this hotel, despite the negative reviews and were not dissapointed. We stayed in room 317 (facing the Prinsengracht Canal) which increased the distance to the noise of the rail line. The World Cup was in full swing, and the local square was a gathering point for the fans in Orange. So the noise level might have been elevated over normal, but didn't keep us awake at night. It would have been quieter further North of the hotel's location (towards the Anne Frank Haus) but then again most people don't expect Amsterdam to be a quiet country setting.The room was clean and the bed comfortable. We were out walking the city most of the day, so we didn't see the staff much during our visit. From this perspective, I have no negative comments.Internet access worked if you were a T-Mobile customer, we aren't so we went without. No big loss, as it would have been a distraction.There is a nice bakery across the street and local grocery stores within a short walk. Walking the few blocks towards the square will give the choice of more restaraunts than one can easily choose from.I don't think that I would rate the hotel as a four star, but I'm not into pampering either so it wasn't a critical factor one way or another. Amsterdam was a stop over point for a business trip to Brussels, so I used the oppertunity to visit the Anne Frank Haus and the Van Gogh Museum.I'm afraid I'm getting a bit to old to enjoy the atmosphere of Amsterdam, but it was a nice visit none the less. The Dikker  Thijs Fenice Hotel is a reasonable place to stay, and very close to many of my areas of personal interest.

<Content>Very Poor Hotel This is by no means a four-star hotel. It is seedy, dirty and rundown. While they advertise air-conditioning, only a few rooms actually have it. Mine did not. It was hot and stuffy. If I opened my window, I let in an enormous amount of street noise that continued well after midnight. At one point, I found my phone unplugged and had to squeeze behind the desk to find the phone jack to reattach it. Other than a closet for hanging clothes, there was no space for unpacking clothes. Yet there was insufficient space to set up the suitcase to live out of it. One positive feature was an in-room coffee maker, but you need to clean it yourself 鈥?even from the former guests. I noticed flying insects in the room 鈥?probably from the need to open the windows (with no screens) to make it livable. My three-night stay in this hotel was a most depressing experience.

<Content>Very expesive 2 star Hotel 3rd June, 2008. Reviewer : N+J, United KingdomWe stayed here for 4 nights in May 2008 19-23. We booked directly with the hotel and paid 676 euros for a standard double, (room 401).no breakfast included. This was our first trip to Amsterdam, we wanted to treat ourselves to what we believed would be a 4 star hotel. How wrong can you be? We have only 2 positive things to say about this hotel. Very good location, good maid service.The rest left a lot to be desired, overall we were very dissapointed. The reception staff were verging on being rude, they were totally unfriendly, and not at all welcoming.Reception area is very small.The room was drab, furnishings were shabby as was the bathroom, which also smelled badly. The hospitality tray was frugal to say the least. There was'nt enough drawer space.There was no view from the room. window latches were broken. We did not use the bar or dining room, they did however try to charge us for 2 breakfasts. We would not stay here again and will not be recommending it to any one we like !! TAKE OUR ADVICE TRAVELLERS SAVE YOUR MONEY AND STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE !!!!

<Content>Horrible!!! Do Not Even Consider It!!! This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. It is supposed to be four star, and was our way of spoiling ourselves at the end of an eight week trip. Well, we definately felt like something was spoilt! This hotel doesn't even rate 2 stars, I have no idea how they got their four star rating. The foyer is barely big enough to put your bags down in, the lift didn't fit both of us with 2 bags in it, the lift doesn't have doors and stops about 20cm below the floor, the hallway doors look like something off of Degrassi Junior High, the bathroom was mouldy, the toilet had poo stains in it, the carpet was rotting, the room stank, the restaurant was no more than a couple of tables for stale bread breakfast, the cupboard (not wardrobe) didn't have a hanging rack, the beds were small, the chair was broken and there was only one chair, the tv didn't work, there was no minibar, there was no room service, and I don't think the room had seen a duster or vacuum cleaner since the end of the war. Oh yeah, and the balcony with a view was 30cm by 80cm - not even big enough to fit the broken chair on. The two nice factors were the view was pleasant (but you could get it anywhere else in amsterdam) and the staff were friendly, oh and it was only about 150m from Anne Franks House. Please Please Please do not waste your money staying at this hovel, there must be other places to stay.

<Content>Nice hotel, good location \we stayed here for 3 nights room only - our room was spacious, very clean and comfortable. We had a room at the back of the hotel and although there was no great view it was very quite. The staff were fine, helpful and polite., The location was excellent, tram stop outside the hotel, alongside the lovely Prinsengracht canal, this area is central to all locations, all within walking distance (Anne frank house approx 15-20mins, Red light district about the same, museums 10-15mins to give you some idea of distance) We would definately stay here again

<Content>What a location! This traditional hotel has an excellent location as most sights in Amsterdam can be reached by foot or by tramway which stops in front of the hotel. Don't even think of having a car in Amsterdam!The hotel staff was efficient but not exactly warm and welcoming; the included comprehensive Dutch Breakfast with boiled eggs, yoghurt, fresh fruit, juices, various breads, cold cuts and cheeses was excellent. The Breakfast room is furnished comfortably and music plays in the background. Only Breakfast is served, no lunch nor dinner. Free WiFi in the building, including in rooms but if traveling without a laptop, you have to use a computer in the lobby and pay T-Mobile 5 Euro (approx $8) for a minimum of one hour use, what a disservice and how inconvenient for this expected amenity.Rooms facing the street have double pane windows blocking most of the street sounds and bathrooms have been remodeled; all spotless and well kept. One quirky thing is that the elevator doors have to be closed and opened manually so sometimes the elevator is stuck on a floor as the guest did not realize this requirement and the doors remain open preventing the elevator from moving.

<Content>Comfortable but not congenial We stayed here for six days and enjoyed a comfortable, good-sized room. It was reasonably quiet and everything in the room was in good shape. We got the feeling, however, that the staff liked everything about their jobs except dealing with the customers. Several times we waited at the desk for two staffers to finish their chitchat before deigning to deal with us. More than several times, no one was at the front desk and we had to wait outside, the main hotel door locked, before the desk attendant came back and opened the door. This was not late at night, by the way, it was mid-day. The staff were all polite, but in a very correct and frosty way, and they seemed anxious that any discussions with guests should not extend one second longer than necessary. We took it in stride, as Holland is an easy place to get around in, and we didn't need their help so much anyway. Be aware that most of the restaurants in the nearby Leidesplein are over-priced tourist traps with mediocre food. Fortunately there is a great sandwich shop directly across the canal, and many other decent places a short walk away.

<Content>Really chilled,great location We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights.It was literally 10 paces from the tram stop and for the ultra lazy, no traditional Amsterdam steep staircases as you can take the lift.We had a gorgeous view over the canal.The staff were so friendly and helpful. One of the guys recommended an excellent restaurant just down the road.The room itself was comfortable and spacious with en suite. They have a bar and breakfast room.The breakfast provided is buffet style with loads of choice and great coffee.It takes about 5 minutes on the tram into the centre of Amsterdam or a short walk.All around the hotel are restaurants and bakeries(and some coffeeshops).All in all, highly recommended.There were no real negatives and we would definitely go back.

<Content>Had a great stay in this hotel. Hi There,We went to Amsterdam for a long weekend, returning on the 18th November 2007.For value for money this hotel was great: It's central, comfortable and friendly. The staff were very helpful and full of good advice.There is some noise from outside but surely staying in a town there's going to be? I enjoyed hearing the trams and bustle of the town, surely this is why you go on a city break to experience city life and all that goes with it!The room was a bit of a strange lay out, but it was all functional and served it's purpose. Beds were really comfortable and the rooms were warm and clean. The breakfast was varied, not Full English but filling non-the-less, with pastries, toast (fruit toast too) eggs, cereals, Tea, juice and cheese etc.If you want a quiet holiday dont go to Amsterdam, it's full of character and life, and I would recommend staying at this hotel as it is in a good location.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel, Great location and staff The Dikker  Thijis Fenice Hotel - is a beautiful hotel - the staff are very helpful - the breakfast is excellant (fresh fruit, cereals, hard boil eggs, coffee, teas, fruit juices, different types of bread). The bedrooms are soooooo comfortable and clean, big bed, large pillows, wanted to take the bed home with me!!The location for visiting the sights is perfect, one way is Ann Franks house and the other is Van Gogh museum. Everything is walkable from this hotel but you also have the option of a tram stop outside the hotel. Getting to the hotel is a tram stop (tram 5) is right outside the door of the hotel from central station. You also have beautiful view of the canal. I read some reviews of other hotels that their was alot of street noise, well with this hotel their was none what so ever. The location is perfect for shopping and eating as you are in the middle of a excellant area for shops and restaurants. After reading alot of reviews about hotels in amsterdam i was scared that the holiday was going to be a nightmare - now after visiting this hotel and amsterdam itself - its my no1 city!!!!

<Content>Pros  Just back from a 2 night stay at the Dikker. Booked it as T.A. reviews on the whole pretty good and also keen on its location. Cant fault the reception staff, the breakfast was fine (albeit mayhem on the Monday morning) but the rooms could have been better. We requested a room at the front overlooking the canal. We felt the 2nd floor room was in need of an imminent update. The bed is too small by modern hotel standards and the pillows for us brits are useless. One is not enough and two is too much. They are made from a slab of foam, so have little give. The shower room is tiny and a bit grubby. Clearly there was once a door on the shower (now has a curtain) which fell off. Sadly the frame from which it beame detatched remains in its damaged state and looks awful.On the whole a bit disappointed with our room for which we paid 175 euro per night inc breakfast. However a great location for museums etc and having the 'benefits' of Leidseplein on your doorstep. Incidentally, the smoking rooms are for smoking, but not for 'smoking'. The hotel has a policy of NO 'smoking' or big fines.

<Content>Good location We stayed at the Dikker and Thijs Hotel for 4 nights in July 2007, room no. 307. The hotel is clean, the staff are very helpful and the breakfast menu was very good. The hotel is situated on Prinsengracht and this is a good location to get to most attractions. We overlookedthe canal and street below, it is a busy spot and the tram line is just outside. We found the first night rather noisy, however, having walked everwhere during the following days and sampling the local beers and wines we soon adapted! Would reccomend a visit to the Anne Frank House, 30 minute walk away, be prepared to queue for an hour or get there early. We also enjoyed visiting the Van Gogh museum and you have to go and visit the RLD! Cafe Het Molenpad serve great food,only 10 minutes walk from Hotel, do not be put off by its 'shabby' appearance, the staff are really nice and helpful too. The Pancake Bakery, 191 Prinsengracht, about a 45 minute walk away is wonderful, sweet and savoury varities. Haesje Claes Restaurant serve wonderful food, more expensive, worth trying their 3 course tourist menu for 20euros, very good value. We enjoyed Amsterdam and will certainly return.

<Content>Light Sleepers Beware! as others mention, the partygoers on Leidseplein can easily keep you awake until 6AM. Then the street sweepers and trams start up at 7AM.The hotel itself strikes a perfect balance between Old Amsterdam charm and modern efficiency. You may be able to get a room in back that's quieter, but that would eliminate the charm factor and for the rate they charge, that becomes a big issue.I'd imagine it's quieter on weeknights during the offseason, so if you want to stay for, say, Monday-Thursday in April you will probably be okay.The ideal clientele for DTFH are young people who don't have to penny-pinch and are in town to party. Stay out until dawn, then stagger back for a few hours' crashtime, then go out again for lunch, sightseeing, and another evening of bacchanalia. Repeat.But if you need a quiet place to sleep at night, you need to look elsewhere.

<Content>The Dikker was great! Stayed at the Dikker last month. So glad we chose this place! Everything we wanted from this hotel was just as it should be. Breakfast was good quality and plentiful, whatever time we went down. Rooms were spotlessly clean and large even though it was a standard room.Our request for a canal view did not go unnoticed. This made the stay even better! The location was great, right next to the tram stop for the centre and just before Leidesplein. This made it an ideal base to explore the whole city.The hotel let us leave our bags in a room before our late flight at the end of the week, which was apreciated.The only slight critism was no ventilation in the bathroom, which made it a bit stuffy but like I say, only a small thing really.All in all a great hotel in a great location. Would def. recommend to others.

<Content>good...after a change of room! We (middle aged couple) stayed 2 nights and our first room was at the front. At first we thought how nice given the view of the canal but we didn't think that at one in the morning we would be hearing the crowds on the street outside. Even at 6am I could here some awful Englishman singing God Save the Queen!! The trouble with the room is that there is no aircon and so we had to have the window open.The next morning we asked for a change of room so that we could get some sleep the next night. At first they said they were full. It took a lot of nagging on our part before they discovered that they did have have another room. This room was excellent. Ok, it was at the back and there was no view but it was considerably bigger than the first room and was quiet.Breakfast was good.Location is good, for walking into the centre and also out to the museums, although far from the station.In summary, the lack of aircon is a drawback, and makes the rooms at the front of the hotel unusable in warm weather. The room at the back however was excellent. But how does one get such a room? I had called the hotel before travelling and they told me my room was good and in any case`they refused to guarantee a particular room for anyone.So i would not use the hotel again.

<Content>Good value, great location Stayed for a weekend and can truly recommend a visit. Good value although not sure its 4 star. Def on the nicer side of town and right next to tram link to the station. Breakfast typical continental, rooms clean and staff (like most people in the city) were friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great hotel I went with two other single women and shared a big comfortable bedroom. Everything was as described and the staff were very helpful and friendly.Breakfast was excellent and we were given a free welcome drink. The area is excellent too with a great selection of restaurants and bars but it felt comfortable to us away from the centre of the city. The trams stop right outside the hotel and are very frequent. A great stay, we will definitely stay here again when we return.

<Content>Highly Disappointed My partner and I plus another couple were looking forward to staying at Dikker en Thijs for a long weekend in Amsterdam. I chose the hotel because I had lived in Amsterdam for ten years and had always wanted to stay there based on its reputation for being one of the best--NOT SO! I think it is time the hotel had its star status reviewed and at least one star revoked. From the moment we arrived at the hotel to check in we were treated coldly by reception. The rooms were by no means up to any four star standard I have ever experienced (our friends' bedding was stained). The rooms we were assigned were unappealingly decorated. All in all the staff was unhelpful and aloof. The only good thing about the hotel is its location and the breakfast was satisfactory. I would not recommend this hotel, especially as a four star category.

<Content>excellent This hotel is very well located just a stones throw from the Leidseplein , and close to loads of restaurants, and tram. Had booked a single room and was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a superior double, hence the good review. Would definitely stay again, hopefully soon. Great location friendly staff and clean. Particularly good in summer time , near Leides square.

<Content>Had a nice stay We had one of the smaller rooms and although we didn't spent a lot of time in the hotel it was a nice stay. Good location. Clean rooms. Very helpful and friendly staff. The breakfast is good. I was very hungover the day we checked out and managed to leave some documents and my montly travel card behind in the room! When I got back to the UK I called the hotel and they said that they kept all of it and will post it to me the next day. I received it 2 days later. They were very helpful and it was nice of them to keep what seemed like other people's junk. I will recommend this hotel.

<Content>Excellent hotel We loved the Dikker. The hotel was in a perfect location and we could walk to everything in Amsterdam from our doorstep. We had a superior room that was HUGE and overlooked the beautiful canal. The staff was helpful and very friendly. Breakfast was an extreemly nice selection of breads, meats, cheeses, jams, juice, fruit, boiled eggs, yogurt abd cereal.I highly reccomdend the Dikker to anyone visiting Amsterdam. In addition to the excellent services, the hotel was reasonably priced.

<Content>Great Hotel and Location We have just arrived back after spending three nights at this hotel. We booked it through KLM and it was such a great deal, return flights from Glasgow and hotel all for 拢165!!!The hotel is extremely clean and although our room 205 had its faults (rock hard bed, sink from bathroom in room area, shower head not staying in place) overall the hotel was excellent. The breakfast provided is more than sufficient and there is a great choice of variety. The location of the hotel is perfect, Leidsplien area is certainly the best area to stay in and this hotel is right in the heart of it and is literally three steps away from the tram stop. Although the hotel is located in a busy area we were not bothered by the noise in our room.I would definately recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>Excellent hotel and location This is an excellent hotel! First, the location is excellent! You are literally a stone's throw from the tram stop on Leidsplain. Also, the Leidsplain Street is awesome, with tons of stores, eateries, souvenir shops, and just about anything you could ask for. Lots of small bars, including sports bars, and nightlife that is within easy walking distance---literally 5 minutes! Now to the hotel---staff is very friendly and courteous. From the moment you walk in, you can tell it is an above-average hotel. My room was excellent---large, clean, big comfortable bed, separate shower and bathroom. After staying at a low-budget hotel in London for 4 nights, I had my best 2 nights of sleep at this hotel. If I return to Amsterdam, I will definitely stay at this hotel and I strongly recommend it to others! Also, the hotel booking was simple---I booked through the hotel's website...they used my credit card to simply hold the room, then I paid in full with the same card at check-out. They also accomodated me by storing my suitcase in a side room, since I arrived several hours earlier than check-in time. Strongly recommend!

<Content>Will be returning to the Dikker and Thijs Just returned from 3 nights at the Dikker and Thijs and can highly recommend it. We got a great deal on expedia, around 拢170pp for 3 nights and return flights from London, including breakfast (which we never got up in time for!). The room was huge with a view of the canal and the beds were clean and comfortable. Bathroom was also big and clean with an excellent fully adjustable shower with excellent pressure - great if you are a tall person as you dont have to duck your head to get it wet. Rooms had tv, minibar, desk, but no safe. Location is good, its about 20 minute walk to the RLD but you can catch a tram right next to the hotel. Overall it is quite central. Highly recommend this hotel and I will returning next time in Amsterdam.

<Content>Dikker  Only just got around to writing this.... We have had two great stays in this hotel, one last year and one in 2005. The location is perfect! The staff are very efficient and our rooms were clean, comfortable and reasonably priced. I have stayed in many hotels in this part of Amsterdam and DT is my favourite.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel Just spent 4 nights at this hotel and had a lovely stay there. It's in a great location with trams 1, 2 , and 5 stopping just outside the door (Prinsengracht stop). The Dutch staff were all professional and very friendly. I booked a double room (103) which was bright, modern, very spacious and very clean and comfortable. It was totally soundproofed. Although it was on the first floor with trams passing by I never heard any noise. It was air conditioned so window could not be opened. The bathroom was also large with a bathtub and powerful shower. The bed was lovely and I slept very well. My friend booked a single room (205) and this was also spacious and comfortable, and had a great view over canal. We were both delighted and will definitely be staying here in the future. We never made it to breakfast due to late nights but the dining room looked lovely. The room had tea making facilities and there are lovely shops nearby where you can buy croissants etc. They have a secure room where you can leave your suitcase if you have a late flight home. The area is beautiful and safe with lovely shops, restaurants, museums, cinemas all within minutes walking. The trams 1, 2 ,5, to/from Central Station only take 10 minutes and cost 鈧?.60.

<Author>Voyager2005
<Content>OK Amsterdam hotel, great location I stayed in this hotel in Jan 2007 for business. This is a fairly basic hotel with some nice touches. I booked a superior double room which was very large. Nice big bathroom, with lovely shower. The room had 2 twin beds, desk, minibar, tea / coffee making facilities, satelitte TV and pay movies. I was impressed with the room鈥?until I tried to sleep! The noise from the street comes mostly from the trams 鈥?trams in both directions have to use 1 tram line for a 20m stretch and the way they indicate to eachother who is coming through is to ring the bell. Fine 鈥?except when it鈥檚 every 5 minutes at midnight. There is also a lot of noise from the party goers that wander past at 3am. The hotel doesn鈥檛 seem to have done much to try and combat the noise 鈥?no double glazing. The front desk girls are fine and very friendly 鈥?but please try not to get the manager. He鈥檚 terribly patronising, and when I tried to book for a night the week after he told me the best rate was twice what it was on expedia. I explained this鈥?but to no avail. He told me to book through Expedia, not directly with him!The wireless internet is 6 Euros per hour.Trams go right past 鈥?a blessing and a curse. You鈥檙e right in the heart of lovely Amsterdam with Centraal Station only a 10 min tram ride away.

<Content>great location - bit shabby Thanks to previous reviewers I had a good idea what to expect and therefore was very satisfied with the Dikker.It is a brilliant location for sightseeing if you want more than just the red lights and coffee shops. Trams 2 and 5 from centraal stop right outside and it is a two minute walk to Leidersplein for other tramlines and all the restaurants you can possibly need. The red light etc are about a 20 min walk back into town but as that is through all the main shopping areas it is a nice walk.The hotel itself is a bit shabby - we rejected our first room (308) as it was almost underground and only had two small windows near the ceiling. The staff were fine about it and we transferred to room 205 in the older part of the hotel which had a great big bay window overlooking the canal and the street which made for great people watching. The room was spotlessly clean but well lived in! The sink is not in the bathroom but on a partition wall in the room. This wasn't a problem to us but may be to others. Breakfast is fab - a cold buffet that is constantly replenished right up to the end of the breakfast period and it's included in the price.There was a bit of noise from other guests - the walls are a bit thin! but nothing that caused a problem.

<Content>Took a chance on the D I stayed at the Ambassade on my last trip to A'dam and liked it fine, but was unwilling to pay the much higher rates there now. The location of the Dikker  Thijs just a block from the Leidesplein was a big plus, and their rates were much more favorable--AND included breakfast which the other hotel did not, AND included a free ticket to either the Van Gogh or the Rijksmuseum (my choice). Decided to try it. Glad I did.  I requested a non-smoking room, preferably on a high floor overlooking the canal. As usual, they couldn't guarantee it but would try. I said the high floor over a canal was negotiable but the non-smoking room was not, that I would look elsewhere if they wouldn't guarantee it. After two e-mail exchanges, the nice reservations mgr promised to block off a non-smoking room for me. And she did.I also got a great room--504--on the top floor except for the penthouse. Very big. (I'd only asked for a single.) It had a balcony with a great view over the rooftops and canals. My one Dutch friend came over and checked it out and was impressed. What's the catch, you're wondering? There's only one. It wasn't air conditioned. I understand some of the rooms are; this one wasn't. It was unseasonably balmy in A'dam (global warming), but nights were breezy and cool, and I kept the door to the balcony open, so it was fine. And there was also a tall, rotating fan in the room which I turned on but pointed away from the bed, as I don't like wind blowing on me.Breakfast was plentiful and good. It didn't vary, but as I was there for only 3 nights, that didn't matter. The staff was courteous. It's an old fashioned hotel in that they want the key turned into them whenever you leave the hotel, but I had no problem with that. They were prompt with their wake-up call and in calling a taxi for me on my last morning. I have no complaints about this hotel. I would stay there again, although if it were in the dead of summer, I'd want an air conditioned room more than a room with a view.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location We stayed at the hotel on June 16, for 3 nights. Location was great. It was very easy to find . Took the train from the airport and then onto the tram. It was right outside the hotel door. I found the Hotel to be very clean. The staff was very helpful as well. For the trams and entertainment being right outside your door. I heard no outside noise. Slept like a baby. Breakfast was very good. Plenty of food. Only some of the rooms have a/c . So it is worth the call or email before you arrive to try to request an a/c room.My husband and I loved Amsterdam and the hotel. I picked all of my hotels on my trip based on these reviews. And I was not dissapointed.Highly recommended.

<Content>some good points  Good points:*Great location (places to eat, drink, lots of shops, tram stops right outside hotel, beautiful canal side walks, brown cafes, coffee shops).*The surrounding area felt very safe  unthreatening at night.*If you get a room on the 4th or 5th floor, the view from the window is brilliant.*The windows in our room (on the 4th floor) were huge  one of them opened like a door so we could step out onto the small balcony (actually, it was more of a ledge than a balcony, nevertheless, it was lovely to be able to look out across Amsterdam in the mornings  evenings).*Plenty of hot water for showers.*The people in Amsterdam are really warm  friendly (a world apart from, say, Paris!!).Not so good points:*Our room was shabby  in need of modernisation. *The paintwork was grubby.*The shower hose leaked.*The hotel breakfast included green, furry, mouldy oranges, yumyum!*The room could've been cleaner.*There was quite alot of noise within the hotel at night (hotel guests).Hope this helps you to decide! Enjoy Amsterdam, it's a fantastic place.

<Content>Just fine It poured with rain this holiday weekend but our room was clean and cosy and had plenty of space. It is very well situated for visiting Amsterdam---museums, restaurants, canals, trams---though this might be a drawback in summer as the area is crowded and noisy. Fine when windows are closed but possibly less so when open. But this will be true of any other hotel in the area, as well. That said, don't let it put you off.

<Content>Great Great location, trams 1, 2,  5 right outside your door, the tourist bureau is around the corner and many restaurants to choose from. The staff was very helpful, gave us a choice of rooms and let us check in early. Depending on your room location it could be noisy at night, especially on weekends. This is one of the few hotels that includes breakfast in the room rate, it was a buffet and many choices were offered to please the guests. You can walk to Museum Square, the Anne Frank House and the Floating Gardens.I would suggest the hotel upgrade its linens, when one comes in from a busy day of sightseeing it is wonderful to come home to lush towels and bedding, what was there was average or below. The water pressure is good and the water was always hot.......It is a very nice Dutch Hotel.................the towels and bedding, if changed, would bring it to above average.

<Content>Location, location, location Just spent 4 gloriously hot days in the Dutch capital - hot weatherwise, that is (26C) - nothing to do with the Red Light District ;)Arrived at 11pm, after a stress-free journey from the airport to CENTRAAL STATION (train platform located right under Schipol - 1 way ticket to Amsterdam cost 7Euros/拢5). THEN got conned by a Turkish taxi driver outside Centraal, who charged us more because of ramps en-route to the hotel. Charged us a staggering 25Euros for a 5 mins journey. Compare that to 12Euros for a hotel ride back to Centraal for our journey home (booked via hotel). You have been warned...Courteous English-speaking staff at reception. Tidy, spacious en-suite room, with TV and coffee making facilities (a rarity for Amsterdam hotels apparently). On my first morning, found out that the shower head was broken and leaking everywhere. Uh, oh, here we go I thought. After noting the problem to reception staff, it was fixed by the time I returned at midday. Breakfast was fine - the usual croissants, rolls, cheese, hams, boil-your-own-egg, toast-your-own-bread, juices, tea, coffee.Fantastic location for hopping on Tram no. 1, 2 or 5 (PRINSENGRACHT) to Dam Square - tram stops right opposite hotel. The only downside was tram noises from 6AM - 12AM daily.Fantastic location also for nightlife. The cafe bars and restaurants of LEIDSEPLEIN was 2 mins by foot from hotel. Spoilt for choice, with abudance of Italian / Chinese/ Indonesian/ Indian/ Greek / Mexican eateries. Macdonalds and Burger King also, if you must. Perfect spot to people-watch and chill out with local Amstel or Heineken beer. Again, the ONLY downside with this location was the street noise from partying passers-by heading home to bed at 4AM.Great location for the museum quarter, with RIJKSMUSEUM (handy for those of you who want to see Rembrandt in a hurry) and VAN GOGH MUSEUM 5 mins walking distance. Went for a stroll to litter-strewn VONDELPARK as well - which was dissappointing to say the least. Even the lakes was like a rubbish tip. Litter was a problem at DAM SQUARE as well - had the city's binmen gone on strike?? I'm surprised Queen Beatrix hadn't complained from her nearby PALEIS...All in all, a hot, hectic couple of days in a fun-filled city. Head off the beaten (cobbled) tracks, to the quieter canalside streets for an oasis of calm.One final tip? Pack a good pair of trainers/shoes, and BEWARE THE CYCLISTS! Their right of way rules!

<Content>We will be back..... We will definitely be back. The location of this hotel was perfect for us(not in the center) but then again we are walkers. The room was very nice, double bed, chairs with table, desk ect.(as pictures on the website). The room had an entire wall of windows (don't worry there are blackout curtains) that overlooked the street/canal-just beautiful. The room had coffee/tea making facilities which was nice b/c I could have coffee whenever I wanted-and it was really good! The bathroom was a good size with a tub and good hot water and toiletries. The breakfast was more than standard which included coffee/tea/juices/granola and cereal/cold cheese and meats/breads with so many spreads to choose from/yogurt and fruit. It was more than enough to start the day and served in a very nice room.You had to leave your key when you came and went but it wasn't a problem at all, it's a small hotel and we never had to wait to do this-and the staff was very pleasant.The only negative I can say about this hotel is that the bed was very hard and uncomfortable but this is just preference (it didn't stop us from sleeping though). Also if you are a light sleeper you want to request a room in the back. The hotel is in a busy area and there is street noise until late-this didn't bother us though-again-just preference.All in all we will definitely be staying here next visit.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at this Hotel in March this year and I must say its great . The location is superb, the room we had was enormous and overlooked a canal. The room was well heated in the cold weather. The staff were helpfull.The only downside was the breakfast which was very average. However overall this was a great place to stay

<Content>Good location This hotel has a very good location for tourism and I think it is very good value for money. The hotel is right on a tram line. My room had double glazed windows and was quiet and very comfortable. But my friend's room did not have double glazing and he found it a rather noisy. So I would recommend asking for a quiet room.

<Content>Great location but luke-warm service We stayed at a 3 star Tulip hotel in the same area last year and here this year and so can compare the two.The location is great, the room we had was large, clean and well-presented. But I have stayed in better appointed 3 star hotels.This hotel was let down by some of the staff not bothering to be friendly (bar one exception who actually smiled)- we were not even asked how our stay was! This was in stark contrast to the staff at the Tulip who seemed to make a point of being welcoming and bent iver bacwards to be helpful. The person who appeared to be the manager never even said hello.The staff were certainly never rude and did resolve any problems that arose.The other area of concern was breakfast. One person was charged with providing and maintaining everything (the 4 star Tulip had several people on hand). Although he worked hard, it was just impossible for him to keep up with replenishing things to food and cutlery kept running out. Furthermore, you had to boil your own eggs and make your own toast and there was no hot food at all.These aspects spoil what could, and should, be a really good 4 star hotel.

<Content>location, location, location At the risk of increasing the popularity of this little gem, let me say what a delightful stay my wife and I had a couple of weeks ago.You couldn't ask for a more convenient location for lodging in Amsterdam. There is a tram stop for tram lines 1,2, and 5 right in front of the hotel. The tourist information center (buy an Amsterdam Pass!!) is 150 feet away. We walked to the Rembrandt Museum, the Van Gogh Museum, a canal boat tour dock, and even walked to Central Station one evening.Our room was pristine clean, good pressure and plenty of hot water, windows in room open, and the included breakfast included enough calories for a full day of touring (well, no beer calories at breakfast). Find those almost anywhere.The staff is pleasant and informative.So, don't stay here if its going to drive up the very reasonable rates, because my wife and I want to go back there for Queen's day in April 2007 and I want to stay in this hotel.

<Content>Fantastic value for money Got the room for 50 Euros a night through Bookings.nl. This included breakfast. The room was large, spotless and faultless. My first floor room overlooked the main shopping street with a tram line, I thought oh no, sleepless nights BUT the complete opposite, very well soundproofed and quiet.Two minutes from the Liedseplein and all the entertainment, a tram stop is 50 yards away which takes you to centraal Station in about 5-10 mins.I won't hesitate to book this hotel again for future stays!

<Content>A Big Fan I only had a chance to stay here for only one night during my stay, but my visit was outstanding. The room was relatively spacious and the service was excellent. The cleaning staff had everything in the bathroom gleaming. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially compared to the other hotels I've stayed at in Amsterdam. And the location is also a plus. It's right across from the tram stop, and within walking distance of Leidseplein, a square with a bustling nightlife (an understatement). While I wouldn't pay top dollar for a room here, I was able to find a deal on the Internet that made a room this high quality into a great value. Having that room actually improved my enjoyment of the overall trip.

<Content>Good Location but hated the Hotel!!! Stayed at this hotel last February 2004. Our room on the second floor was very small, dark and not very clean,the carpet was filthy, the bed was tiny and uncomfortable to fit 2 people. The bathroom was worse, the shower was tiny - the size of a small closet and very hard to move around in, outdated with mold and mildew on the tile, I was completely disgusted. The noise from the street was unbearable, I had a difficult time getting sleep. The only good thing about this hotel was it's location, close to all the Museums and restaurants. I will never stay there again!

<Content>Nice hotel I booked this hotel through an agency at the train station, so they had a great deal...80Euro/night. And I ended up getting the penthouse suite. The view was very nice. I'd rate it 3 stars, not 4 stars as was advertised to me. Room was clean. Free breakfast was basic (bread, cold cuts, cheese, cereal, juice). The location is great! It's just a block away from Leidseplein which has tons of restaurants. The tram stop is just outside the hotel.

<Content>Good hotel, great location for a reasonable price We stayed in a room facing onto the main street for three days as a city break we organised ourselves. AccommodationThe room was clean and well equipped with satellite TV, mini bar and hairdryer. The room was large, most of the furnishings were fairly new and the d茅cor was in good condition. The bathroom was a reasonable size although slightly dated with a full sized bath, the shower was both hot and powerful. The whole hotel was in a good state of repair.ServiceThe daily maid service to the room was fine, beds were always made, the bathroom restocked and cleaned. Reception staff were always friendly and helpful, they all spoke excellent English. We only used restaurant for the buffet breakfast, staff were slow to restock when buffet items (especially croissants) ran out. Breakfast facilities were the one area that the hotel was weak. There was just one household kettle for heating water for tea/coffee and a two slice toaster for making toast, inadequate for a 26 room hotel.FoodAs previously mentioned we only ate breakfast in the hotel. This consisted the usual continental selection of breads, cheeses, cured meats, fruit juices and eggs, everything was fresh and tasty.LocationLocation is excellent with a tram stop almost outside the front door and canal-bus stop within a few minutes walk. Shopping and restaurant areas are right outside the hotel. The obvious downside to this is that it can be a bit noisy at night, especially in the Summer if you have the window open. Would definitely stay at this hotel again when visiting Amsterdam.

<Content>Good central hotel. I have stayed in this hotel twice. It is perhaps a bit old fashioned but very comfortable.The rooms were very well furnished but the bathroom in one of them was poor for a 4star hotel.The location is superb and having a tram stop 20metres away is a real bonus.

<Content>Dikker  We chose the Dikker and Thijs Fenice Hotel because it included breakfast and 4* comfort all for 拢228 for three nights. On arrival, the bedroom and bathroom were clean, yet compared to other 4* hotels we have stayed in in Europe, it didn't compare. The bathroom was in need of attention with quite an old-fashioned decor and cracks in the tiles. The shower ran hot and cold water intermittently at extreme temperatures, with the hot water almost scalding me. Washing my hair was not fun! Even though it may sound pedantic, the towels were of poor quality, which, for us, summed up the 'cheapness' of the place and certainly not what we have come to expect from 4* accommodation. On the plus side, the room was clean and comfortable and of good size. It had all the mod cons expected apart from air con. Considering we went in July, the room was boiling when we arrived, which made sleeping difficult. Being in the centre of town around high buildings, even with the windows open not much air got around. Having the windows open every night was a must, but it meant a noisy night! If you want some peace and quiet, don't come to the Dikker! The tram goes right outside the building which makes everything vibrate, along with the constant dinging of their bells and engine roaring. The hotel is also very close to the Leidseplein, which is an open square of street entertainers. Also, it is a hotspot for drinking and late night revelry, and being as the Dutch are so liberal, this continues well into the early hours with large groups of people walking by the hotel shouting and laughing at 4.30 in the morning! Fortunately for us, we tired ourselves out every day walking round the city and discovering the museums, so we managed to sleep alright after the first night, but if you are a light sleeper it is something to consider. The hotel is placed in a very good location though, within easy reach of all the main attractions, museums and entertainment places. Three tram lines operate outside the hotel that travel in various directions all over the city and they are clean and always on time (although avoid rush hour!). It is best to go to the tourist info centre across the street from the hotel for a comprehensive map as the hotel does not provide a good one! They serve a continental breakfast in a lovely beamed room every morning, but the breakfast is pretty average - enough, but not very wide-ranging. The days we were there, the staff seemed quite stressed and not too polite at times, so if the hotel is fully booked don't expect big beaming smiles! All in all though, our stay was pleasant. I suppose for the money we paid, it was ok, but considering it prides itself on a 4* it didn't really match our expectations. If you see this hotel offering a good price, then take it. Otherwise, shop around a bit more. Some other hotels (4*) seemed a bit classier than this one!

<Content>central and dutch Had a great room with huge windows overlooking canal. Strange layout of room - loo was tiny but huge area leading to wardrobe. Didnt mind as dont really spend much time in room anyway. Minibar was brilliant as was very central location. I can understand what people mean about noise - but you are central in a busy city and i think the odd (rare) siren sounds very dutch and very sweet - we even sang along. woohoo!!By the way the staff are a little reserved but were extremelly helpful with keeping our bags safely before and after checkin/out. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>1st timers experience in Amsterdam a real gas! We just returned from Amsterdam and had a great time. Here our some of our tips. Hotel: We stayed at the Dikker and Thijs Fenice Hotel. This was a perfect hotel for us. We asked in advance for a room with a view of the canal and that's just what we got. The hotel has a small elevator and breakfast is included in the cost (We paid a very resonable 110 euros per night). Call them directly to bargain with the cost. The staff was friendly and accomodating. The room was a good size for the two of us. The best part of the hotel was its location in Amsterdam. This, in adddition to having a stop from the tram right outside your door at this hotel. We were a brief walk to Leidsplein, the hotspot of Amsterdam. The area is bustling. In Leidspein you can find reasonable restaurants great bars like the Alto (live jazz) and Bourbon Street (live blues and rock). In addition there are a couple great coffeehouses. One restaurant we liked in this area that did not break the bank was the Santa Lucia for pizza for 5 euros. As far as the coffeeshops go there were two in this area we liked: Rookies and Rokerij. Rookies had cold beer and a nice atmospere. The other was the Rokerij. Look for the purple light in front at night. Great atmospere, hot waitresses and good tunes. We spent most of our time in this one.Leidspein is also a great area just to walk around people watching and also if you want to do some limited shopping.One other coffee shop we liked was called Barneys on Harrlemmerstraat just west of Central Station, north of Jordaan. Great american breakfasts as well as other things and the people are real friendly.The transportation in Amsterdam is a snap. When you get into Central station by some stripenkarts. These are strips of tickets which can be used on trips within town on the trams, the preferred way to travel. We bought a total of 5 strips while we were in Amsterdam each has 15 strips on them and each trip typically costs 2 strips each and were good for an hour in case you need to transfer to another one right away. Here are some of our other sightseeing highlights not in any particular order:1. Riks Museum- There still renovating but there is still alot of paintings worth seeing.2. Sex Museum- Fun, eye opening with a few surprises3. Red Light District- Pretty safe althogh the wife wasn't the most comfortable.4. Jordaan- Beautiful canals, shopping and homes, a great walk.5. Anne Frank House- A must see for the historical value6. Van Loon Museum- See how people lived in the old days. A good look at a house that had a great deal of wealth surounding it. Each of the rooms are decorated differently.7. Delft- Get out of town and take this one hour trip, you'll be glad you did. This is where that fancy blue china is made but there are also many shops and restaurants in addition to some wonderful canels and old houses.8. Albert Cuyper Market- Fresh fish, trickets and T-shirts abound in this area just south of the Heineken Brewery.9. Heineken Brewery- It cost 7.50 euros to get in but I thought it was worth it. Two decent rides, 3 Heinekins and a complementary glass are included in this excursion.10. Singel Flower market- Beautiful flowers and good people watching.11. Walking the canals.12. A boat tour of the city- It's a great way to get your bearings once arriving and to see some good sights.Areas we wanted to get to but didn't:1. Van Gogh museum2. Vondel Park3. Electric Ladyland- In the Jordaan, if you like Jimmy Hendricks or neon this is for you.Places that we felt were overated:1. Torture museum- Overpriced and not worth your time or money.2. Moudenslot- This is a old castle in Mouden that we took a train and bus to and we thought it was alot of traveling for very little payoff.Final Tips:1. Make sure you have some euros on you. Many of the restaurants, bars and coffeeshops only take cash.2. Bring your ATM card. It's the easiest and most inexpensive way to get money.3. Beware, many of the restaurants are pricey $20-40 american dollars. The menus are listed outside the restaurant so you can check the prices.4. Buy a laminated map of the city to carry around with you. Make sure it lists the trams and the stops so you can plan your day accordingly.5. Hae some comfortable shoes, you will be doing alot of walking!6. Make sure to take time to walk down many of the canals.7. Talk to people in Amsterdam, they're wonderful and so laid back. Most of them speak english as well so dont worry about the language barrier.8. Pay a little more so you are in a good location near a tram. It makes getting around alot easier.9. Everything is smaller in Amsterdam. Smaller rooms, restaurants, glasses of beer, elevators if you have one, stairs are narrow, many hotels don't. Be sure to check with yours if that's important to you.10. Remember the conversion when purchasing anything. 1 euro=$1.31 in american money. Coffee in a coffeeshop is about 1.75 euros and that's the same price for a small beer.Good Luck and have a great time in Amsterdam!Jay

<Content>A Gem in Amsterdam Stayed at the Hotel March 2005.Selected this Hotel as it appeared to be reasonably priced for a 4* in Amsterdam, room rate included Breakfast.Entrance and Reception are small, and could be mistaken for a 鈥淥h well! Where鈥檙e only here for four nights鈥? however it turned out to be a very good place to stay, the rooms were spacious and with the facilities that would be expected, Staff were friendly, efficient, courteous, and 鈥榟uman鈥? not like some other places I have stayed.The location,a 5 minute amble from the Liedseplien, is superb. There is a Tram Stop (Lines 1, 2, 5, 11) close by, and Restaurants, Bars, Clubs, and Shops all within minutes of the Hotel, that said, we had rooms at the rear of the Hotel in the new part, and there was no noise at all from the busy life outside. This in effect gave us a base in the middle of an active, but not raucous, part of Amsterdam but was quiet enough to get peace, quiet, and sleep when needed.The showers took a little bit of adjustment to get the temperature right; they could however scald the unwary.Adjusting the heating in the rooms was essential, as during the night it did tend to get hotter for some reason.Hotel bar closes early, midnight, but there are so many bars close by, it is not a real problem.All in all a good place to stay if visiting Amsterdam, combined with a cheap flight, gives a reasonably priced comfortable City break.
