<Content>Great hotel We've a great stay in the Athenaeum Hotel. It's a modern hotel so it didn't have much character compared to the surrounding area/architecture but that didn't affect our stay at all. Our room was a good size, quite spacious and the bathroom included a bathtub. The room and bathroom was very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet had a good continental selection. The facilities were good as well, free internet access, gym and a bar for a drink at night. The location was great, just a short walk to the Duomo and we didn't need to use public transport when we were there. Florence is very quiet at night but we've had a great holiday and I would recommend the Athenauem to family/friends and would definately go back

<Content>It was okay This hotel had a strange feel. The staff were friendly enough but it was quite cold and lifeless. The room was clean and compact. It was fairly close to the main attractions - about a 5-10 minute walk. The breakfast buffet was plentiful but some of the items were quite tasteless. Overall, it was a comfortable stay but the hotel overall had little charm.

<Content>Great modern hotel Great modern American style hotel in beautiful Florence. Rooms are very clean and modern. Great change from the tired old hotels in Italy. Our room was pretty tiny though. Fantastic shower. Good high speed internet. 10 minute walk into main shops in Florence. Bring good walking shoes. Amazing leather markets near by.

<Content>Loved it This hotel is in a great location, clean, modern and has a great staff. I enjoyed staying there, and the bartenders there are fantastic. They concoct excellent drinks, and it has a great atmosphere. We went out in the Santa Croce district and had no problems walking back to our hotel at 2:30am after going out. It's definitely a great place to stay.

<Content>A great gem in a huge city We have just returned from staying a week in the Athenaeum and couldn't fault the service. The staff were all very pleasant, the food in the restaurant was superb. It was a shame that some evenings it was very quiet. Breakfast , superb and the Ace fruit/veg drink was very good. I was recovering from surgery and the whole experience did me a power of good. When we return to Florence this will be our hotel.

<Content>Very Pleasant Stay, Great staff This is a very nice hotel, convenient to the center but out of the tourist mess in the very center.Rooms are a good sized and we had a nice bath as well. Closets are small but functional. Our superior room had a large terrace and was quite spacious, standards are less so but still a good value.Breakfast was more than adequate.Staff overall was excellent, especially Alessandro at the front desk and Jacopo.Restaurant was disappointing though lovely. Pietro who seems to do a bit of everything provided excellent service.All in all, a very good experience and a hotel we would return to.

<Content>It's OK but you can do better... When you arrive you'll think you've got the wrong hotel, it looks as though someone started an office building and then changed their mind half way through and turned it into a hotel. The design and finishes are modern and of a good standard, but it doesn't really seem to know whether it's a tourist hotel, business hotel or boutique and quirky.The putting green on the roof of the bar suggests quirky, but nobody uses it. There is one suite (118) which has no view but has a good sized drawing room but furnished very oddly with a good meeting or dining table for 4 people. Some of the 4th floor rooms have roof terraces, but the rooms are small. Wireless internet is available on each floor.It's a good ten minute walk from the Duomo, and whilst the staff are helpful and the rooms comfortable enough, I think you could find somewhere more central and Italian for the price.Not bad though.

<Content>Fun in Florence Loved loved loved this hotel. Great for anyone - young, old, couples, singles, families. Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a birthday celebration and could not have asked for a nicer hotel in a great location. Staff friendly and service great. Ate in the restaurant and the prices were ok including alcohol.Florence itself is amazing - loads to do and could have spent more time there in fact planning to go back and spend about 4 nights.Would highly recommend

<Content>Gorgeous! Beautiful hotel on the outskirts of the city (about 10 to 15 mins walk to the central area). Very nicely decorated and well kept rooms, luxurious bathroom and they have an excellent restaurant in the hotel which offers a discount to hotel guests on their first meal. Free wireless internet access. The hotel staff recommended some really excellent restaurants in the area serving very typical Italian food. I had the best meal of my whole trip at one of the staff recommended restaurants! It's a real shame they didn't have an outdoor pool instead of the fountain in the courtyard!

<Content>Excellent choice, in a very expensive city. The Atheneum is a centrally located modern hotel, 500 metres from Duomo. The rooms are clean, modern and comfortable. The breakfast was a continental one (although hot food was available at an extra cost).Private parking is available at a cost of 20 euros per day.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Athenaeum Florence and I cannot fault this hotel at all. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. the room was cleaned with fresh towels and sheets every day. It is in close proximity to all the main attractions. If we return to Florence we will certainly book this hotel and I certainly would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip!!

<Content>A lovely place to stay... FOR MOSQUITOS!!!! Not knowing Florence and the area as well as we knew Venice and Rome (the other two destinations on our honeymoon) we decided to splash out a little in Florence and stay in a 4* hotel, the Athenaeum in Florence. We had seen the pictures from our travel agent's site and thought the hotel looked modern and attractive, somewhere that would appeal to us.We arrived and our hotel and room was just as we expected. Clean lines, unfussy decor, elegant and very attractive. We were pleasantly suprised,upon arrival to find that we had our own secluded outdoor space in the form of a small patio balcony.Aside from being able to say that the breakfast was good, there is not much more that we can positively say about the place.My husband and I were bitten to death by mosquitos that were continually flying around the room even though we never opened the patio doors! Mosquitos are not to be blamed upon the hotel, but clearly there has been a problem with them for some time judging by the ammount of squashed cadavres we found stuck to the walls, the doors, the bathroom.... We couldn't believe that a maid could clean the room and not think to remove the dead carcasses stuck to every surface! urggh... hardly the romantic setting we expected.The staff were never rude, but there was no level of personal service whatsoever. No polite conversation, no provision of tourist maps as we had had in other hotels along the way.The hotel had no atmosphere whatsoever. The hotel restaurant seemed to sing it's own praises in the hotel bumph, but we never saw a single soul dining there... perhaps they thought, like we did, that the menu looked pretentious and overpriced? If you're looking for a place to stay where you come and go without interaction then this might be the place for you, but if like us you enjoy the friendly nature of the Italian people, then head elsewhere. We won't be recommending this one to friends!

<Content>Small, modern and a little gem in a busy city My husband and I stayed her in April. The hotel does not look impressive on the outside, but once you enter it has a modern and clean feel, friendly staff on reception and a nice seating area in the lobby. If you are into old and traditional, this will not be the hotel for you. As we are in our thirties, we quite like the modern clean style that was evident throughout.The room was a good size and as we were on the top floor we had a large balcony which was lovely. The room was clean and had the normal robes, slippers and toiletries you would expect. TV was fine, but as anywhere in Italy, limited English channels.The bathroom was great, very clean and spacious.We did not eat in the restaurant (as we preferred to check out local restaurants) but we had coffee and tea in the bar both evenings. The bar staff were friendly and welcoming and prices were OK.There is a small gym (downstairs from bar) and free internet access (you get password from reception). The breakfast room was very nice and light. Food was limited and very typical of any hotel serving a continental breakfast. A bit more fresh fruit and nicer bread would have helped.I really recommend this hotel if you stay in Florence. I think most people who like a clean and modern feel will enjoy their stay in this hotel.

<Content>Great value, clean and stylish Hotel in Florence Having spent ages reading so many reviews on trip advisor and trying to get the best value in such an expensive city, I was very fortunate to get a deal with HotelsRUs in this hotel. It is a little further out - just near piazza san marco - about 8-10 mins walk to duomo and 15 - 20 max to p vecchio. Very Helpful staff, who will always help to get you taxi's and to advise you on your way around the city. Rooms are modern, clean and exactly what you need for a city break. Breakfast was simple, but got you a good start to the day.I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would go back again. If you wish to be right in the thick of it and enjoy the noise of the city don;t stay here cause you will get a little peace and quite here after a hectic day !

<Content>Great Hotel, Friendly Staff I went there with a friend just before the easter weekend. The hotel is very modern and clean. The hotel staff is also extrememly helpful, especially Alessandro who worked on the front desk. He also gave us good advice on making trips to Siena and San Gimignano, and booked a Chianti tour for us. We had a fantastic time there and were glad for the recommendations.The breakfast provided is a simple continental breakfast, but if was sufficient for us. The only downside, if there was one, is that the hotel is a bit of a walk from the main attractions. It takes at least 20 mins to walk to the duomo which is the starting point of the main attractions. a walk that's less appreciated after a full day of sightseeing. Other than that, the hotel was just great.

<Content>Very happy with the Athenaeum My husband and I recently got back from a 3-night stay at the Athenaeum in Florence and overall had a very pleasant experience. We really couldn't have asked for something better in terms of price, location, and comfort. The Athenaeum is a new, boutiquey style hotel on a quite street about a 10 minute walk from the Duomo - location wise it's perfect because while it's very central, you're not surrounded by throngs of tourists the moment you walk out the door. Plus there are several restaurants within walking distance which are great for dinner. The rooms are comfortable, clean, and modern, the bathroom is a bit small but not uncomfortably so and provides all the amenities (bathrobes, slippers, vanity kits, etc.) and, if you get the superior room, they have this great little patio which is perfect for having breakfast or a cappucino in the summer months. Price wise it's very good value for money - we paid 150 euro a night for the superior room including breakfast - definitely a good price for a gorgeous city with overpriced hotels. Our only grip was the breakfast - there was a very meager selection, many of the items weren't fresh, juices were of the canned variety - but given that the difference without breakfast was 10 euro per room you figured you couldn't really lose - even if you just have a cappucino and a croissant. We had read that the hotel restaurant was very good but didn't try it... Also worth mentioning, the hotel has on-site parking for 25 euro a night, yes, pretty pricey, but worth it if you're touring the area by car as free parking is pretty much non-existant. We drove into Florence from Rome airport and found it very convenient.Overall I would definitely recommend the Athenaeum, we had a very good experience, and plan to stay there again next time we're in Florence.

<Content>Can't get better than this in Florence Just got back from a 4 day - 3 night break in the Athenaeum Hotel in Florence and would thoroughly recommend this accomm to anyone looking for a top quality hotel in Florence. Booked via lastminute and got a great price - upgraded to a Superior Double Room for just an additional 拢30 for the stay. The room was spacious - well stocked mini bar, robes, plasma, lovely big bowl of fresh fruit, large balcony, good bathroom - marble all round etc - bit worried that as we were next to the lift we would hear it all night - didnt hear it once - in fact didnt hear any noise from neighbours at all - so its well built from a soundproofing perspective.Good location - 10 minutes walk to the Duomo and central Florence - all staff were extremely courteous and friendly from reception to bar to restuarants and went out of their way to ensure we had an enjoyable stay. Breakfast was good and dinner in the restuarant was superb - great quality food and wine and not as expensive as I expected for a 'downtown' quality hotel.Another nice touch was the free WiFi - why dont more hotels offer this ? - (I know the answer so please no replies!!)All in all - both myself and my wife loved this place and will definitely return.

<Content>10 on 10 Just (literally) returned from our stay here. Outstanding hotel (and that's coming from someone notoriously fussy). Clean, modern, luxurious and cool. I took my girlfriend for her birthday and she loved this hotel - perfect for young couples or those that appreciate a more modern setting. The rooms are spacious and have everything you need as well as a few nice additional touches that you wouldn't necessarily expect from a 4 star (bath robes and slippers, flat screen tv, free internet access, pool room, cool water features etc)The restaurant in the hotel is amazing, fairly expensive, but well worth it! Beef fillet was fantastic and the waiters were very attentive and polite. Really, really recommend you try at least one meal here, wherever you stay!All in all a superb hotel. Granted, it is not the closest hotel to the very heart of Florence, but it is only a 5-10 minute (max) stroll away to the hustle and bustle of the main attractions 鈥?hardly a marathon by any stretch of the imagination.If anyone is planning a trip and wants to ask any questions about arrangements etc, please feel free..... We travelled to Pisa airport and took train to SMN, via Pisa Centralle so we could see the Leaning Tower - a must!!

<Content>very good hotel, if too modern for some tastes We liked this hotel. We found neither of the problems others referred to: there was no problem about our booking; and we did not mind being slightly away from some of the sights - indeed the best sight of all, the San Marco monastery, is just a few yards away.We had a superior room - large bright and comfortable, with well appointed bathroom. The breakfast was fine. The staff were helpful and recommended a good restaurant. Everything worked well. Free internet. To me, the cool, clean, modern style was a bit too, well, cool, clean, and modern (I longed for a bit of old-style cluttered homeliness), but this is just a matter of taste. No kettles in the room was a small draw-back (too un-cool?), but otherwise an impressive and stylish place to which we would certainly return.

<Content>Lovely hotel - would undoubtedly recommend it I was a little concerned with the reviews saying that this hotel did not always reserve your booking and that people were bumped to a lower class of hotel. We had no problem with our reservation (through lastminute.com) but I can imagine the disappointment had we been forced to go elsewhere because this hotel is lovely, and there isn't one of the same standard for miles.The rooms are beautiful - spacious with marbled bathrooms. They are all in good condition. There is a bar and restaurant - and you even receive a 10% off discount - I would recommend the Steak Fiorentina (shared between 2 people of course) - it is magnificent. You also get complimentary battered vegetables with your meal! Room service finishes a little early for my liking (9.30pm), but there is a supermarket nearby. Breakfast was excellent - a hot buffet but they are certainly strict with the times and cordon off the restaurant by 10.30 am!The location is excellent 10 minutes walk from the Duomo...in a striaght line!Having seen a few other hotels in Florence I would definately recommend and return to The Atheneum!

<Content>Florence was lovely, but !!! The hotel it self was lovely. The rooms were great and it was a short distance to see David and a little longer to see the Duomo. You can walk all around the city from there. Our only problem was that when we arrived we were told that there was not a room available and that they were putting us up in another hotel for the evening. The other hotel was not in the same category as this hotel. This of course ruined out first day as we had to check in one hotel and then on the next day check into the Athenaeum. We could not get an early start. We booked our hotel and travel plans from Gate 1 who could not believe what happened. I will see what happens with them now that I'm home. There are so many places to see in Florence that 3 days was not enough. If your reservations go according to schedule, you should have a clean, comfortable room and a great time. They were very helpful after that and tried to accommodate us as much as possible. I would just check the reservations before time.

<Content>Great little hotel Booked this through lastminute as was looking for a good value but still luxurious 4* hotel for my Dad's 60th birthday. And we weren't disappointed. The hotel is in a good location - ok its not next to Il Duomo, but who wants to stay there?? - and is the perfect distance away from the Ponte Vecchio area to walk off the pizza and chianti at night! It looks a bit nothingy from the outside. However step through the doors and it was wonderful. Cool, clean lines, orchids as ornaments on the tables in the lobby, a great courtyard/atrium in the centre of the hotel. The room was great too, fantastically comfortable beds, flat screen tv, and cosy dressing gowns to wrap up in after a tough day's sight-seeing and shopping. Both Dad and I thought this little place was great and we will definitely be back. The buffet breakfast was good too and the barman even re-opened the bar for us after hours.

<Content>Fabulous Florence I have just returned from a long weekend in Florence. The hotel was lovely. The staff were really helpful - even at 5am! It was a short 10 minute walk from the Duomo down a straight street, which was no hassle at all. The rooms were of a good size with plenty of space and a secure safe in each room, and a large bathroom. The room was lovely and clean and in good condition.Breakfast was nice with a large selection of food and again helpful staff on hand. The food was all fresh and even at 10.30 (when they stopped serving breakfast) it never looked like left overs or substandard.I am planning to go back soon!

<Content>Poor service from reception Booked a suite at this hotel as they had an offer on when we were staying. I also sent them an email a week before to confirm we would be checking in late (23:00). Hotel replied and confirmed that this would be okay.Turned up at 23:00 and checked in. We were given a key to room 406 and I checked with the receptionist that the room was a suite and he said yes, and sent us up. Although a pleasant room, this was not a suite. Our confirmation said we'd have a seperate lounge area so we went back to reception to see why we weren't allocated the suite.We were then told that the suite had a problem with the bathroom and that it would be fixed for the following day, but we should sleep in room 406 instead. When asked what the rate would be, he told us the night's rate for 406 was Euro175, whih is more than we'd paid for the suite! We refused to accept this. In the end, he told us that the general manager would be available to sort out the issue the following morning and we should get some rest. We spent the night in room 406 (whose headboard rests against the adjoining wall to the lift shaft, so pretty noisy).General manager wouldn't see us the following morning - he was too busy, and recpetion advised that our suite wouldn't be ready for today either. We kicked up a stink and eventually the manager came out, was very rude to us, and said he'd sort the suite for us for today. When I asked what rate we'd end up paying for room 406 for the previous night, we ended up in an argument and we were given the room for free. Rest of the stay was fine. Suite was pleasant although located over the bar on the first floor so could be noisy on a busy night. Restaurant at the hotel is lovely. other staff were also great and breakfast was fine. Location is about 10 minute walk north of the Duomo.

<Content>Contemporary and spotless We were pleasantly surprised by the state and location of this hotel. Although some reviews complain about it being far away, I beg to differ. I will clarify that I am under the age of 30 but I hope I've got a good few more years in me before I consider a 10 minute walk to the centre of town a distance worthy of note. The breakfast was nothing to write home about but given that we only got up in time for breakfast once that was not an issue.The hotel staff were pleasant and helpful and all in all we had a great time. On the downside, I did notice some women arriving only to be sent to a sister hotel up the road for the first night when told there was no availability...even when they had the confirmation email with them in their hands. So perhaps we were just the lucky ones and you should probably call the hotel in advance to confirm that they have received your reservation.

<Content>A Gem! I had read great reviews about this hotel so was expecting it to be nice and wasn't disappointed! This is a great hotel with lots of extra little touches to make you feel really special.The hotel is very modern and comfortable. Our room had everything we needed including bath robes, slippers and a very reasonable mini-bar. Unlike most others it didn't cost anymore than a drink in the bar. There were linen towels in the bathroom and extra pillows and blankets in case the air-con kept you too cool! When we arrived we found a lovely tray of fresh fruit waiting for us in our room and after travelling from Rome by train this was more than welcome. The front desk staff were very friendly, as were the bar and restaurant staff. I definately reccommend the resaurant, by the way. The food and wine was typically Tuscan and very well presented. We sat out on the patio and there is a lovely waterfall and beautiful plants all around. Breakfast each morning wasn't bad either (far better than our hotel in Rome). Lots of fresh fruit and you could even have toast! The location was pretty good too. Although in a quiet area it was only a few minutes walk from the Duomo and main streets and just a couple of minutes walk from the train and bus station too. It seemed very safe to walk at night.The hotel is also filled with pieces of modern art and lots of interesting things to see. It was very comfortable and relaxing and i'd highly reccommend this hotel to anyone looking for a bit of luxuary at a great price!

<Content>This Will Take the Shine Off Florence I have been lucky enough to visit Florenece many many times. I have stayed in some beautiful hotels there. This time, and at the last moment, the best I could arrange was the Athenaeum Hotel. End of May was Pitti week, a big exhibition week so choices were very limited and I needed a hotel for 5 nights. Sorry to say it was a very bad experience. From arrival, and no help with my luggage, to the very small box like bedrooms, I looked a 3 and there was little to choose between them, all poky and dark. No gratis drinking water in the room [only mini bar!], no iron or tea  coffe maker, very small storage and equally small TV, and the decoration is very IKEA. The main photos of the hotel show this beautiful antrium but you will not see that from your room.Breakfast is in the basement, and the one day you could look forward to spending the time enjoying a cooked breakfast, Sunday morning, they give the chief the time off, so you'll only get cold! Don't try and eat luch here, on Saturday the restuarant doesn't open and on the Sunday they would not serve me because they had rented it out for a party!This hotel is a long walk from anywhere you can get a decent meal. No ATM nearby either.The staff stay firmly behind their front desk and are aloof and as unhelpful as the worst kind of 2 star hotel. definitley avoid like the plague! Only to be used by the cheapest type of 'package holiday.

<Content>Good hotel with one fool problem Lovely hotel, with superb staff but with one big problem. I stay there from 4 to 10 April and i have to fight for my breakfast..... I have to explain this, so... the bread was always to little for all the roomers and you have to wait to refill the hamper. I have to face the same problem with water, cheese, ham but the problem was fixed (not at all) after a conversation i had with the reception. These was the bad things all the others was good enough for me. The staff was friendly and ready to help, the hotel was clean, with a modern decoration and the distance from the center was only a 5-7 minutes walk. Florence probably is the most beautifull city all over the world, so i'm waiting to go again soon.

<Content>Very modern, but not a great location Hotel Athenaeum was indeed a very nice hotel, with a modern look and feel. It was very clean, the staff very helpful, offered free use of a computer with internet access, and had particularly nice bathrooms. The major downside in my opinion would be the location. It is a fair walk (15 minutes down a regular city street) to the main attractions of the city. My fiancee and I are young and walked every where in Italy, but found this walk more rather annoying. Unlike Rome or Venice there was nothing to see walking to and from the hotel. After a full day of touring we typically would return back to the room before dinner. Who wants to walk another 15-20 min at night through a non spectacular part of the city just o reach a restaurant? The the amenities were great for the price but I would have downgraded for something more centrally located.

<Content>Very good hotel, good location It is a modern Hotel with a boring fassade and first class inside with a quiet terrace to relax. We had room 216 with a private terrace and a bathroom with shower only. The breakfast is very good by italien standard: assorted sausages, cheeses, bread, fresh fruit and several different fresh baked cakes and coffee to order. Free internet acces and very friendly staff. We got the room for 3 nights, breakfast included, for EU 189. It is only a 15 minutes walk to the Cathedral and a 5 minutes to the Accademia. For a hotdeal try www.cultbay.de or Ebay. We would stay there again. For genuin tuscan fare we recommend the simple trattoria Cibreo, Via dei Macci 122.

<Content>A fab Hotel Have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel in Florence and had a fabulous time. The staff were extremely helpful in anyway they could be. Our room was large and extremely well equipped. The abthroom again was very roomy. Breakfast was included with our trip and this was delicious and plentiful. You could have filled yourself up with goodies at breakfast and not eaten again until the evening. A really good selection of meats and cheeses, cereals, pastries, cake and juices. Also any type of coffee you wanted. Excellent value for money.

<Content>Loved the hotel but room safe was broken into Had a girls weekend in Florence and loved the hotel, but during our stay the room safe was broken into and some but not all money was taken. Enough to have us reaching for calculators to see if we had spent it!! Staff were great and offered to help with police reports but we felt it wasn't worth going through it and spoil the rest of the weekend. Got the impression it had happened before, so beware! We were given our dinner and wine on the house that evening which probably cost more than had been taken. Location is great for the Accademia and the square on the corner is a good place to pick up the open top bus before it gets too full. Would stay there again but use the main safe for cash!!

<Content>Great hotel Great hotel to stay at for a weekend break in Florence. The hotel is clean and the rooms are very comfortable.The hotel is a little way out of the centre but is near a couple of the sites including the amazing frescos in the San Marco monastry which is very close by.Very friendly staff who suggested 2 brilliant local restaurants for us to try which were away from the tourist areas. The restaurant in the hotel gave us free glasses of prosecco at the start of our meal and as hotel guests we qualified for 10% off the total bill (which was rounded up so we ended up saving nearly 18%). Very good value for money - a 3 course meal for 2 with a bottle of wine for only around 拢62! I felt that the breakfasts were the weakest part of the stay as they weren't great although there was lots of choice and the possibility to pay extra for a cooked breakfast.We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Not the Best Location After reading reviews on this hotel, we didnt know what to expect. Some thought the location and hotel were good, and others the opposite. We found the hotel to be lovely inside, and the staff friendly and helpful. The room was a bit small, but very nice. The one thing i didn't like was the location. It was only a 10 minute walk into the centre which isnt far. However, its the part that you have to walk through which we didn't like. There are no shops, restaurants etc up at this end- just buildings. There also doesnt seem to be tourists up this far either, and was pretty much just locals and people on mopeds. You have to pass a big square, which has lots of young italian males all hanging about. As i was there with my partner, i was not overly concerned. However, i wouldnt like to stay there if i was a young female alone, or even all females in a small group. I think they would be safer to find accomodation more in the centre.

<Content>Nice if you don't mind walking I'll be honest - I like really modern hotels. I don't like character hotels that are old and musty but have character. So this hotel fit the bill perfectly.It's very modern  clean but could also be seen as sterile if you are one of those that DO like the hotels described above.The rooms are nice - good bathroom too!!....For once, website photos are not misleading.It's a pretty reasonable price and the breakfast is much the same as any other Italian hotel I've stayed in - nothing specialNow..the big thing is location......Firstly, I found it really difficult to find...a taxi is recommended to get there in the first place even if it's only a two minute journey....I walked out of the station in a terrible thunderstorm and got really lost trying to find the hotel.Once you have your bearings, you will find that it is a 10 minute walk to Il Duomo at tops. Considering the Duomo is pretty much at the centre of Florence, I think that can be considered a very central position. I can only assume that the people who have complained about it's location don't much like walking...if that's the case then Florence is the wrong place to go - period!!It's true that there is not much around the hotel like bars or restaurants but that didn't worry me.All in all, I would certainly return to this hotel if I'm ever in Florence again.

<Content>really good A very fine hotel in beautiful Florence. Although not very central, location is no problem in Florence because it's always a pleasure to walk in the city. The breakfast is good and the rooms are very modern  clean. We were also lucky enough to have a very good price form a web site. Highly recommended!

<Content>Great Choice - Very Modern I would have rated this hotel as excellent had a couple of things been different. There was a very rude, female, desk clerk named Sonia, who I could have lived without, and I could never get my laptop to work, BUT, everything and everybody else was great! Gorgeous public areas and rooms, very modern, great airconditioning, great restaurant and bar. The staff was amazingly gracious, helpful and friendly. And I don't think it was too far away from the main attractions. I'm 52 years old, and I walked to the Ponte Vecchio in about 15 minutes. The David was even closer. If you don't want to walk, rent a taxi -- they're cheap

<Content>Beautiful hotel, didnt like location (not central enough) All the write-ups tell you how central this hotel is which I didnt agree with at all. It was a beautifully modern, boutique-style hotel which was very comfortable but I didnt like the location. It just wasn't central enough and at the time we stayed there were no nearby restaurants or attractive shops. We arrived late and ate in the hotel's own restaurant on the first night. The main course turned out to be excessively salty unfortunatelyand I had to send it back. The waiter couldnt have been kinder. It was swapped for something else quickly. Unfortunately the replacement meal wasnt that great although the service was helpful. There were just a few others diners and it was very quiet and so lacked atmoshphere. Despite the attractive rooms and the excellent decor and comfort of the place, it wasnt enough to keep us there. We moved the following day to the Hotel Adler Cavalier. its was a bit old fashioned and musty after the very modern Athenaeum but we were delighted to be so near to all the sights of Florence and the river etc.

<Content>Nice hotel We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in Febraury. We thought we were in for a long taxi ride as we arrived from Venice at the Santa Maria Novelle Stazione. It took less than 5 mins. The hotel is also close to the Duomo and the Academia. We basically walked right in, without queuing to see Michaelangelo's David. The hotel is very nice and modern. Staff are ok but not as friendly compare to other hotels of this calibre. The room was quite large and very modern, except it was facing the street so it got quite noisy during traffic hours. I would ask for rooms in the back. Breafast was better than most places in Italy, as at least you can order an omelette for additional charge. But your free breakfast is still pretty good. Worth staying here but with someone else. There is also a good Chinese resturant about 15 mins walk from the hotel, which is just around the corner from the Station. Good choice if you were like us and got abit tired of eating too much carbohydrates.

<Content>Fabulous Stay at the Athenaeum I stayed with two of my girlfriends at the Athenaeum in June 2006. It was perfect - the room was huge, the bathroom was luxrious (and also huge), and there was even a balcony we could see Il Duomo from. The free internet service worked fabulous. The breakfast was delicious and filling, even for my vegetarian friend. The hotel took our bags when we arrived early, and when we came back from site seeing, they were already in our rooms! It is a very modern hotel, so if you are looking for old world charm, this is not the place. But the location is fantastic. It's about a 10 minute walk to Il Duomo and a 15-20 minute walk to Santa Maria Novella Stazione. I felt we got a lot for the price, which was 210 euros per night.

<Content>No room at the Atheraeum! If you book at room at this hotel, beware...you may end up in a completely different hotel at the other side of Florence.Having researched where to stay in Florence for our New Years celebrations we finally decided to go with the Hotel Athenaeum, and made our reservation through Expedia.co.uk. AT Dublin airport we were advised that our flight to Pisa was to be delayed, so out of courtesy I phoned the hotel so that they were aware of our situation. Arriving at the hotel at 1.45 am amid a snow storm, my wife and I were greeted by the Night porter, who asked us what we wanted. I passed him my booking confirmation and he just shook his head...PROBLEM...BIG PROBLEM he said... I'm sorry but we don't have any room for you. Absolutely flabbergasted, tired, and obviously now quite worried about what we were going to do. The porter spent the next 30 minutes or more calling the manager to get us sorted out. We were told at 2.40 am that we would be put up in another hotel...just for the night, and that everything would be sorted out in the morning. I contacted the hotel the next morning at 8.30 and was told that there was no one who spoke good english, and that the manager was busy! I then contacted Expedia hoping that they would be able to sort out the matter. But to no avail, the expedia staff advised me that they were unable to make any sense from the hiotel and that they were very sorry about our situation but that there was nothing that they could do. They then went on to say that they could find no other accommodation in Florence but that if I could they would reimburse me.I can honestly say that my first experience of Italy, and Florence was a horrible one, rude staff, no customer service and a blase attitude...not the romantic getaway we were expecting.

<Content>excellent hotel! My husband and I stayed here for four nights in May. We loved this beautiful ultra modern hotel, which was well located.The hotel restaurant, which is quite new, was our best dining experience in Florence! It was so good that we ate there two nights. You can eat on their outdoor terrace, which was absolutely beautiful with the waterfalls. The service was excellent, and the food was far superior to what we had in other highly recommended restaurants. The prices were reasonable and the portions plentiful.A wonderful hotel in a gorgeous city!

<Content>Perfect Fantastic hotel. I cant understand why its not higher up in your reviews. I picked it from the recommendations on this site as I couldnt find any availaility in the higher reviewed hotels for the time that I wanted to travel.A short walk from the train station, about 5 minutes away from the tourist attractions. Very Clean, modern  the staff are very helpful with finding places to eat etc.The lighting in the rooms is quite unique and with the windows closed you cant hear anything from the streets below. (adding that in since it seems to be an issue with other reviews of florence Ive read on your site).Perfect place for the stay!

<Content>Modern But Inconvenient Location Single woman traveling alone from USA. It was a very far walk from the Duomo or train station. There weren't many restaurants, bars, or anything near it. The bell boy did not help me, there was no turn down service. The room was small and the glass shower tiny. Like most hotels in Italy, the AC did not work and I had to open the windows for fresh cool air. It was very angular and sharp, very modern with glass and stone, zero artwork, but clean and quiet.The breakfast had little selection but service was ok. You cannot find a decent breakfast anywhere in Italy anyhow.Fortunately I only booked for one night, and stayed at the Hotel Sofitel near the Duomo for the same price after that ($180 euro/night). I have a sister who is gay, and I think that demographic would enjoy this hotel. My best stay was at the Hotel Adler Cavalieri which is older and smells like cigar/pomade. But it had character and decent location. Ask for the room w/ balcony overlooking the terrace.

<Content>Great boutique hotel - very central Stayed at the Athenaeum for 4 nights at the end of March for my birthday and was delighted by the quality of the hotel. It is very central, just a 5 min walk from Duomo and other attractions and very nicely decorated inside. The rooms are spacious as is the bathroom and the concierge in particular was very knowledgeable about good bars and restaurants to visit in the evenings.Breakfast is not as basic as made out in previous reports - fruit, pastries, cakes and cereal are all free of charge but you can order hot food for about 3-5 euros such as omelette, eggs and bacon etc so that isnt too bad at all.I would definately recommend this hotel and would happily stay again if i were to visit Florence. A much higher 4 star hotel than can be sometimes classed in this league- you wont be dissapointed.
