<Content>Nice location. We stayed at the Meridien for a few days before New Years. The rooms were nice and clean. We primarily enjoyed the location.It is right next to the gothic quarter and two blocks from the metro station which is easy, quick (you never wait more than a few minutes for a train), and the Ravel area. Around the corner is a great hot chocolate shop, one of the oldest in Barcelona. The only thing missing was a nice pool and spa to relax in at the end of the days of touring.

<Content>Perfect for the business traveller I had the most comfortable and uneventful stay at Le Meridian, exactly what you you want when you're travelling on business. Taxis appeared instantly, I forgot my adapter and the staff were so helpful getting a new one and the best touch was the weird blue light that automatically went on when you got up at night.

<Content>Le Meridien is Wonderful Le Meridien Barcelona was a fantastic hotel. I enjoyed my stay there a great deal and had a lovely room with a large veranda. It was an absolute pleasure. The hotel is centrally located on Las Ramblas and made it easy to get around the city. The concierge and hotel staff were polite and helpful. The quality of the rooms was quite good as I saw two separate rooms when I needed to switch to a larger room as I had a friend flying in. Overall an excellent hotel. While on the expensive side, it really made my stay there that much better.

<Content>Really liked this hotel Fantastic location. We had a renovated room which was modern and beautiful. Had to have the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. The staff was exceptionally friendly. We didn't use the dining room as we found it quite pricey but there are tons of places to eat in the area.....and a Starbucks just 50 yrds away.

<Content>did not regret the choice Hotel has great ramblas location with short walk both ways - either to the sea or opposit to Passeig Gracia with shops. We enjoyed the design of the hotel. New, modern, exactly what Barcelona is about. In terms of food they offer limited but very high quality breakfast as well as a la carte lunch and dinners. What was not so nice it was the impression of the lobby. It was weird as reception area being very crowdy at any time being too small comparing to empty lounge area on the other side of entrance. We booked deluxe room but as we arrived in rainy day and forecast predicted more of it during our stay we asked for upgrade (reading all the reviews here about small size of these rooms). As SPG gold no upgrade was offered/possible but when I asked if paid upg is possible it was immediately available to every higher category. We went for Prestige suite with a 150Eur additionaly and did not regret these extra money. Suite had Ramblas view, huge flat TV, Bose system, huge bathroom etc.... Great refugium after some wet escapades in rainy city...

<Content>Watch Your Wallet and Check Your Bill! The location is the best part of this hotel. The service is very indifferent and the modernistic rooms are fine if you like that sort of thing. However we will not return as they posted an outrageous bill for breakfast and would not reverse it. The restaurant was very crowded at breakfast and as we attempted to get our bill the manager assured us that it would be taken care of properly. When we checked out the bill for breakfast for 2 was close to $100. When we protested this they would not reverse the charge at checkout. Additionally throughout our stay we noticed that change left in our room had disappeared when we came back after the room was cleaned. I guess the maid thought this was her tip but I call it petty theft and these are the reasons we will not return to this property.

<Content>An experience you can't forget! The property is lovely! Exactly what I expected and more. The service is top shelf and so is the food and drink. From the doorman to the front desk each and every employee is definately there to assist their guests. A touch of elegance, glamour and, of course, real quietness. The rooms are magazine picture perfect aside from being cozy and comfortable! Is great see 'Las Ramblas' from my window! My choose, in Barcelona, is the 'Le Meridien', an experience you can't forget!

<Content>Just OK for the price My family and I stayed in a Mediterranean Suite for 3 nights, and to begin with the location of Le Meridien is truly excellent--close to sightseeing spots and metro stations!But other than that a few problems occured:The telephones in the room were out of services and were not fixed. The suite lacked a plasma tv--a very mediocre CRO TV with poor video quality. The furniture in the room was worn out!Concierge was not properly staffed.Fairly friendly staff thoughThe terrace of the suite is a big plus--especially nice with sunny conditions.When you are paying 500 Euro or so for a night, one would surely expect more from the hotel--probably the room amenities and decoration would be better in the renovated rooms--but still no excuse after the hotel has undergone a 30 million Euro revamp!Overall so so experience, might try H1898 just next to Le Meridien next time.

<Content>Simply stunning! My brother and I stayed at the Le Meridian for 4 nights and it was a fantastic choice. We looked at lots of luxury hotels in Barcelona but the location of this one sealed the deal and we weren't disappointed. It is a fantastic escape from the charismatic but noisy Ramblas whilst still retaining the feeling of being part of the action. The hotel has recently been refurbished and it oozes quality and style from every angle, including the very cool image mosaic on the doors and windows of the entrance, the futuristic lighting in the lobby, the Gaudi chairs at the concierge desk and the stunning Cent Onze restaurant and bar. We stayed in a twin deluxe room, which had one of the best showers I have ever experienced (perfect after a long day of trekking and sight seeing!), very comfortable beds, bathrobes, slippers, tea and coffee and a ridiculously large plasma television to name just a few (including a second flat screen in the bathroom!). The only negative was the over priced mini-bar but all the hotels I have been to are the same. Breakfast was superb with a huge selection to suit all tastes and diets. There is a chef on hand cooking eggs and crepes to your liking which we thought was a fantastic concept. Wonderful omelettes! We also dined in the restaurant which is pricey but the food is excellent as is the service. All the ingredients are bought fresh from the Boqueria market apparently! A three course meal with wine was around 65 euros each.We found all the staff excellent. They were instantly helpful in reserving tables for dinner, calling taxis and making calls for us.There is also a gym and business centre with free internet use.I would definitely recommend it. We didn't want to leave!

<Content>Rambla Rambler A superb hotel in an excellent location for exploring the centre of Barcelona. An outstanding room with a well-equipped bathroom and comfortable bed. Not an inspiring view, but other rooms looked on to Las Ramblas. A noisy night, but only spent the one, so this may not be the norm. Did not sample the breakfast. Not cheap.

<Content>Great location on las Ramblas If you want to walk out the front door of a hotel and take a few steps to Las Ramblas..then Le Meridien is the hotel to consider. It is a very contemporary (a bit too contemporary), clean and service attentive hotel. The rooms are roomy and the bathrooms are quite large for a European hotel. There is a free internet access business center on the lower lobby level which was wonderful...however, it is not monitored and quite often there are children playing internet games rather than adults using the internet for email.A few blocks away there is a wonderful and reasonable restaurant; Les Quinze Nits which usually has a long line (it moves so be patient). We loved it so much we ate there two nights.The tourist bus stop is only a few blocks away in either direction from the hotel and a great way to see the sights since it is the hop on hop off bus. All in all, a great location and a nice hotel!

<Content>Lovely hotel, very small rooms! We stayed in Le Meridian for 2 nights in July 2008. originally booked 3 nights but changed to 2 due to the size of the room.Overall - very nice 4 star hotel in excellent location right on La Rambla. Service- very friendly but not the most helpful.Rooms - very nice, new but TINY. If you can book a deluxe room with sitting area (it could be classified as a suite; just check - all bigger rooms look onto La Rambla). Nice newish but again very small bathrooms. We'd recommend this hotel to friends but only in a bigger room category. Our opinion was that it is a nice business hotel, not so much a holiday experience.

<Content>Location Trumps All LOCATIONIt really can't be beat. We took the Aerobus from the airport to Place de Catalunya for about 4.05 euros. They are outside all terminals. If the machine is broken, you can pay the driver. Just be careful of pick pocketers when you get off at Catalunya. Then, just walk down Las Ramblas a few blocks and it's on your right. When getting around, Liceu metro stop may be a little closer than Catalunya. The Touristic buses are really convenient though. However, so easy to walk around. You can walk to the water and Port Vell area in 20-30 minutes depending how captivated you are by the street performers.ROOMSThey are still in the process of renovating the rooms. We got a creepy, older suite. We were on the 6th floor and the noise from Las Ramblas was tolerable - more like a background humble with occasional, random yelling in the night.OTHER STUFFFree internet in the business center. Sorry, no lounges or breakfast for the Platinum people. No pool. Small gym though.Enjoy Barcelona!!! It ROCKS!!!

<Content>Disappointed as a Platinum SPG member Whe booked a room for 5 nights and were allocated a standard room (ie not an SPG room). I awoke during the night to what I thought was my husband snoring but it was actually the guy in the room next door (it was not interconnecting room). Had a shocking nights sleep. Complained and was then moved to an SPG room. I am not sure why we did not receive this initially as I am a Platinum member and I was charged for the room a month prior to our arrival. After asking why were not allocated an SPG room I was told it was due to a lack of availability (we were later told by another staff member that the hotel wasn't heavily booked).We were upgrade a recently renovated suite on the 1st floor. It was fabulous and very spacious with intimate views over La Rambla. Ended up being a great stay but we were ready to change hotels if we had not been moved.

<Content>A great hotel in a great location The Hotel is located on La Rambla which is city centre with close access to shops and tour buses.The room was immaculate with a 42 plasma screen and even a screen in the bathroom.There was nice blue ambient lighting in the room with good amenities.The bathroom was large and well equipped.Concierge and staff overall were very friendly and very helpful and recommended a lot of restaurants and night spots to visit which were absolutely wonderful.There is a business centre to use for free and open 24 hours.The only thing I disliked was the face that the in-room safe was a bit small and did not fit my laptop.I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved the hotel We just returned from a cruise that left from Barcelona and we stayed at this hotel for two nights before the cruise left. After the cruise, we had one more night in Barcelona before our flight back to the states and there was no doubt that we would return to this hotel. It is very modern and clean. Our room did not face La Rambla which is what we wanted. It was very quiet and we were able to catch up on our sleep. Check in was a pleasure. Everyone spoke English and all were very helpful. We needed to call the airlines and the concierge let us use his phone at no charge (we waited on the line for 30 minutes for the airline to answer). The hotel is in a great location. Be sure to check out the sink in the woman's bathroom off the lobby. Also, good luck figuring out the lights in the room.

<Content>A hotel that defines the term "uneven" There is so much to like about the Meridien, from its central location on the Ramblas in Barcelona to the friendly staff. But there is almost as much to disappointment, from poorly maintained rooms (I had two major water leaks in my two visits) to its lack of a pool and terrace, which are important in a city that boasts 200-plus days of sun a year. And the rates at this hotel are astronomical when compared to its rivals nearby. Try some of Barcelona's fantastic -- and far less expensive -- boutique hotels.

<Content>Liked to leave the hotel When making the reservation I thought it's good to take a hotel directly at the Rampla - but it's not! The Rampla is full of tourists, homeless and by far not clean. So the location of the hotel already has been the first problem. Better to stay at a relaxed and green area of the city and take a taxi down-town if you want to go there.As a Platinum SPG member at first we got one of the quite small standard but renovated rooms. They try to make it design but with grey/brown/red they got it quite 80's style... red leather armchair...After I complained about the room and pointed to my Platinum status they gave us a quite shabby unrenovated suite (also withou any view) on 6th floor. The most amazing point of the room was that there's a window from the hall to the bathrrom where you can directly look to the toilet. Whos idea was that??? Imagine the maid comes in...Another problem of the hotel is the internet connection. In the room it's 鈧?20,00 plus tax (I really ask myself for what some hotels still charge money for internet access). In the business center it's free - but the computers are often occupied by children. WiFi exists at the lobby and at the business center, that's it - and it costs 鈧?20,00. Thanks a lot!Another issue is breakfast. While staying at Sheraton (and some Westin) for SPG platinum members breakfast (or lounge access) is included at the Le Meridien it's not. I really don't understand why SPG can't unify their goodies for all Starwood hotels.Well, we reduced our stay from 2 nights to 1 night only and were really happy to leave.

<Content>Construction Noise Nice hotel and location but was awaken every morning at 6:00 AM by construction renovation next to my suite. It is a beautiful hotel with all the amenities and unfortunately we picked the wrong time to stay here. I would stay here again but would make sure beforehand that there is no constuction next to the room. I didn't ask to be moved as it was an excellent suite and we were all unpacked and settled and had overheard the receptionist tell another guest that the hotel was full. I don't like to complain and we were only staying for 3 nights.

<Content>Great Location I ended up staying at the Le Meriden because my first choice, a private resident near the Central Station immediately turned out to be a bad choice: The private residence I had originally booked was smaller than advertised, on the busiest and nosiest street in Barcelona (and lacking the double pane noise proof windows you normally find in Paris) and the internet did not work. I packed my bags and left for a more expensive but rewarding hotel stay at Le Meriden. For the average traveler Le Meriden Barcelona is an EXPENSIVE hotel at lowest $350 average per night. But the location is a gem. Close to public transportation (the Catalunya railway and metro stations are but a 100 meters from the hotel) and right at the doorstep of La Rambla, a long series of streets that lead from city central down to the harbor filled with restaurants and shops and entertainment venues. La Rambla is a wonderful place to people watch as city workers and locals mix with tourists. The building itself has the reserved modernist style of its 1950s origins but the interior is composed of that unique Barcelona strain of decoration that includes ultra modern furnishings with Catalan colors and styles with a retro sense of history.  My room was large with a wonderful bed and everything was very clean and professionally prepared for my arrival. Internet in the business center and for laptops was free, a great find as most European hotels charge extra for internet access. The staff was friendly and professional.  Because of the central location to art museums and tourist attractions, La Rambla, the harbor and subways and buses this is a highly recommended hotel.

<Content>Loved this hotel This is a fine hotel, with a perfect location (on La Rambla). But what really made this hotel special was how they treated us when we arrived.Unfortunately, my daughter's pocketbook, including her passport, was stolen on the way to the hotel (the theives in Barcelona are quite clever). And none of my family speaks any Spanish. Upon our arrival, we explained what happened. The front desk staff, including Marco and a woman whose name I cannot recall. were amazingly helpful. They placed calls for us to credit card companies, helped us with the police report, and contacted the US Consulate. Without their amazing help, our vacation might have been ruined. Instead, we did our best to forget about it, and had a wonderful stay there.

<Content>Great location but Terrible Service My wife and I spent two days in Barcelona at the Le Meridien as part of our Spain Tour. While the hotel is nicely located right off the Las Ramblas and is well kept, the service at the hotel is terrible. They lost our passports for a day when the manager locked them in his safe and didn't tell anyone. We almost missed our flight and had to worry the entire time in Barcelona about them. The rooms while nicely decorated and accented were disappointing as you could hear the water running through the pipes in the wall and hear your neighbors talking. The staff really didn't seem to care about anything. We never even received a greeting from anyone and they just didn't seem to want to help anyone. As a SPG Gold Member, I was thinking that I would have received better service in this level of a hotel. Not worth the price. Look elsewhere if you can.

<Content>Luxury and location If you have the money, this is a great place to stay. I was fortunate enough to be able to use my Starwood points, so I didn't need to count the euros. Service was excellent at check in and departure, and our room was comparable to the Meridien in the US. The hotel has recently been renovated and everything looked new. The beds were comfortable and faced a 50 inch plasma TV on the opposite wall. The bathtub was huge, and had a rubber incline so you could lean back comfortably. And of course, a separate shower. Bath amenities were the same that I used to get at the Meridien in Beverly Hills.The hotel location was right on the Ramblas, only a block or two from the Plaza de Catalunya. There were cabs galore, and a convenient metro too.All in all, a great place to have has your home base in a beautiful city.

<Content>Great Hotel After reading the mixed reviews on this site, I wasn't sure what to expect. I was definitely very happy with this choice once I arrived. The room and bathroom were both very modern with all the best ammenities. The bed was very comfortable, and I really enjoyed the large flat screen television in the room. The room also has dimmer lights so that if you get up in the middle of the night, a dim light will go on so that you can see where you're going, but it's not bright enough to wake anyone up. There is free internet access in the business center which is one of the best features of this hotel since most places in Europe make you pay an arm and a leg to get internet access. The gym was nice, but didn't really have much if you're looking for weights. The staff was great and accommodating as well. The location was also superb. We walked just about everywhere - or took the metro - the hotel is between two stops. I'd say Catalunya might be the closer stop though. (the other one is Liceu)

<Content>Great Location Great location, right in front of Las Ramblas...I used my Starwood Rewards Platinum membership and they upgraded me to a suite that was amazing.It is also within walking distance to major shopping areas, and the beach. You might find better hotels but, its hard to compare the hotels in Barcelona, because location matters and this place is right in front of where all the action happends.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel - great room! My Husband surprised me for my Birthday with a trip to Barcelona, staying in Le Meridien on La Rambla. He booked us a mediteranean suite - WOW! The sun terrace was huge and was always always in the sun.....great after a days walking around for a relax on a sun lounger - in private! The room was enormous, the bed as comfortable a any Sheraton group bed. There was a dressing room, with ample hanging space and a large ensuite. It was beautifully kept, was very clean each day. We had room service breakfast every day, which was pricey but well worth it to eat on the terrace in our dressing gowns! My husband used to internet connection for his laptop, which worked well and had a good fast connection. On our first day, we came back to our room to a bucket with a bottle of champange and two champagne glasses - a nice touch. We loved this hotel and would highly recommend it, though take a med suite if you can :o) We thought the hotel was ideally situated to get to all the sights we wanted to see - on foot. It's really very central to all the tourists spots.

<Content>Great location, nice hotel but check your bill. We stayed here in April 08 for seven nights. Arrived in the morning around 10am and our room was not ready. The agent said that our room had been assigned but the current guests had not checked out yet. It was going to be about 4 hours. We are Starwood gold members and asked if anything else was available, but no luck. When we returned several hours later, we spoke to a different check in rep and she said our original room was still not ready, but when we asked her to check for something else, she came through for us. We ended up on the 4th floor in a newly renovated room that was very modern with a hugh bathroom to die for. Giant shower with top and side shower heads. We loved the shower but be prepared for flooding on the floor. Poor design flaw on the lip of the shower door. Put some extra towels on the floor. Even a flat screen TV with remote in the bathroom. There was also a large flat screen TV in the bedroom area. Very nice. One thing that bothered us a little. For a room that was recently renovated, it had a lot of dirty finger prints on the walls and ceilings. It looked like they were from the workers that were remodeling the rooms. Very sloppy. The breakfast buffet was nice but they need to rotate the selections. We stayed for a week and the food was the same every day. The breakfast was included in our rate. Do not pay for it otherwise. You are better off at a local cafe. There is also a hugh grocery store right next to the hotel. They have wonderful baked bread with meats and cheeses and just about anything else you would need. Get your bottled water there too. The location of this hotel could not be better. You are right off La Rambla and close to the metro. This hotel is very expensive especially when converting US dollars to Euros. While a very nice hotel it is, I think the location and name is what what we are all paying for. We pre paid our stay in full before arrival and upon check out we were charged an extra 30EUR a day for a double room. We already paid for a double room in full. Why were we being charged for it again? We showed the check out agent our receipt showing that we already had paid in full and after he made a copy of it, he quickly removed the charges. Overall, we would stay a the hotel again, mostly for the location. Don't pay for the internet. The hotel has three computers in the business center on the lower level. It is not advertised, but you can use the internet and printers for as long as you like for free, yes, free and it's open 24 hrs.

<Content>An enjoyable stay My husband and I stayed for a romatic weekend at the beginning of April. We took the Aerobus from the airport and a short walk from Placa de Catalyna arriving at approx 6PM. The porters helped us to carry our largish suitcase to reception where check in was quick and professional.We had booked a renovated Deluxe Room with a Rambla view, but on opening the door we quickly discovered that this is not what we got.The room was a little tired looking, especially the bathroom, however we believe we had been upgraded to an 8th Floor Suite since we had a lovely large terrace (we would not have had a balcony in our requested room) with excellent views of La Rambla, lots of Barcelona and even a sea view. We also had a largish sitting area and a good sized desk. This more than made up for the disappointment of not being assigned a refurbished room, and so we did not complain to reception.We were disappointed with the selection of TV channels available in English, although in fairness we were not often in the room watching TV.We didn't eat in the restaurant since there was far to much on offer in Barcelona so cannot rate the food, although the restaurant did look very nice. We had a couple of drinks in the hotel bar which was quite stylsih, albeit a little expensive. On one evening there was a large group in the bar with lots of children and both adults and kids were very loud which spoiled our experience, however generally this was a good place to unwind with a cocktail after a busy day in Barcelona. Breakfast was purchased from the supermarket next door to the hotel and eaten on our lovely terrace. We were able to store juices in the minibar and made coffee/tea from the facilities provided in the room. This made for a stress free start to the day.We could easily walk to most locations from our hotel and only took one taxi during the whole 4 days. A negative point was the expensive internet at a charge of Euros 17.50 a day.A positive point was the excellent housekeeping. Our room was kept spotless and we had a daily turn down service, including an additional towel change. Also, we were never bothered by housekeeping, no matter how late we left the room.Staff were very friendly and eager to help in a discrete way (not in your face).Overall we recommend this hotel as an excellent base for a trip to Barcelona.

<Content>Great location, comfortable rooms, but more a 4 star I checked into Le Meridien after being unhappy with the condition of the rooms at the Colon Hotel. Le Meridien was very comfortable and had the best shower - both a hand held sprayer and a large rain showerhead. The bed and pillows were comfortable and fluffy and the furnishings were in very good condition. The location on La Rambla, just a block away from Placa Catalunya, was ideal and it was an easy walk to sightseeing and restaurants. The door and restaurant staff were pleasant and helpful. The desk staff were ok. Although it's billed as a 5 star hotel and is very comfortable, by NYC standards, this Le Meridien is only a 4 star hotel. It's also quite expensive. If price is not an issue, Le Meridien is a comfortable place to stay.

<Content>Wonderful Stay! We stayed at Le Meridien for a romantic weekend break at the beginning of May.The location was perfect! Everything was in walking distance so we didn't have to take a cab all weekend. We spent our time wandering through the old town and down to the beach. The room was so comfortable and stylish. We had one with a view over Las Ramblas - we loved watching all the action on the street. The bathroom was gorgeous too. We hated having to leave this place:-)

<Content>Excellent location, comfortable rooms We stayed at the Meridien for a week in March 2008. When we arrived, despite my calling the hotel a few days prior to arrival to review our room requirements (newly renovated suite), the junior suite we given had peeling paint, was dark and had stains on the carpet. We complained and were given a lovely Mediterranean suite. Since we were sharing the room with our daughter, this modern, renovated suite had one and half baths and a separate sitting area with a convertible sofa. It made our stay very comfortable. The suite also had a lovely patio.Breakfast was very good, but very expensive. We ate breakfast a lovely outdoor cafe behind the Boqueria a couple of blocks away. It was a quarter of the price and just as good.The location was very good with all sites easily accessible on foot or by subway.

<Content>Not up to expectations! My wife and I stayed here at the end of February. We picked this hotel firstly as it is a Meridien and secondly due to its location being in the centre of Las Ramblas. We had been to the Meridien Dubai the previous year and were basing our high expectations on the high standards we incurred while there. We were very disappointed in the Meridien Barcelona! It was the staff and location that let it down. The decor and room were lovely. It was when we went into the main restaurant that we came across problems. The food was uneatible, staff unhelpful to the point of rudeness...totally uncceptable. When a meal is presented with some of the items described on the menu missing then its only natural that you will ask the waiter about this, lets just say I was not happy with the reply I got from him. So much so that I asked to speak to the Restaurant manager about the food and the service, totally unaccepable for this star of hotel. Needless to say we ate out for the remainder of our stay.Second point was the location of the hotel on Las Ramblas. Great if you are a 20 something wanting to be in the middle of all the action...gangs of young men running about made us feel uneasy walking back to the hotel at the end of the night. If I had to choose a hotel in Barcelona again I would not pick one in this area of town. We are a couple looking for a romantic break away not to be anxious about stepping out of the hotel at night to go for a walk. But then I suppose it was the centre of the city and these things do happen. I would probably go back to Barcelona as we did see some lovely historical sights when on the tour hop on hop off bus, but I would probably choose a less busy part of town and a hotel which would live up to its star rating and put their customers first.

<Content>Great Hotel in the middle of the action Booked 5 night stay on hotel website Jr Suite with view of Las Ramblas. Booked on Hotel website...being a member of Starwood Preferred Guest there is a slight discount but it was expensive 315 Euro a nite Room was clean spacious flat screen tv that rotates between sitting area and bed. High speed internet as well.We stayed on 9th floor no balcony in the room view of Ramblas required a little bit of a lean but the view of the city was pretty cool.I booked this hotel after I found out that the Cathedral across from the Hotel Colon was under construction and paying for a suite at Hotel Colon with a view of the Cathedral would have been a huge waste.Check in was very quick no issues everyone spoke great English so no worries. We used the concierge extensively to book restaurants they always gave good recommendations. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant but did have a drink there, nice decor good service. They also have a small bar and sitting area in the lobby.The hotel is in the middle of a lot you walk right out onto Las Ramblas, are a few blocks from the big market La Boqueria, very close to Plaza Cataluna where you can get tourist bus, very close to subway stations which are very easy to use and a great way to get around the city. It is right across street from Hotel 1898, there is a Starbucks a block away.There is still some work going on around the hotel it did not interfere with our visit, also no gym or pool though they can give you a pass to a large health club about 1/2 mile away that does have pool and all the equipment you would ever want.Room had minibar which was expensive, water 3.90 Euro there is a grocery store a block away where water is .50 Euro and wine and I believe beer was available all at fractions of minibar prices.One odd issue is that they do not guarantee nonsmoking suites, the one we had smelled fine, no residual odor but something to ask about if that is a concern.All in all a great hotel clean, professional good service and great location. Would stay again and recommend to others.

<Content>Design a little "off" We just returned from a 4 day stay at the Meridien. Overall, the experience was good, but I have to say that the room design just did not work for us. We had one of the recently renovated rooms on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor. First of all, there is no privacy between the bathroom and the main sleeping area. They are seperated by a frosted glass door that did not close properly and was open at the top. My husband and I were staying with our six year old son so we had very little privacy for showering. The sink drained very poorly and the makeup mirror just hung from the wall sadly- as if the weight of the mirror was too much for the extending arm. There is a wonderful rainhead in the shower, but no means to prevent the water from spraying all over the bathroom floor. The lovely plasma TV was not working properly so we were unable to get movie or internet access. The staff offered to move us, but we felt it would have been too difficult at that point. You pay through the nose for computer internet access and a children's bed (50 Euro per night for the latter).It felt like the designers had some wonderful ideas that just were not practical. The wood floors that line the hallway are already showing extreme wear and tear. Lastly, there is a concierge desk in the foyer, but it is rarely manned which is odd for a hotel of this caliber. . Food prices are quite high and breakfast was not included in the room price.On the plus side, the blackout curtains provided great for great sleep ins and the housekeeping staff was top notch.The location is very good

<Content>What a Great Hotel We had a great stay at this hotel. It is in a wonderful location, right on La Rambla, but that also made it noisy and our first room was right on the street. So, after the first night, we asked for and got a very quiet room at the back.The decor and amenities were very, very nice, including robe and slippers. Beautiful bathrooms, too.We love our internet and the business center was open 24/7 with free high speed internet.I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great rooms If you want to stay on La Rambla, this is an excellent hotel choice. My room was on the small size, but not tiny as some European rooms can be. The decor was very hip and the bed extremely comfortable. The bathroom was great with an amazing deep tub and rain-style shower - plus a TV in the bathroom so you could watch as you soak (though the only English channels are news and sports).The construction was still happening while I was there, but it didn't affect my stay at all - just meant that the lobby wasn't superb. The room service and minibar prices were too high for me. My room was on a side street, not directly on La Rambla, and it was still quite loud, though fine with earplugs. That is probably unavoidable and the price one pays for staying on La Rambla.

<Content>hip hotel on ramblas This hotel exceeded our expectations as far as decor. I expected it to be old fashioned or traditional decor and was greatly impressed to find flat screen TVs, great shower/tub with very modern decor and every amenity. The bed was super comfortable and down comforter and pillows were a treat.The staff spoke English and was very helpful overall. We were concerned that it would be loud since we were on second floor close to Rambla but the windows kept all of the noise out. So we had convenient location without inconvenient noise. Great hotel experience overall!

<Content>Very nice, Great Location Traveling with a group and they picked this hotel. The hotel is clean, well run and convienient location (on Las Ramblas). I would not rate this a 4 star hotel because of amenities but it was very comfortable. At the time it was undergoing renovations but it did not interfere with our stay.

<Content>Not a 5 Star Just returned from 4 nights in Barcelona, 3 spent at Le Meridien. PROS: well-situated near Plaza Catalunya and Metro stop; clean; great shower; good mattressesCON: over-priced; not 5 star quality; very small rooms; 17.50 Euros for Intenret connection; snobby personnel; noisy environment outside; during our stay it was quite warm, but they had AC turned off, so option was to open window which proved extremely noisy.Airline personnel say they stay at Fira Plaza near Plaza Espanya.....might try that next time.

<Content>The Center of it all in Barcelona! My husband and I visted Barcelona this past Spring and had a wonderful stay at Le Meridien in Barcelona. This hotel is beautifully located right on LAS RAMBLAS and is steps away from all the sites: Las Ramblas, the Barri Gotica (my personal favorite!), many museums, the beautiful parks and myriad fantastic restaurants. Our rooms was lovely, with a HUGE balcony overlooking LAS RAMBLAS, the majestic Banco de Espana, with it's Empire Facade and in the distance, the Mediterranean Sea. We dined several times on this romantic balcony as the revelers milled below us along LAS RAMBLAS. The staff was accommodating and made good recommendations for restaurants. I think our favorites were Ceverceria Barcelone (great tapas!) and the world-famous Paella place down by the waterfront. YUM! My husband was ill and so he spent a lot of time in the very comfortable bed, and I was thrilled with the restaurant (called 111, and really excellent!) and the room service was also super. We ate at the restaurant alot because my husband was not feeling well, so we didn't want to go too far afield and Ricardo our waiter was the best! the bar is gorgeous in sexy red decor and they have jazz there ont he weekends, which is fun, but we did not stay long as my husband needed to head back to bed - TOO BAD! When we return to Barcelona, we will definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Good Experience Just returned from a 4-night stay at the Le Meridan in BCN. The location (as others have attested to) is very convenient and quiet, despite being on Las Ramblas. I didn't seek advice from the Concierge b/c there was always a line formed around that desk, but did utilize the security guard that was near the front door each morning... he wasa very knowledgeable  pleasant gentleman so I suggest if you're in a time crunch... seek his advice on good spots for breakfast, etc. I did not experience all of the shower issues some others had... our room was newly renovated and had 2 rooms - a large area in the front (dressing area) and then the bedroom. I didn't find the room to be small at all - with the luggage stored in the front room that freed up some space in the bedroom area.Overall a good stay - used starwood points so if I had to pay upwards of USD$500 I may not have been quite as happy. Also - if you're looking for a more pleasant/quiet lounge/bar area - Hotel 1898 has a beautiful bar/lobby area you can poach while the Le Meridian is going through their renovations. It is next door to the hotel.

<Content>Great Location Wonderful location, hotel presently under renovation of lobby so guests must use the bar area as the lobby to check in and during stay which is inconvenient and not a pleasant experience. Used our Starwood points and was upgraded to a suite after many requests and being rudely lectured to by an arrogant hotel staff member upon check in that the hotel was making an exception to Starwood's normal policy of not upgrading gold members to suites. On the basis of our prior travel to many other Starwood hotels this is not true. We were made to wait in the make shift lobby for 2 hours supposedly while our suite was prepared. However, upon entering our suite it was apparent that it had not been stayed in for some time. TV wasn't connected, shower was inoperable, no toiletries in bath etc. Concierge staff pleasant but not that knowledgeable about restaurants, events, taxi fares etc so do not rely upon their advice alone. Overall a pleasant but not luxurious experience.

<Content>Nice Hotel I stayed at this hotel while on vacation. My room had been upgraded to a room right on Las Ramblas. Considering how many people were walking in front of my room, my room was quiet. The room is indeed very small as others have noted, but I have stayed in smaller rooms in NYC. The room was dark, but thats not a problem for me. If I had to put makeup on everyday I could see that being a problem. The shower had drainage problems. Despite the fact that I speak Spanish and explained the problem to the staff twice, nothing was done to resolve the problem. I had to shower in a pool of water at my feet every night... and once I had been in the shower for more than five minutes... the water would flow into the main bathroom... not pretty. The workout facility was under construction while I was there, but passes were given out to a local gym. The local gym is very nice but was a nice ten to fifteen minute walk away from the hotel. I love my starwood points so I might consider staying here again, but otherwise, its just a nice hotel with a great location. Nothing really special about the hotel or the staff. However, the location can not be beat... its perfect for someone who wants to see Barcelona.

<Content>Wonderful hotel in Barcelona A wonderful business hotel with friendly staff and a great location. My hotel room was one of the best I have ever had, complete with large balcony. I enjoyed my stay and can recommend this hotel. Construction work for a new lobby was well managed. Mark, Switzerland

<Content>Excellent, considering the circumstances The location is just perfect, on the Ramblas next to the Barrio Gotico and with a street buzzing with people and shops. We had been advised that the lobby was under renovation prior to our arrival. I must say however, it was very discreet and we never saw any workmen around, it was clean and not noisy at all. The reception has been discretly placed in the bar provisionally, so you can have a drink while you check-in/out. Had a wonderful Mediterranean suite with the most amazing bathroom and jacuzzi! The variety at the buffet breakfast is very good. We liked the touch of a teddy bear with a small card saying Please bear with us during the renovation. Highly recommended!

<Content>Great location, nice hotel This is a nice hotel, in a great location. They are doing construction, but that really wasn鈥檛 an issue as we were typically out and about while the noisy stuff was going on. I was told it would be completed by the first of December, but trust me, they weren鈥檛 close when we stayed there. Some guests were demanding they be moved to another hotel. Overall for the price and rating, the property should be better. The personnel were, uh, okay. Mostly good. But, they should have been great. They suffer from that ugly syndrome many properties suffer from. They mistakenly think their discussions with fellow employees and following procedures trump the needs of their guests. The room was cool, but tiny. It had weird motion lights. Great when they worked properly, annoying when they didn鈥檛.This hotel is right on La Ramblas, so the location is perfect if you are new to Barcelona. If you aren鈥檛 a quieter option over in the Gothic area might be preferable. If you do spend time walking down La Ramblas, enjoy the spectacle, but keep your wallet safe. Don鈥檛 give money to anyone for anything (okay, maybe a mime or two). Most locals are trying to scam you. We watched tourist after tourist get taken by the shell game鈥ees, the oldest scam in the book.In summary, this property is leaning on its namesake. Hopefully once the construction is completed, they will also take a look at their guest experience.

<Content>Very disappointing - do not recommend to anyone My boyfriend and I stayed at Le Meridien Barcelona for the weekend in early Nov. Overall, the hotel was very disappointing, certain aspects - ridiculous. A few incidents -- After taking a shower, half of the bathroom was flooded  water even went into the room. Was told that there was a problem with the sink.- Not feeling well on our first day there, so I was sleeping in the room in the afternoon to get some rest. But to be able to sleep was impossible as the hotel seemed to be undergoing some renovation and the noise was there. And just when I was about to drift into sleep, at about 4pm in the afternoon, someone from the hotel CAME INTO the room without either pressing the bell or knocking the door. It was really unacceptable. Door bells are there for a reason, please.My general impression was that people in the hotels were not friendly/helpful. I understand that different people might have different experience staying here, and I do not want to make any sweeping generalisation. But for my stay, it was very very disappointing. I would not recommend anyone to stay here.

<Content>How to ruin your trip If you want to ruin your trip to Barcelona, stay here. It is highly overpriced, rooms are small and dark,services are inferior, and the staff is rude and unhelpful. It starts at the curb, where you can struggle to get your luggage out of a taxi on the cramped side street, as the doorman stands still and watches you. (And then expects a gratuity) I had reason to approach the front desk 3 times during my stay. Each time I had to wait behind other couples who were filing complaints or trying to check out early and go somewhere else. The web information is highly misleading and misrepresents the ranking of this hotel. Staying here makes you feel ripped off, and casts a palor over what ought to be a great stay in a fabulous city.I'd rather sleep in the park.

<Content>Great location. Disappointing hotel This hotel is in a great location right on La Rambla. The hotel itself was disappointing. The lobby still isn't finished. The desk staff was totally unhelpful when we asked questions about directions or sights. The rooms were very small, but they were modern and clean. Luckily we were using Starwood points. Otherwise this hotel was not worth the rates it charged.

<Content>Excellent! Amazing location - right on La Rambala.Excellent service - reception and concierge were very helpful and friendly, made great recos for restaurants and got us reservations.Beautiful room - I guess they've just been renovated so the room was definitely 5-star worthy! Very modern look, comfy bed.The lobby renovations were still not yet complete when we visited but that really didn't bother us at all - the side entrance was small but just fine and not at all an inconvenience.We didn't eat at the restaurant or order room service so i can't speak to the food... tho the prices did look high.

<Content>Wait until the construction has finished - 3 star We stayed here for two nights at the start of November. This is not a five star hotel in its current state. The location is great, the staff are very helpful and friendly and the rooms are very nice but the noise from the construction above our room 316 was a nightmare. Drilling, hammering, sawing, cutting you name it started at 9am and I don't know what time it ended at because we just had to leave the room. We had planned to stay in this hotel for two more nights but we moved to a great 4 star hotel called Hotel Jazz on Pelai at 170 euro a night versus 225 at Le Meridien. If its value for money and five stars your looking for do not stay at Le Meridien during construction.

<Content>Nice hotel, very relaxing and good food! We stayed at Le Meridien Barca at the start of June. The staff were very helpful on our arrival and the concierge accompanied my partner to park the car which was a nice touch.Our room wasn't ready on arrival, so we went along to the restaurant for something to eat (reception staff did give us drinks vouchers). The food from the snack menu was great.Our room was quiet and relatively spacious for a city centre hotel. Bathroom was a real treat and the bed as always was very comfortable.We have stayed at Le Meridien hotels on a number of occassions and although it was very good, it didn't quite match Vienna on service.I would return here as the location is great and I'm sure after the hotel is refreshed it will be even better.

<Content>Great rooms!!!!!!!! The hotel location is great, right on the Rambla (too many people!!!) and you can take the bus from the airport to Plaza Catalunya and then walk afew blocks.They are going under major construction, I think the lobby is the last part and will be ready soon.That was the thing I didnt like, you take a small door and then go to front desk (very small) next to the bar, next to the restaurant.The elevators are small, I think because the construction, we had a room in the fourth floor, the halls are wide and totally new, then you open the door of your room and is small, BUT so nice, modern, GREAT BEADS, fantastic linens, towels, bathrobes, the pillows are very good, the shower is sooo good, like a spa.I can麓t say enough about how much we liked the room, we relaxed and had a great time because we were there during the weekend so we had no noise, only a little on friday afternoon and monday morning, I麓m sure during the week is awful.The staff is very nice, very friendly, probably not very proactive in terms of understanting the guests麓 needs, I would say the service is not five stars.

<Content>Fantastic.!!! Don't let the construction bother you Fantastic hotel in the middle of the Ramblas. Ultra Modern room, best bed and linens ever, a shower that you will not want to leave, and the thickets softest towels I have ever experienced. Big LCD hanging from the wall, and TV in the bathroom.Ask the person who helps you with your luggage to show you how the lighting of the room works because it is a little tricky. A soft blue light on the floor will always turn on in the middle of the night even with the slightest move and believe me, it is hard to manage the lighting. Ask for an upper floor room, because the construction on the lobby starts at 9:00 am and you will not only hear it but feel it if you stay in the first floor. So, don't let the lack of a real lobby and the construction bother you and experience a fantastic room in Barcelona.Pd; free internet in the business center...and free coffee, chocolate croisants and fruits if you wake up early.

<Content>Le Meridien on La Rambla Modern rooms, very sleek decor,great bathrooms. Rooms have flat screen TVs, comfy beds. Didn't eat at the restaurant with all the wonderful tapas bars around.The bar to the right as you leave the lobby was very local, friendly and good late-night food or early morning as it may be.No concierge, or, if there was they were never around, but the staff speaks English pretty well and has maps.Don't get me wrong, nice and reputable hotel brand, but I would rather have stayed at the hotel across the street Hotel 1898. Much more character, rooftop pool and lounging area, beautiful rooms.

<Content>Wait till Constructions Finished! Half the hotel was being renovated and the entire lobby was not accessible. The staff was very helpful finding us an acceptable room but at these prices, considering the difficult circumstances, breakfast or a discount or something should have been offered to compensate for noise and mess! Hotels undergoing such a major overhaul should clearly inform customers or close altogether. Older travelers should beware Meridien's new look. Getting into and out of the shower requires a huge step over a higher than normal ledge which, when wet, is also slippery. The bathroom is supposed to be chic, if small. I found it poorly laid out with mirrors too high to see and only half a tub enclosure to keep shower water from dousing the floor. Lighting turns on and off automatically, thus waking your companion if you get out of bed during the night. This hotel will probably be very cool when finished but I could not recommend it even though we found the staff very kind under the circumstances. Unless you're under 25 and plan to party all night, there really is no reason to stay on Las Ramblas anyway. Good news is, new windows keep street noise down and we enjoyed the restaurant very much.

<Content>The best i've found in Barcelona Stayed three nights in August, booking through SPG.COM.Upgraded to very nice suite as part of platinum spg recogntion program, and very impressed with room. Quiet, spacious with comfortable living area and well thought out bathrom with great selection of toiletries. A nice touch was the comp. botle of Hermes eau de toilette.Had room service breakfast each morning from a la carte menu. fresh squeezed juice, superb selection of prepared fruits, good pastries etc. About the best continental i've come across in Europe, on par with Berkeley Hotel, London, but at 30 euros rather cheaper.Wake up calls all on time.Room service dinner was also good, with professional, polite staff who were happy to listen to specific requests for slightly off menu choices.All the staff I came across were generally helpful, especially considering the general lack of a can do service culture in Spain, and BCN in particular.There's a small biz centre on LG floor, which was useful as I'd dropped my laptop en route and needed to remain in touch with office.I've previously stayed in both suites and apartments at Arts, and must say this beats the Arts in many respects, not least of all in terms of service and value for money.

<Content>Great location, ultra-modern room We spent 2 nights in the Le Meridien Barcelona before boarding a cruise. The remodeling of the hotel is done except for the lobby. They're using a place in the bar for the temporary reception which made it very crowded on check-out and difficult to find on check-in. Our room was very nice, ultra-modern decor and lighting that seemed almost too complicated for it's own good but it worked out. Very nice bathroom and large room by European standards. The hotel restaurant was always buffet-style and the food was good quality for buffet style but very pricey. The staff was friendly and available and the room and common areas were always clean and well maintained. The location right of Las Rambalas was ideal and it was easy to find.

<Content>Worst Service Well the hotel was modern and new but the service was terrible. I checked in to be given a smoking room wrong standard I complained and asked for correct room and the manager told me if I did not like it to leave. I eventually got what I asked for the next morning. Moved rooms and when I arrived back after a day sight seeing and the sheets had not been changed and the room had not be cleaned properly. Day 3 came back and 3/4 a bottle of Moet had been dumped by the maid without my permission. When I complained and asked for the champagne to be replaced they did not want to do it. To be honest if I had a problem instead of being accomodating the staff wanted to have the last word not find me a solution. Dont forget this is meant to be a 5* hotel!!Would not recommend staying here as i left not relaxed and really p****d of. Would not receommend at all.

<Content>Currently not a 5 star We decided to have a few days in Barcelona with friends, and got a good deal at Le Meridien, attracted by its location on Las Ramblas and the official 5 star rating. I was wary about the previous reports on refurbishment, but it sounded substantially complete. On arrival, we found that the main reception and lounge area was being re-developed, and so had to use a temporary reception. This gave a poor impression of the hotel overall. The temporary reception was very busy and crowded with suitcases etc of those checking out, or waiting for transport. Our room was initially not ready, but after a walk around the area, we were allocated our room. This had been fully refurbished in a modern, minimalist style, and the bathroom, although very smart, had a large shower area but no bathtub. The view from the room was of the back of some appartments and offices opposite. We did not have dinner in the hotel, but had a couple of drinks in the lounge, which offered good service, but high prices. Breakfast was included in our package, and was very varied and tasty, with some egg dishes cooked to order. Unfortunately on the last morning, the overnight thunderstorm had caused the flat roof above the breakfast buffet to leak, resulting in water dripping through the still live light fittings - not a very safe situation!Overall the hotel was disappointing, and it was difficult to see how the 5 star rating was justified, even if the refurbishment was disregarded, and if staying in Barcelona again we would certainly look at other options.

<Content>Great hotel in perfect location My wife and I spent the end of our honeymoon at the Le Meridien in Barcelona. The downside of our trip - the hotel's main lobby was under construction. That was the ONLY downside. The room we got was excellent - it was not huge, but clearly recently remodeled with a very modern bathroom and a great bed. VERY comfortable room. The hotel location is ideal for a short trip - very near the Gothic quarter for exploring. On the Ramblas. The concierge booked us into an incredible restaurant (La Dama) for dinner - superb experience. Highly recommended.

<Content>Highly recommend Le Meridien Barcelona My husband and I stayed at the Meridien for one night prior to going on a cruise out of BarcelonaWe arrived at 9am...our hotel room was available and we were very pleasantly surprises to find a nice sized room, very modern , clean. and beautiful bathroom with great amenities.We left the next day, boarded the ship, and then I realized that I had left a blazer behind in the room.Two weeks later, upon my return home, I called the hotel, reported the blazer left in the room, and was told that it was found and woud be sent to me immediately.One week later, I received the jacket, along with a book I had also left in the room.The efficiency, honesty, and all around pleasant experience will certainly bring us back again, and we surely recommend the hotel for all of the above along with the wonderful location, right on the Ramblas.

<Content>What a disappointment! We were 11 in our family, stayed July 21, 2007, for 2 nights,we had 1 twin and 3 triples (1 adult and 2 children in eachroom).The only thing going for this hotel is the location.Rooms are very, very small, not very functional.The distances between elevators and rooms isawful (my brother has only one leg). The staff wasrude and disinterested. Definitely not a 4 or 5 starhotel. Should have listed to my travel agent aboutstaying across the street at the reliable Hotel Colon.

<Content>Great Experience at Le Meridien Barcelona My girlfriend and i spent three days in Barcelona and had a great stay at Le Meridien. The concierage and front desk staff were tremendous. In particular, Anthony, the concierage, was a great help. He was outstanding maping out all the must see spots and things to avoid. Anthony also did a great recommending local restaurants and tapas bars. He really helped make it a great trip instead of just a good trip for my now fiance and me.The hotel was finishing up a renovation of the lobby. The rooms, however, were complete by the time of our stay. Rooms were great, with plenty of space. We really enjoyed the style of the hotel - modern, but not too crazy like some W hotels. This hotel is a no brainer - you are right in the middle of everything on La Rambla.

<Content>Overall Very Good My wife and I stayed at the Le Meridien for seven days in July. We arrived early on Sunday morning from New York and our room wasn't ready. Not a big deal as we were there so early that we didn't expect it. I'm an SPG Gold Member and they told us that they would put the room cleaning on a priority list and that the room would be ready in about 1.5 hours. We went for a walk on Las Ramblas, had a cup of coffe and returned to the hotel about 1.5 hours later. The temporary lobby in the bar/restaurant area (renovations in the actual lobby) was absolutely packed with new arrivals waiting for their rooms. To make a long story short, we waited 4 hours to get a room and didn't get that one unitl I spoke to a Manager about the situation.Luckily, that was the only negative we experienced. There were room and lobby renovations going on, but there was no noise to speak of and the work did not affect our stay. The room was a renovated one on the 8th floor with a patio and facing Las Ramblas. It was good size for Europe, modern/clean and verything worked fine. The location of the hotel was perfect for sight seeing and the staff was very helpful. They really don't have a concierge as such but use the front desk people in that capacity. They were helpful and very friendly. The buffet breakfast was teriffic (well stocked at all times) and the breakfast help were responsive and friendly. We ate two meals in their restaurant and it was o.k., but not great. We wound up having a great stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Good choice for central Barcelona Had 4 nights here recently. Excellent location right on the Ramblas but rooms well soundproofed so noise not an issue. Refurbishments still ongoing (late?) but not intrusive. Room a bit narrow and lighting poor for (e.g.) reading in bed. Our refurbished room obviously had water coming into it from the bathroom as skirting board and paint coming off the wall. As no damp smell didn't bother askng for new room. Bed and other facilities in room otherwise fine. Staff v friendly especially at breakfast. Downside is lack of outside space e.g. roof terrace/courtyard - wish we had had a rooftop pool as some other hotels have in Barcelona. Recommended otherwise.

<Content>I loved this hotel I absolutely loved this hotel and Barcelona. It is located right on Las Ramblas which is a great street with plenty to see and do. There are restaurants and little shops all around the hotel within walking distance.The room itself was a decent size for Europe. It is very modern looking and I liked the huge flat screen TVs. The bed and sheets were very comfortable. The bathroom was large and clean. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.Although you had to pay for internet in the room, there a couple computers down near the lobby where you could use the internet for free.Overall great hotel and I look forward to going back to Barcelona and staying at this hotel.

<Content>ramble on the ramblas The hotel was excellent. Travelled on sleazyJet 拢35 each way as a last minute present for my much better half and spent quite a lot for 1 night at a hotel. Booked a cheaper one with ramblashotels.com but upgraded with them to Le Meridien after reading a couple of tripadvisor reviews of hotel rooms broken into, grief, tears and sorrow. The hotel was great, sort of at the bottom of the Ramblas, right by the market. Older hotel, very polite staff, nice big clean, quiet room and no hassle. Slept for the best part of 12 hours. Certainly no complaints from us. The hotel had also left a courtesy note saying our room had yet to be upgraded but we were happy with what we had. Loads of complementary toiletries and as we had taken one change of clothes (my significant other half had 1 hours notice of the trip) we used them. The Ramblas is a bit overpowering at night, loads of Brits and Germans looking for the Irish bars (who were the only ones to have security on) but probably no different than any other city at night. By day, visit the market for Tapas. Amazing stalls, cheap food, friendly staff. Visit the marina, beach and cathedral, stay away from tour buses - walk, you will see so much more. We landed 9pm and flew back 7pm following evening. Mad 22 hours, lots of fun - far better than Madrid which we visited in October 06. Hotel and Barcelona both recommended by us.

<Content>What a great hotel! I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Le Meridien. It is half a block off of Las Ramblas- you could not ask for a better location! Our room faced the side street (not Las Ramblas), so noise was not an issue for us at all. Very nice, modern, and clean room- large by European standards. Cannot speak to the food, as we did not have one meal at the hotel. But the location is convenient to the sights, the metro, and everything for someone wanting to see and learn about Barcelona. Could not be happier about our choice in hotel and would highly recommend it.

<Content>Great Hotel  We stayed at the hotel July 7-8, 2007 and found it to be a great property. I booked a standard room with Starwood points. It wasn't ready by the time they promised so they gave us a much larger room with a huge balcony overlooking las Ramblas. It wasn't a remodeled room, but still very nice and spacious by European standards. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful with restaurant recommendations and reservations. It's in a great area right on las Ramblas, but beware it is very crowded with tourists in July. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona.

<Content>maybe my individual tale of woes? I stayed there in April on points and am a platinum starwood member. All the reviews have been so great but I do want to tell my tale of woe as a word of caution. I felt very sorry for the staff as they dealt with one disaster after another and seemed quite embarrased..1) Disaster 1: The first room was a suite and when we arrived there was a problem with the electronic lock-- no key but the hotel master key could open it. It was supposed to be fixed the following day but was not. I finally had to really push to get a hotel manager to see the lock who then apologized and quickly moved me to nice room with a balcony view2) Disaster 2: It started raining and water started pouring out of the ceiling light fixtures onto the flat panel tv. in room number 2. We grabbed the TV so it was not damaged and went down to the front desk...who by now were flabbergasted..3) Disaster 3: We went to dinner at the hotel and the service was so bad they comped the meal.. we gave the price of the meal to the waiter since he and the staff were so embarrased at the hotel4) Disaster 4: Not really a disaster, but by now we had been upgraded to our third room which had a massive jacuzzi and two bathrooms. After all this I decided to take a jacuzzi to relax--which I never do-- and you guessed it, the switch didn't work and in fact came out of the socket in the tub.The renovation of the hotel has taken far longer than expected and I hope by now all this has been fixed. I really liked the folks working there and hope that under Westin management all the issues have been fixed.

<Content>Great hotel with great value!! This hotel is in a perfect location on La Rambla!! In addition to that the service was excellent and everyone spoke perfect english. The rooms have just been upgraded and offer very comfortable beds andbig screen plasma tv's in each room. The bathrooms were also very nice, ceiling shower was very relaxing the bathroom was very spaciousunlike most european hotels. I was traveling with a 2 year old and a 7 months old, which led them to offer me a suite for lower than the standard rate so we can all fit more comfortably. I had to pay for upgrade but it was a great rate and it was well received.There is a park around the corner if your traveling with kids and they offer free internet service in the lobby to check email and browse the web. I don't know if its every hotel in spain which the staff is so nice, but this over achieved my expectations.

<Content>Great location We were in Barcelona for two nights before leaving on a cruise. We chose Le Meridien because of it's location, close to the pier and right on LaRambla. We like to run in the mornings and we thought LaRambla would give us a place to start and then go down to and along the water. We were not disappointed, we were actually thrilled. The room was comfortable, the staff was very friendly. The internet access was convenient and easy to use. We loved walking La Rambla and sitting there in the morning and afternoon with an espresso and watching the people. A short walk to Placa De Cataluna and you can easily get anywhere you may want to go. We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a good hotel and one that puts them in the middle of the real flavor of Barcelona.

<Content>Good Hotel, Great Location We had a great stay for 4 nights at the Le Meridien. Staff was incredibly courteous and we loved the location and the overall feel of the hotel. As a SPG plat member, ended up on a high floor - but with an unrenovated room. Room was a little worn, but with a nice sitting area and bath and nice view. A friend was on lower floor but had a very sleek, boutique hotel like room with flat panel TV. Big selling point here is the trusted name and the wonderful location right off las Ramblas. Perfect place to stay and see the sights. Boqueria is nearby for fruit, and starbucks is across the street if you miss home and need a pick me up. Wouldn't hesitate to stay again, although there are so many great neighborhoods and hotels in Barcelona, next time we may head a little further north into town.

<Content>Location! This hotel is located in the perfect location. It is on La Rambla which is one of the main roads in Barcelona. We were able to walk almost everywhere from the hotel which saved us a lot of money on taxis. The hotel is modern and since it is in a city the rooms were small. We had wished it had a pool to sit at like some of the other Barcelona hotels because the weather was beautfiul. The staff at the hotel were wonderful helping us to select restaurants during our stay. We would highly recommend eating at Rosa Vinya. It was a small restaurant that wasn't touristy and the food was amazing.

<Content>Be alrert! Unbelievable poor customer handling! Once in a life time happened to me.....in the 5-star hotel.........True Story happened on May 22, 2007: I was back to the hotel room and found that my glass was broken. Obviously, I did not break it so it must be someone fromt the hotel broke it by mistakes. I took the broken glass to the reception and tried to found out what's happening. It is very disappointing that they kept me waiting for like 2 hrs and the final answer was that no one was found responsible for this incident. In this case, I was absolutely innocent and helpless. Because to me, a serious short-sighted person, I'm totally blind without the glasses. I felt extremely uncomfortable and is really torturing experience.Would you choose one hotel treat customer like this? I'm absolutely indoubt.

<Content>Excellent Location!!! I stayed at this hotel with a friend during a girly weekend break. Our hotel room was beautiful and had a great view of La Ramblas. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and the location was excellent near shops, great cafes and restaurants and only a 10 minute walk to the beach and marina. I can't fault this hotel - it was perfect.

<Content>If it suits your budget then do it..... Stayed in a Junior Suite in April for a long weekend. We asked for one of the refurbished rooms and we were not disappointed. Room had a main bedroom and a seperate lounge in which my son had a sofa bed. Both rooms and the bathroom had a TV. Bathroom was very modern and at night blue lights lit up automatically from the bedroom and lounge to guide you to the loo........ :)Although on the first floor the room was very quite if the windows were closed and Yes the air conditioning was working! All the staff were excellent, really attentive and friendly - we opted for the inclusive breakfast which was excellent and really set us up for the morning.Location on top end of Las Ramblas - excellent.Welcome drink from the bar and bottle of Cava in our room were also most welcome.....

<Content>Location, location, location! This hotel has the best location in Barcelona, right on La Rambla and a short walk from all the major sights. We had a large suite with huge bathroom and a sumptuous buffet breakfast was included, which allowed us to skip lunch so that actually saved money.The room was very comfortable and the lighting, linens and amenities were excellent. Barcelona is a very exciting city, and being in a good location is crucial in my opinion.The staff was very friendly and seemed to go out of their way to be helpful whenever we asked for advice or directions.The only negative was a window in our room looking into the bathroom. I was with my wife so it didn't bother me, but I could see how it could be embarrasing. I don't know if this was common to all the rooms or unique in ours.

<Content>Perfect Location! You cannot ask for a better located hotel in Barcelona. The Le Meridien, is centrally located on La Ramblas - the street that never seems to sleep in Spain, yet is a few meters off the road so that you never hear any sound if you don't want to.Really nice rooms. I love European stying so I enjoy these rooms - they are a bit small for the price but quite chic. Big 42 inch plasma in the bedroom and another smaller one in the bathroom. The room I am in on the club floor has a lot of funky recessed lighting and if I had one complaint its that even with all the lights on it's not very bright at all. Opening the curtain does the trick but then you've got a bunch of houses looking into your room.Stay here if you plan on going around town and yet need someplace safe to come back. Barcelona is notorious with pickpockets and this hotel is probably one of the safest places to walk back home without a hassle (since the street is always crowded). It's also perfectly located, the central square is a 2 minute walk away and from there you have every conceivable mode of transportation around town. I chose the hop on hop off bus that departs from there - buy the two day ticket, it's great value at 23 Euro. Overall, nice hotel, nice service and location location location.

<Content>Loved the location We booked this hotel on Starwood points and stayed in early March 2007. They first gave us a standard room which was recently renovated. The king bed was VERY comfortable and we loved that, but otherwise the room was very narrow (making it feel small) and too high tech for us. Big flat screen TV on the wall and blue lights that go on and off as you walk around the room. Bathroom was okay with a large shower but no tub. We had a problem with the room in that the shower from above was leaking into our shower so we asked for a new room. I mentioned that my husband was a gold Starwood member and they upgraded us to a junior suite. WOW! We loved this room. Very large with a sitting area. This room was the old style which we liked better. Only problem is the mattress is extremely firm. (It hadn't been replaced as in the standard rooms) Didn't bother my husband but I had trouble sleeping until I figured out to pile the large pillows on top and sleep on those (true pillowtop!) I guess nothing's perfect but as we were there for almost a week, having the larger room was great.What we absolutely loved about this hotel was the location. Right on the La Rambla and you can walk to the Barri Gottic, Placa Catalunya, the port and two metros within minutes. (Don't be afraid to take the metro; we took it with no trouble). Lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance and so much atmosphere! I think this was the most perfect location of any hotel we have ever stayed in.As far as the air conditioning goes - it wasn't turned on yet. They generally turn it on in March but hadn't done so yet, so don't expect air conditioning in the winter months. The original room we had felt stuffy because it was on a lower floor with only one window. The junior suite was on a higher floor with two windows and with them open, we were very comfortable. Our room faced a courtyard so noise was no problem for us.Maid service was excellent. They serviced our room twice a day. Towels are huge and bed linens excellent quality. All in all a very classy hotel.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel for the location (right next door to Hotel 1898). Ask for a room higher up as you will get a better view and it will probably be cooler with the window open. If smallish rooms don't bother you, the new beds are great and probably most people will like the modern style.As far as restaurants, the Attic (across the street) was okay and Les Quinze Nits (in the Placa Real) was a bit better (expect to wait in line to be seated). Both were reasonably priced. We didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on that. There is a grocery store next door and it's much cheaper to buy bottled water, sodas etc. there.We had some trepidation staying in Barcelona because of reports of street theft. I must admit that I was accosted in the Barri Gottic by two gypsy women who I think were trying to grab my purse. Luckily my husband was with me to throw them off me. We think I might have been targeted because I had a knock off of a designer purse that looks so real they probably thought it was the real thing. Probably not a good move on my part to bring that purse. Anyway I was fine and it wouldn't stop me from going. Barcelona is a fabulous city. Just be careful in crowded areas and hold on to your purse!

<Content>NIce hotel We stayed for 4 night in a junior suite, with view on the Rambles. Nice big room on the 7th floor, no noise from the street but reconstruction work on the 8th floor was going on till 6 pm. Our suite was not yet renovated but still very nice.Breakfast was included in our package. If not included you will pay 鈧?28 per person, I think way to much for what you get. Positive is that breakfast is served till 11.00 am. And don't be surprised that your room is cleaned during your breakfast!Prices for the mini bar where also high. Coke for 鈧?4,75 excluding tax is very high. Better go to the nearby supermarket and buy it yourself.

<Content>Good hotel on a perfect location! We've just stayed here for 4 nights in a junior suite and we weren't disappointed! Very spacious room on the 7th floor which faced the very busy La Rambla, but because of the double windows we didn't hear a thing of all the noise outside. The bathroom was large and clean and bathroom amenities were replenished every day, even when, for instance, the tubes of shampoo weren't fully used yet.The only two downsides of the room were the very (!) firm mattresses and the airconditioning that didn't seem to work well. No matter which temperature we set it on, the same temperature of air seemed to come out. There was some renovation going on at the floors above our room but there was hardly any noise from that. The turndown service was a nice touch and they even cleaned the bathroom again, replaced dirty towels and emptied waste bins after turning down the blankets.The breakfast buffet was ok; quite pricey (鈧?23) and we certainly wouldn't have used it if it wasn't included in the room price.Food and beverage are very expensive, even for a 5-star hotel! 鈧?5,50 for a (local) beer from the mini bar and in the hotel bar!The hotel staff at the front desk were very friendly and efficient; so was the staff in the bar. Staff at breakfast was ok; they seemed to be more friendly towards people who speak Spanish, but that was something we encountered in more restaurants.The location of the hotel is more than perfect: right in the busy centre of Barcelona with all tourist attractions nearby.All in all a good experience at this hotel!

<Content>Fantastic hotel Reading other reviews, I was a bit apprehensive to stay at this hotel. Recent construction and noise from the street seemed to be the top complaints, though neither was an issue for me. I booked the hotel on points, and the staff upgraded my room to a renovated suite with a deck on the 6th floor. It is in an alley near the middle of Las Ramblas, and so everything was nearby. There were two computers with free internet access in the lobby, and a carrefore was just around the corner for quick food.

<Content>good choice, with a couple of caveats Stayed at the Meridien Barcelona three nights this NovemberThe pro's: nice rooms, very friendly and helpful front-desk staff, good breakfast; nice beds and bedding; quick room serviceThe con's: the Spaniards love to smoke--make sure that your nonsmoking room is exactly that; beware of rooms on La Rambla side which can be noisy; it takes 10 mins to get a taxi although in theory they are parked right in front of the hotel; no gym due to renovationAll in all, a good value, it was our favorite property from among several Meridiens we have stayed at

<Content>Nice hotel, but don't use the concierge service We stayed in the Le Meridien for 5 nights in October as the final segment of our vacation. We took bus A1 from the airport directly to Plaza Catalunya and the hotel is a short walk down La Rambla. The hotel location can't be any better. The hotel is few minutes walk from La Boqueria, La Rambla is right outside your window, (if you are lucky enough to get one of those rooms) and 5-minute walk to the Gothic quarter. Also, if you follow La Rambla all the way to the end, you find yourself in an amazing marina. Since the hotel is under construction, there isn't any organization to storing luggage. There were luggage everywhere in the lobby and that seemed to be a permanent feature of the lobby. At our 2pm arrival, the only room with king size bed ready for check in faced the back alley. We took that room regardless. When we got to the room, she wasn't kidding that it faced the back alley. We were looking directly into other people's living rooms on the other side of the alley. The room is a decent size and the bathroom was great. Even though we didn't have a tub, the shower had one of those rainforest shower heads. The room came with all the niceties of robes, slippers, comfortable bed, clean linen, mood lighting and a 42-inch plasma TV. During our stay, housekeeping was very nice with daily turn-down service. If you have a don't disturb sign on, they always leave you a nice note to call when you are ready for turn-down service. The two computers with free internet access in the lobby is a great bonus. My main issue with the front desk/concierge service is that they insisted that we will get lost on our own and it鈥檚 better to take one of their tours when we had transportation questions. For example, we wanted to take a day trip to Montserrat and asked the concierge for train station location. They insisted that we will get lost on our own and not enjoy the trip, and it鈥檚 best to book a bus tour with them for 48 euro per person. On top of that, they would not provide any detail about the metro/train services we had asked. We ended up looking up the train service in our tour book and took a chance with getting lost. It turned out that the train station had BIG signs directing you to multiple daily services to Montserrat. It was a beautiful train ride up the mountain and the monastery was fabulous. It cost us a whoppy 12 euro per person. (BTW, we saw the route the bus would've taken, and it could not have been a comfortable ride). Just on a side note, hotel staff constantly stood in front of the hotel entrance taking smoke breaks or just hanging out there. For a 5-star hotel, they could do better than that to their first-impression. Overall, the hotel is in a great location, comfortable room, and free internet. But I think they could do much better for a 5-star hotel and for the price they are charging.

<Content>Graet Hotel-Fantastic Location ! I was a little worried about some of the negative reviews for this hotel.However, we need not have worried ! It is a first class hotel in an excellent location right in the middle of Las Ramblas.Despite this you don't hear any noise at night so you have the best of both worlds. We only had Bed  Breakfast option but the breakfasts were excellent - so much choice ! Also breakfast served everyday until 11.00 am - a fantastic plus for me. Who wants breakfast at 8.00 or 9.00 am when you are on vacation ?? Went with my wife and 6 year old daughter and the restaurant staff could not do enough for my little girl including giving her a gift pack with crayons/colouring book etc.No big deal to some I know but it is little things like this that make all the difference ! I cannot see how any other hotel would be better. I went to The Arts Hotel but far too pretentious and too far out of town ! Le Meridien is much better !! Go for it !

<Content>Mediocre stay While the hotel is in a great location and the remodel is a great design, members of SPG program like myself continue to be dissapointed.Room:Contemporary modern style, with a lot of dark wood and red.Very nice bathroom with flat screen TV. Tub had a curved pad so you could lean back and relax.Safe too small for a laptop Huge plasma TV! Hotel General:Excellent location, so much withing walking distance. Unlike previous guest, I had no trouble finding the hotel as it has a large sign on the roof.Lobby looks to be last renovated (old elegant style)2 computers in lobby to print boarding passes, busy, but free.Internet in room is wired (no wi-fi), and 17 EURO per 24 hours. You can also do .50 cent a min.Grocery store around corner, plus many great bars, bakeries and places to get coffee (Oliva had amazing cappucino!) less than 1-2 blocks away.For cheapies, the walk to Placa Catalunya is easy and there you can take the Aerobus to/from BCN for under 4 EUR.The hotel is busy because of it's history, nice rooms and excellent location. However, they don't seem to take the SPG program seriously.

<Content>nice room this hotel is undergoing renovation at present but lot's of the rooms have already been altered. the room was spacious with really comfy beds. the bathroom was a glass cube in the room with a door that doesn't quite close- okay if you don't need much privacy! the only problem we had, which other reviewers have mentioned, was the maid entering the room on about four occasions without checking if we were in. this was annoying and happened early in the morning even when there was a do not disturb sign in use. we complained about this.the restaurant and bar badly need updating - to compete with the 1898 hotel opposite. lastly, the location is great.

<Content>Queen for a day in Barcelona We all know Barcelona is one of the best destinations. It only got better while staying at the Meridien. Just of the Rambla giving me easy access to shopping and dining.However the maximizer to me was the room and the service of the hotel. Thoughtful and pleasant, putting 5 stars back where it has to be. The ultimate was actually the bed... dream on.Isn't that all you need from a hotel; great location, bed and service. I'll be back...

<Content>Great hotel, just a few details need improvement but definitely a good choice The hotel is on La Rambla, right in the heart of where you want to start your trip as a tourist. It's a little hard to find, because the address is on the La Rambla street, but the entrance is actually on a side street. That annoyed me to start, the street address the listed right now has some construction so I wandered around for 10 minutes trying to find the hidden entrance.The room I had was enormous by European standards. I had a lovely balcony with a nice view. It was very nice to lie out on the balcony furniture and soak up the sun! I had a view of hotel 1898 across the street, I think they have a pool...lots of people on the roof...The bed was super-comfy, the room was nicely appointed. Stereo was great. Shower was great. The bathroom had a floor thermometer to heat the floor, but it did not work in my room.I would stay here again, I thought it was a terrific spot. There are probably better hotels, and there were a few kinks which is why I can't give it a 5 rating.

<Content>DIFFICULTY WITH FRONT DESK STAFF We checked into this hotel in the midst of all the recent airline security issues. All three pieces of our checked-in luggage were lost. We were staying at the Meridien for two nights prior to a cruise and were quite frantic thinking we might not have clothing for the cruise, etc. When we checked in at approximately 4pm we were told that the hotel had been sold out and the remaining non smoking deluxe room was on the first floor overlooking the roof of the lobby and the dirty skylight on that roof. We asked for an upgrade (members of Starwood preferred) and were told there were none. We were offered a smoking room with two twin beds. When that was too smokey for us, we were promised to be moved the next day. Needless to say, that never happened. The front desk staff was cordial, but I found them to be unhelpful and ungenuine. They told us that they would assist us with checking on the lost luggage. They only did so when we were actually standing at the desk . Even then, one staff memeber decided that he had been put on hold for too long and just hung up. One time I called to inquire and was told that the hotel staff had called the airline at 11pm and there was no news. I reminded him that the airline luggage office closed at 7pm and so they could not have called at 11pm and he covered by saying, oh, well, I am sure my associates have been calling throughout the day...... Needless to say, the loss of luggage was quite frustrating. If the hotel had not offered to assist, we would have taken care of the telephone calling on our own. But the fact that they offered and then really did not follow through at all (and even lied to me) leads me to a pretty low opinion of the property. The perception was that they truly had no esteem for their cllientele.  I will not return to this property.

<Content>Fantastic weekend My husband and I had the most wonderful time at the Le Meridien in Barcelona. We spent 2 nights there using it as a base to explore the city.The room was fantastic, the service was brilliant and the location couldn't be matched.All in all a perfect stay. One word of caution - use the DO NOT DISTURB sign as the cleaners tend to come round at about 9am which proved a little too early for us!

<Content>Some things to work on at Le Meridian Although the location of this hotel is very good, there are a number of other issues that need attention for the price. Yes, they will walk right in on you. No knock, no housekeeping call, nothing, even with the do not disturb sign. In addition, half the lights in our room did not work. Maintenance had to come in and change the bulbs. My elderly parents were in the room next to us and almost killed themselves trying to get into the bathtub, which is about 3 feet off the ground. They knew they were elderly and I guess just did not think of it. We ordered a Sprite for our daughter in the bar when our room was not ready and it was 4.50 euros, almost 6 bucks! Come on, for a Sprite? And don't count on the wake up call, because 2 our of 3 of ours did not come. The service downstairs is very good but they loose it once youve checked in. Very comfy beds, though, and great towne/linens. However, for this kind of money I would try elsewhere.

<Content>Nice Place The hotel is nice. Great location, right on La Ramblas, near the outdoor market. I read some comments about this hotel being noisy, but I had no problems with noise from the street. There was some noise from some construction next door, but that was more in the lobby area than in the room. My only complaint was the almost RABID afternoon turndown service. More than once they just walked into our room (no knock before, no hello? - nothing). Just put a key in the door and actually woke us from an afternoon nap with a housekeeper standing in the room - Happend twice - the same day. I highly recommend using the 'Do Not Disturb sign. Didn't know those were so important...Other than that, the housekeeping staff was great - always had clean towels, service was prompt, great beds (all down), etc. Modern rooms. Huge bathroom - even for US standards. And great showers. Also, there are no clocks in the room, so bring your own. I heard some complaining about missing a few wake up calls, so don't rely on them.

<Content>Great Hotel I loved Le Meridien in Barcelona. I think the location is great - very close to La Ramblas. The hotel was very quiet. Concierge service was great with great dinner recommendations. Rooms were very clean with terrific housekeeping service and turn down service. Robes and slippers in the rooms with chocolates on your pillow. The bar was a little pricey, so beware.

<Content>Tradeoffs This location has huge tradeoffs. The good news is that this is a convenient tourist area with amusing sights such as street performers. The bad news is that the area also attracts activity such as pickpockets and other mischief. Factor that risk into your decision whether to stay near Las Ramblas.

<Content>Sleek, convenient, quiet... The Meridien Barcelona is reminiscent of other Meridiens in other cities in Europe and North America, in several respects: It is very comfortable, without being decadent; it is modern and sleek, without being soulless; but the service is rather corporate and detached. Quiet rooms are available on the back side of the hotel, the beds are plush, and the bathrooms are right out of a Malibu beach house -- broadband connections in each room are reliable. The location, of course, is ideal, with the entrance on a side street steps away from La Rambla. My only complaints were the overabundance of motion-detecting fluorescent lighting and the Las Vegasy red-and-gray color scheme in the rooms -- both of these features are a bit pretentious -- as well as the quality of food in the dining room, which was surprisingly mediocre. But for business travelers who don't need to fall rapturously in love with a hotel, this place makes up for those drawbacks with its efficiency and comfort.

<Content>Amazing Hotel, Wonderful Location We only spent one night in this hotel as our flight was cancelled and we had to find a room for one night. We got a great rate of 180Euro which included all taxes by making a reservation at the airpot. The tourist service located inside the airport right beside the huge statue of the horse let us use the phone. After some haggling with the reservation clerk and saying no thanks several times the deal was struck. We took the aiport bus 3.60Euro and got off at Placa de Cataluna and after a short walk down Las Ramblas we arrived at the hotel. It looks plain from the outside but it is amazing inside. They have flat screens in the room and the bathroom which has interesting frosted glass walls and doors. I enjoyed my one night at this hotel and hope to return someday.

<Content>Great location and good service in Barcelona Just got back from a long weekend at the Meridien. We had a really enjoyable time and the hotel contributed to this - except for a few small quibbles. The hotels' location is both a strength and a weakness. The convenience of being right in the heart of things is great but there is no denying it's noisy. The staff from check in to doorman to bar /restaurant staff were unfailingly pleasant and helpful. Our room on the second floor looked great at first glance - large bed ; huge plasma screen tv etc. However there wasn't much floor space left over. The bathroom again looked great - until you tried to use it. The design of the sink and taps is very poor - the tap is incredibly sensitive which combined with the shallow sink is an excellent recipe for getting an unexpected soaking. Then there's the bath tub/shower - the side of the tub is so high that it is extremely dificult to get into the shower. Also we weren't very impressed with the etched glass walls of the bathroom as anyone stood in the public corridor could easily see into the room if the door was opened for any reason. Triumph of form over function. On the up side the breakfast buffet/service was excellent and the entertainemnt in the bar was very pleasant for a quiet night cap.Barcelona was it's usual blowsy self - to borrow a quote from a well known sports bar chain the Ramblas is tacky yet unrefined. There was a lot less of the belligerent begging that I saw last year - maybe because it's early in the season. One point to note is that Sunday afternoon is not a good time to visit the Ramblas - most of the bird stalls packed up after lunch and a lot of the living statues were gone by 3 pm. A couple of restuarant recommndations near to the Meridian - Les Quatre Gats (Carrer de Montsio?) and Les Quinze Nits (Placa Reial) - people start queuing for this one before 8 even though it doesn't open till 8:30 - very popular with locals. On the other hand Los Caracoles seems to have gone downhill - very poor service and food not so good as I rememebr. If you have kids the Hard Rock is worth a visit - really fine range of memorabilia - although it's probably the loudest HR I have ever visited!!

<Content>Loudest Hotel I ever stayed at My first clue was when I walked in and the lobby smelled. Great location - about 1/2 block from Las Ramblas. The problem with 1/2 block from Las Ramblas is that it is the loudest hotel I have ever stayed at. It felt like Mardi Gras was happening inside my room. The beds were low to the ground and fluffy and the air conditioning could not work so we were so hot. Car doors slamming and people screaming outside your window all night. We woke up and moved to a hotel down by the water. The bathroom is in the middle of the room with etched clear walls.

<Content>Great experience Well I must add another excellent review鈥?This is a very comfortable hotel, really good value for money. It鈥檚 located in the very heart of Barcelona, La Rambla, and it is very easy to move around from there. My girlfriend and I went there to celebrate our anniversary and we really enjoyed our brilliant choice. I would recommend it to any person who wants their holidays in Barcelona to be just as they should be鈥?FANTASTIC! Breakfast was very good. Room has plenty of nice details and I particularly enjoyed taking a bath watching the bathroom LCD TV. Receptionists very welcoming.

<Content>Living as a Queen Stayed during the renovation and got upgraded to suite with balcony. Overwhelmed with luxury, comfort and service. What a breath taking view of the city. Our visit was a surprise to my wife and became something she will not easy forget; Love it when you treat me as a queen.Reception and concierge took all time and covered the details. The bar was heart warming with considerate music and quality cocktails. The room was spacious, has a nice balance between classic and modern and the bed was hard to get out of. Hard to imagine that downstairs the world was racing by when upstairs silence gave a royal calmth.The combination of luxury and location on the Ramblas made it the ideal stay for a romantic but active weekend in the centre of Barcelona.We'll be back.

<Content>Super Base for Las Ramblas  We stayed here for three nights (Thursday to Sunday). Having read some of the reviews we were a bit apprehensive. We need not have worried - what a super hotel! From the doorman rushing to our Taxi to open the door/grab the bags (the ever present security man opened the Hotel door for us whilst he was doing this) to the Receptionist who gave us brochures and maps and instructions after checking us in (imploring us to come back anytime and ask if we wanted anything else - restaurant suggestions, further info on Barca, whatever) to the Barstaff who served us whenever we called in for a drink, the Staff were all superb. Even Staff bumped into in the lift or corridor spoke without fail with a cheery Hola or Buenos Dais!The room (fourth floor) overlooked the street below, fair enough not much of a view, just the Hotel opposite,  not much to see each way, but we didn't go to Barcelona to sit in the room and look out of course. The room was great in other respects, huge plasma TV, further plasma TV in bathroom, turn down service, Tea  coffee / well stocked mini-bar, very comfortable bed, enough storage space, iron  board etc. heating  air-con which worked as the controls said. Brilliant shower!Sorry to say we never tried the restaurant, not even for breakfast as we were out so late at night, but others we spoke with found it fine. Breakfast in a Cafe on the Ramblas was fine for us, except for the beggars coming up to our table - the Waiters left them to it and we felt should have moved them on, some were quite intimidating. (Not the street performers - they are different to the Beggars and at least do something before holding their cap or bowl out).On another food note, we had Los Caracoles Restaurant in Calle Escudellers highly recommended to us prior to our visit, we like to think we are restaurant connoisseurs and frankly we found this restaurant extremely poor to say the least. We went on the Friday night to a pre-booked table that I took the trouble to ring and book over a week before hand from the UK, however we were crammed into a pokey corner and experienced poor service and very poor expensive food. We felt on leaving that it was a case of rush people through as quickly as possible to make way for the large queue waiting speculatively for a table in the bar. After all, most are City Breakers who probably wouldn't come this way again!We love the Ramblas and spent a good deal of time watching the world go by from a cafe table with either a beer or a coffee. It was about 20 yards from the Hotel door to being on the Ramblas if you like the area.Back to the Hotel, the piano bar late at night has a couple performing songs (up to 1am) and stays open until 2am, with as mentioned above great Staff to look after you. We like to sit at the bar and chat to other guests, being a 5* hotel stools weren't on offer and you sit at tables for 2 or 4, and the drink prices were very high, but what the heck, you expect that when you book this calibre of Hotel.In summary, excellent, and we would probably stay there again rather than risk trying somewhere else if we went to Barca again. Two things I would add to the Hotel if I were the Owner, a gym and a pool (if they have anywhere suitable to put them). Sorry, didn't get any photos of the Hotel!

<Content>Felt very welcome LOCATION ! LOCATION ! LOCATION !  My wife and I stayed there from 1/8 to 1/13 and were overjoyed. The airport bus at 3.6 euros was a breeze and only 3.6 euros. It left you off near the top of the Ramblas only a short walk to the Meridien.We found it more convenient to taxi back to the airport on our return at 25 euros. The room was a little noisy in the early AM but we got used to it. The bed was enormoud and comfortable. The pillows fantastic. The bathroom was ultramodern, plenty of shelf space,anice deep bathtubto soak in. It had an adjustable backrest. It also sported an honest to goodness a real efficient American shower. Continental breakfast was obcenely priced, but the buffet breakfast was lavish and a comparative bargain. The staff was agreeable and helpful. the price of 179 euros plus seemed fair. Would look forward to returning. the hotel did not seem very busy

<Content>Great hotel. Highly recommend it to friends The hotel is in great location for sight seeing and shopping. The reception staff are the best that I have come across in Spain (Stayed at Westin Palace in Madrid, Westin Alfonso XIII in Sevilla and Paradors,etc).They are going through renovation right now but the service of the reception staff made up for everything.

<Content>5 Stars All Round!! Stayed for 2 nights from 15 December 2005. Reception were very welcoming and upgraded us to a Suite on 7th floor with 2 balcony views of La Rambla - what a view - and a sunrise! Maids were very nice and quickly upgraded our room to accommodate 3 people. Bar staff were great and so friendly - really made us feel welcome. Live music was wonderful both nights. The room was amazing - ultra sleepy beds and great CD and plasma. Bathroom was luxury with all the little extras and fresh flowers everyday. Loved the choccies on my bed! Location fabulous - central for everything and right on top of Starbucks for our morning coffee. The only place to stay when we visit next time. Had the best time with my 2 wonderful sisters!!!

<Content>Lovely hotel - Great reception staff The hotel was being refurbished and we had a newly refurbished room which was pure luxury. Great bathroom and bedding. The reception staff were really helpful and we would recommend this hotel. Also a great location.We always use this site to check out hotels before going on holiday and we think the reviews are the best guide.

<Content>Great Location, Great Staff, Great Stay !! I visited the hotel for business purposes, I found reception to be very helpful, the bedrooms very comfortable and had all the modern facilities I would expect from a hotel of this standard. The bathroom was great too, had all the girlie things I would expect.! I found all the staff very professional and friendly. The hotel for me was in a great location, great for my pick up point and great for shopping in the evening, which I felt extremely safe doing on my own. The hotel is going through re-furbishment whilst I was there and I found it didn't disturb my stay at all. Once finished the hotel will be fabulous.

<Content>Charming central hotel We decided to spend a long weekend at this property due to its excellent location and only can highly recommend it: High quality service, extremely nice and helpful staff, caring a lot about our concerns regarding the refurbishments (we had been advised about those before, however we were surprised that we almost did not notice anything). The rooms were great, cozy and confortable. The TV with plasma screen and modern bathrooms are really stunning.... Alltogether an unforgettable stay!

<Content>What Else Do you Need?! I went to Barcelona last week with some colleagues for business purposes, and had the most pleasant stay at Le Meridien Barcelona. The Location is superb, Staff was extremelly polite, very professional and well trained. The concierge was a must booking all our tapas dinner and taxis always on time, extremely helpfull! We were advised that the hotel was undergoing refurbishment prior to our arrival but, to be honest, we hardly noticed it. The room excellent with brand new luxury bathroom. 5 STAR! What else do you need?! To Stay Few More Days!

<Content>Couldn't care less Good location and that is all. During the stay the hotel was undertaking major building works - and we are talking here about, for instance, walls being knocked down. The services were also curtailed, as the hotel was not able to function properly. However the hotel still charged full rates.The supposed new deluxe rooms are very small in comparison with other hotels in Barcelona and the value is therefore very poor despite the location. We found staying in the room both hazardous and unpleasant. The fittings are similar to cheap retail store fittings (dark wood laminate) and the d茅cor induces feelings of depression. Really it was design nonsense of style over practicality. The best part about the room was being able to leave it.Complaints to the hotel were met with arrogant compliancy. They probably think that there are enough new customers not to worry. My advice is to go elsewhere; you will be much happier.

<Content>Fantastic hotel and unbeatable location I just experienced the newly renovated rooms at this beautiful hotel and was totally blown away. The most comfortable bed I ever skept in, huge flatscreen TV and a beautiful bathroom with rainshower and extra TV. The location right in the Ramblas is unbeatable and the service was attentive and caring. I loved every second of my stay!

<Content>Charming stay in Barcelona My wife and I were in Barcelona for 3 days. We got a good deal at this otherwise pricey hotel. The rooms and service were really fantastic, especially by European standards. We got a very nice room, luxury bathroom and nice amenities. The location of this hotel is where you want to be if you are calling Barcelona. All landmarks, shops, night life, theatres are next door or at a stonethrow away. The staff was courteous and always helpful. The turndown service with hotel slippers and chocolates made us feel very special. The concierge were helpful in confiming our flights to Rome and making reservations for us in local restaurants (nice tapas restaurants!). Try to have breakfast included, as it is a very nice European spread, inclusive of cappuccinos or whatever you want. The hotel is quite historic. If you are looking for a place which is charming, does not feel like a typical large chain, and is luxurious, stay here.

<Content>Okay rooms, horrible restaurant... Now we know why the Mediterranean suites were so cheap. The room itself is nice enough (with a large bed, deep loveseat and chair, Mediterranean-themed carpet and wall colors, decent-size TV, etc...), but the views from the terrace can be marginal (unless you like looking down on alleyways, tin roofs, and into other people's apartments nearby), and the air conditioning doesn't seem to work.Oh, and the hotel doesn't have any fans. Fortunately, there is a supermarket a half-block up Las Ramblas (on the same side of the street), owned by the Carrefour consortium (which means it's much like most any other major supermarket chain you might encounter in Europe). On the first floor, they've got fresh vegetables, drinks, personal grooming products, electrical equipment (including fans), etc.... Make sure to check your bag in at the front desk before you enter the store, and keep in mind that if you're going to use a shopping cart that the only way downstairs (to all the packaged food, dairy products, fresh meats and cheeses, etc...) will be the elevator on the right, and is not well marked unless you're looking up at the signs above your heads. Otherwise, you'll want to stick with a hand-basket and the escalator or stairs.The bed in this room is amazingly hard -- the hardest bed I think I've ever tried to sleep on. I'm not sure, but I may have had a softer bed at times in the past when I was camping, with my sleeping bag on the ground. Or when I was crashing with friends, laying directly on a hard concrete floor with a thin layer of carpet. But my wife is absolutely in love with the pillows -- they give each of you a huge two foot by two foot back pillow, and a smaller pillow to use while sleeping, and they are high quality down/feather.But why have a nice bathroom with lots of marble and mirrors, if you're going to get a sewer stink? We passed a sewer on Las Ramblas, so we know for sure what that smell is, we just can't be 100% certain where it's coming from in the bathroom. And why have just one bar of soap in the bathroom? Don't you want a large one in or near the bath/shower, and a smaller one near the sinks? After you've washed yourself in the shower with the large bath bar, do you want to use that same bar again to wash your hands or face in or over the sink?Note that the shower is very powerful (enough to hurt, if you turn it on full strength), and can get very, very hot -- Think McDonald's coffee hot. I like hot showers, and I like long showers. I could only turn the handle very slightly past the halfway point before I felt like I was being scalded. And the hot water never ran out. The tub is also very deep, but is made out of plastic and was rather disconcerting to feel it moving underneath my feet. I later decided that it was intentional to have the floor of the tub have a slight give to it, to make it feel a bit softer and more comfortable. It also has raised spots spread throughout, which I presume is intended to have some sort of massage effect on your feet. The electrical power in the room is also marginal -- we lost all power earlier today, but we're not sure if it was a breaker that flipped or a result of the construction. We were leaving at the time, so it didn't really matter. But I would be very concerned if that kind of thing happened when we were going to be in the room for a while. Tonight, we've noticed that all the other lights in the room will flicker when you turn on another electrical device.Also note that most of the lights in the room are compact fluorescent, which tend to give off a kind of greenish glow, and don't put out a lot of light. If you have seasonal affective disorder, or get depressed at night if you have bad lighting, be warned. There are lights on the terrace, and they can feel pretty bright at night.The light switch by the door controls the power to the small halogen lamps in the ceiling near the door (over the desk), but also controls the power to the small halogen lamps in the alcoves and the floor-standing halogen lamp in the bedroom. Unfortunately, the floor-standing lamp is fairly weak (I'm guessing 100 watt or 150 watt, instead of the standard 300 watt). It took us a while to figure out how to turn on the floor-standing lamp, and even had the engineer come up to take a look at it to see what needed to be fixed.Avoid room 627 at all possible costs. It is long and thin (and weirdly shaped), with a tiny breakfast/living area at one end, and a tiny bedroom area at the other (just barely large enough to contain the bed). The air conditioning does work well, but it drips -- make sure you don't put anything underneath the vents on the ceiling in the hallway area.This room may have two TVs (one in the living area and one in the bedroom area), but the one in the bedroom area can't display any of the on-demand movies or other special content. You can get the small selection of satellite TV channels, and that's it.The one saving grace of room 627 is that it has a much larger and nicer terrace than any of the other Mediterranean suites, with views of three sides of the hotel. The other suites on the sixth floor look out mostly onto other nearby buildings.As far as the food is concerned, the room service menu is very minimal. The soups have been good, the single-serving size margarita (only cheese, no sauce or other toppings) pizza is hand-tossed thin-crust style (which my wife likes but I don't), the club sandwich is very good, the chicken with green tagliatelle pasta was okay.But whatever you do, do *NOT* eat dinner in the restaurant downstairs. It looks nice enough, the dinner is buffet-style (which my wife and I thought we would appreciate), but the food itself was marginal at best. It took me a long time to figure out when I last had cafeteria style food that was worse -- I had to go back to school lunches that I had in sixth grade, and even some of them were better. And the restaurant downstairs is Euro-style expensive, with dinner for one person running something like 30 Euros.The bar looks nice, and they're supposed to have live entertainment Tuesday through Saturdays. We haven't actually done anything there, but I think it would be hard to screw that up too badly.If your room is on the fifth floor or below, you have two elevators to choose from. If you're on the sixth floor or above, there is only one elevator, which is apparently also shared with the staff. You can get three people in one of these elevators, but that can be a tight fit.

<Content>Fantastic new rooms Just visited on business this renowned hotel. I was thrilled to stay in one of their recently refurbished rooms that have turned this hotel in one of the most elegantly designed in Barcelona. The quality of the matress, pillows, rainshower and generally the materials used throughout the room are superb...its been years since I have slept so confortably. Added benefits are a huge plasma TV, a very confortable red armchair, a blue night light that guides you to the bathroom without disturbing your partner and a userfriendly lighting system. I also found the complementary shower gel to be very envigorating. Cannot wait untill the public areas are refurbished. If they are going to be anything like the rooms this will surely be the best hotel in Barcelona. Overall the staff were very helpull, above the level that you would expect from a five star hotel. I strongly recommed you vist this hotel!

<Content>Nice rooms, horrible service The rooms are nice - what you would expect for a hotel of this class. However, the service is non-existent. First, when we checked in, there was nobody available to help with our bags. Then, they gave us a room with 2 double beds, even though we reserved a room directly through the hotel website requesting a king-sized bed. We immediately asked to change rooms, but they had no king-sized beds available and they would give us a new room the next day. The next day, I called again and the front desk had no idea I made the request the day before. After some arguing, they relented and gave us a room with a king size bed. Also, the concierge made us a reservation at the wrong restaurant, and they were unable to help us rent a car. The final blow was when leaving, we requested a taxi to the train station. The taxi driver and the bellhop appeared to know each other. The driver charged us 18 euros for what should have been a 9 euro taxi ride. We suspect the bellhop got a cut.A lot of people complain about the noise, but fortunately both rooms we had were not facing Las Ramblas, so noise was not an issue for us.If you want to stay in a luxury hotel, stay at the Arts Hotel, or any of the luxury hotels on the Diagonal. Le Meridien Barcelona is a rip-off. Also, while we thought the location directly on Las Ramblas was convenient our first night, we realized later it is not worth staying right smack in the middle of everything. There are plenty of luxury hotels that are in safer areas (especially around Rambla Catalunya) and are walking distance to Las Ramblas and the Barri Gotic. Don't stay here! You will be sorry!

<Content>BEWARE: You will regret staying here. The noise is unbearable. I just returned from the Le Meridien Barcelona. What a horror! The noise is unbearable. It makes you want to jump out the window! It's horrible beyond imagination. It is a constant, extremely loud, pounding, from which there is no escape.Worse yet, before I went, I asked if there would be noise, and was told 'no'. I was told that the renovations were finished. Apparently, their goal is to now finish sometime in mid-2006. Personally, I wouldn't believe them, and I would avoid this hotel for a long, long time. They lied to me about being finished with their renovations, when there are no where near finished. How can they be trusted? Renovations of this scale can last for years.This is the first time I have every posted on a travel site. I tried to get out of the hotel as soon as I arrived, but could not for 2 days. I asked for another room, but was told that all rooms are just as bad. Le Meridien should shut this hotel down with this much noise. They are milking people to cover their expenses, but not providing a place of quiet enjoyment. When I suggested a reduction to the rate based on the noise, the manager became insulting and accused me of trying to get something for nothing and abruptly said that no discount whatsoever would be provided. I was shocked at the manager's rudeness, but promised myself that I would post this review so that others would be forewarned. You would be better off at a quiet 2 star hotel, than this terrible hotel. There are many, many, less expensive hotels all around this hotel. Stay at any other hotel!The renovations start early in the morning, and go late into the day. It is a constant sound like metal slamming against stone, and it echos throughout the hotel. Forget about sleeping in, and forget about an afternoon nap. It's a bad joke. Le Meridien as a chain, has/had a decent reputation, but this place is terrible and the management is rude. You should have seen the front desk. The customers were lined up complaining all around me. Every time I went by the front desk, people were complaining. The staff is oblivious to the customers' complaints. They just do not care. They know exactly what they are doing: They are calculating that it is better for them to take in the cash flow at the cost of alienating the transitory tourists who stay there. It really should be a crime what they are doing.Barcelona has so many hotels. Don't be suckered into staying at this hotel like I was!

<Content>Beware of the renovations We booked our trip to Le Meridien on a last minute deal, hoping for a comfortable (at least) stay in a 5* hotel in a great location.We were dissaopinted on arrival to find that due to the renovations, our room was not ready for us. We were put up for the night in a hotel opposite (Hotel Montecarlo - absolutely impeccable may I add). The room we were given was a beautiful suite, and whilst this was a nice compensation and the staff did all they could, it didn't really make up for being unable to unpack and relax properly. We had to check out of the replacement hotel the next morning, but were told that our room in Le Meridien would not be redy until 2pm. This was understandable, but waiting for our room to be ready was not how we would have planned our first day in Barcelona. We pottered about in lovely Barcelona until 2.30pm, at which time our room was still not ready. We had been upgraded to a suite, and were told that as it was a larger room, it would take longer to clean. It was finally ready at 3.30pm. We were happy with the room (though it was not as good as the other hotel), but mostly as it meant that after 24 hours in the city, we finally had somewhere to shower, rest and avoid the sweltering midday sun. The ceiling had a large stain on it, and the room was a little average, if larger than we had expected. Whilst we could not have any complaints about their service, it does not make up for the fact that we effectively lost a whole day in Barcelona (out of three - a large proportion of our trip) waiting around for a room. I would advise you to hold off from staying at this hotel until the refurbishment is complete. You will have no problems otherwise, as the hotel is absolutely fine, but I would still say that it lacks personality. The location is great and the rooms are quiet despite being on La Rambla. My final remark is that on our last day (having not been woken up by the wake up call we ordered which never called!), we were presented with a bill for the other hotel we had stayed in. Of course this was resolved but 5* service it was not. If you have already booked, don't be alarmed, you will have a pleasant stay, but just be aware that the renovations are still underway.

<Content>Will be more Above Average when remodel is complete We waited and waited and snagged 2 rooms at the Le Meridien when we found a good price. The deals are out there. I think we were in the midst of a heatwave in Spain. We arrived to find a hot, hot lobby, hot, hot hallways and hot, hot elevators but really cool rooms (both style and temperature)! Seriously, the common areas were unbearable. The newly remodeled rooms are modern and great. Awesome beds, interesting lighting and fixtures. It took some time to figure out the multitude of lighting choices (switches everywhere would do different things every time you used them) and the workings of the tv were a bit of a puzzle (it would stay on or not turn on). GREAT shower, Plasma TV too. The air-conditioning in the rooms worked perfectly and the rooms were quiet enough so that you could not hear other guests. Especially when the windows were closed, you could barely hear outside noise. You could, however, hear construction in the hotel and across the street (the contractors on that building chose to take their coffee breaks sitting on the roof of their adjacent building to watch the goings on in the hotel rooms) but that won't last forever.They offer free admission to an excellent, top rate gym/spa facility with an indoor pool but it is a 10 minute walk away.The common areas were not inviting to relax or hang out in. That was dissappointing since we were traveling with friends and found ourselves just retiring to our seperate rooms. We did see some famous people who were there as guests. The restaurant was very average (even for breakfast) but they are building a new one right on Las Ramblas. The staff was incredibly helpful and made some excellent, non touristy recommendations.We sought out the Le Meridien because of it's class of hotel (listed as a 5 star) and it's proximity to Las Ramblas. Consequently, it's kind of a contradiction. Las Ramblas sure has the activity level we were interested in but it's kind of on the seedy side. Although we never felt our safety was at risk there is a bit of an element there.We found ourselves walking up passed the Placa Catalunya and spending our evenings on Rambla De Catalunya (higher up on La Rambla) or Passeig De Garcia where the nicer cafe's and stores are. I think a better choice would have been to stay there and visit the Las Ramblas madness for measured doses.Not unhappy with our choice but we might consider a different location next time.

<Content>Great hotel in Barcelona We wanted to be near the La Ramblas shopping  cruise pier. This hotel was all we wanted  much more, just steps from shopping  the exciting La Ramblas mall with all the street performers, large grocery store, great produce market place, restaurants, Metro station  5Euro cab ride to the cruise pier.  Smart, new, super clean Art- Deco rooms, state of the art plasma TV, HUGE bathtub w/fancy back support so that you could watch the 2nd TV in the bathroom, the BEST most comfy down pillows  bed (pillows were not available for purchase, because we inquired)  beautiful bath amenities.  Friendly front desk staff  bellmen, all who spoke English; all staff also served as concierge  information desk, which the hotel lacked. Most unique feature in our room was that when you got out of bed to go to the bathroom at night (in the dark), there was some kind of sensor that turned on a soft blue light on the floor and in the bathroom! We had the $25 buffet breakfast that included all you could drink Cava (Spanish champagne), a little pricey for what was offered, but food was fresh  good, friendly servers. Our only regret was that we only had time to spend 1 night here before our cruise.

<Content>Simple, complicated and expensive.... Stayed in this hotel for 5 days, early in April. Called ahead to verify they had aircondition rooms and the answer was yes. Upon arrival, try to set the AC to cool the room, but didnt work. Called the front desk and the answer was that they did have AC but that it will not be available until the end of the month. Therefore had to sleep with the window open, lots of noises from people at La Rambla, garbagge truck at 4:00 am and other nightly noises. Bar was very expensive, 2 drinks and a couple of entrees was $70.00. Staff not very friendly, would help you if asked, but they didnt went out of their way to help. Hotel was under renovation. Rates are rather expensive, but so are other hotels in Barcelona, US$ to Euro dosent help either.They have 2 PC's with internet in the lobby, that was nice and in the room the best thing was the bed, very comfortable.The area is not very good, has changed a lot for the worse. NOT a family hotel, and I would probably stay at another location in the future.

<Content>modern hotel in the heart of downtown Barcelona My two toddlers, my husband, and I stayed in a suite at Le Meridien, Barcelona. Service was great, with turndown twice/day, chocolates on bed every day, great amenities and the room was very spacious - enough to accomodate a king-sized bed, a cot, and a crib without feeling cramped. It is located right in the heart of downtown Barcelona with many touristic attractions within walking distance or a few minuites in a taxi ride. The street is very very busy, but the hotel does a good job of blocking out the noise once windows are closed. It was great for us also because a market is located right next to it - for last minute needs of milk, juice, diapers, etc.The only thing about the hotel that was less superb was the restaurant and brunch. The breakfast menu is not impressive for the price, and the decor is too homely/country-style which is not in accord with the rest of the hotel (The lobby and rooms are decorated in sophisticated modern style).Parking is also additionally charged and fairly expensive. There is no pool or gym or spa on site.

<Content>Very Shoddy Very unimpressive. The hotel is undergoing a refit. I stayed in a recently refurbished room. It looked great, was clean etc. It failed however on all the bits that make a difference. Morning alarm calls never happened (I overheard a number of guests complaining as they missed or were late for meetings!. The appliances (phone, plasma screen TV etc) were all being repaired when I arrived and did not work after the electrician left. The sound of heavy drilling started at 08.00 and continued throughout the day. For the money there are better places to stay

<Content>Wonderful! Having telephoned Le Meridien at 1800 hrs having checked out as quickly as checking in at a nearby hotel which was a dive, we had a fabulous time. The staff were attentive, the rooms spacious to say the least (we got a great deal as a late booker on a couple of suites), the piano bar relaxing and the location excellent. Highly recommended.

<Content>Brilliant hotel Stayed in the hotel as a special treat for my husband and I . We could not fault the room with own private terrace giving views across Barcelona. We could easily view La Ramblas, the Olympic stadium, cathedral and port with out leaving our room. The staff were excellent and could not do enough to help. The breakfast was pricey at 23 euros for continental breakfast but the mini bar was reasonable and well stocked. You may need to do some weight training to be able to wear the very heavy, fluffy bath robes and you may need a compass to find your way around the very large beds but the chocolate left by the bedside every night helps to keep your strength up. Our daughter also loved the teddy bear we brought back for her. Didn't eat in the restaurant but the menu looked varied and reasonably priced. Drinks in the bar were also averaged priced and you get free nibbles.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Just completed a short stay post--renovation (the hotel re-opened on March 3, 2005) and found the establishment to be excellent. We got an internet deal on a king-bedded room (which otherwise would have run to 390 Euros per night..pricey by most folks' standards I am sure) and were very pleased with the accommodations. We particularly like being in/near the Gothic Quarter so this hotel offers a perfect location for us. La Ramblas can be quite noisy yet we heard absolutely no noise in our room whatsoever.I researched various other establishments and on previous occasions have stayed in the nearby Colon which has an unbeatable view of the gothic cathedral. However, the current scaffolding on the cathedral prompted us to look elsewhere for a place to stay. The LeMeridien now far surpasses that hotel in terms of appointments, etc., and the staff were absolutely helpful and responsive in every way.I find it interesting that MANY Barcelona hotels pointedly like to brag that they are near La Ramblas. Why stay near when you can stay right there? We will definitely return to this hotel in the future and already have a reservation for July 2005.

<Content>Beautiiful room, beautiful view My wife and I stayed here for four nights in February 2004. Our room was probably the most beautiful we have ever stayed in -- and included a small balcony overlooking Las Ramblas, which was a special treat. I am surprised that some reviews have complained about chipping paint, and a run-down appearance. Perhaps the hotel has been renovated since those reports were written. Our room was spotless and spanking new. The decorating was modern and new and clean. The bed was very comfy and the bath was spacious and modern. I believe we were given a more luxurious room than we paid for -- it was a treat. The staff were fine, but we didn't have many dealings with them. I recommend this hotel without hesitation if you want to be in the heart of Barcelona and stay in comfort. There are cheaper alternatives, but you get what you pay for. We wanted to treat ourselves and we did.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location, Great staff I just spend a long weekend in Barcelona. A fantastic hotel in the best location. How can you choose any other location in Barcelona?. Basicaly the top 10 attractions of the city are within a 5 minute walk!. And the shopping!. I handed over the shopping bags to the doorman every hour or so to not to have to carry so much. That is convenient shopping. Furthermore the staff is very helpful and friendly ( and for real! ). Everything in the hotel just works. You do not get any no. No hassles. We had a great room overlooking the always busy Ramblas, and not a noise to hear. I will go back for sure!

<Content>3 star for 5 star price Although we liked this hotel for the location it was in no way a 4 or 5 star hotel! We were highly disappointed when we checked in and attempted to cancel our reservation but they wouldn't allow it so we were stuck there. They gave us an upgrade to a slightly better room but the bathroom was still very old and seemed dirty even after cleaning, there was no clock in the room, the wake up call was 25 minutes late one morning and there is no concierge. The staff attempt to give restaraunt recommendations but they didn't match up with what we were looking for.

<Content>Great hotel Would echo previous comments - a very good hotel indeed. We stayed for 2 nights in an executive room (expensive at 300 Euros but there was nothing else available - we moved from other accommodation at the last minute) and it was immaculate and very big with a great view over the rooftops. There was a huge marble bathroom with underfloor heating and also a sizeable walk-in wardrobe.The bed was king-sized and nice and firm (but not too hard). We also had a large sofa and glass coffee table.The hotel's location cannot be faulted. Would heartily recommend, especially if you can get a better deal than we did by booking early.

<Content>Le Crap instead of Le Meridien Just came back from a 4 night stay. The rooms are from a Holiday Inn, and on top of that the A/C was not turn on on the hotel because it was still spring, that was what I was told by the Hotel manger. The sugested me to open the windows so i could air the room out, that brought the other problem, when you open the windows it is as if the rambla just got inside your room. You can hear every single sound from the street, including the construction going on across the street and inside the hotel. I spoke to managment several times and they said that there was nothing they could do. So i spent 4 nights sweeting and not sleeping very much. This is something not acceptable from a 5 star hotel, this hotel is realy a 3 star hotel. It is the last time i stay in this and any other Le Meridien Hotel.
