<Content>Good location. Tiny rooms We stayed here on a stopover to Oz and to be honest I wouldn't book this hotel again. The location was good, short walk to shops and the harbour but the rooms were tiny, we were prepared for small rooms in HK but ours really felt like a cell. Barley no daylight at all, hardly any space to walk around the bed. Lobby was nice and staff were adept at their job but no really friendly. I'm sure there are nicer places to stay in Hong Kong.

<Content>Good location After reading other reviews we were a bit concerned about where our travel agent had booked us. We didn't need to be. Yes the rooms are tiny (how much time do you spend in them anyway?!?!) But it was clean and the location was great. We didn't eat at the hotel as it was much cheaper at Charlie Browns round the corner so can't coment on the food. There are easy links to the underground and the ferry etc and while we avoided the touristy places for dinner where possible, there was a great local restaurant only a few doors down. Over all we have stayed in worse places for more money and worse locations.

<Content>Just Walk on By... My advice is to look at other properties in Kowloon-something newer and better value for money! Read on if you need more convincing...After having stayed in Mainland China (Shenzhen), and being spoiled at 3-star hotels for a fraction of the price, I was thoroughly disappointed with this over-priced dump! The bed was huge and uncomfortable with a 'gorge' between the two mattresses that are 'stuck' together to make the bed seem really big! The closet was tiny (no doubt an after thought), while the windows were single-glazed and allowed so much noise to enter the room, you might as well had the window open! The decor is from 1980-absolutely horrific, with gray bathroom fittings and a really moldy bath tub. It didn't feel clean... The corridor to the elevator is not even big enough to wheel your two regular sized suitcases.

<Content>Good location, compact room, helpful staff, wonderful freebies I stayed in Ramada Kowloon for 1 night during my transit back to the Middle East. The hotel's undoubtful advantage was its location. I took a bus (A21 or A22 I can't remember clearly) from the airport and 40 min later it stopped in front of the hotel! The bus stop back to airport is just on the opposite side of the road. So very handy for transit passengers like me.I got a room upgrade (standard - something better) when check-in. The room was small, layout was odd (my room was located in a corner of a V-shaped building) but clean. The bed was huge. Nevertheless, other furniture was still basic, so I wondered that if this room was the upgraded one, then standard rooms would be very ordinary.There were many restaurants near to the hotel so there's no difficulty looking for food. For shopping, I would prefer walking to Canton Road though. Choices of food in the hotel restaurant were very limited.Staff was friendly and helpful (esp w/ the upgrade). I asked for a late checkout (as I took an evening flight) and they could grand me one right away.

<Content>Good Location, Very Small Spent 6 nights at the Ramada  the experience was 50/50.First of all, the hotel is in a very good location, not far from the subway  the harbour. There is also a bus stop basically at the front of the hotel.The rooms are very small, tight  a bit run-down. The beds are rock hard  the TV channel selections aren't very good if your are not chinese or japanese.The service at the hotel is fine  so is the restuarant. Interent usage is pretty cheap but there are only 2 computers available in the lobby. Rooms have a decent view but the corridors  lifts are very compact.But after saying all of the above, you are in HK  the bulk of your time will not be spent in the hotel. HK is a great city with so much to see  do.

<Content>Handy to shops and transport We had a 3 day stopover at this hotel in Kowloon on our way to the UK. Never having been to Hong Kong before we were not sure what to expect. On arrival (quite late at night) we were greeted by the friendly night staff, booked in quickly, and taken to our room. We had a double room with ensuite, and whilst not as big as we are used to in Australia was adequate for the time we were there. The staff were very helpful with directions to various places, and the lady in the officed that booked tours went out of her way to help us. I have been reading some of the other reviews about this property, and have come to the conclusion that perhaps there are 2 Ramado hotels in Kowloon (tongue in cheek) as we did not experience any of the problems others seem to have had. In fact we are returning there in September.

<Content>G-R-O-S-S This is a very seedy hotel. I travel to HK frequently for business and I must say that this hotel gave me the creeps in a serious way. The blankets are disgusting -- pilly brown blankets that seem like a fire hazard. Also, no real lobby, dark entrance, dark hallways, teeny tiny bathrooms. I had a room w/ 2 twin beds (although I booked for a double sized bed) - the beds were 15 inches apart from each other. Yes, that's right, 15 inches. I will never stay here again.Now for the one (and only) good note - it is in a great location. Lots of shopping and about 2 blocks from Knutsford Terrace -- which is the TST East dining hot spot for dinner.

<Content>Good location We booked it when we arrived at HK airport through the HK Hotels Desk as it had the best last minutes rates' and we also needed 3 beds which can be hard to get in Hong Kong.The airport bus drops you off at the door though for the return it is across the road but there is a foot bridge.Rooms are small but standard for HK hotels. Location is good, off the main strip but only a short walk, plenty of food stores nearby and the museum across the road is very interesting and informative- easily spend half a day there.. Rooms were clean but in the bathroom some of the wall had fallen away, probably when some work had been done it was never repaired properly. Only one person at a time can fit into the bathroom.We basically wanted somewhere to sleep at night for 5 days and it meet that need. Don't know about other extras it may offer.Reception area is small and is crowded in the morning with people leaving or waiting for transport, standing room only.

<Content>Worst Hotel Ever Been Too!!! This has to be the worst hotel I have ever been too. The room was so small that the 2 of us couldn't fit our luggage in and had to remove the desk chair. I couldn't open my suitcase properly as there wasn't enough room!!!The bathroom was so small you could stand in the middle of the room and stretch your arms out and touch both walls!!!Had to ask for another room, which wasn't much bigger.Had to ask for tea/coffee as wasn't replaced each day!We were told our phone was to be cut off and mini bar taken out as our deposit had ran out, even though we told them we would settle our account the next day when we were departing!Breakfast room was tiny and often the tables were not cleared regularly. I have been to many hotels before and stayed in basic but this has to be by far the worst!!!!I recommend you stay away!!!!!!

<Content>Small but good value The hotel is conveniently located for Kowloon/TST, and a short walk or subway ride from the Star Ferry etc. Service was competent without being remarkable, and the room was small, as is usual for HK. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, and the aircon worked well. Breakfast was toelrable, without being especially good. However, given the price, it was a good choice, and we'd stay here again.

<Content>Choose somewhere else Having spent a few days in China with fantastic service and a smile from all the staff at the hotel we had stayed at, Century Pavilion, my wife and I were looking forward to a few days in HK. This hotel spoilt all that. The reception was dark, dingy and the staff were abrupt on the verge of rudeness. We were allocated a room on the 5th floor, no choice of smoking or non smoking, so as soon as we got out the lift it stank of smoke. The room was even darker than the reception area, smelt worse and was very small. Everything was crammed into the room, and the bathroom was tiny. Our room was opposite the lifts which pinged on everyfloor which was just a tad annoying. We tried to stick it out for 1 night but after a horribly uncomfortable night, the mattresses can hardly be called such, we gave up and moved elsewhere. Needless to say, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE,

<Content>Harassed by Security Personnel My family decided to take a long overdue vacation in Hong Kong. We decided to take the trip on the week inbetween Christmas and New Year of 2007 as it is the only days where we could share time together as a family. It was a 5 day trip where all accomodation and tours were booked ahead by our travel agent. On our second day, our first full day in Hong Kong, the itenerary was for a city tour. We were scheduled to be picked up by our guide at 8:30 in the morning. We we all excited and was at the Ramada waiting lounge around 7:30 AM, an hour earlier than the expected pick up time. While all 5 of us were there sitting and waiting, my son fell asleep. The security personnel gave us a not so friendly stare. That personnel paced around us several times with the same stare. After pacing around us for several times, he approached us and spoke in broken english, saying dont sleep. Sensing he could not speak fluent english, I let it go and said OK. A few more minutes passed and the stares were still there. Worst this time the stares were accompanied by head shaking. It is the type of a stare done by high school bullies. The constant stare were as if we had committed a serious crime that we had to be watched over very carefully. I complained to the manager about this harassment. I was told in no uncertain manner that it was their policy not to allow sleeping in the waiting lounge. That it was their board of directors who created the rule. I explained that we were waiting for our guide and falling asleep durig these times are normal. I also asked what was the rationale for this policy. Instead of explaining, the manager informed me that they could get fired if they wont wake people up. I then said that higher management should be advised that PAYING guests should be allowed to fall asleep without being disturb while waiting for their pick up. The manager responded that all hotels are like that. On the contrary, per our schedule, we transferred to Disney's Hollywood Hotel in Hong Kong for the Disneyland trip on our last day. In Hollywood Hotel I saw several people, in several occassions, dozing off while waiting for their bus rides or their guides. I made it a point to take note if any of the Hollywood staff would wake their guests up. The alleged claim by the Ramada manager that all hotels wont allow sleeping in waiting lounges NEVER happened in Hollywood. Harassment is not a great way to treat customers. I dont think there will be a next time for us in Ramada. I will also call my travel agent and inform them of this not so memorable experience.

<Content>Highly recommended I stayed 3 nights and found this hotel to be perfect for my needs.The location is convenient, just one block from the shuttle bus to the Airport Express. The room was clean and everything worked well. The front desk was friendly and efficient. When I checked in, they said the nonsmoking room would not be ready for 15 minutes, but just 5 minutes later it was available. While the lobby and elevators may be smallish, they served me well.Booking through Asia rooms, I had a very nice rate of $89 US per night-very acceptable for this part of Kowloon.Would gladly return to this hotel anytime.

<Content>Bad Attitude and worst Hotel in Hongkong I landed HK with my wife and 2 years then old son....we were carrying enough luggage as we came on work permit from MNC. The experience was horrible for me and my family and not matching with the cost they charge. Let's me share- My company had already did communicate to them about my arrival, but still when I landed I had to wait for my luggage to unload from taxi ...as they were checking with my company..and looking for the hotel person who booked the hotel, but did not get...as person was on leave..so they called and other headache went on for 30-45 mins...which was completely over stupidity.- Hotel staff was worst and have some attitude problem as well...and it varies from customre to customer seems...we were told that...after 9:00am...breakfast..would not be server....which wsa quite a stupid reason..as on weekends..everybody expect delayed breakfast.- Also, seems hotel staff had been told always 'NO' to everything.... :-( which was sometimes annoying.- Room was stinky and we need to call SD for room freshners at place before checkin in.- Finally, at mid of our stay..we decided to leave that...8th day instead of 14th day....and heavily relieved.Please think 1000th times before looking at booking this hotel. THIS IS EVER WORST HOTEL WE EXPERIENCED.

<Content>A REAL NIGHTMARE HOTEL !!!! Maybe OK for backpackers, but.... I am a frequent business traveller from Germany and I come to HKG once a month in average. This was the worst Hotel experience I ever made....My company booked the Ramada this time, because my usual used Hotel (Royal Pacific Hotal at Canton Road) was fully bookd due to Electronic Fair. The room rate I got (HKD 1860) was quite high so I expected some nice Hotel.... The lobby was very small, old, ugly and totally crowded. The lifts (2 pcs.) were so small and fitted just for 4 people (2 with luggage) that I needed to wait 15 minutes to get a space and to reach my room in the 9th floor.The room was also small, old, ugly, smelly and really bad...The bathroom was not better and in the morning it took 10 minutes until the water in the shower was getting warm.The breakfast room was a real nightmare. Very dirty and all free tables were polluted by used dishes from other guest. I had to ask the waiter to clean on table for me. The Buffet was a horror.No glases for the juice, no cups for tea, no spoons. I had to ask for everything. The Food was disgusting, so I decided to take a Yoghurt and a Tea. I was really afraid to eat the other things....IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS TRAVELLER OR AN AMBITIOUS TOURIST, TRY TO AVOID THIS HOTEL BY ALL MEANS. Maybe backpackers have no problem with it, all other should look for something else !!!!

<Content>Good hotel in an unbeatable location I stayed here for 10 days and I liked it. My room was overlooking the street with large glass windows (window cannot be opened). I enjoyed the view. The room was basic and small. But it was adequate. The bathroom was also basic. But it was very clean. The breakfast was OK, but got somewhat boring towards end of my stay as they repeat the same stuff. I had dinner once here, I did not like it. But there are plenty of food options as soon as you step out of the hotel. The location is unbeatable. It is in the heart of tourist district of TST in Kowloon. The bus-stop is right outside the hotel. The metro is within easy walking distance. There is also an airport shuttle that you can book from the hotel. The best part is that the staff was very friendly and helpful. There is a small business center where you can get print outs and access the Internet. There is also a travel desk who helped me with visas for mainland China. It is a budget sort of hotel. But I believe that I got more than my money worth.

<Content>Pay for what you get A real Hong Kong feel as soon as you step in you are squeezing for space. The rooms have all the basics and are presented ok. bathroom is small and has no real ventilation and the window looks onto a brick wall - so slighty costrophobic. So a good place to stay on a lower budget but not wanting a backpacer style.

<Content>Not bad for the price and location Booked this hotel on the web from the philippines since we were looking for a holiday on a budget. got exactly that. There were four of us, incl my wife and 2 boys, aged 11 and 8. Room had two beds but with 2 suitcases and a carryon, not much space to move. Bathroom was also tight and cleanliness so-so. But the location was great, walking distance to ocean terminal, and right at granville road for shopping and the science museum. 20 hkd by taxi from the star ferry only. Lots of nice local restaurants a street or 2 away. taxi to airport 300hkd. staff were ok.Good enough for a short stay if you arent too finicky and you just want to sleep and freshen up in your hotel. Didnt eat in the hotel though. paid 356USD for 4 nights which isn't bad. if you want something better, pay a few dollars more for another hotel.

<Content>Good find! We stayed at the ramada kowloon for 2 nights. We were very happy and satisfied with our experience. It's a good hotel, with great breakfast at a nicely positioned restaurant, and the best part about the hotel is it's location. It's withing walking distance to all major shopping streets and tsim sha tsui. The only drawback about the hotel is the small sized rooms, but then it's a fact that can be overlooked. The hotel lobby has a small tourist company which offers various services from sightseeing trips to visa services so it is quite convenient. You should stay here, it's priced well, though you might bargain a bit. Hong Kong hotels aren't exactly cheap!! Ramada's a good place though!

<Content>It's good enough for a 3 nighs stay My wife  my daughter stayed here last April for a vacation. At first we were given a double bed, but does'nt look like a double bed to us, just a little bigger than 1 single size bed. We requested for a transfer to another room, the front desk staff was very accommodating and gave us a twin bed which has enough space for the 3 of us plus our luggage. I understand that hotel rooms in Hongkong are really small due to space limitations. However,location is very good, right at the heart of the shopping area, restaurants, MRT. Buffet is okay but on the last day of our stay, it took them so long to refill the food, I have to call the attention of the hotel duty manager to speed up the service. Over all rating is Good.

<Content>Good Value for the Money I don't agree with some of the negative reviews here. This is a decent full service hotel in a fairly good location with very good customer service. PRICEI only stayed for one night and paid $100 total with Expedia. ROOMOur room with a comfortable queen sized bed was medium sized with enough space for us two. The bathroom worked well and was decently sized as well. Overall the room's decor was 1980's style and felt a bit tired, but it was clean. Our room had big windows that faced the busy street on the 14th floor but it was amazingly quiet.SERVICECheck in and check out was quick and easy, but the best was the concierge. He was extremely helpful with helping us with the sightseeing and got us a taxi to the airport that guaranteed a rate of 300 HK dollars or less.LOCATIONThe hotel is located on a busy street across from a park. It takes about 5 to 10 minutes walking to get to the subway station or to the harbor promenade.CONCLUSIONI would recommend this hotel to any tourist or business person on a budget.

<Content>OK Hotel My mother and I stayed at the Ramada for 4 nights in June 2006. Overall it was an OK experience. The room was roomy enough and clean. The toilet did not flush efficiently and we had to call someone to fix it. Also the powerpoint for the electric jug did not work so the maintenance fellow suggested we use the power point near the bed and just put the jug on the floor - which is what we did. The staff were friendly and helpful. The tour desk person - perhaps a little pushy - and we did a tour which we were very disappointed in - it was the one that takes in the Peak (we could not go up there), the fishing village - we paid extra to go on a 20 minute chug around the water with no commentary, we were then taken to a jade shop - take my advice and don't do this tour. The location of the hotel was fine and we were able to walk to where we wanted to go. The airport shuttle bus does a drop off and pick up just around the corner.

<Content>Worst hotel stay ever!!! My boyfriend and I checked in Ramada Kowloon late because we flew into HK in an evening flight. Asked for a non-smoking room, the answer was no, since you didn't request when you booked the hotel. but the room you got is newly renovated, it shouldn鈥檛 have a lot smoke smell鈥?When we walked into the room, found the one of the twin bed was not made. Called the front desk, a guy came up 5 minutes later. Saying the quilt should just cover the bed due to the summer time. But the bed looked like as if someone slept on it. So he agreed to change the quilt. I asked him to change the sheet as well. He changed the bed, and we thanked him. I used the bathroom for No1. And found out the toilet didn鈥檛 flush well. I had to flush 4 times, and each time I had to wait for the water to get full. My boyfriend said maybe because it鈥檚 too high (we were at 14th floor), there鈥檚 not enough pressure. Fine. After settling down, we decided to go out for a midnight snack. Took the room key out from the slot (for getting power to the room. Most Asian hotels use that to conserve energy) and left the room. I went back to the room for my purse, and tried to insert the key back to the slot, the room wasn鈥檛 lit. The switch in the slot stopped working. Called the front desk, waited for 15 minutes for a maintenance guy to come, and took that guy 30 min to fix the problem. Asked the front desk for another room. The answer was 鈥渨e will fix it really shortly鈥?Came back from the restaurant nearby, we decided to make a few phone calls, but found out we were not able to call out. Asked the front desk for instruction again (there鈥檚 an instruction printed on the phone), just to make sure we dialed the right numbers. Not successful. We weren鈥檛 even able to call 999 (emergency number in Hong Kong, equivalent to 911 in the States). Asked the front desk to call a local number for us, and transfer the call to our room. The answer 鈥渘o, we don鈥檛 do that鈥?And asked the front desk why the phone was not working, the answer 鈥渨e don鈥檛 know, if the phone line is having problem, then the phone company is having problem鈥︹€?We stopped to argue, because we were really tired. And decided to call from a pay phone the 2nd morning, and NEVER GO TO RAMADA KOWLOON EVER AGAIN.

<Content>Good Hotel, I would stay there again. We Stayed for 4 Nights. Paid USD67 per night (Total, incl taxes). We got exactly what we wanted. Clean, MiniBar (used for refrig only), 1 Hugh bed, TV, AC/heat, Good part of town, walk to the subway, good restaurants close, clean bathroom, hot water with good pressure, tub. The room was a good size, not hugh, but sufficient for 2 people. The staff was very helpful. They had a good bar upstairs. All in all it was a very good experience. I would highly recommend it. I am really not sure why others wrote such poor reviews, I had no problems at all. This place was fine. For the money, it was great. No internet, Local phone calls HKD5 per call.

<Content>Good value for Hong Kong I stayed at the Ramada for four nights in January and thought it was OK. It certainly is in need of redecoration, and my room was a little cramped. However, it was clean and decent; the staff were nice and friendly; and the location is excellent: a block or two to the TST MRT station; frequent buses to the Star Ferry and the airport going past the door; and the shops and restaurants of the Nathan Road area just around the corner. The buffet meals were not exciting but were quite adequate. I paid $HK550 a night (plus taxes), which is very good value for Hong Kong. This is a good place for the budget traveller who wants something better than a backpackers' guesthouse (and who can't get into the Y!).

<Content>A budget hotel We stayed at Ramada Kowloon Hotel for 5 days. It was an ok budget hotel, nothing fancy. The room was small (as in any other hotel rooms in Hong Kong) and we don't have a view (our room is on the 4th floor). We don't mind this because we spent our time outside. Despite these, the room  toilet were clean, no complaints there. I noticed that the room door  bathroom door need a little fixing, but they still work. Elevator is small as well as the lobby. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The location is a little far going to the harbour, but it was nice walking around TST. You also need to walk a little far to reach the MTR station. There are shops nearby that sells clothes, shoes, bags, food, etc. Nice! We didn't eat at the restaurant because there were fast food restaurants nearby. All in all, the hotel is ok for travellers who just need a nice, clean room to stay after going around Hong Kong.

<Content>absolutely awful We stayed here for two nights, we were booked for six. There was a connecting door between our room and the one next door and I could hear everything through the gap under the door. When you are tired after a long journey you do not want to hear the couple in the next room grunting and groaning in the middle of the night. The bathroom was dirty with duck tape stuck to the ceiling, I do not know why. The outside of the toilet was stained brown, I did not look too closely to see what was the cause and the painted was peeling from the floor tiles. If you've booked and you're not desperate try somewhere else. When we stayed we were charged 拢102 per night for a very, very basic accommodation. I think someone was having a joke at our expense.

<Content>Dont go there I stayed at the Ramada Kowloon, Hong Kong, and my advice to others is dont go there. You cant drink the water that you boiled from water taken from the bathroom tap. The water smells of overnight cooking oil from your deep fryer. so it was off to the nearest 7-Eleven for bottled water. Then there were not even a complimentary tea bags or a newspapers, or maybe they thought a Chinese lady from Malaysia dont know English. Then I was billed HK$30/- each for 3 unsuccessful tolled free phone calls back to Malaysia, total HK$90/-, ,and HK$5/- for each call to places in Kowloon. I only paid HK$1/- for a phone call from the airport. Then on the 2nd nite, there were no bathroom light, and it took them quite a while to get it fix.

<Content>Better Price and Good Service I liked my two nights here. It seemed a good deal less expensive than the Golden Mile Holiday Inn or others. The location on Chatham Road by a Park and by the nice old section was nice. There were less of the Tailor vendors as on Nathan Road. Also, I had less Massage offers in the evening in this area. It was a little farther walk to the great Ferry over to the Central District. The InterContinental HongKong had a great view in the lounge and dining area and all...great Security forces there, too. I was never in any danger in Hong Kong or Philippines. The Bus service from this Hotel to the Airport was super. I used Expedia to get this Hotel reserved. I received no frequent flyer miles from United Airlines on this. But, I might be prone to use this Hotel again if I were using Hong Kong Airport again to go to Philippines, etc. The Hong Kong Airport is very very nice.

<Content>Nightmares in Kowloon I am being nice by describing this hotel as 'terrible. I booked for 4 days, but checked out after one night. I was forced to stay the one night because of a deposit and a very late check in. The restaurant must be the worst I have ever seen, bordering on disgusting. My advice, pay a little more someplace else and be comfortable.
