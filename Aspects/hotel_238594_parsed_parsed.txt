<Content>Great location and service! This hotel is just great.... It's right on La Rambla so extremely easy to go anywhere. The service is amazing - every staff is super nice and truly helpful. My husband and I stayed there for 4 nights during X'mas with lots of requests/questions and never felt that we're not getting great service for once! I stayed in many 5-star hotels for business before, but the service level at Montecarlo still impressed me a lot. Special thanks to Sergio!

<Content>This Really Is The Best Hotel in Barcelona The Hotel Montecarlo does not disappoint and lives up to the reputation of being #1 on the Trip Advisor website. The rooms are spacious and well decorated.... and those beds!!! Just fantastic. It is centrally located and the friendly staff will help you with any of your needs. I would be a fool to stay anywhere else!

<Content>Just loved it !!! My husband and I booked the Montecarlo on the basis of its ranking on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. The hotel turned out to be far more attractive then it appeared on the photos and it was bliss right from the moment that the doorman/security guy nods his discreet welcome. We were given a room overlooking the Ramblas with our own private balcony. It turned out to be incredibly quiet because of the thoughtfully installed double doors. The bathroom was luxury itself, with an enormous jacuzzi (read small swimming pool), bathrobes, slippers and all the modcons you could wish for. The beds were great for resting after a long day because they could be raised to a seating position or to drain your legs. The staff were incredibly polite and friendly. Quique in particular gave us excellent restaurant recommendations and was very welcoming with a wicked sense of humour. The hotel is perfectly located on the Ramblas (we could people watch from our balcony), close to the Plaza de Catalunya and great for nightlife in the Barri Gotic. Barcelona is culture, culture, culture bursting with museums and incredible gothic, modernista and contemporary architecture. Don't miss the MNAC (museum of Catalunyian art) and its wonderful restaurant with a view called Oleum. The hop-on buses are an excellent way to get to all the top cultural sites. It is worth booking a ticket for two days rather than one. Thank you to all the past reviewers of this hotel for pointing us in the direction of the best hotel possible! It really made our holiday!!

<Content>really nice but caution for wheelchair users or toddlers We stayed here with our 1 year old son for the 3 kings parade and christmas markets. Flying from Bournemouth to Girona airport is very simple and the airport bus waits for the flight. A return to the bus station is 24 euros each and is extremely punctual and efficient (on the return as well). It takes 1hr 10 mins into the station. We then picked up a taxi from upstairs which cost 8 euros and took about 10 minutes.We were put in the new wing which is minimally and tastefully decorated. Good points are wheel chair access into the building but the lifts are very small, some of the spaces in the room again are very narrow so difficulties manoevering a wheel chair but the beds are adjustable and there was a closimat toilet if you could get into the bathroom. The breakfast which is 11 euros per person is up some stairs and there is no other access. Great coffee and very freshly squeezed orange juice and a good range of pastries and cold cuts.Why caution for toddlers - huge staircases leading off open corridors - its a long way down! You pay for a cot 10 euros a night but they do have a high chair. No evening meal service or room service or even tea and coffee making facilities and the restaurants on Las Rambas are limited for small kids unless you want fast food. The staff as previously said are all charming and the majority speak very good English. A nice place

<Content>Loved the Monte Carlo We stayed at the Monte Carlo for 3 nights prior to boarding a cruise ship on November 16.We found the service to be excellent- front desk staff very helpful in pointing out the best way to tour Barcelona. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. We had a sitting room as well as a balcony overlooking Las Rambla. Because of the double doors on the balcony, the room was quiet.The buffet breakfast contained a lot of food but not all to our tastes. It was convenient, as we found no other full breakfast restaurants in the area.The free use of the computer in the hotel lobby was a nice surprise.We would definitely book at this hotel again!

<Content>haven of peace Having spent 4 nights here, we can only agree with other reviewers on tripadvisor. We asked for a quiet room and were given a room at the back from which nothing else could be heard. The standards of accommodation and service were high and the location perfect. Thanks to the reviewer who pointed us to Moka (2 doors down) for breakfast. It served a croissant and the best coffee in Barcelona for just over 鈧?. We would also recommend the restaurant Santa Anna, just round the corner, for excellent meals and tapas which were very reasonably priced.We would go back to Barcelona and would return to Hotel Montecarlo without hesitation

<Content>A delightful hotel This hotel is really central. It is a short walk from all shops, buses to airport, there is 3 metro stations on the street also. The staff especially Queque and Sara were very helpful with directions, recommendations for restaurant, they could not be more helpful. We spent three nights here and didnt see any other guests but the hotel was 80% full. Our room was very quiet and as there was an electric shutter on window it blocked all daylight so when we got in late we slept on as the room was so dark. I would recommend this hotel to anyone because of its location and the staff.

<Content>Great hotel in a superb location The Montecarlo is in a fantastic location. Its right on the Ramblas, at the top end, so is convenient for pretty well everything that you could want. If you are getting the bus in from the airport (and thats the best way) then its only a couple of minutes walk from the Plaza Catalunya terminus.We would only add to the recommendations of the hotel, so we wont bother. Its great, and so is the breakfast!.Let me suggest a couple of things to do. Firstly, DO VISIT THE MARKET !. Its only 5 minutes down the Ramblas (towards the harbour, on the right). I have never seen such a fantastic market anywhere. Fruit, fish, veg are all set out in spectacular displays. The prices are lower when you get away from the main way in - but just go to see all the fantastic displays.Also, we really enjoyed a day trip out to Montserrat. Its an easy train trip from Barcelona ( even if there are a lot of stops). The monastery was interesting ( try to get there for the singing at 1pm) but best of all was taking the St Joan funicular up to the top of the mountain, and then walking back (get a leaflet from the information centre). We did route 5 - a bit rough, so wear strong shoes, and it takes a couple of hours ... but stupendous scenery.All in all, the Montecarlo is a really recommended base for a break in Barcelona.

<Content>Montecarlo Hotel in Barcelona: The place to stay We spent 4 glorious days in Barcelona staying at the well situated Montecarlo Hotel on La Rambla. We loved being able to walk to all major historic and cultural sites. The concierge service provided by the friendly front desk staff is the best we've seen in Europe. Our spacious room overlooked a quiet courtyard. Tapas bars and quality restaurants are close-by and of course there is the famous pedestrian boulevard La Rambla. Within 2 blocks there is the large and wondrous La Bouqueria marketplace for all sorts of well displayed and reasonably priced fresh produce. Visit Gaudi's work in progress the Familia Sagrada;it's a must. Enjoy Montecarlo Hotel and Barcelona.

<Content>Didn't break the bank! As ever chose off Tripadvisor and was not disappointed. the location is ace - right on the Ramblas - letting you walk to nearly everything.We had a 'junior suite' at the back on the first floor - great size with a lobby leading to the bathroom and bedroom and then a lounge off the bedroom. Decor was good - beautiful teak floors and furniture and an electrically adjustable bed !The 'toys' in the room are good as well - we had a jacuzzi bath and a separate steam bath cabinet - flat screen TVs in both bedroom and lounge - and probably best of all free and efficient wireless internet. Didn't ever make it to breakfast in the hotel - millions of coffee shops around for that - have never stayed in a hotel so well located for access to bars and restaurants - dozens within a few hundred feet.Staff were efficient and friendly.It was pretty chilly when we were in Barcelona - so we didn't make any use of the rooms private terrace - my one criticism would be that it would be pretty dark and not much fun to sit on in the summer with absolutely no view that I could see.

<Content>La Rambla 124, Barcelona :) Ideally located hotel in city centre, possible to walk to most places and the staff couldn't be nicer. The building, an old nineteenth century palace is gorgeous. The reception area is very bare and there didn't seem to be any other guests around.I stayed here with my mum, but if you're going with a group of friends it might be a bit quiet - suppose it depends on what you are looking for. Overall its good value, great location and nice and comfortable rooms.

<Content>Excellence, but at a price We found this hotel excellent in almost every respect. Location could not be bettered, front desk service was good and our superior room was lovely with a Ramblas view. We did though find the hotel a bit soulless as we rarely saw another guest (as we didn't bother with breakfast) and the bar/lounge was deserted throughout our stay. We paid over 鈧?00 for our superior room and breakfast would have been 鈧?1 each extra had we taken it. For a low season weekend we felt this expensive for UK visitors given recent currency movements although cost and value will always be subjective. Perhaps another time we would stick with a standard room and forgo the view and the sitting area of the superior rooms. Nevertheless highly recommended if price is not an issue.

<Content>The best hotel in Barcelona! My husband and I came to Barcelona for the tail end of our Spain honeymoon and the Hotel Montecarlo did not disappoint! The deluxe room was SUPER SPACIOUS with adjustable beds!! Hardwood floors throughout, HUGE bathroom with marble floors and a sitting room with a mini bar and flat screen TV. The service is EXCELLENT. The front desk staff helped us out so much and gave us so much information about Barcelona including researching Spas, etc. We didn't get to try out the buffett breakfast since we would wake up really late...but it was only 11 euros. We should have tried it at least.The location couldn't be any better. Right on La Rambla...our balcony overlooked La Rambla. Which was a good and a bad thing. At night, it was pretty loud, but what do you expect if you choose a hotel in the middle of everything.The only bad thing about this hotel is that the walls are pretty thin. I could hear the people next door to us coughing as we were lying in bed (better to hear coughing than other things!). Regardless....it was worth every penny. When we come to Barcelona again in the Spring, we're staying at the Hotel Montecarlo!

<Content>fantastic Once again stayed in a hotel based on tripadvisor, and yet again have not been let down.This hotel is in a great location for all the tourist sites in Barcelona, the staff are very helpful from when you first enter the hotel, to when you leave.We had a standard room for four nights, and it was just what we needed, I understand that there are better rooms, but this was above what you normally get in this price range. There was plenty of space, the bathroom was large and the beds large and comfy, Ok you dont get a view of the ramblas, but when its cold and wet, we wouldnt have used a balcony anyway.All in all a great hotel, and will be stopping again in the future.

<Content>A sensational hotel in the middle of everywhere The Montecarlo is a great hotel. Located right on the Rambla and in the middle of everything.A very quiet room, but perfectly equipped (even an automatic bed that adjusts to your reading comfort if you are into that type of thing).Staff very professional, very courteous and very helpful.We didn't pre-book breakfast as we did intend to discover other venues for breakfast but after using the hotel for our first breakfast we just didn't look elsewhere - it was so good - and again the staff so very helpful. (Freshly squeesed orange juice was a very pleasant surprise)For any friends that visit Barcelona we will certainly be highly the Montecarlo as the ONLY place to stay.

<Content>Very Good I liked this property very much. We stayed in September 2008. Many of the rooms have just been refurbished. Our room had a little terrace facing Las Ramblas and a jacuzzi. It's nice to have a modern, sleek room in a classic building. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I thought the price of about $210 was fair considering the location and time.

<Content>Fantastic stay at the Montecarlo.. My boyfriend and i stayed at the montercarlo for 5 nights and had a fantastic holiday.The hotel is beautiful, rooms large, beds comfy and electronic!! but the bathroom was the highlight for me....a huge shower and jacuzzi....perfect for soaking in after a long days sightseeing.Staff are very friendly and always willing to help.We didnt have breakfast so i cant comment on it but there are plenty of cafes nearby.A wonderful city to visit and with the hotel right on la rambla you have easy access to everything.We will be staying in this hotel on our next visit to barcelona for sure

<Content>Absoultely Fantastic!! Great location, on the ramblas, absolutely in the middle of everything. Not the kind of place if you like peace and quiet, but we loved it. It was our first trip to Barcelona and what a fantastic introduction to it. The best thing is you walk out of the hotel on to the ramblas and can spend the evening on the ramblas if you are not up to exploring the night life in the rest of the city. We spend most of our evenings here and were never bored. About 30 mins walk to the beach or you can take the metro, which we did, but still had to walk about 20 mins. So on our way back we walked, which was quicker and very pleasant. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The breakfast @ 11Euros is well worth it. Overall a very pleasant stay.

<Content>Great Location and Terrific Service We booked the Montecarlo after reading all the fabulous reviews on tripadvisor and stayed for 3 nights in Aug. Given all we had read, it is fair to say we had pretty high expectations (and we paid 207 euros a night). Overall I would say it lived up to most of these, but having spent 3 weeks travelling around Spain (and staying in many hotels) I'm not sure it deserves the incredibly high praise it seems to get from most (given it is not cheap).There is no doubt, the location is very handy, although we found La Rambla to be very touristy (and a bit tacky). You can walk to many sights and the metro and bus stops are closeby. The hotel staff were excellent. They were all very friendly and incredibly helpful. We got some recommendations from the hotel manager on the day we left (as we were driving north into the Pyrenees) that was fabulous. He went out of his way to assist and even called a hotel and did some searching on the internet for us. The room was very comfortable and quiet. A minor point, our high tech beds squeaked a bit when we rolled over. The internet access in the room was a little expensive but there is a free computer in the lobby.Breakfast was reasonably priced and tasty. Overall, this is still a good choice, but I'm not entirely sure you get what you pay for.

<Content>Best choice in Barcelona This has to be one of the most fabulous hotels in Europe in its price level. We had a GREAT experience there during our 6-day stay. The room was quiet and comfortable, but the best part of the experience was the hotel staff and Carlos, the manager. They went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. Carlos even saw it was my birthday during our visit and comped us to a bottle of Cava at the hotel bar. Just one example out of many of how great this staff was to us. And the location: best in Barcelona, right on Las Ramblas. Don't worry about light or street noises...blackout shutters come down at the push of a button. the staff restaurant suggestions, especially those from Carlos, were wonderful. Only one bad food experience: avoid La Gavina on the waterfront. It's a total ripoff with bad food and fish that isn't fresh. I wish every hotel was like this one!

<Content>Great Hotel Loved, loved, loved this hotel. The location is fabulous as it is located right on Las Ramblas. You can walk to most sights. I had a standard room and it was quite large as was the bathroom. My cousin had a junior suite that was gorgeous. (The pictures on their web site does not do it justice.) Also, the adjustable beds were a nice touch as were the toiletries in the bathroom. The staff was quite friendly and gave great recommendations for restaurants and travelling to various sights.  I would defintely stay here again. Can't imagine there's a nicer place to stay in Barcelona.

<Content>Our experience with managment left a bad taste We stayed for 2 nights prior to a Mediterranean Cruise. I would have given this an Excellent rating except for management. I'll start with our overall experience. The room was very clean overlooking the interior of the building. It was quite lovely. We did upgrade to a superior room which offered a small area with a king size adjustable bed and a small area with a sofa, chair and television. There were only a couple chanels available in English but little time was utilized watching television. The bathroom was large with a tub and separate shower area. Breakfast for 11 euro offered an ample supply of food and feel it was well worth the money.There was internet service in the lobby which I utilized often to keep in touch with home.The hotel was located on La Rambla within easy access to everything. Now for the negative....We had an overnight flight the states. We had been in contact with the hotel prior to our arrival and asked for early check in. We were told that they could not promise but would try to accommodate us. We arrived around 1:30 and requested to check in as soon as possible. The gentlemen at the desk seemed willing to make this accomodation however when they went to management to inquire we were told no...check in was not till 3pm. Not a big deal as we ended up getting something to eat. By the time we were back at 3pm...we had our room and our luggage had already been delivered. The day of our depature we had checked the television to see if our bill was on what we thought was customer services. To our surprise we were told we had accessed the internet for a 30 euro charge for the day of departure. Where this might have been our error we did not utiilize the service. (I'm not totally convinced that this was indeed an error we made) When I started to speak up and argue the point my husband was quickly told that this was not America and he should keep his wife in line. They would not reimbuse us for the 30 euro charge. I believe this was just poor customer service.Unfortunately given this experience I would not stay here again or recommend it to others.

<Content>the place to stay my wife and i booked three nights at this classy hotel with all mod-cons.I can see why it is no.1 with Trip Adviser.It is not cheap but you certainly get what you pay for.Staff are very friendly and will go the extra mile on service.We had a Superier room and it was worth it for the bathroom alone.I would not stay anywhere else in Barcelona.

<Content>Fantastic location, but expensive... We recently stayed for 3 nights at the Montecarlo. I chose this hotel because of all the rave reviews on Tripadvisor. It is indeed the perfect location; right on the Ramblas and only 5 minutes walk from the airport bus (4 euros) at Placa Catalu帽a. The recently modernised room had a flat screen TV and internet access, perfect for the business traveller. I thought the room was ok apart from some small inconveniences (the safe was not working, there was no bottle opener, the sink became blocked). However, my wife absolutely hated it. We arrived in the dark, so it was not a nice surprise to find in the morning that the view from the window was the wall of an adjoining property. This meant there was little natural light in the room. This compounded the problem that there was no dressing table / chair / mirror facility for doing makeup etc.. The staff were very helpful and overall the hotel is great, but it is very expensive, not good value certainly for the room we had.I would recommend it, but make sure you check out the view  facilities in the room you are going to have before confirming.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Stayed there Sept 1 to 4, 2008. Really nice and large room. I requested a quiet room and was given a room which faced the court yard which was very lovely on the third floor. Absolutely no problems with noise. Can't beat the location. Would skip the breakfast at the hotel. Just step out to your right to MOKA and have a great and cheap breakfast. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. I can't say enough how nice they all were. I would definitely stay there again when I go back to Barcelona.

<Content>MonteCarlo or Bust!! I have just returned from this superb hotel after a 3 day break in Barcelona. I stayed here on the back of reading the reviews and was blown away.Like a previous reviewer, we had the priviledge of staying in 402 with it's electrically controlled beds, useful lounge area, a bathroom larger than some rooms I have stayed in and it's birds-eye view of La Ramblas. On closing the balcony doors, the only noise we heard from the streets below was from a police car driving up the road in the late evening. Even the aircon was quiet (something I rarely find in a hotel room).The staff could not have been more helpful. There was someone waiting at the door to take our luggage, the receptionist gave us a pile of tourist literature to browse through when we checked in and on our last day our luggage was securely looked after following our noon checkout.I will be staying here again on my next trip to Barcelona and have already recommended it to loads of people.TIP: if arriving at Barcelona airport, catch the A1 bus just outside terminal B - cost 4 euro per person instaed of the 40 euro for a taxi.

<Content>Wonderful hotel We booked this hotel based on the excellent reviews already on this site. We were not disappointed at all. In fact our expectations were exceeded.It was our honeymoon, so we booked a deluxe room (402) which had its own small balcony and overlooked La Rambla - so right in the middle of all the action. However, two sets of double glazing meant that we didn't hear a peep from all the noise and bustle. The beds were independent adjustable singles which are pushed together (this is the same in all the rooms) and were incredibly comfortable.We can't praise the staff highly enough. They were so courteous and helpful, with restaurant recommendations and when they found out it was our honeymoon a bottle of cava, a red rose and some chocolates were placed in our room for us when we came back in after a hard day being tourists. The buffet breakfast was also very good with a varied selection and serving up til a civilised 11am!We wouldn't hesitate to go back.

<Content>Full Monte! Stayed at the Montecarlo for 1 night in August 2008 and had a fantastic experience. The hotel is located right on La Rambla with countless restaurants, bars and take-aways nearby. Catalunya Place and the fantastic harbour area are also just 5mins walk away and if your feeling a little more adventurous there is an underground stop a stones throw away from the hotel doors with links all over the city.Room and hotel facilites and fantastic, especially the spa bath moveble beds! Hotel staff are helpful and friendly.I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to those looking for a special experience while visiting the city or a fantasic central location.

<Content>practically superb excellent hotel right in the heart of everything you want, stayed there 2 nights in August, good access to restaurants, take aways and plenty of shops and stalls .supermarket is at stone throw away.would stay here again if i came to barcelona, highly recommended very clean and tidy staff very helpful and are able to speak good enough english. just a word of warning though bacelona espceally the La Rambla area is very very expensive so be prepared to dash out your hard earned cash if you want to enjoy eg 2 baguettes and 2 soft drinks will cost in the region of 16 euros!! have fun and enjoy this excellent hotel and beautiful weather.

<Content>Excellent Montecarlo Stayed for 3 nights end of July. Very friendly and helpful staff, very good English spoken.We had a room with balcony overlooking the Rambllas which was well soundproofed. Adjustable beds, jacuzzi bath, very clean.A nice touch was a chocolate sample in the room every night. The buffet breakfast was very good (11 euros) especially the freshly squeezed orange juice, with a good choice of bacon, eggs, pastries, cereal, cheese etc. We have also stayed in Hotel 1898 opposite, also very good but would choose the Montecarlo always because of its friendliness. The Attic restaurant close by recommended by the hotel was very good. Love Barcelona, lots to see and do, magnificent Gaudi architecture but also football, sand and sea. The street artists are fascinating, and the trees and sounds of the Rambllas.

<Content>Excellent all round This is an excellent hotel in an amazing location, right on La Rambla. My initial concern was regarding noise levels from the street below (as some people in Barcelona never seem to go to sleep) but there were two double-glazed sliding doors onto the balcony which completely eliminated all noise (Room 301 - classed as a Standard Room ). The air con was perfect for a mid-afternoon snooze when the temperature outside was near 35 degrees C, and the balcony was a nice spot when relaxing in the evening or at night.The staff were completely professional and helpful at all times. The room and the hotel in general was spotless, with the room sometimes cleaned twice a day. The jacuzzi bath also provided a great way of easing the tired leg muscles after a days hard walking.I would recommend this hotel without hesitation. It will be top of my list if (and hopefully when) we return to Barcelona.

<Content>Second time at this hotel and didnt disapoint After staying in this hotel in 2007 we revisited it again in 2008 and it did not disappoint. Centrally located on La Ramblas and it was great to see on the front desk Kiki who looked after us in 2007. Whilst this time we were not upgraded we had a lovely room overlooking La Rambla, one of the highlights when we were there was when Spain won the World Cup and it was great to open the balcony and go outside and look down at the celebrations in the street, slightly noisy but it was a very special night. Again the freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast was as remembered, still free internet and a lovely reasonably priced breakfast. Would stay here again. If you are seeking a nice restaurant for dinner can highly recommned The Attic a couple of doors down from the hotel, very very good food and great service, try and get a window table that overlooks La Rambla or sit up on the terrace.

<Content>As good as the reviews say Hotel is as good as people say. Recently stayed there for 12 nights and the room was much better than other hotels I have stayed at in Barcelona but which cost more. Room had large bathroom, was quiet from external noise, comfortable bed, decent TV and music system plus the staff were excellent. Location is also excellent.Minor quibble is that I was asked to pay for the first week on arrival at the hotel before even seeing the room. Maybe if people are staying for a long period of time and a part payment is required then they should be allowed a day or two before making this payment.

<Content>Amazing Hotel on Las Ramblas We stayed in Spain for 3 nights at this modern 5 star hotel. It is in the center of all of the activity and restaurants. Our room was modern and clean. One of our elderly companions left his passport in the last city we stayed in and the hotel helped us have it courriered to them, re-arranged flights and reassured us that they would help him get to the airport safely since we had to leave. The staff was very courteous and helpful.

<Content>Cant beat the location Unfortunatly we only had one night there but really enjoyed our stay. The location is great, right on La Rambla so lots to do and see right around the hotel. The room was very nice with adjustable beds, a seperate sitting area with a TV as well and it was great to open the doors to the window and look down on the bustling life. There were a few little things that went wrong in the room, the mini bar does not keep anything cold, our pay TV did not work and the taps in the huge wonderful tub were very hard to work since they were to far away, nearly killed myself trying to turn them on but hey, no real complaints at all for us. The staff was very nice as well, better then I am used to in Spain. I will definatly stay there every time I am in Barcelona and since I love the city, that will be many times in the future.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel What a wonderful hotel Montecarlo is. It has tons of old world charm, but is also very chic with all the modern amenities. Absolutely perfect location, right on La Rambla and two blocks from Catalyuna Square. Staff and service were excellent. Our room (deluxe double) was delightful, quiet, extremely large with all mod cons. We would not dream of staying at any other hotel when re-visiting Barcelona.

<Content>Brilliant hotel We stayed at this hotel based on the TripAdvisor reviews and certainly weren't disappointed. It is in a fab location, halfway down La Ramblas but is a calm oasis of marble in the middle of the bustle of LR and close to the Gothis Quarter. Lovely, minimalist rooms - and the beds are SO comfortable with very good quality linens and comfy matresses. Our room - 404, had beds which elevated the top and bottom of the beds as required, perfect for my aching feet after a day's walking. Barcelona is a gem of a place to visit - the Sagrada Familia and Park Guell are just stunning.Restaurant suggestion - Alter Ego, just around the corner in Carrer Comtal, gorgeous food/reasonable prices and a lovely atmosphere. Don't be put off by the workings on the building next door.

<Content>Loved the Montecarlo! We read the reviews on Hotel Montecarlo on Trip Advisor and decided that it looked good. Well, we were not disappointed. This was truly a 5 star hotel experience. The staff were attentive, friendly, kind, and went out of their way to accomodate us. I had been bicycling in Girona, Spain before arriving in Barcelona. Before arriving I emailed the hotel and asked if I could store my bike there while my wife and I traveled throughout Spain. They promply said yes. Upon arriving in the taxi I was met by one of the hotel staff who carried my bike inside ,indicating that he knew I was coming and that I had a bike with me. He reassured me the bike would be stored safely and securely. I was stunned that they remembered and how efficiently they handled the bike and storage.This was how our stay was here the entire time. We stayed a total of 5 days. Our room was quiet, clean, and beautiful. We asked the staff for several restaurant recommendations and they supplied us with delicious choices. No tourist traps. Each time we departed and arrived we were greeted warmly.The hotel is in a fantastic location. We walked everywhere we needed to go. Even though it is on the Ramblas I did not hear any noise from the street.The brunch in the a.m. was a real deal. Food and ambience is great and a very good value.My only criticism of the hotel is the lack of non smoking rooms. I am super sensitive to smoke and even though the rooms were smoking I could not detect any smoke anywhere. I was nervous about this at first but as soon as I was in the room I smelled nothing.What a huge difference it makes when you travel and you stay at a hotel that is as welcoming, friendly, and professional at the Montecarlo. The staff deserve high marks. This number one rated trip advisor hotel lived up to its ranking. I highly recommend this hotel for your Barcelona stay. They are number one.

<Content>Trust the Reviews for this hotel! My wife  I stayed at the Hotel Montecarlo for two nights at the end of June. It is as good as other reviewers have stated (thank you). We were coming off a cruise so we would arrive at the hotel early in the day so I had emailed the hotel ahead of time to confirm they would have a luggage lock-up we could use (they had replied that they did). However, upon our arrival at about 10:00 am, presumably knowing we were arriving early, they informed us that they had our room ready. Impressive service! We got an updated room which was a little plain (art-deco-ish style) compared with many hotels we've stayed at, but very tastefully done. The bathroom was excellent, which is something that you don't always see in Europe. We had no problem with the dual beds making up the king-size bed that other reviewers have mentioned. The staff were great, explaining the various features of the room like the electric blinds, air conditioning and beds and they handed us some useful tourist books without our even asking. The room was clean, quiet and well maintained. What more could you ask for? We had the 11 Euro breakfast one morning, which was ok but about the only thing I would not rate as exceptional.This was our first visit to Barcelona and I was amazed at how good a location this hotel has. Besides being on La Ramblas, it is also near Placa Catalunya which is a transportation hub, if not the hub of the city. The Metro, buses, airport bus and city tour buses are just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. When we sadly left, we took the airport bus from there which only costs 4 Euros and 5 cents each. Overall, this hotel deserves its high rating.

<Content>Nothing much to say I booked this hotel for the honeymoon after reading all the reviews one by one and I would like to thank all the reviewers as they are right on every detail. It is at a perfect location. Our room was facing to La Rambla and there was no noise at all. The only bad thing I can say is the room that we stayed (room number 413) was not a refurbished one so the carpet on the floor was quite old and worned off. Besides that everything was great. The staff was great. Everytime they saw going back to room or going out they were asking if we need anything or things like that. So I give a 10 to the hotel and staff.

<Content>Fiesta on la Rambla We stayed 3 nights at the Montecarlo from June 27-30 and were able to positively verify what has been written about this beautiful hotel. Our room was a superior one (room 101, not overlooking la Rambla but an inner courtyard) and exceeded our expectations in every way (bathroom, space, comfort and softness of the bed,...). As for the quietness: our last night at the hotel coincided with Spain's vicory in EURO 2008 and altough la Rambla was soon filled with cheering and celebrating supporters, we heard absolutely no noise whatsoever inside our room. Furthermore, the location of the hotel is hardly to be bettered and the friendly staff will take every possible step to help you out: we were looking for a nice restaurant in the Eixample which would be open on a Sunday (not many are) and the reception staff not only recommended a few but checked the websites in order to make positively sure. We will most definitely stay here again.

<Content>I will go back to this hotel for all future Barcelona trips I agree to all other good reviews on this hotel. It is excellent.I normally avoid going back to the same hotel so I could try new places, however, this is one of a few places I would actually go back as my regular hotel in this city.The rooms are stylished decorated, yet very functional.Housekeeping standard is very high.The location is simply fantastically convenient to go anywhere. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly.Only two negatives, if I am to raise:1. As one of of the previous reviewers commented, King sized bed is actually made of two single beds, which obviously is not ideal.2. This is probabaly only summer time but just in case some travellers may not like it - The hotel shares its courtyard area with the next door hotel which has a open air restaurant/cafe there. From about 21:00, they have open air cinema, which is quite loud and if your room faces this side (which itself is a good thing as it is quieter than facing La Rambla) you will hear it even with your window closed. It finishes around 23:00 so, if you are out for dinner for these hours, it should not cause you a headache. Also, if you leave your window open overnight, you will be woken up by the strong smell of breakfast preparation from this restaurant in the morning. You may wish to shut the window and leave AC on if you would rather avoid this.

<Content>Staying in Barcelona? - Hotel Montecarlo every time !! My grateful thanks to all of the Trip Advisor reviewers for recommending this wonderful, luxurious haven in the heart of Barcelona. I would not have stayed here without you.Just about everything that can be said about this small hotel with every attention to detail and superb staff has been said and I will certainly return. I will just add that I would recommend using the bus from the airport to Placa de Catalunya. They run about every 10 minutes and its just a five minute walk to the hotel from Placa de Catalunya. Just make sure that you leave plenty of time to get back to the airport as, even though the bus may appear to be full, they still pick up at various points and the listed 35 minute journey ends up closer to an hour. But, as the fare is just 4 euros 5 cents there is little to complain about.Go to hotel Montecarlo and have a wonderful stay!!

<Content>Shhh! Keep this quiet! This hotel is a gem! Gorgeous, ultra clean--trendy without being stiff, and the management is fantastic. We have stayed in 5 star places that do not match the standards of this hotel. Only problem is when the cruise ship people enter the building and use their outside voices--but this, of course, can't be avoided.Fantastic place.

<Content>Exceptional in Barcelona (or anywhere!) We stayed at the Hotel Montecarlo for one night following our Mediterranean cruise. Chose this property based on the reviews on this site, backed up by other good recommendations in Frommers and Fodors. We were not disappointed. The room itself was very high end, in line with any top boutique hotel in the United States. The staff was exceptionally willing to help with maps, restaurant recommendations and transportation. They all speak English to some extent, and if the particular individual didn't, there was always someone there they could ask.Wireless Internet was free, and there is also Internet via television available in the room. Two HD televisions with various channels available, very upscale bathroom with whirlpool tub and multi-head shower, full-size hair dryer and toiletries, also a mini refrigerator. Our superior double had a view of the peaceful inner courtyard. There was no noise from the street.The location can't be beat in the center of the La Rambla district, near the Boqueria market and adjoining the Barri Gotic (easy walk behind the property). Two blocks from Plaza Catalunya, where our bus dropped us off after the cruise, so we did need to drag our luggage that distance to the hotel (buses can't drive up La Rambla). This was not a problem, it seems to be the accepted way to do it there. We had been told that no cars could drive up to the hotel, but there is a street out front and taxis can pull up out front.Although we did the final booking through our travel agent, we had already contacted the Hotel Montecarlo directly via email to get quotes and inquire about the hotel and Barcelona in general. They were most helpful and responded right away to every request. Our travel agent was planning to book a different hotel for our small group and we insisted on the Montecarlo.There is a nice breakfast room with eggs, cereals, lots of fruit, bread and pastries, however the breakfast is 11 euros additional per person, a small negative in my book. However, it was very convenient the next morning as we were hurrying to leave for the airport.The only other negative is that the bed, although comfortable, was two individual beds pushed together and they tended to separate - something to consider if you want to cuddle. :-)Otherwise, it was a great way to end our wonderful vacation. Do not hesitate to choose the Montecarlo!!

<Content>A perfect choice It was easy to see why this hotel is the top rated one as it has everything you'd want (unless you're incredibly indulgent and need excessive luxury or space). The lobby is fine, they have newspapers for the guests, a terrific location right on the Ramblas yet the rooms are quiet.I'd requested they make dinner reservations and they could not have been more helpful and accommodating as we kept changing nights.The room and bathroom was large enough, nicely done and totally comfortable. We could not have been happier on all counts and were a few minutes away from the market, where we went each morning for breakfast.Staff was pleasant. Everything is well maintained and spotless.

<Content>Wish I was there now! This is a hotel I have come to twice because I cannot fault the location, the amenities and the staff. The staff are all knowledgable, friendly and extremely helpful. I dream of returning again. We were able to get recommendations to restaurants, travel itineries and even help with a faulty rental car. The staff were unbelievably understanding and even after we had checked out, took care to see us safely off on our next journey.

<Content>Oasis on La Rambla Used Trip Advisor to find a good hotel and were not disappointed. Wanted a central location but were a little concerned about it being on La Rambla because of noise etc. However, once inside the hotel you had no idea you were on one of the busiest streets in Europe. Hotel has retained its lovely exterior and salon whilst providing contemporary bedrooms and bathrooms with very modern facilities. The staff were very courteous and helpful and breakfast was good value.This hotel deserves its high rating on trip advisor - it made my stay in Barcelona even better and well exceeded my expectations.

<Content>MonteCarlo lives up to its great reviews We spent 4 nights (Post Cruise) at the MonteCarlo and loved the hotel. Our room (202) was one of the refurbished rooms. (Staff told us the second and fifth floors had been redone.) The room was large, had a sitting room, a small balcony overlooking Las Ramblas and a large bath. It had new wood floors, quality contemporary furnishings, adjustable bed (fun to sit up and read or watch TV at night), in-room safe, mini-bar, nice closet with storage shelves, a shelf for luggage, two flat screen TVs, nice quality linens and pillows, two bed lights for reading, etc. The sitting room had a wonderful bay window overlooking Las Ramblas.  Watching the action on the street is great fun. The noise is NOT an issue since the hotel has used electric rolling shutters, double sets of doors and a heavy door between the sitting room and bedroom to block the sound. We slept great.The bath had high end decor and fixtures - interesting stone counters, walls and surrounds, high-end Grohe fixtures, whirlpool tub, shower, bidet, toilet, a good hair dryer, bath scales and the usual nice toiletries. Everything you could want was provided.The staff speaks English and are outstanding. They willingly make restaurant reservations, provide help with transportation, maps, and other info. The housekeeping is very quiet and out of sight but excellent. The room was immaculate always. They never knocked on our door and distrubed us to clean. They simply always came while we were gone.We frequently used the free computer with internet in the lobby and took advantage of the breakfast buffet ($11 euros). We appreciated that it stayed open until 11 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. on weekends.We plan to go again to the MonteCarlo. It is very user-friendly and a great place to stay. It could not be in a more convenient location for everything (metro, bus, taxis, tourist sights, restaurants, grocery store, fun and action), and the staff and service are terrific.

<Content>could not have been better I was apprehensive as the photos of the room show an old fashioned bed and tv but reviews were promising so we booked it and are spending the last of three nights in a fabulous, spacious, modern room with plenty of light and as quiet as we'd hoped for.It's right on the ramblas, convenient to everything, and the staff is helpful, made restaurant reservations for us, provided the Herald Trib, among other papers. Chocolates appear on the pillows each night. Bed adjusts like a hospital bed and the tub is a jacuzzi, neither of which had been advertised. There's plenty of space for clothing, a couch, flat screen tv as well as a comfortable chair. Wifi in rooms, computer in lobby.Prices varied by the night, from about 177 euros to 220 euros, and we felt it was very fairly priced. There is a solarium on the roof, but we prefer walking the streets of this magnificent city.People at the desk are pleasant and helpful. I would return to this hotel and recommend it without hesitation.

<Content>What a location! We have just returned from 3 nights at the Montecarlo. I chose this hotel for it's location on La Ramblas, it's traditional exterior with wrought iron balconies, and the contrast of a modern interior. We were not disappointed!We had 2 rooms (superior rate) with balconies overlooking La Ramblas. Both had spacious bedroom areas, sitting areas  large modern bathrooms with jacuzzi baths.The breakfast was excellent (11euros) and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful.First class hotel and worth every penny!

<Content>Pros  Pros:The junior suites were very large, up to date and a good value for your euros. The location is excellent- right in the middle of the tourist district of Barcelona but we had a courtyard facing room and we never heard any street noise. The staff was wonderful and were eager to please. The hotel is also very attractive and has a great look.Cons:They are currently doing some work on the upper floors. The noise is not loud but it is noticeable. The shower was also a little funky. You had to turn it on and input selections on the digital scene to get it to work. I tried to use it twice and both times received error messages that there was not enough water. I ended up using the tub.But even funkier than the shower was the bed. It was an 'italian' bed with two mattresses and controls that would lift the head and foot ends of the mattresses independently. Pretty neat while watching tv but it ended up being a nightmare to try and sleep on. The two mattresses slid apart from each other very easily and three times during the night I woke up to find myself falling into a foot wide gap and onto the metal framework.

<Content>Great Stay We have just returned from a week long visit and couldn't be more pleased with the Montecarlo.Our standard room was modern,clean and comfortable with a large and well equipped bath.We had a courtyard view which was very quiet. The staff were very polite,attentive and helpful. A great place to stay in the midprice range(150-220E).

<Content>As Good as the Reviews! Might be the best hotel we have ever used in Europe. I can't say enough about the staff, the room itself, the location, the service. It's a bargain for what you're getting.Quique, at the front desk, was perfect. His dinner recommendations were great. Each one was super. No tourists traps. All authentic Catalan.The room was huge by European standards. Very comfortable and clean. The bath was bigger than mine at home. Don't worry about the noise on la Rambla. We were right on La Rambla and could not hear a sound from the street. Air Conditioning was very good.We will be back!!

<Content>Very friendly, great hotel I booked a junior suite for my father's 70th birthday, and was very impressed, as was he. It was huge. He said he hasn't slept so well for ages, even though the hotal is right on La Rambla. Excellent beds. Very friendly helpful staff, would recommend to anyone.Nice roof terrace too, but maybe could have had a bar near the lobby to meet in, but there's lots of other places to meet near by.

<Content>Just could not have been better! Well, what can I say! We read the reviews beforehand like you all and booked with a good level of expectation. Those expectations were well and truly exceeded in every way. We were absolutely delighted and thrilled with the hotel. Fabulous room, excellent full-scale breakfast is good value (just about everything you want including full English breakfast so we were not hungry till about 4 p.m!). Reception staff are so approachable, friendly and so helpful. Just can't fault this hotel in any way - the best we have ever stayed in. A great location too, and VERy quiet!. Suggest ask for a room at the back to be sure, but room was very sound-proof particularly at night.

<Content>FAB We had a wonderful time at this hotelwe booked it on the reviews from this site and they were all spot on. staff , location , rooms all FAB we asked for a local tapas bar and the staff recommended Ciudad Condal it was within easy walking distance and the food was to die for. we went early 6.30 the first time and it wasnt too busy so the staff had time to listen to our phrase book spanish and show us and explain most of the dishes as first timers we found this invaluable! we went later another night ( 9.00ish) and it was very busy with rapid service and little time for novices i was glad we had been earlier and new the score!! all this added to the experience ,it was great place.the roof top of the hotel has spectacular views the touristic bus is well worth the money, we got on at 10.30 no queue.i would go back in an instant - no question

<Content>Lovely hotel Hotel great, we stayed for a week and had a lovley time. The blackout blinds meant LOTS of sleep which you need after hours and hours of walking in the city. The staff recommended lovely places to eat- ask them about the great place that does suckling pig! Watch out for pickpockets- we were done on our second night despite bieng really careful after warnings. The harbour area does great seafood. Really enjoyed the location of the hotel, right in the middle of all the sights. Would recommend to others.

<Content>Perfect stay! Stayed at the Montecarlo for 3 nights and was extremely pleased.The hotel's location is perfect. It is on the Rambla near Plaza Catalunya, so very near to starting point of airport bus and tourist hop on hop off and located in the Barri Gotico, in short the heart of the city. You can walk to many important sights, and don't need a taxi or metro. But the perfect thing is that the hotel, which is a beautiful building, is a haven of rest and peacefulness inside.We had a room at the back, which was so quiet that you could sleep with the windows open! The staff are very friendly and extremely helpful, and speak perfect english.Roger, the porter, who found that the allocated room smelled of smoke, came back to give us an even nicer room.Room 306, their standard room, but perfect. Good beds and enough space and an extra door before you get to the hallway. So keeps noise down.All rooms have marmbled bathrooms with a jacuzzi, which is nice after having walked for hours.There is also free internet.In short, go for the Montecarlo. I looked at many of the other mentioned hotels, but was happy we decided on this hotel.

<Content>LittleGem We spent a week at the Montecarlo Hotel with our children in late February. The experience couldn't have been lovelier! The location could not have been beat and the accomodations and service were wonderful. The hotel is right at cross-roads between La Rambla, its shopping, and the Gothic neighborhood. Excellent, convenient access to everything. The Montecarlo, which we learned is a national Barcelona monument , is diagonally across the street from Hotel 1898 and directly across from le Meridien.Staff was wonderful and recommended absolutely the best places to dine. The food in Barcelona is awesome, from tapas to elegant restaurants. The hotel service was excellent. The breakfast waitress couldn't have been nicer and more accomodating. We loved our cafe con leches with our fresh orange juice and she tended to us very attentively.This mid 1850's building has a beautiful 1st floor great room, restored to its original splendor. Yet the bedrooms and bathrooms are all modernized, immmaculately clean and the beds are the most comfortable beds in which we've ever slept. The hotel provides slippers and bathrobes to all guests and in my estimate, represents the best deal in Barcelona. Check out the top floor solarium which provides 360掳 views of Barcelona's beautiful rooftops, gothic neighborhood and city center.Emphatically recommend and would return in a heartbeat!

<Content>Convenience and comfort My son and I stayed here for a week, and enjoyed the quiet modern elegance. The staff was great, very helpful with directions. The location on La Rambla is very convenient to restaurants, the harbor, and other attractions. The hotel is an art deco - Gaudi like structure with a charming lobby and sitting areas; the rooms are completely modern and well equipped. Cost was reasonable, this was 3.5 star comfort at 2.5 star prices.

<Content>Absolutely loved the Montecarlo We stayed in the Montecarlo for 4 nights in early January this year and were very impressed. We booked one of the deluxe rooms and really believe it was well worth the extra money. First of all the room and the en-suite were huge. The bathroom was easily the biggest we've had and having the jacuzzi bath and seperate walk-in showers after a long day spent sightseeing was a godsend. The bed itself was one of the most comfortable beds I've stayed in. Entertainemnt wise we had a full minibar, mini hifi system and multichannel tv. What was really cool is that the hifi was wired into the bathroom so you could relax in the bath sipping some chilled cava while listing to your favourite tunes. Total bliss. We didnt sample breakfast as we booked room only, however there are plenty of nice places nearby which do lovely reasonably priced meals.All the staff we met during our stay were incredibly helpful. The gave us tips on what to see and do and they were only too happy to book restaurants and taxis. The hotels location is very central, literally 5 mins walk from La Catalunya railway station. However travelling from the airport its not advisable to take the metro, its best to take the bus to Placa Catalunya and walk 5 mins to the hotel. I would definitely recommend the Montecarlo to anyone going to Barcelona and will stay there again next time I go to Barcelona.

<Content>Ideally placed with relaxing atmosphere A great find near Plaza Catalunya. Easy to reach from the airport 鈥榖us and good transport connections 鈥?not that you really need them much as being right on Las Ramblas means you can enjoy this lovely city on foot.Hotel looks great both inside and outside. Front desk offered good service which was friendly and efficient. Didn鈥檛 make use of any of the other facilities but the bar and breakfast room were well appointed. There are plenty of nearby caf茅s and bars to choose from with breakfast readily available for much less than 鈧?1 charged in the hotel.Our room overlooked an inner square with well set out courtyards of neighbouring flats and hotels. It was very quiet inside the hotel. The room had plenty of space in it including in the bathroom and everything was well maintained and subtly decorated. Overall, a feeling of comfort and relaxation.On arrival the porter showed us to the room with no hint of wanting a tip. The features included an adjustable bed, a Jacuzzi bath, a CD player and little extras such as a presentation box of freebie samples.The only minor negative points were that the large looking double bed was in fact made up of two single mattresses and the sun roof was locked and we鈥檇 been looking forward to the views.Overall the Hotel Montecarlo shows how it should be done. Simple but elegant presentation (beautiful flowers in reception and candles burning in the evenings). Apparently effortless service and attention to detail. At times it was hard to believe that there were other guests resident as there were never other people waiting around for anything 鈥?other than the staff always ready to help.

<Content>Perfect Hotel My girlfriend and I stayed here for a short break of four nights in February 2008, and I have to say that the hotel was perfect in every respect - I don't think I could find a thing to fault it.I selected this hotel after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and after looking at all the top rated hotels for both a central location and price, this seemed to be the perfect combination.We arrived early Friday evening and found the hotel located in a perfect spot on La Rambla just a couple of minutes from Place Catulunya.We were greeted at the door by a hotel porter (although I don't believe he was there all the time during the stay, so it may just be pot luck on whether there is a porter there when you arrive). The porter took our bags to reception where we were swiftly and efficiently checked in by a polite and helpfull receptionist with perfect English.After checking in, the porter went with us to the room, carrying the bags and then showing us the features etc. of the room.The room was great - a good sized room with king size bed, contemporary style and nice and clean. The room had doors which opened to overlook La Rambla - and even though the street outside was busy and bustling, you could close the doors and all was quiet. In fact, the hotel was quiet as a whole - everyday we had a nice long lie in without being woken up by noise. The bathroom was wonderful - a good size, clean and with a nice big jacuzzi - big enough for two :-)) with a good shower over the bath.TV was limited in choice - only BBC World and CNN in English - but we didn't go to Barcelona to watch TV. Reception had free Internet access.Overall this was an excellent hotel that I would definitely recommend.TIP - the tax from the airport to the hotel was about 40 Euros inc. tip. However, the Airport bus stops and starts in Placa Catulunya and is five mins walk to the hotel straight down La Rambla. The airport bus only cost 4 Euros per person.

<Content>Great location!!! After reading excellent reviews of the hotel, I decided to check myself. Great choice! Awesome location, nicely renovated rooms, and very helpful staff. I stayed for three nights, and had to go to another city to attend a business meeting. I left most of my luggage in the hotel, and returned for one more night before heading back home. No issue whatsoever.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, friendly with very nice rooms and superbly located We have just come back from a three night stay in Barcelona and stayed at the Montecarlo. When we visited the city 7 years ago, my husband fell in love with the outside of the building and vowed he would stay there if he ever went again. For his birthday, I booked this short break and he was delighted that I had managed to book a room there. Despite only having a standard room, when I spoke to the hotel, they said they would do their best to let us have a balcony. When we arrived they confirmed that we did indeed have a balcony overlooking La Rambla. The room, whilst not being the biggest we have stayed in was very good, and the bathroom was magnificent with a huge jacuzzi bath big enough for two. The beds were very comfortable with the usual egyptian cotton sheets you would expect in a good quality hotel - even the pillows were to my taste. A novelty was the electric bed, enabling you to sit up and have a drink whilst watching the tv. Although they had Sat TV, the only english channels were CNN and BBC World, however we probably spent more time either walking round the city, or chilling out in the bath to help our aching muscles. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. All in all, if we went back to that wonderful city, we would always ask for room 301 at the Montecarlo! If you want a good meal, try El Burrito y Yo in the old quarter. Great food and good ambiance.

<Content>Perfect choice This hotel was a great choice for our first visit to Barcelona in mid-December. Perfect location for exploring the city centre on foot with lots of great restaurants, cafes, bars and shops close at hand. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Our room on the fifth floor was quiet, with a very comfortable bed and a great bathroom. We could have paid more for a fancier room with a view, but we had no complaint. We took breakfast (9E each extra) on a couple of days, but there are plenty of alternatives nearby. In short, a very nice place to stay. Well worth the price.

<Content>First-rate in every way We could not have been happier with the hotel. The location is great, right on La Rembla, two blocks from the Plaza de Catalunya. La Rembla is a main street leading up from the port to the center of the city. It has a wide median strip with lots of kiosks, street entertainers, etc. On Sunday it is particularly crowded because the city's people walk up and down the street and a modern version of a paseo. The site is also convenient for catching the open top-deck tourist buses around town. The two main routes stop right at the plaza. There are also many restaurants, etc. around. There is a small supermarket across the street. The hotel is also near to the subway, and many taxis go by for easy flagging.We took in a flamenco show, and it was almost directly across the street from the hotel. The hotel itself was first-rate, specially for the price (149 euros). The room and bathroom were both quite large and very clean. The room had ad dual-control electric adjustable bed-something I've never seen in a hotel. The bath an a good size whirlpool tub. The staff was quite helpful about booking tickets, restaurant suggestions. The buffet breakfast as extra, but at 9 euros was a good bargain. There is free internet in the lobby.

<Content>Fabulous hotel and Best Location After reading all the wonderful reviews on tripadvisor, we decided to book 6 nights at the Hotel Montecarlo. We were not disappointed. We had a beautiful room on the 5th floor overlooking Las Ramblas, balcony with a wonderful view of the city, palatial bathroom with jacuzzi tub, spacious shower, great bathrobes and slippers and even a scale so we could make sure we did not gain too much weight from all the tapas and sangria! The room were very quiet at night, with double pane windows and blackout shades. The bed was extremely comfortable with great bed linens and thick absorbent towels.The location is perfect and the staff were always helpful and accommodating. They spoke great English and the service was just perfect. We felt very safe here and would definitely recommend this hotel to others for the location, great rooms. service, and value for the money. They do have a great breakfast for 9 euros but we choose to go to other small cafes nearby for a little less money and a change of atmosphere.This was a wonderful find and I am so glad to have found this gem through Tripadvisor. You will not be disappointed!

<Content>Quiet and Comfortable Stay We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Our taxi drove us right up to the door and someone was out immediately to take our bags in and hold them for the day until our room was ready. We had just the standard room on the fifth floor. It was overlooking the courtyard. It was fine with us that it did not overlook La Rambla. I took a nice jacuzzi to unwind after our long flight and it was wonderful. They provided a very nice assortment of perfumes and bath crystals and goodies. Very nice touch. The beds were nice, except that they separated during the night and I ended up sleeping in between the two mattresses because I was too tired w/ jet lag to get out of it!! The only thing I would say negatively about the room is that though it did have a CD player I was surprised at the quality of it. I don't think I would advertise that. But, it was nice to have in the room.The staff was willing to help and if you asked a question, they quickly pulled out a map to show you.The ATM right outside the Hotel is archaic and we were afraid it was going to take our card. We had no problems w/ pickpocketing, although we could sort of spot them in the Boqueria when we were sittiing on bar stools looking at our pockets. Keep your bag in your lap and across your body ALL THE TIME. We absoluteley loved Barcelona and almost wished we were not going on our cruise to stay there longer. Don't miss Boqueria and Pintoxto Bar!!!!We ate and drank like the locals and they liked us for it! (wine at 9 a.m.!) Also go have lunch at 4 CATS!!!!!! Awesome!

<Content>Great Location and a great hotel We stayed at the Montecarlo in October 2007. We were very pleased withthe hotel. It has been redecorated in a modern theme which we liked and has some nice touches such as adjustable beds, robes and slippers,and electic rollup blalckout shades.The location is super, Even though it is on the La Rambla, it is very quiet and we were never bothered by street noise. The desk staff was most knowledgeable and quite helpful.We did not opt for the breakfast as it was not included in the price of the room. There a several places close by that are cheaper.I don't think you can beat this hotel for its location and price and for what you get for your money. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Amazing Montecarlo Well, the reviews were great that we read before we booked and we certainly were not disappointed. We stayed in room 209 at the back of the hotel, not much of a view but the room had just been refurbished.Wooden floors, white linen, fluffy towels, slippers and dressing gowns greated us with a beautifully appointed bathroom stocked with all of your essentials. Also had one of the best hairdriers that I have found in a hotel for a long time.There was also a safe (free) and the room was cleaned and turned down every day.Breakfast in the hotel was 9e+tax and was well worth it with the usual continental selection, but cerials, bacon, eggs, fresh fruit and copious amounts of tea. We ate breakfast in other places during our stay, but the hotel offered far the best selection and price.Staff were always on hand to help and provided some great advice about getting around and resteraunts in the area. We also felt that the hotel was secure with the reception manned whenever we were around.The Montecarlo is certainly somewhere we would stay again and it's right in the heart of where you need to be on a break to Barcelona.

<Content>Wonderful Start After spending around 20 straight hours on airplanes and in airports, my wife and I arrived at the Montecarlo at 11PM, for the start of a long awaited and eagerly anticipated Spain vacation. I was thinking nap time, but as anyone who has been to Barcelona knows, the city is just waking up about then. So we threw some cold water on our faces and out into the night we went. Barcelona is an exciting and fun city. The Hotel Montecarlo is perfectly situated on Ramblas, a short walk to many fine restaurants and cafes, along with open air markets and museums. For longer jaunts, we took public transportation. Being an urban planner, I truly appreciated Barcelona's splendid combination of art, design, form and function. At no time did I ever feel lost or unsafe (using some common sense, of course). The Hotel Montecarlo was the perfect compliment to our Barcelona experience. The room, overlooking the Ramblas was spacious and modern with a classy shower/jacuzzi tub. The staff was very accommodating and helpful. In particular, we left our passports in our room's safe when we left for Girona. Marina, the front desk staff person, was very helpful and made sure that we received them without incident a few days later. Marina also was extremely helpful regarding local sites, customs and eateries. It was the perfect start to a wonderful vacation. Without a doubt, we would return to the Hotel Montecarlo.

<Content>It was just okay I too read the reviews but wasn't sure about the location. The Ramblas can be rather hectic. Since we had two stays in Barcelona, decided to stay at the Montecarlo on the way home.I was impressed with the desk clerk and the breakfast, but my room was very disappointing. The carpets were stained and the room lacked any ambience. It was not a luxury room, nor was this hotel cheap. The room looked like a motel room. Aside from the fresh orange juice, good coffee and internet access, I would not stay here again.

<Content>The Best Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In We just got back from a wonderful week in Barcelona. I booked the Hotel Montecarlo because of the good reviews on TripAdvisor.com, and all I can say is, the hotel was FANTASTIC. We are a family of 4 and booked 2 adjoining rooms on the 5th floor, away from La Rambla. The hotel exceeded our expectations. Everything everybody says in the reviews is true -- large beautiful quiet rooms, wonderful comfortable Craftmatic-type beds, down comforters, great showers and jacuzzis, robes and slippers, chocolates on your pillow, free internet, and the most helpful, friendly staff. We did not opt to pay 9 euros for the breakfast, but instead ate breakfast at the cafe literally next door, Moka Cafe, for a cheaper price. There was a cash machine next door, too, and of course the location on La Rambla couldn't be beat. The hotel is rated 3 stars, which I find puzzling, since it seems at least a 4 star hotel to me. We thought Barcelona was fantastic, and we would stay at the Montecarlo again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Stylish, friendly and first class The location of this hotel is second to none. it is also quiet - especially if you ask for a room at the rear of the property. The delux rooms are very spacious, luxuriously appointed and comfortable.The staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great - especially the coffee - a great place to stay.

<Content>A very good value for Barcelona. We stayed at the Hotel Montecarlo for three nights in September. It isin a very convenient location, the rooms are nice and functional and the staff is extremely helpful and accommodating. We had no problems whatsoever. The hotel is also a very good value for Barcelona. I booked it after reading some reviews but it still exceeded my expectations.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed three nights at this hotel and although it was a bit more expensive we could not fault it and it was well worth the money. Great location but very quiet at night. Couldn't even here any noise from the next room. Staff are obviously well trained and are very helpful and friendly. Rooms were a good size and spotless. A great hotel for a visit to Barcelona

<Content>Perfect location, great service After doing considerable research on the internet and in guidebooks, I selected the Hotel Montecarlo for its location and excellent reviews. We were not disappointed. Its location near the top of La Rambla was perfect and central to everything. Its 200 year old facade was gorgeous and our modern room facing the back of the hotel had a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and included bathrobes, slippers, and a hairblower. The breakfasts were wonderful with scrambled eggs, pastries, yogurt, a variety of breads, and fruit. Best of all was the staff - helpful and charming. We would definitely go back there. Barcelona should not be missed. We stayed there for four nights before a Mediterranean cruise and loved every minute of it - the Gaudi masterpieces, Gothic quarter, great restaurants, museums, and fabulous seafront location. We would also recommend a day trip to see the monastery at Montserrat. Great city and great hotel!

<Content>Everything and More My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Montecarlo for 2 nights prior to our Mediterranean cruise. We requested a view of the Rambla and were accomodated on the 5th floor with a wonderful view. We were surprised how quiet it was considering the number of people strolling the area. The room was large and the bathroom was wonderful and clean. The front desk folks were eager to please and recommended restaurants upon request. There were ATM machines located right outside the hotel entrance which provided Euros at the current rate which saved us a small fortune when exchanging dollars. The location was close to the main plaza where we were able to catch the tour buses for great sightseeing. Our stay provided a tremendous beginning to a spectacular vacation. Our next visit to Barcelona will DEFINITELY include a return to the Hotel Montecarlo.

<Content>Great room, great location. Just came back from a week in Spain. We spent four nights in the Hotel Montecarlo. We had a room on the 5th floor overlooking Las Ramblas. With the double pained glass the room was very quiet. Again, echoing many of the previous sentiments this was an idle location. Right on Las Ramblas near the top. Quick walk up to Platca Catalunya, making it great base for site seeing and going out in the evening.English speaking staff was very accomodating. The only quibble would be the beautiful, Euro style shower was difficult to use without soaking the tiles around the tub.

<Content>What a gem! Have just come back from 3 nights at this hotel. What a gem of a place. It's right on Las Ramblas but you can't hear any of the noise.Rooms are more spacious than they look on their website and very clean. Staff were fantastic, excellent English, very polite and helpful. The breakfast at 9 euros was good with excellent fresh orange juice. I would definitely stay again.

<Content>EXCELLENT BASE FOR EXPLORING BARCELONA Got a warm and freindly welcome when we arrived at the Montecarlo. Everything, incuding the price, was clearly explained in very good English. The hotel is very clean and well-run, and although I'm very fussy, I could find nothing wrong.The central location is fantastic, right on the Ramlas where all the shops are, and very close to the metro. Our room on the top (5th) floor was a reasonable size and had an electrically adjustable and very comfortable twin bed. The air conditioning worked perfectly and the double glazing completely cut out any traffic noise. The marble-tiled bathroom was first class with good water pressure and limitless hot water. The staff were always very friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our 4 night stay and would certainly book again.

<Content>Lovely, quiet hotel in the middle of everything The Montecarlo was fabulous! This was our first trip to Barcelona and we wanted a location that was central to the touristic sites. When we first walked down La Rambla to the hotel, we were apprehensive because La Rambla was SO packed with people and full of activity - we were worried that it would go on all night and that our room would be noisy. We asked for a quiet room and got 206, which turned out to be in the new part of the hotel on a private courtyard (private to other buildings). Even though we kept the window the the courtyard open every night, we slept in complete silence and tranquility. That was the first thing we loved about the hotel: being in the middle of everything and having it be quiet at night.Besides that: the hotel is stunning. It is a beautiful old (Beaux Arts?) building that has been updated with modern design giving it the best of both worlds. We did not see rooms in the old part, but ours, in the new part was simple and lovely. It had a platform bed, a built-in desk with a free internet line, an ample closet, a chair and small table, and a spacious bathroom. In fact, the bathroom was really gorgeous, with chocolate brown slate tiles, a jacuzzi tub, and modern fixtures. The pictures on the website do not do this hotel justice. It is much prettier!On the mezzanine is a beautiful old sitting room with a magnificent fireplace and lots of sitting areas. It has chairs where you can sit and watch all of the activity on the street.The people working at the hotel were extremely helpful and courteous. The hotel is just two blocks from the Plaza Catalunya, which is where the fabulous touristic buses board and where the airport bus stops. Thus, you can get to the hotel from the airport for only 4 Euros (30 minute trip). Every day that we were at the Montecarlo, my husband said to me Thanks for finding such a great hotel!

<Content>Great Hotel After reading the good reviews on Trip Advisor we stayed at the Hotel Montecarlo in Barcelona from the 9th to 12th October 07 and confirm the reviews were correct, it is a fantastic hotel.The Hotel is classed is 3*, but we would class it as a very good 4* Hotel.We were given room 301, which had a nice balcony with great views overlooking La Ramba. The room was excellent and the jacuuzi was great.The location of the hotel is first class and the politeness and helpfulness of the staff was also first rate.Brilliant hotel - we will always stay here when we return to Barcelona in the future.

<Content>Wiorst Experience Ever Stay Away!!!!!!You need to read this if you are thinking of staying at this hotel. Ok, we stayed at this hotel for part of our honeymoon in Barcelona. Location is good and rooms are ok but nothing great for the money.Our last night there after we just went to sleep around 3 AM we hear shouting in the hallway. Then there is this load banging on our door from a girl screaming in some foreign language. Of course we didnt know what to do so we just waited and we heard banging on the door next to us. This goes on for like 5 minutes and I didnt want to open the door because I dont know who is out there and what their issue is, so I call the front desk. Front desk tells me that some crazy lady got on the elevator before they could stop her and they are aware she is in the hotel. I tell the guy well shes is banging as hard as she can on my door and the rooms next to me on the third floor so please have her removed. He says ok and that he also called the police.This baging goes on literally for the next 45 minutes. This lady is crying, screaming, and banging on our door and the rooms next to us so loud that I honestly felt she was going to break the door down. I called the front desk again, same guys there and no action is taken. Finally around 4:14 AM the banging stops and we try to go back to sleep but with all that happening and it being so loud and odd I probably got 1 hour of sleep before I had to wake up and get my plane.So the next morning I go to check out while my wife finishes gathering things in the room. I ask to talk to the owner. A middle aged man downstairs said he is the owner. He spoke some English and I explained to him in English and Spanish about what happened. He said he was aware of it and it was a lady and a husband or boyfriend that have stayed there before that were in a fight, which was very different then the story I heard the night earlier about some random crazy walking in off the street. I explained it was our heoneymoon and we paid a lot for the hotel and I didnt think we should need to pay for the last night becuase of what happened. You dont pay $300/night to stay at a hotel and have that kind of experience. I own 3 different businesses in the US and any other business owner would agree that some sort of action should be taken by the owner of this hotel for his guests. Well this guy flipped out. Came around the desk and started yelling and screaming with his fist in the air that we better pay for all the nights. This guy was crazy. So to wrap this up, he actually grabbed me by the shirt at least three times and tried to shove me, kicked our bags and our $1500 worth or artwork we purchased in Barcelona the day before that was wrapped in a bix that said fragile, tried to have a bell boy take our bags, and just acted like a real ass. I told him we would have the cops come and they could see the videotape of what just happened. he had one of his workers go in the back room and do something (Im pretty sure get rid of the tape). The police came which were little help. I told them to watch the tape. They came back 5 minutes later and told me it was out of order. I filed a police report there becuase they advised me it would take too long to go to the police station. We ended upo missing our flight anyways and now I am disputing the charge for the hotel on my credit card because of all this. What a way to treat your guests after they are put through a night of screaming and yelling by other guests outside of your room. Especially when you know how much they are paying a nigh to stay there and that it is your honeymoon. Stay away from this place. Only thing good about it is the location. Services suck. Cant even get ice unless the bar is open and then you need to walk downstairs and have them go get you some. Not worth it. Trust me. Rest of hte trip was great. Z This place ruined Barcelona for us.

<Content>AbsolutelyLoved Hotel Montecarlo My best friend and I stayed at the Hotel Montecarlo on Las Ramblas for 5 nights in September and absolutely loved it! Its at the top end of Las Ramblas close to Placa Catalunya Square (2 min walk) - which made it perfect for catching the Tourist Bus and bus to and from the airport.The hotel is one of, if not the most, beautiful building on las ramblas - loads of tourists took pictures of the building. The staff are incredibly helpful and very friendly. We arrived early and the team gave us a welcome pack full of things to do in Barcelona and looked after our luggage whilst we went and grabbed a bite to eat while our room was getting ready. When we got back our luggage was already in our room, complete with a welcome pack (gorgeous chocolate key, lovely welcome note and gorgeous goodie box). (Top tip though, don't struggle up the steps with your suitcase on arrival - if you go in to the reception desk theres a lift that will take your cases up to the ground floor reception room).We'd asked for a room overlooking Las Ramblas in our email reservation and got one - definitely worth asking. Gorgeous iron balconies, but these do tend to be shared with the next room, but are sectioned off. Once the sliding doors are closed you wouldn't know you were staying on Las Ramblas it was so quiet.The mini bar is restocked often - and is as cheap as anything around the hotel with a good choice of drink for both pre-night and morning after thirst requirements!!. There's a cd player and tv. The beds were remote controlled so you could raise the top or bottom end of the bed to suit. The shower was amazing - a whole room of its own, with a huge jacuzzi bath. There were also complimentary bath robes and slippers (not all out luxury, more of a day spa robe - but a really nice touch).Also - do make the effort to pop up to the roof terrace as the view over the city is lovely.Initially we were considering staying at the 1989 (if thats the right name) which is situated just opposite the Montecarlo. Yes the hotel has a lovely pool at the top, but you really wouldn't miss it. The Montecarlo has a much more relaxed and friendly feel - I can't recommend this enough!

<Content>Best Hotel in Barcelona? Yep! After checking on hotels at Tripadvisor, we picked the Hotel Monte Carlo, staying 3 days from 2-5 October. We booked a deluxe room (#402) for 270 Euros through Venere.com at the last minute. We were shocked and amazed by our room! The bathroom alone was bigger than most of our hotel rooms in Europe, all redone in marble with jacuzzi, separate shower, exercise bike and lots of windows providing mellow light. We had a living room with WiFi and cable TV, and the bedroom was palatial, with an adjustable bed that raised both head and/or feet, with a balcony overlooking Las Ramblas, the best location in Barcelona! The entire staff was super friendly and helpful, and the public areas magnificent. Oh, and the breakfast buffet was the best we've had in Europe; eggs, ham, 5 kinds of sausage, 5 or 6 kinds of bread, with a toaster that actually worked! Plus FRESH squeezed orange juice! Heavenly! A word of caution, the regular rooms cannot be this nice, as they are $70 less money, so if you can spring for the extra $$ it's sooo worth it. We felt like the Duke  Duchess of Windsor!

<Content>An excellent hotel We stayed at the Monte Carlo for 2 nights post-cruise and couldn't have been happier with our choice.The hotel has a baroque appearance from the outside (very lovely when illuminated at night) but it's very modern inside. From the moment our taxi pulled up at the door the staff couldn't have been more helpful (and we did have a lot of bags).We had a quiet room at the back of the hotel - furnished in very modern style and with jacuzzi bath (lovely after our cramped shower on the Emerald Princess). Bathrobes were supplied but we didn't use them. One little complaint...the bath was rather slippery and we would have welcomed a bath mat when showering. The hotel is ideally situated right on La Rambla and very near Catalunya Place and a very central spot e.g. for catching the turistic bus which circumnavigates all the main attractions in the city - both routes, north and south are highly recommended. The staff were very helpful in suggesting good eating places...great recommendations for tapas. We ate breakfast both mornings ( 9 euros per person and well worth it). We would certainly stay at the Monte Carlo again.

<Content>Great location, great value Great location right in the center of things..despite what you may think most of the tourist spots are within walking distance to Las Ramblas so it is really not necessary to get taxis.. the hotel is very nice , clean and modern with great rooms and large chic bathrooms. It is very quiet as all the rooms have electronic shutters which literally close out all light and noise. The staff are very friendly and courteous.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel was great. It was our last spot on our vacation and we could not have asked for more. The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathrooms were huge with a big spa bathtub. You have to turn your room keys in everytime you leave, but then you don't have to worry about losing them. Las Rambles was very busy and crowded, but you couldn't hear anything in the hotel. One of the friends I was traveling with got really sick the last day and the staff did everything they could to make it easier for her. We actually had to check out that day and they made her comfortable in the lobby with blankets and food. The staff went above and beyond. great hotel.

<Content>Lives up to the hype!! My wife and I booked the Hotel Montecarlo for the Barcelona stretch of our honeymoon. We booked it based on reviews from this website. We were a little nervous because the hotel is not found on very many travel sites. Bottom line: the entire experience was unforgettable - because of the room, the staff, the location and the price. I had written in advance to advise that it was our honeymoon, and they certainly stepped up to the occasion. They placed us in what they referred to as their newest and best suite. 2nd Floor with a private terrace overlooking La Rambla. seperate bedroom and sitting room. Beautiful decor, cozy kingsize bed, and the greatest bathroom you could imagine with a 2 person jacuzzi, huge seperate shower with rainfall, regular detachable showerhead and horizontal hydrotherapy jets! Double-sink vanity, etc, etc. Moments after the staff checked us in and brought up our bags, the hotel manager arrived with a complementary bottle of cava (spanish champagned) and flowers to congratulate us on the occasion. After each long, wonderful day we would sit out on our terrace with a bottle of cava and watch the excitment of La Rambla go by. Then, the moment we closed the well-soundproofed doors lowered the professionally installed black-out blinds, we were in our private villa which could have been miles from any other people. Seriously folks - This hotel was the highlight of our trip.

<Content>First Class weekend at the Monte!! Just returned from a wonderful weekend at the Montecarlo Hotel, located directly on Las Ramblas. We paid the extra for a deluxe room...well worth it. On arrival we were given a choice of Ramblas or rear facing rooms. No competition really, we chose room 308 at the rear of the hotel...features a huge jacuzzi, walk in wet room shower with hydro massage, a seating area, 2 tv`s, Hifi, electric beds and blinds and silent air con. Only areas for improvement were no iron in room or tea / coffee facilities. Comprehensive buffet breakfast...well worth the extra.Take the Aerobus from the airport....stops 100 yds from the hotel.By far the best eatery visited was Los Caracoles [-----]....steak, snails and chicken were all the best ever! Visit during the afternoon to take in the local clientele and traditional atmoshere.Las Ramblas is awesome...no problems with pickpockets, but wear your bag in front, not on your back! Brilliant street artists. The place really comes alive at 1.00 a.mThe 2 day tourist bus pass is great value, and covers all the main sites. An added feature being that you dont have to drive and can therefore drink at numerous local bars en route! Gaudi`s Sagrada Familia is without doubt the most awesome structure in Europe. Enjoy!

<Content>Great Find We chose this hotel based on the TripAdvisor rating and were very pleased. The interesting 19th Century building is beautifully redecorated to a high standard. We chose a superior room and were given a nice suite. Excellent maintenance. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The location is excellent for walking about the city. No nickle and diming - wifi free, mini bar inexpensive. A great spot.

<Content>Fantastic all round! Fantastic location - 5 minute walk from the Aerobus (From the airport) stop in Plaza Catalunya. Great staff - Perfect English, plus helpful, friendly and always polite. Right in the middle of everything - On La Rambla, a walk to the beach, a short walk to the Gothic Quarter, a good walk to Sagrada Familia. Great room - Clean, massively comfortable beds, lovely welcome pack, plus a Jacuzzi in the bathroom!!! It was a fantastic place! The breakfast was a little pricey at 9 Euros each, but very, very good....buffet, with a selection of cold and cooked meats, fruit a range of breads and lovely, freshly squeezed orange juice. All in all, it was close to everything - whether that be restaurants, famous sites, bus stops, the beach, culture - way more than a 3 star and for the centre of such a great city as Barcelona, fairly priced.....everything was great! I cannot recommend it enough! One thing to remember is that when you book on your respective websites (I went with Opodo), it didn't detail the 7% Service/VAT Charge......took me by surprise, but it was no fault of the hotel, just something I forgot to take in to account! But, if you go, you will not be disappointed!

<Content>Good location, clean and comfortable. You wont be disappointed Booked a 4 night stay here in August on the back of the tripadvisor reviews and wasn't dissapointed. The hotel is in a great location on Las Ramblas, 5min from Placa Catalunya where the aerobus from the airport stops (last stop). The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room we had on the 2nd floor was great. Very recently renovated with wooden floor, tasteful furnishings and a really nice bathroom with Jacuzzi bath and shower. The matress on the bed was also adjustable via a small control although if I had one complaint it would be the mattress is a bit soft. We had the breakfast once at Eur9 each it wasn't really worth it. you are better off having breakfast on the go by getting something from a local bakery or sitting down at a cafe. As far as hotel breakfasts go though most people will probably be happy.Only thing to check would be to try and get a room on a renovated floor, not sure all have been done yet

<Content>Fantastic hotel in a great location This is a brilliant hotel, we were on the 2nd floor and there was no noise at all from the street. The room and bathroom were superb, didn't have breakfast so I don't know what the food is like. If you like real Flamenco go to Tarantos, Playa Reial 17, a few minutes walk down Las Ramblas.Everyone should try a Mojito, the best cocktail there is!Barcelona is a fantastic city and this hotel is highly recommended to all!Beware of pickpockets, they are everywhere.

<Content>Excellent hotel and location, would stay again Our first time in Barcelona so followed the info on Trip Advisor and stayed at the MonteCarlo. The whole experience was value for money with very well equipped room overlooking Les Ramblas. The excellent double glazing and near silent aircon mean the noise of the Ramblas doesn't filter up. I'd stay on as high a floor as possible to be safe. Breakfast is excellent value and the staff were also excellent. 2nd floor was undergoing renovation when we stayed but this was pointed out to us on arrival and we heard or saw nothing about it. I was slightly concerned by some noise from other rooms but this didn't cause us a problem at all so I can't say this is a negative.Location is great for 1st timers in Barcelona. Very much recommended.

<Content>Location Location We are just back from a ten week trip to Europe.Five weeks driving around the south of Spain, I chose all our hotel from Tripadvisor.We were not disappointed that's the beauty of this wonderful site.Hotel Montecarlo was the first hotel on our trip through Spain and we loved it.From the minute you check in the staff are amazing,we had requested a La Ramblas view room.We stayed for four nights on the 13th of May, on the 3rd floor and we did hear any renovation noise or any noise.The bathroom was huge and the bed was the best we slept on in Spain.We would sit on the roof terrace in the afternoon and have our wine and nibbles the view is great.The breakfast was very good and a bargain at 9 euros I think this hotel should be 4* and 5* for service.The reception staff recommended a great restaurant called 4cats the street is Montsio I think..The food was fantastic, it was were poets  writer used to go in by gone times has lots of atmosphere a MUST.This hotel is in a great location we caught the airobus from the airport very quick and a bargain at only 3.75 euro, five minute walk to hotel.If we return to Barcelona, Hotel Montecarlo is were we would stay.

<Content>Ideal hotel and superb staff This is an ideal location if you want to be in the centre of everything in Barcelona and easy to get to on the Areobus from the airport. Our room in the hotel was quiet and peaceful in spite of how busy Las Ramblas is... Air conditioning, jacuzzi bath and adjustable beds were perfect after a hot day doing the tourist bit :) The staff are very helpful and friendly and provided information and advice when asked, and a what's on guide. We found two excellent restaurants we would be happy to recommend, Taxidermista at Placa Reial 8, just off Las Ramblas and Citrus at Paseo Gr脿cia 44 just up from Placa de Catalunya, but there are plenty of excellent cafe's and cervesaria's too...The tourist bus is an ideal way to see the city and decide what you want to visit and if you get a two day ticket it's very reasonable.The only downside we noticed is that the sewers are occaisionally a bit smelly... but Barcelona is definitely worth a visit!

<Content>Fantastic hotel in ideal location This 3* hotel is definately under-rated. This should at least be given 4*. The hotel is fantastic. The rooms are boutique size with a jacuzzi bathroom of 5* status. Prior to arrival, informed hotel that three day break was in fact a birthday surprise. To this end, a bottle of chilled champagne was awaiting our arrival in the room. Our room, on the 4th floor, had a balcony looking over La Rambla. This view could only be bettered by the view from the hotels 6th floor sun terrace. The staff, especially those on reception, are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Breakfast was good...both continental and hot available. Fresh orange juice and coffee served directly to your table. The location of the hotel is indeed first class, almost in the centre of La Rambla, with the main square to the right and the port area to the left. All main points of interest within walking distance of the hotel.Just a few traveller tips:Taxi from airport to hotel door 20 euros. Hotel door to airport 30 euros! Be sure to get price prior to leaving hotel.A pint of beer in La Rambla 9 euros. Just round the corner, price drops to 4 euros.Beware conmen with the 'ball under the three matchboxes' routine. They work in a group to produce their own crowd, enticing 'lucky' tourists!

<Content>Peaceful Montecarlo For anyone wanting a quiet oasis in a sea of frenetic activity which is Las Ramblas, then this hotel is for you!. Helpful, very able staff constantly on hand to assist any request--where to eat ,trips to organise etc.Very comfortable rooms ,we were on the 3rd floor overlooking Las Ramblas, and not a sound from outside--very well soundproofed! There is some renovation on 2nd floor at present but we were completely unaware of any noise,dust from below.Breakfast is continental and 9 euros extra but certainly worth while.Hotel very well situated ,within 200 metres of Catalunya square ,the departure site of tour buses,metro station,and if you like it--Hard Rock Cafe.And of course a short stroll down Las Ramblas takes you to the Marina and beach areas.Would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to this beautiful city.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay despite the renovations I stayed at the Montecarlo from June 23-25 and, while I was quite happy with the hotel, the review calling it a grand disappointment may be exaggerated but not wholly untrue. We stayed on the fourth floor and our room did show wear. I too was surprised by the carpet stains and the chipped paint on the walls. I guess this is why they are renovating! There was noise from the renovation that began at about 11 AM and was gone by evening. It was not jackhammers, but loud workers. We were out during the day and did not find it a problem.The staff was extremely helpful, spoke English, and provided excellent service. I would not hesitate, however, to recommend the Montecarlo. I enjoyed my stay.

<Content>A Grand Delight Each to their own of course but happily for us our experience couldn't be further removed from a recent review 'a grand disappointment' - it was for us 'a grand delight'. I am an extremely fussy traveller as regards cleanliness, comfort, and luxury, and checked in early and wearily (having been in another hotel in town working at said convention). The room we had requested, balcony overlooking Las Ramblas was unavailable so we were offered an upgrade to their junior suite (104) which more than made up for it. Magnificient - enormous, lots of marble, chandeliers, beautiful furniture, even a small library, and a massage jet shower/sauna, as well as the rugby team sized jacuzzi.Another recent review points out all rooms above 3rd floor are yet to be refurbished, and this was still the case, so we were pleased to be on the 1st floor. No disturbance from the workmen during the week until about 10am by which time we were out or on our way out., and then only light tapping. The staff were unfailingly helpful and chirpy, and made some great restaurant recommendations and reservations for us - even getting us a table on a terrace overlooking the fiesta fireworks on the beach with an hour's notice - impressive! Nice finishing touches like coming in late at night to see tea light candles lit all around the flowers in the lobby, chilling our wine for us, and even lending us their corkscrew. On arriving home there was an e-mail waiting for us to say my husband's mobile had been left in the room (oops), and it arrived here in the UK 3 days later, impressed us further. I believe if you make sure to ask for a refurbed room, you won't stay in a better hotel in Barcelona for the price.

<Content>Will come back Just came back from a wonderful trip: Spain, US and Mexico. I must say that starting in Spain was the best idea. They treated us so well, the staff through out the hotel was extremely friendly. Our room did not have a great view at all, but we were not looking for that. The bed, bathroom and little entrance area were so clean and well decorated, not too flashy.I must say the toiletries were excellent.All in all, will definitively go back next time we are in Barcelona.

<Content>A grand disappointment We visited the hotel from June 11-14, 2007. We were very disappointed with the quality of this hotel. We booked it based upon the reviews on this site. I expected a high quality boutique hotel and it turned out to be a high- priced (198 euros per night+ tax), run down establishment. The hallways were dimly lighted. The hallways and room carpeting were stretched and stained. The walls were banged up and we had a view of the adjoining buildings' roof tops. The furniture was old. The bed was more like a cot with a pad on the top than a bed. The location is great and the staff is friendly, but the facility is definitely not as advertised. Although it tainted our first visit to Barcelona, we could not change hotels since there was a large convention in town and all of the better hotels were booked. If you're looking for a nice, clean hotel, this is not the one for you!

<Content>Amazing!! My husband and I visited Barcelona in June 2007, and stayed at the Montecarlo. This hotel exceeded our expectations on every level. As we checked in at the front desk, the friendly staff (who spoke perfect english) informed us that we would be upgraded to a nicer room. We booked through a travel site and got a great rate, but our room had a jacuzzi tub and separate shower. The bathroom was marble, and bigger than many rooms I have stayed in while travelling in Europe!Throughout my stay, the Montecarlo front desk staff helped with suggestions (and reservations) for dinner. They suggested a fantastic restaurant for paella that will forever be a memory. This hotel is in an ideal location, but it can be a bit noisy on Las Ramblas. I am a very light sleeper so I brought ear plugs just in case and was pleased to have them.I would definitely recommend this hotel. It made my Barcelona experience!

<Content>Absolutely the best We stayed at the MonteCarlo in late May/early June and it was much better than even the best reviews suggest. One review below suggests that the work on the 2nd floor was disturbing - we found it wasn't noticable at all. Moreover, the room, the staff, and the location were outstanding. The hotel is at a perfect location, at the point where Las Ramblas goes from fun/lively to sophisticated, with great tapas bars within close walking distance. Our room was on the 4th floor, facing Las Ramblas. It was a deluxe room (well worth the extra money, although I imagine even the least expensive room was outstanding). What made this so outstanding was the staff - they were great. All in all, this well exceeded even our expectations.

<Content>Just great! This hotel is in the middle of it all. It is not just close to La Rambla, when the lobby door opens, you are in La Rambla. There is a metro stop one block to your left, and the big metro and train stop underneathe Plaza Catalunyia one block to your right. The rooms are very large for the european standards and large enough for the american standards, they are also clean, silent and the windows seals all the light out. The staff is very professional, proper, correct and helpful. They have a nice breakfast for a few bucks. The staff told us to call if any noise disturbed us, because they are remodeling the second floor, but we never heard a hammer. For euro 200 per day, this hotel is a bargain. We paid more for another room that does not compare to this. This hotel is underrated, they are missing one or two stars. You want to know if we will stay there again? Yes, definitely.

<Content>it depends... I loved this hotel when I stayed here a year ago with my partner. I thought it was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in, and the price was excellent for Barcelona, the quality of the place, and the location. Now I'm not so sure anymore.I was on the third floor, and the renovations on the second were infernally noisy. Yes, they said they'd stop if it bothered me but surely they wouldn't suspend everything for the 5 days I stayed here. Not a big deal if you're out during the day (the work goes from 9 to 6) but if you're planning to spend quality time inside, not pleasant.Last time we had a room with a view of the Ramblas, which was great and quiet. This time, I had a room with no view whatsoever, only looking across a narrow space at another room, and as an earlier reviewer said, there's very little natural light because the top is covered. This made the room very dark and depressing. I would certainly not want to stay in this kind of room again. It may be that this is only the case for single rooms though, so if you're travelling with a companion, it may not be a problem.The third issue is the one that bothered me the most, and probably means that I will never stay here again. When I wanted to bring a friend, who was staying at another hotel, up to my room so he could check his email, the reception desk staff told me I was not allowed to have visitors. He said the little slip you sign at check-in said so on the back. I went up and checked (with my friend waiting downstairs), and indeed, it said that for security, no visitors were allowed. Many hotels have a similar policy, except it's usually something along the lines of visitors must be accompanied by guests at all times. I find it completely unacceptable that a hotel would forbid its guests to have visitors, not to mention very embarrassing for the guest who has to make his visitor wait downstairs. But again, whether this is a problem, depends: if you're not going to have visitors, you won't be bothered by this unfriendly policy.Of course, the hotel still has many positive features. The rooms are nice, the breakfast is actually good value at 9 Euros, and most of the people at the reception desk are very friendly and helpful.So altogether, Hotel Montecarlo is a mixed bag and I can certainly no longer recommend it without reservations.

<Content>Convenient and Friendly There have been many positive reviews of this hotel so my purpose in adding to their number is simply to contribute a couple of topical points.Firstly, we would agree with everything favourable written about the hotel. We had a great stay.Secondly, there has been some renovation taking place in the hotel. During our stay the second floor was sealed off in its entirety. That said ,we were not at all inconvenienced and there was no early morning chorus of hammering nor clouds of dust to contend with.Thirdly, what friendly staff! Genuinely eager to please, helpful and informative.Finally...before our short trip I was worried because the hotel's name did not appear amongst the recommended hotels in the guidebooks we had brought with us - Rough Guide and Dorling Kindersley. I cannot understand why this should be - unless the other hotels in town are of such matchless quality that the Montecarlo pales in comparison. I don't think so.Be guided by the positive reviews found on Trip Advisor and stay at The Montecarlo when in Barcelona. Clean, friendly, convenient and with breakfasts to die for.

<Content>professional staff, quality hotel We spent 4 nights here in late May, third floor front room on the Ramblas. At the time of the stay the third floor had already been renovated, the second was in the midst of renovation, and then they will renovate the 4th and 5th floors. The first floor has a large conference or public room but no guest rooms. I note that the previous reviewer was required to sign a form stating that he understood renovation was ongoing. On the other hand, we were told that if the work bothered us they would immediately stop all work on the room below us. We were always out of the hotel during the day, so it wasn't a problem, but since renovation is likely to be ongoing for months, I recommend people try to stay on renovated floors away from the ongoing work.I did not see inside any rooms on non-renovated floors, but I walked down the hall way on the fifth floor to reach the solarium, and the carpet was very warn. If this is an example of what the rooms themselves look like on the non-renovated floors, I would again recommend keeping with the renovated rooms.We were a little nervous about possible noise in a room directly above the Ramblas, so asked to see a variety of rooms. I have never in my life had hotel staff so willing to show us so many rooms, all on the 3rd floor. I would say the footprint of the rooms were all about the same square footage, large for a European 4 star hotel, and very large for Barcelona. The main difference is the size of the Jacuzzi, and thus the bathroom. The room we ended up accepting, on the Ramblas (and with double doors, each double paned, noise from the Ramblas is a non-issue), had a vast Jacuzzi, and thus probably a third of the room consisted of the bathroom. Another room we were shown had a bathtub that was so small I couldn't possibly see how to get in, or more importantly, out of it. As a result the bathroom was small and the bedroom thus much larger than the bedroom portion of our room. Why in such a huge room would you have a half-bath tub? Weird. And weird also was our swimming pool of a Jacuzzi. It took an immense amount of water to half-fill the thing, and there was a long, and I mean long, set of instructions explaining how to work the thing. Despite both of us reading the instructions out loud to the other, we couldn't get it to work, and when someone arrived to explain it they couldn't get it to work either. Not a problem, but a tad odd. Also odd was the selection of furnishings which ranged from typical 4 star hotel nice wood head board and side board to a lamp that even Ikea would have found cheap which you turned on by yanking the electrical cord!But these are nits. The temperature controls, window coverings and lighting allowed one complete control over the environment, and housekeeping did a very professional job throughout our stay. The room included a table with nice chairs, plenty of reading lights and even a pocket door that you could close in the hallway between the bathroom and bedroom where you could read without disturbing someone sleeping. There is one computer with not very good free internet access in the lobby and a fair selection of international papers. The common seating area is comfortable though rather corporate. I found the solarium rather odd, since it is just an unfinished portion of the roof with an outdoor shower, and the hours are oddly short, 11:00 AM to 7:00 PM.But the area where this hotel really stood out was the professionalism of the staff. Our demands were limited to seeing endless room at check in, having our boarding passes printed the night before we left, borrowing umbrellas, getting wine bottles opened and chilled and receiving explanations of how to reach a couple of destinations. They handled all of these requests very well, and each time we returned to the hotel they remembered our room number. But what really impressed me was the unbelievable range of requests guests threw at them during our stay. A problem back at the office continued to plague my trip, so I spent way too long at that one computer off the lobby. One simply awful young woman demanded that staff find her a rental car to get to her next destination, some resort a couple of hours away. Loudly announcing in her US english that money was not a concern, merely that they find an agency to deliver the car to her and that would allow her to drop the car at the resort. Cheerfully the front desk wrote down this request and began making calls. Hours later when I again sat myself in front of the computer and the woman returned from her day shopping in Barcelona (huge number of expensive bags in tow) and asked about the arrangements, they were able to assure her that the car would arrive the next morning at the requested time, she merely needed to provide her credit card for the reservation. Upon hearing the price ($275 for a 2 or 3 day car rental) she told them to cancel it, it was way above her budget, and instead get her train reservations. I would have hit her (which is one reason why I'm a lawyer and not in the hospitality industry), but they were as pleasant and professional as could be. Another woman was in tears as I sat at the terminal while the desk explained that they had no reservation under her name and the hotel was full for the night. She then admitted that she had never actually received a confirmation from the hotel, but that since she had sent an email and they hadn't actually said no, she assumed...They couldn't have been nicer. They asked her 20 questions about exactly what she wanted in a hotel, what price she was willing to pay  then called and found her a room. They then called her a cab! It got so that every time I returned to the hotel room from my awful battles at the computer trying to solve the office problems I would have at least one story of the incredible people at the front desk. If only they could have solved my office problems with the same smile  attention to detail they afforded each and every request that came past the front desk!

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stayed at the MonteCarlo Hotel for two nights May 2  3.We have stayed at numerous hotels throughout the world and I must say this was one of the most enjoyable at any price. The decor of the rooms was great, we had a balcony room overlooking La Ramblas which had double glazed windows and heavy curtains so it was silent and dark if you wanted to sleep. In addition we had a separate sitting area with TV and a fantastic usuable bathroom with spa bath. The location of this hotel is ideal for a first time traveller to Barcelona, but what impressed me most was the attention and commitment of the staff to ensure we enjoyed our stay. The breakfast was great value for money at a cost of 9 euros each (i think).We would not hesiate to stay here again and highly recommend this as a hotel of great value for money. It is certainly not 5 start in it's facilities, but it is for service and experience. Don't forget a visit to the roof top terrace where the views are breathtaking and all over Barcelona.If you judge your hotels on pure value, this is it!! I would prefer this hotel to most 5 star hotels I've stayed at.

<Content>Location and comfort The Montecarlo is close to public transportation, restaurants, and also within walking distance of enough tourist attractions to keep you busy for at least a day. You could probably spend half a day just people-watching on Las Ramblas where the hotel is located. The staff was friendly and accommodating and efficient. The property was very clean and well maintained. Our room was most comfortable and had many features/amenities that added to the comfort level. Those I can remember: individual reading lamps in bed; internet connection in room; electric window shades; adjustable bed (2 sides); lots of pillows; turndown service; evening chocolate; view of courtyard; room away from street; jacuzzi bath; room safe; digital thermostat to control heating/cooling; CD player; radio; plenty of closet space; shower/tub; magnifying mirror; free Internet service near lobby; bar near lobby; refrigerator in room.Breakfast is available on premises from 7:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. at an additional price of 9E. A wide range of items are available from the breakfast buffet and the breakfast waitstaff is friendly and efficient.

<Content>Very dissappointing I had booked this room based on the glowing reviews from this site and I have to say I was very dissappointed. I had booked our rooms directly with the hotel. When we arrived they couldn't find our reservation and the hotel was nearly full. We eventually did get a room but not the room we had agreed to. We did get a slight discount but again this was not what I had expected. First of all the room we were in was very dated and needed some updating. Not what you would expect from a hotel of this calibre. The room also needed some cleaning. I sensed this was a room that was used as a last resort and understandably so. The noise level from La Rambla kept us up much of the night . A very bad experience. We requested another room but they couldn't accomodate us so we went across the street to the Hotel 1898 for the remainder of our stay in Barcelona and the experience there was much better.

<Content>A hotel of enduring quality I stayed at the Hotel Monte Carlo in 1993 and even back then can echo everything I've read recently. It is rewarding to know that such a great hotel has such consistency providing great accomodations and value over a span of 14 years. Amazing!

<Content>Loved it!! We stayed at the Montecarlo for three nights. We booked directly through the Hotel's website and got a fantastic room with a balcony overlooking Las Ramblas. With the double double-glazed doors closed, almost all street noise was removed so light sleepers shoiuld not be put off. The beds were very comfortable and the jacuzzi bath was great, particularly after a long day of sight-seeing. Breakfast was not included in our deal but it is certainly worth the extra nine euros- the freshly squeezed orange juice is too good to be missed and the selection of hot and cold dishes is excellent. Location is perfect for getting around the Barri Gotic, El Raval, La Ribera etc and Placa Catalunya is only one hundred metres away. Staff were all amazingly helpful and polite- among the best I have ever encountered.

<Content>A friendly oasis on La Ramblas The staff was amazing--from our first email contact to the enthusiastic desk clerk who hailed a taxi to the airport. The hotel was an oasis in the busiest, most crowded section of town--quiet and convenient. and the breakfast was marvelous--did i mention the chocolate croissants and the cafe con leche? highly recommended!

<Content>Fantastic retreat Just returned from a thoroughly enjoyable 4 nights at the Hotel Montecarlo and wanted to echo the other positive reviews on this site. We booked the hotel direct via its website and found the prices better than a lot of those offered by generic agency websites.Arrived late on the Friday to a warm welcome and a complimentary bottle of Cava (for our anniversary). The room (Gracia/Superior) was great, with comfortable adjustable bed, luxurious marble bathroom with power shower and jacuzzi bath, separate lounge and entrance hall - All the facilities you would expect from a 4 star hotel with a lot of the touches you would associate with a 5 or above. (For example the proper hairdryer in the bathroom!)The hotel is very quiet both in terms of not seeing any other guests, but also being well sound proofed from the Rambla. It's a fantastic retreat from the noise and crowds of the street.One minor negative: on checking-in we were advised of building work taking place on the second floor (Pre-season stuff, only in the afternoons) and we were told that should there be any disturbance to call reception and they would move the builders onto another part of the building. Needless to say we were initially very sceptical and assumed the worse, however we didn't get disturbed whatsoever during our stay. (Having sampled the quality of service I have no doubts that the staff would indeed have moved the workers on!)

<Content>Yet another 5 star review for the Montecarlo! I booked this hotel based on the reviews and was not disappointed. I just looked over the last few dozen of those reviews and they're dead on.I was nevous given the picture on the hotel web site, but our rooms (512 and 513) were much nicer then the pictures.Location: On Las Ramblas and Portaferissa, about 100 yards south of Placa Catalunya (transport hub including 4 metro lines, airport bus and tourist buses) next to the Gothic quarter and 400 yards from the Cathedral.Room: stunningly modern; great cabinets, fixtures, bathrooms. The double glass doors DO eliminate the noise from the ramblas (though if a balcony is important to you, go with the 3rd or 4th floors the 5th floor has really just floor to ceiling sliding glass doors).we thougtht breakfast was stylish and worth experiencing; other days we got bread, cheese and ceral from the supermarket across the street.theres no coffee in the room and if you're morning people it could be hard to find a cup before 9 (and its that thick European coffee) I brought No-Doz. Theres a Burger King and a Mcdonalds at the top of the Ramblas.I don't know much about fine dining -- we ate prety cheap -- The Attic -- 20 yards south of the hotel -- was good with entres between 10 and 14 euros, and theres plenty of fast food on Las Ramblas. The Boqueria Market (70 yards south) has all sorts of fresh fruit and cheese and is also worth seeing as a tourist attraction. Fresc Co is a chain (6 of them in Barcelona) that has a salad/pizza/pasta bar. -- theres one near the Museo Picasso, one north of Placa Catalunya and one a block and a half west of the hotel.teenage girl shopping: the south eastern edge of Placa Catalunya, Porta d'angel (parallel to Las Ramblas, between Placa Catalunya and Portaferissa, and Portaferissa between Las Ramblas and Port d Angele mail me with questions: pcatalan@nycap.rr.comhave a ball!

<Content>Great hotel We had a very pleasant stay at this hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was a standard double, was very clean, quiet and the beds were sooooo comfortable, also the en-suite was a good size and had everything we needed. Breakfast was excellent value at 9 euros per person, plenty of choice and most diets catered for. The location could not have been better for getting around Barcelona. We would definately stay here next time we visit.

<Content>Wonderful hotel We chose this hotel based on reviews on this board. Not speaking the language, a great front desk was key. Everyone who worked there was helpful but most of all so pleasant and sweet. They booked restaurant reservations via email from us. They gave us a standard room with a balcony overlooking La Rambla although they only said they'd try for a room like this since it's the more expensive ones that guarantee a balcony. With windows closed, there was no noise from the street. The room was spotless and had a very comfortable bed controlled electronically separately on both sides. The location was perfect. It's near several metro stations, in walking distance to many sites and literally around the corner from the gothic quarter. We found the breakfast very nice and in a lovely setting. It was the perfect hotel experience for us.

<Content>This hotel spoiled us! The four nights in this hotel spoiled us. What a great way to start our vacation and I agree with the other reviewers. Quique and the others gave us excellent service, a wonderful introduction to the city and some good meal recommendations. Opening up the patio doors, stepping outside and looking down on Las Ramblas was totally cool. The bed was so comfortable and this was probably the first time in my many European trips where I actually slept through the nights. My family was addicted to the Jacuzzi tub. Trip Advisor comes through again!

<Content>Totally lived up to our expectations What an excellent hotel! - from the moment we arrived, the staff couldn't do enough for you. We were lucky enough to get a room with a balcony (ask for a high floor so you can get the best view of La Rambla and beyond) and it was luxuriously appointed with a Jacuzzi bath, adjustable beds, mini bar and a sound system. Towelling robes and slippers are also provided for guests comfort, and the bathrooms have hairdryers and a good range of complimentary toiletries.The sheets and towels are changed daily, and although the rate I got did not include breakfast my friend and I decided to treat ourselves;at 9 euros each it was plentiful, delicious and well worth the money.I was sceptical before arriving about the hotel's claim that the rooms were virtually soundproof - being that the hotel is situated on the busiest thoroughfare in Barcelona, but this is certainly the case.I would recommend that even if your room is not on the top floor you should take the lift to the 5th floor and walk up the short flight of stairs to the roof terrace - the views in all directions are stunning.I'm going back to the hotel next year with a larger group of friends,and although you can find cheaper accommodation in the city I feel its certainly worth the extra to stay at the Montecarlo.If you only have a short time to spend in City, I would thoroughly recommend you visit the Sagrada Familia - it's quite simply breathtaking. Also, on the far side of the Plaza de Catalunia is a street called the Passieg de Gracia - the shops are fabulous, and you can see two of Gaudi's famous landmark buildings ( La Pedrera and Casa Batllo). Enjoy!!

<Content>One of the best hotels I've stayed in! We just got back from a 4 night stay in Hotel Montecarlo, which had to be one of the best hotels I've stayed in. The location on Las Ramblas was perfect for seeing all the sights. For its location, the prices was more than reasonable (we found a deal on the hotel website). The staff was probably the nicest, most accommodating hotel staff I've ever encountered, from the front desk to the breakfast staff. Speaking of breakfast, extremely delicious, lots of variety, and some of the best coffee I've ever had in my life! Oh, can't forget to mention the fresh squeezed oj they bring to you when you sit down. Free internet access service in the lobby, your beds turned down, large jacuzzi bathtub and chocolates on your pillows....what more could you ask for???

<Content>In the heart of Barcelona! We stayed two nights at the Montecarlo with another couple as a prelude to a cruise. The hotel was a great value, but what we most appreciated was the great location and the helpful hints from the hotel staff. We really only had a day and a half to see the city - by staying at the Montecarlo we were able to get the most out of our time. We highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>A Great Location! We loved our stay at the Hotel Montecarlo! Perfect location right on Las Ramblas. I was worried about noise from the street, but it was no problem at all when we shut the windows/doors. We had a terrace and could enjoy a glass of wine while watching the entertaining pedestrians below! The hotel staff was very friendly and every resturant recommendation was perfect. We'll definitely stay there again!

<Content>Great Hotel Just returned from a 4 night stay ( 7 to 11 Dec) and loved our time at the hotel. I read the reviews on this site and I cancelled a booking for elsewhere in Barcelona and was not dissapointed. My wife and I loved our room (311), which overlooked Las Ramblas, we sat outside with a glass of wine and enjoyed people watching and the street theatre. We would recommend this hotel and its staff. Our booking included breakfast so make sure your rate includes for this.

<Content>Fantastic stay at the MonteCarlo We went to Barcelona for our first anniversary and stayed at the Monte Carlo. We stayed in a lovely room with our own jacuzzi.. which was great. The room overlooked the la Ramblas yet we were never disturbed by the hustle and bustle of the city.There are lots of cafes nearby and the Barcelona market is only 100 metres down the street. The location is great. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in Barcelona.

<Content>MonteCarlo quiet oasis on a busy street Date Oct 28, 2006We stayed only one night at the Hotel Montecarlo but would certainly be comfortable here for a week or longer. The staff is attentive, helpfull and polite. The rooms were quiet and clean. Even though the hotel is located directly on busy Las Rambles it is very quiet inside. There is an elevator to take you and your luggage to your floor.The Hotel is centrally located within walking distance to many areas of interest. The staff recommended Ciutat Condal located just North of Placa de Catalunya for an evening meal of tapas and it was a wonderful experience. There is a supermarket Carrefour located across the street from the hotel that is handy. Even though this was a short stay we would stay here again.

<Content>The Very Best We stayed at Hotel Monte Carlo on the northern part of Las Ramblas, and therefore within walking distance of everything. I had splurged on a room with a Jacuzzi because I can get my husband to do almost any amount of shopping and sightseeing if he knows there is a Jacuzzi bath for him at the end of the day (we honestly walked well over 30 miles in three days, the poor guy). The room was lovely and included a bedroom, a small living area and a huge bathroom. As nice as the room was, it was nothing compared to the level of service from the staff who were universally kind and attentive. I usually do not return to the same hotel just because I like to try something different, but when I return to Barcelona, I will go nowhere other than the Hotel Monte Carlo.

<Content>Lovely hotel, great location, reputation well-deserved We just finished spending a week at the Hotel Montecarlo and loved every minute of it. Our room overlooked La Rambla, which meant that if we wanted to enjoy the street scene we could--but the double windows meant that we could also completely shut out the noise.Our room was comfortable, large enough, and spotless. The hotel breakfast can be skipped--but there are lots of cafes nearby and the Barcelona market is only 100 metres down the street and that's a great place to have coffee and a croissant--or even bacon and eggs. The location is great. It's close enough both to L'Eixample on the one hand and the waterfront on the other so that we were able to walk most of the places we wanted to see.The staff lived up to its reputation for being attentive. We arrived at the hotel without our luggage and they did everything they could--calling the airlines several times a day--to track it down and ensure that it arrived. We hope to be able to stay here again.

<Content>Excellent choice in Barcelona We just returned from Barcelona on Nov. 04. We stayed in Hotel Montecarlo for three days and felt so welcome and warm from the Hotel every time when we were back to the Hotel after a long stroll in town. The hotel location is excellent, right in the middle of the old town, and there is a big supermarket, Carrefour, right across the Hotel, which makes everything convenient. There are only 3-minute walking distance from Placa De Catalunya. The Hotel staff is rated absolutely 5-star. They are very helpful and warm from the start to the end of our stay. There are only less than 60 rooms in this Hotel so an early reservation is needed. They deserve every penny of the price.

<Content>very pleased with this hotel We were really pleased with the Montecarlo. It is very conveniently located and the entrance and ground floor are charming. The staff at reception were very helpful, particularly when we unexpectedly had to extend our stay from 4 nights to 7 due to an unfortunate accident. The room, although it had no view, was very comfortable and completely quiet, despite the hotel's location on a busy street - La Rambla. There is a charming roof top from which we watched fireworks. The breakfast was excellent, although, at 15 euros, a lttle expensive (as hotel breakfasts often are).

<Content>A big gem of a little hotel! My husband and I stayed at this hotel from 18-24th of Sept. 2006.We loved the positon of the hotel in Las Ramblas, right in the middle of the action!You could walk to the sights, great shopping at the Passeig de Gracia... a great place from where to explore the city.The hotel facade is so pretty that tourists frequently stop and take pictures, especially at night.The room itself was furnished very well. It was a mini suite, very roomy with a big, comfortable bathroom. It had a jacuzzi tub/shower and a bidet.All is great at this hotel but the greatest thing was our BED!!! It was the most comfortable, the best bed I have ever slept in all my life! That coming from a veritable Princess (as in Princess and the Pea!)This bed was to die for. It was one of those adjustable beds where you could lift the top of the bed, the bottom of the bed, and adjust it to everywhere in between. Each side of the bed is completely adjustable! Not only that, the mattress was not too hard, not too soft, it was just right!The sheets were just the right softness, not too starchy, and the pillows were incredible. I wanted to ship home the whole kit and caboodle! The sheets, the pillows, the adjustable bed, everything!I was ready to trade in my Tempurpedic bed at home to get this particular bed and sheets. I tried to figure out which manufacturer made the sheets but they were unmarked. I did buy the best sheets at El Corte Ingles but they were not as good.(I got to try them out at home later.)I couldn't wait to get into the gloriousness of this bed every night.It was unbelievably good. Needless to say, everything else about Barcelona followed ensuite.The best restaurants-La Barceloneta and Botafumiero.Don't waste your money on Jean Luc Figueras, that was a total waste of 200+ Euros. We couldn't get into Huffman at all.Remember to ask for the adjustable bed when you book!Look no further, this is the best moderately priced hotel in Barcelona!

<Content>Exactly as everyone said Just back last night from a great 4 day trip to Barcelona. First time there and hopefully not the last! Fantastic time to celebrate wifes birthday and weather and sights magnificent.Hotel Montecarlo is exactly as previous reviewers have said. Great location, fantastic Staff and a great room with a Balcony overlooking Las Ramblas-but great windows to keep out the noise. Jacuzzi, seperate sitting room, Dressing gowns etc-a lot of great touches make it a great place to stay! Booked directlly with Hotel and got a good rate.-not the cheapest but well worth it!!

<Content>Excellent hotel!!! We stayed two nights in the Hotel Monte Carlo and it was a wonderful experience. Besides location, location, location; it had the most friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful staff. They helped us with our travel arrangements and allowed us to store part of our luggage there while we went to Southern Spain for several days as we realized there would not be enough room for all our luggage. The rooms were clean and comfortable, but the staff made our stay one of the best on our two week trip. I look forward to staying there again!

<Content>A gem of a hotel Booked this hotel on recommendations from previous reviewers and was not disappointed. As it was our 30th wedding anniversary we treated ourselves to 4 nights in a Sarria de luxe room overlooking La Rambla. Very comfortable room with lovely bathroom. As others have said, La Rambla is very noisy but once double sliding doors are closed it really is very quiet. All of the staff were helpful and courteous. What more can I say - we would stay again!

<Content>Excellent Hotel We have just returned from the Hotel Montecarlo in Barcelona. We went to celebrate my 40th birthday. The hotel was beautiful to look at as we arrived and we were not disappointed with the inside. The hotel staff were very friendly and attentive, after arriving in our room we received a bottle of Cava and chocolate truffles from the management to celebrate my birthday. The room was excellent, we had a balcony overlooking La Rambla, lovely bedroom with comfortable bed, small lounge and fantastic bathroom with jaccuzi and large shower. The hotel was very clean, lovely white fluffy towels, bathrobes and slippers.We really enjoyed Barcelona and would recommend the Tourist Bus, one day costs 18 euros and two days 22 euros. We only had breakfast once in the hotel and there was plenty of choice and the staff were friendly. The other mornings we had breakfast at one of the many street cafes which was just as enjoyable.Thank you to all the staff at Hotel Montecarlo for making my 40th birthday treat so special.

<Content>Montecarlo, Barcelona-Decent hotel I have just returned from my vacation to Barcelona, Spain. After thoroughly researching hotels in the area I decided to book with the Montecarlo, which based on reading other reviews, met my expectations. The hotel lobby was very nice, the room was small but clean and we had a great view of las rambla from our balcony. The location of the hotel was great since we were right in the center of the area, most of what we wanted to do and see was within walking distance. Generally the front desk staff were very helpful with suggestions for where to eat and go out etc. We never ate at the hotel since there were so many options so close by so I can't comment on the food there.The only dissapointment with the hotel was the Internet access which was limited-I was never able to open or send any emails from my hotmail account. Also remember to bring your own travel iron as the hotel does not have one.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel, Incredibly Helpful Staff You can read all about this hotel -- its comfortable rooms, great value, location -- and I completely agree. We stayed for 3 nights in early August and loved it. I can't wait to get back to Barcelona and I'll be staying at the Hotel Montecarlo again.But what the reviews don't quite capture is how thoroughly welcoming and helpful and warm the hotel staff is, day and night. After 2 nights at the hotel, we were off to the airport for our return home. At the gate to board our first flight, to London Heathrow, the flight information suddenly disappeared and we were told to reclaim our checked luggage and go back in line for another flight. Well, this turned out to be the morning of the London raid on terrorists. Our flight to London (and then home from there) was not going to happen. With two young children, we decided to leave the chaos of the airport and head back to the safe haven of this lovely hotel and its lovely staff.They were, again, welcoming and helpful and concerned for us. They put us in the same rooms, at the same deeply discounted rate we had booked through their website. They directed us to travel agents, and I was able to use their lobby computer for website searching for a flight home. In a very stressful time, in an unfamiliar city far from home, the people at Hotel Montecarlo made us feel that we had a safe place to be and there were people who cared.

<Content>Fabulous stay! Comfortable, close to the fun! After touring Spain for a week it was a wonderful treat to stay in such a comfortable, quiet, happening place. The beds were fabulous and so was the bedding! We had a room overlooking Las Ramblas which is a very noisy place. However, the double-paned, double doored sliding doors worked like a charm. We heard no noise coming off the street. Our room was very nicely appointed and the AC was perfect. The weather was over 100 degrees each day so we really needed the relief from the heat.The Front Desk clerks were always super friendly, available, and knowlegible about the places we wanted to visit. There was never a backup. They all spoke English very, very well.The plumbing was quiet and the amenities were definitely four star. They can't get a higher rating because there is no restaurant and no pool but, hey, I was so very, very comfortable and food was VERY available on Las Ramblas that those weren't issues for me.I'd highly recommend staying on Las Ramblas because it's such a happening place. Yes, I held my purse close to me at all times but I did that everywhere in Spain. I loved all the fun street performers at all hours of the day or night. It was the best show in town for just a few euros in tips!We ate at a WONDERFUL tapas place called La Lluna that is about a block away. It is open only for lunch but at about 12 euros a person it is not only a fabulous deal but the BEST meal we had in Spain. The hop-on-hop-off bus was disappointing. It was very, very hot on the top of the bus and the lines were so long you didn't really want to get off. I felt it didn't really go very close to anything but the Gaudi houses which is maybe 1/2 hour of the tour, the rest of the 1.5 hours of the drive on the red line is just driving up and down to drop people at the different stops that are a block or more away so you really couldn't take a peek while you were on the bus. I would say that it was worth doing but do it only for one day. Once the summer lines slow down it might be fine.Due to the location on this busy street the taxi drivers have to drop you off across from the hotel. It wasn't a problem for my friend and I since we only had one bag each. We didn't have to walk far at all. However, if you're traveling with more bags than you can carry yourself you might rethink staying here.I LOVED this hotel and would go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>Great hotel, horrible location First time to Barcelona for hubby and I. Liked the Hotel Monte Carlo - modern entrance, staff excellent, large rooms. However, I hated the location. La Rambla is filled with pickpockets, theives and gypsies...I hated being on that street. I noticed pickpockets stand outside the doors of the hotel and follow guests out...It was pretty scary. If you like safety, I would highly recommend a hotel on the Gran Via Passieg de la Gracia - the big street with all the expensive stores. My husband and I felt very safe dining and shopping there. No pickpockets in site! Besides the location, I found our washroom not to be cleaned well (hair all over the floor upon arrival!). I didn't like that at all. However, the rooms were large and the adjustable beds were amazing! I want to buy one for home now! So there were some pros and cons. Nice hotel, but next time, I would spend a bit more money to stay in a safer area. I guess it's personal preference...

<Content>Right in the heart of the city this hotel was peaceful and friendly but completely convenient. Staff were always friendly and helpful and all spoke english.We were fortunate enough to get an upgraded room and it had a range of extras from electrically operated beds to a jakuzzi bath.On arrival we were provided with a map and shown how to get to the main points of interest for us, service was discreet but constant. The location was second to none.

<Content>Exceeded our expectations. I have to agree with all the positive reviews. From the time of our arrival until the end of our 3 night stay ( 06/14-06/17) in Barcelona could not find anything negative to say about the place. Fantanstic location near the top of La Rambla, near plaza Cataluniya (sorry for the spelling), probably the best location possible, for us. Great room with a little balcony facing La Rambla, more like a suite, really, with a foyer, small living area and a huge bathroom w/ jacuzzi. 4 sets of dual glazed aluminum sliding doors blocking all the noise, not 2 as many reviews stated. In-room safe, minibar, sweet wine and chocolates on our arrival. The room was basic but charming. Everything we needed steps away, including Starbucks. Barcelona is a gorgeous and safe city. Charm and atmosphere at least on par with places like Rome. No purse snatching or pickpocket incidents to report. Great restaurants which are reasonably priced. In smaller shops on La Rambla (basically a tourist center) always ask about the price before you buy, or chances are you will be overcharged. Agree on the price with taxi drivers before you get in. Our cab driver decided to overcharge us 10 euros on a way back to the airport. There were 4 euros on the meter when we got in, plus he wanted 7 euros surcharge for our 3 bags. About 10 euros more than what we paid on the way to the hotel. And no matter what, STAY AWAY from money exchange booths on La Rambla, especially the two which are located to the right of the hotel, on the same side of the street, on the way to Plaza Catalunya. The posted exchange rate in columns 1 and 2, already a little high, is misleading, since it only refers to sums of 6,000 euros or larger. Exchange rate for smaller sums is typically in small hard to see letters which refer to columns (typically 3, 4, or 5) with higher rates. In one of the places I mentioned the lady wanted to charge me 18% commission which she immediately agreed to reduce to 5%. I would not pay 5% and moved on to the one next door, a little closer to the hotel. In that exchange booth I pointed to the column which indicated $1.33 per euro and asked if that is the rate and if it included the commission. The lady at the counter said yes. The official exchange rate that day was $ 1.259 per 1 euro. But when I handed her $ 300 she exchanged it at $1.42 per 1 euro. After my immediate protests, she refused to return my $300 (she probably already spent $ 30 she ripped off from me in her mind), pointing to the column which indicated $ 1.58 per 1 euro, saying she gave me $1.42 rate instead of $ 1.58 as a favor. Small writing behind her (you couldn't even see it when she was sitting down) indicated that column to apply for exchanges under 6,000 euros. I decided not to get ripped off on principle and was able to get my money back with the help of 2 policemen which were passing by. The only reason I got my money back was that $ 1.42 per 1 euro rate did not appear in any column. The best rate I could get in Barcelona was $ 1.33 per 1 euro, including commission, from a bank. My worst experiences in exchanging currency were in Spain, particularly in Barcelona. Overall, the people are nice and there is plenty to see and do in that beautiful city.

<Content>Everyone is Royalty at the Hotel Montecarlo My wife and I spent two very short days and nights at the Hotel Montecarlo. It is a beautiful hotel. The front desk personnel were wonderful. They pointed us in the right direction everytime. They even met my request for a restaurant that was not touristy but was a restaurant for Spainards. The room was richly appointed. And because it was our Honeymoon they sweetly placed a congratulatory bottle of champagne in our room. The location was perfect, right on La Rambla and everything was within walking distance. I will definitely stay here again when I visit Barcelona

<Content>Lovely Friendly Hotel The hotel Montecarlo is perfectly positioned for the centre of Baracelona being halfway down the Ramblas, ideal for shopping, sight seeing and Port Vell. We arrived very late as due a thunderstorm we were rerouted to Gerona airport. The hotel upgraded our room as we had had such a bad start to our break! The room was lovely with a jacuzzi bath and motorised bed which could raise your legs or back up. We had a view over a courtyard at the back of the hotel which was lovely and quiet and very pretty. The staff were friendly and helpful at all times (even three in the morning!) and could speak good english. Overall the hotel is modern in style with good facilities, friendly staff all for a very reasonable price (155 euro a night)I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Excellent staff and service We stayed at the Hotel Montecarlo at the beginning of our week in Euope and at the end of our trip. The front desk was so accomodating and friendly. Both times our rooms were spotless and the beds were extremely comfortable. Even though it is located on Los Ramblas, it was quiet. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!!!!!

<Content>Loved this hotel Thankyou Trip advisor In February I went to trip advisor site to check out some hotels I could book through my Cruise line post cruise. I am so glad I did because all of the hotels got poor reviews and they were all pricey.I found the highest rated hotel on the site was the Montecarlo on La Rambla. I immediately tried to book....3 sites were sold out and I got the last room on a forth site.Pricing was a few Euros less than the other hotels the Cruise line offered.We arrived early staff was lovely and we had a room in less than 20 minutes.The room was more like a mini suite with a huge bathroom and Jaccuzi tub.Since the hotel is on a busy street they have special noiseproof blinds that adjust by remote..They had excellent security and free internet in the lobby. Location is great.This hotel exceeded my expectations.

<Content>Montecarlo almost perfect We booked a saria room, and also requested a quiet room.W e were at the side/back and that was fine, wonderful shutters operated from the beds so kept us quiet and dark easily. The saria was a delight, a lovely little sitting area with a sound system so we bought a CD or two to relax too, great bathroom with jacuzzi bath, small dressing area with hanging space etc.And a decent size bedroom with twin beds that elevated at feet and head. This was perfect for my husband who has arthritic ankles, as was the position of the hotel, near everything. The breakfasts were somewhat expensive and disappointing, bad coffee and lack of fresh fruit, breads etc very good and freshly squeezed orange juice was terrific, so it should be in Spain!We sat and read in in the Grand Salon with its overdecorated 19th C style and Corbusier furniture, a pleasing contrast.The bar was neither here nor there, but we had a brandy on the house and good service at all times.The 2 day bus hop- on -and -hop- off ticket is good value and gives you the lie of the land for return individual trips, we didn't hop and off as the queues were very long, an hour for the first bus, because it was the May bank holiday.Ate at the Seven Doors near the harbour, Okish, at two or three local places in the Ramblas, very relaxing and one big treat at the Casa Calvi. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Expecting too much? After reading all the eulogistic reviews of the Hotel Montecarlo, perhaps we were expecting a little too much of this good (but not fantastic) hotel. We came away a little deflated but well rested after a 3 night stay. Firstly, the positives - The frontdesk staff were attentive, helpful and knowledgable. The room was clean (but see other comments later), the towels and robes very comfortable and the jacuzzi bath good fun. The adjustable bed was very good for elevating the feet after a long walking day. The hotel's position halfway along La Rambla is perfect. Now the disappointments - The room (403) was very small with no dressing table nor mirror, except in the bathroom where it was regularly steamed up. Tea / coffee making facilities would have been nice also. The carpet was very badly marked and stained including several cigarette burns. The furniture was cheap, shoddy and likewise stained. Our window view was of a blank wall 10m away. We asked to be moved and offered to pay for an upgrade but the hotel was full. We paid 190 Euros for the room per night directly booked with the hotel. The bar was very basic, lacked comfort and atmosphere. It was rarely staffed so you had to interupt the frontdesk for service. Here I admit to being ultra-critical and this probably doesn't matter to most people. However, we like to have a relaxing glass of beer or wine at the end of the day and in the evenings.All in all it was a fairly pleasant place to stay (no better than that) and a deluxe room, rather than basic, is definately recommended.

<Content>Nice Hotel, but a few snags .... Nice location. Sorta like staying in Times Square, Catalan style.This is a nice hotel but with some MINOR problems.Had problems with misinformation about internet avilability (this was a business trip). Seems that not ALL rooms have internet (free or paid), and the solo terminal in the lobby has a misfunctional keyboard. Front desk was very enthusiatic if not always very efficient. Bell captain Jordie was verbally rude when forced by front desk to open the Grand Salon which had internet access.I realize most folks won't go here requiring business help (seemed a largely bewildered American cruise clientele) but just in case, be forewarned.We ordered a car through the front desk, two days before departure to go to the airport (thinking shuttle or private car), and got a taxi with 3.75 E already on the meter, and a taxi driver who had no brakes and used the handbrake all the way to the airport.When inquiring for a casual, reasonably priced local cuisine restaurant nearby, the restaurant recommended to us by the front desk QUO VADIS, wound up being very expensive and again, very American, with a vociferous patron demaning that the bar tender make him a Manhattan with lots of damned ice this time.The room was quiet, faced a wall and the beds were good. Walls are paper thin. Decor minimalist.We had fun in between work, strolling the Old Gothic section and enjoying great meals at Can Culleteras and Taller de Tapas; also enjoyed an expensive but once-in-a-lifetime night at the Opera within walking distance of the hotel... the real opera, not the Marx Brothers.No purse snatching incidents to report or witness.Go and have fun! This hotel is fine; just not quite grown-up yet.Maybe go for a pricier room to ensure amenities.PROS-Jacuzzi tubsEnglish speaking front deskGreat locationNice bathrobes and slippersVery clean, if a bit tired (carpet, drapes); maybe just our roomCONSPricey breakfastInternet Issues; don't count on itPoor dining recommendationsPoor front desk communications (we speak Spanish, also)Poor business and airport limo help.Cranky bell captain (who had been liberally tipped the day before)

<Content>Fantastic Great hotel in a great location. Just back from a 3 days stay there and could not recommend it more. The staff are so helpful and just make things easy. It's right in the heart of the city on La Rambla where there is always plenty of life around. The rooms are comfortable and very quiet with the double windows.

<Content>Great Hotel I would agree with the previous reviews, this is the place to stay. Everyone in the hotel tries very hard to please. Excellent location and service. You cannot go wrong staying here. They have even sound proofed the rooms facing the Rambla. We stayed in a room with a balcony facing the Rambla and experienced no noise problems. It was actually nice to see the activity going on below.

<Content>Everything They Say Is True! Just back from a weekend break in Barcelona and we stayed 3 nights at the Montecarlo. We had a Gracia room on the 4th floor at a rate of 224 euro per night (not including breakfast).The hotel is in a fantastic location - right on Las Ramblas and just a quick walk from the centre of the action - Placa Catalunya. Las Ramblas is a just a continuous sea of people, traders, street entertainers and is, iniitally, a little overwhelming. But, step inside the door of Hotel Montecarlo and it's an oasis of calm and silence.The staff are all incredibly friendly and courteous - and they all speak perfect English. Honestly, I've only experienced a similar level of consistent service at a 5-star hotel.The room was huge - large enough sleeping area and a separate seating/lounge room. Two TVs! A CD/FM unit! A jacuzzi in the bathroom! Is this really a 3-star hotel??? Oh - free internet access from each room and an internet-enabled PC in the lobby!Yes...the crack between the 2 beds can be a little annoying but no big deal to be honest. Las Ramblas is a noisy, bustling street but, from the room, we couldn't hear a thing.If you are going to Barcelona - stay at this hotel! It's as good as all the other reviews say!

<Content>Great Hotel and Excellent Location What a great hotel! Just had a fantastic 6 night stay at the Hotel Montecarlo and the staff was very polite and accmmodating. The hotel is located on the busy Las Ramblas, but we did not hear any traffic or street noise from our room. The beds and baths are very nice and very comfortable (had the best sleep of any European hotel). Also, I recommend you ask the staff on restaurant locations as they provided us with great places to eat. You can't go wrong with the Hotel Montecarlo!

<Content>The best hotel I have ever stayed in! I booked this hotel on the strength of reviews on this site, and was not disappointed at all. The hotel is every bit as excellent as people say it is, and the staff could not do enough for us when we arrived for a special occasion. Location is perfect for attractions and transport and like other people I wondered how this could possibly be a 3 star hotel??We were on the 4th floor in a sants room that was facing onto la rambla, so had a balcony to watch the world go by from. There have been comments about noise but the balconies have TWO sets of double glazed doors to shut out noise from the outside world. The only thing we heard was the occasional siren from emergency service vehicles passing by.If I had to find a flaw, the only thing I could come up with is that you may end up in the gap between the two mattresses on the double bed as both sides are adjustable!I also found the night staff to be not as fluent in English as the day staff, but it was better than my Spanish.I will definitely going back as soon as I can..

<Content>Outstanding Hotel The Montecarlo is outstanding. After taking the overnight train from Seville, we arrived at the hotel around 9:30 am. To our surprise, we were able to get a room immediately. The staff spoke excellent English and were extremely professional and helpful, immediately taking care of any request we had. The location couldn't be better, right on Las Ramblas. The room was very spacious with a large bathroom with a jacuzzi tub. For a great light meal,breakfast or lunch, it was great to wander down to the large market and get beautiful large fresh strawberries and wonderful pastries from the vendors.

<Content>Best 3 stars I have ever stayed at How this hotel is only a 3 stars is beyond me. I would say this is more like a 4 star hotel and certainly the best 3 star hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff are very helpful, professional and friendly. The decor is very tasteful, the location is great, the price is very good value, the mini bar was very reasonably priced, the hotel was exceptionally clean and the rooms were very quiet for such a centrally located hotel. I would certainly return to and recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fabulous and relaxing Hotel Just back froma 3 night stay at this lovely Hotel. On entrance it is cool and calming, with very efficient and helpful staff. We were shown to our room, which was at the back of the hotel, with a brilliant view of the cathedral out of our window! The room was very large and airy, with a beautiful marble bathroom, with jacuzzi bath. They provide you with large white fluffy towels, bathrobes and slipper too! The room has queen size twin beds with electric leavers to elevate your legs back etc, the maids came every day to clean and tidy up and during the evening tturn your beds sheets and leave you chocolates!purfect! The reception staff were very friendly anf helpful with recommendations of restaurants etc. Only down side, there were no tea/coffee making facilities (am I being typically british here to expect that?). but this will not deter us from returning!A perfect stay at alovely and relaxing hotel!

<Content>Amazing stay but stay out of the crack in the bed! Nothing to add regarding the location (could it be more central?), staff (amazingly helpful  friendly, all speak perfect English, all willing to go the extra mile with tips, advice, bookings etc) and facilities (free English newspapers in the lobby, internet access, pleasant bar area with the most generous measures I've ever encountered). We paid top whack (EUR 250+)for a deluxe room on the first floor (102) with sitting area, bathroom with posh shower and jacuzzi bath, loo and bidet and a truly massive bed -- though in reality it was two double mattresses on one base, which meant that any Valentine's 'action' was hampered by one party constantly slipping down the crack in the middle if they slipped apart -- with added features such as automatic raise and lower so you could sit up and read or put your feet up. One niggle: both English tv channels (BBC and CNN) didn't work too well so we couldn't watch the news.Didn't ever partake of breakfast as the metal shutters were so effective at blocking out the light that we slept very late every morning but I think 15 euros was a bit steep though places on La Ramblas were not much cheaper; is it me or has Barca become very dear of late?I might try and get a better deal next time and I'd like to see some of the 'basic' rooms to see if they're better value for money but I'd certainly go back

<Content>Very nice - a pleasure We have just returned from a 3 night stay in Barcelona to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. Choose this hotel after seeing previous, postive, reviews. We booked directly with the hotel so paid 155 euros a night - not particularly cheap but having done some research this did seem a fairly average rate for such a central location. The hotel has nice decor - the photos on the website do not exagerate how nice it is. The room we were given was quiet, as we had requested (not facing Las Ramblas) and very nice - especially the bathroom with the jacuzzi bath. The staff were very helpful and even recommended (and booked) a great restaurant for us on the Sunday evening - many of the places we had been recommended by friends were not open on Sunday so we were especially pleased with this assistance as it was our anniversary on the Sunday night. All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel - for its location and ambience.

<Content>Loved this hotel! I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights based on the great reviews here, and was pleasantly surprised...especially considering I booked at a great rate of 109 Euros a night. I really enjoyed my experience at this hotel, and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to be in the heart of the tourist area. The rooms were quiet except for one night when Barcelona beat Madrid in football, but I guess that's to be expected! I stayed in mid-November though, and would imagine that in the peak tourist months, this hotel would not be ideal for someone wanting to sleep at night!

<Content>Great Value We got a rate of 109 Euros per night at this hotel. The location is wonderful - right on Las Ramblas, in the center of all the action. The people working there were very nice, helpful, etc. The rooms were a great value - the bathroom was huge with a nice jacuzzi in it. All in all, a great value.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location! We stayed at Hotel MonteCarlo from Oct 10 - 13, 2005 for our Honeymoon after reading reviews on TripAdvisor. We took the Aerobus for 3.60 Euros per person to Playa de Catalunya. It was a 5 minute walk to the hotel on La Rambla. The hotel is in a great location and very easy to find after a long day of exploring. We had room 412 facing La Rambla. It was great to open the balcony door and listen to the activity going on below us. Very quiet with the glass door closed. The room was very nice and clean. Bathroom was a good size with jacuzzi tub. We had a little sitting room area. The beds were sooo comfortable. Having the adjustable feature was nice for reading in bed. As many already mentioned it can get a bit uncomfortable if you end up in the crack as the beds are two double beds pushed together. We received a bottle of Champagne for our honeymoon which we enjoyed very much. We did not have breakfast at the Hotel. Instead, there is a supermarket across from the Hotel where we bought fruit and yogurt for breakfast and enjoyed it on the Solarium on the 6th floor. Our only complaint would be that we were charged an additional night as we got bumped on our connecting flight and did not make it in to Barcelona until the following day. I was able to email the Hotel from the airport as soon as we knew we could not make the flight but because we had missed their 24 hour cancellation window by about 6 hours, they charged us anyway and would not budge. We would however, definitely stay here again.

<Content>Just Fantastic!! What a fantastic hotel! I stayed here last weekend with my 80-year old mother and the staff couldn't have been nicer. They spoke excellent English and recommended and booked restaurants for us (all of which we would go to again). The hotel was spotlessly clean and the bathrooms were fabulous. We had booked 2 single rooms, but were given double rooms (along with two of everything!). View out of the window was a blank wall, but who cares when you don't spend much time in the room?Breakfasts were great - including cooked breakfasts, freshly baked pastries, loads of different breads, freshly squeezed orange juice and excellent coffee.The hotel is situated right on the Ramblas, so you are close to everything.If you are there for only a short time, take a trip on the Tourist Bus - it takes you to all the sights, and you can hop on and off whenever you fancy it. It gives you a really good feel for the city. You also get a book of discount vouchers for all the main sights, so you could even re-coup the cost of the trip.

<Content>Monte Carlo beautiful family run hotel Stay at Monte Carlo Hotel in Barcelona was very good. It is on La Ramblas which may not be for everybody, But it's fun and the access is good.Opted for the deluxe room and it was impressive, virtually a suite with a huge whirlpool tub.Did not opt for breakfast so cannot comment on that but public areas are also impressive.Frienldy and helpfull staff. Across from the Meridien to keep the location in perspective. Lot's of nearby dining choices.One negative is European use of twins to make up a double/queen bed. Some do it better than others but it is annoying.Loved this hotel and Barcelona.

<Content>It couldn't have been better! My husband and I stayed at the Montecarlo on the last night of our honeymoon based on the recommendations from Tripadvisor. We couldn't have been happier with the hotel! The staff was extreemly warm and friendly and spoke several languges so there was never a communication problem. They did everything with the extra 'above and beyond' that makes a place memorable and special. The room was beautiful, immaculate and SPACIOUS and there was not a single issue with noise from the street. The bathroom with the jacuzi tub and shower was very nice (especially after the bathroom we were used to on our cruise ship!) The hotel is right in the middle of everything that you would want close to you, shopping, food, live outdoor entertainment etc and the area is very safe. The bus tour of the city is within walking distance and so are tons of great places to eat and have a realxing beverage while people watching on las ramblas. We also found the small bar at the hotel to be a quiet and romantic escape from the social atmosphere of the street. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a memorable time in Barcelona - you will not be disapointed!!

<Content>ExcellentThe room included 2 TV's, 3 telephones, mini bar, secure safe inside closet for valubles, remote control beds with head and foot adjustments, and a balcony which offered an excellent view of the street below, and of Barcelona. The doors to the balcony are double paned glass, consisting of 2 sets of sliding doors,, offering complete quiet, and solace in your room once they are closed. The bar and breakfast area off of the main lobby are tastefully designed and decorated. We did not take the breakfast on any mornings, however I wished we would have tried it at least once, for I am sure it was equally wonderful. The thing that was most noticeable of all these wonderful assests, was the extreme courtesy, and professional staff, who paid every minute attention to your needs. I will stay at Hotel Montecarlo, again, and again, when returning to Barcelona. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona, that wants to make their visit to this wonderful city, all that more memorable. Feel free to contact me direct , if I may offer any other information. Michael

<Content>Refinement, quality and great value We stayed for 4 nights and everything was perfect. Clean, modern, well presented and spacious rooms. It is a hotel with some history that has been tastefully modernised. Perfect. The hotel has real touch of class and is not too big - which means that the staff know who you are and make sure your needs are met fully without being intrusive. The language skills of the staff are excellent - speaking a range of languages. Nothing was ever too much bother for the staff - I cannot praise them enough. Check-in and check-out was very smooth. The sun terrace on the roof was a nice touch and offered a chance to relax outdoors. The public areas/ lifts/ bar etc are immaculate. Free internet access in the lobby is a bonus but you may need to wait as there is only 1 PC. The location is excellent on La Rambla. Right between 2 metro stops and close to Catalunya Square. Some travel reviews of Barcelona paint a grim/ dangerous picture of the marina/ beach area and the bottom end of La Rambla. I guess these journalists have never stepped far outside Kensington on their travels. These areas are also fantastic. Never saw any problems with crime etc and can testify that there has been a high level of investment in these areas and that they are lovely. Sound proofing in the room was excellent as we never heard any noises from the main street. We had a room with a jacuzi, robes, marble floor in the bathroom etc. Although I did not see the next room down in price I would probably not pay the extra 拢35 per night next time as I'm sure the other rooms are also great.I would definitely go back to Barcelona and would definitely recomend the Montecarlo.Loads of great places to eat in Barcelona but it does pay to get away from La Rambla if possible as the quality seems to improve for the same prices. Went to see FC Barcelona play in the Champions league - it was easy to get tickets even on the day of the game by buying them at the stadium (pices from 28 euros per seat - we bought excellent seat fro 46 euros each).

<Content>this is the one! spent the last part of the vacation in Barcelona. Monte Carlo was the place to cap off a perfect trip. The staff were helpful and very polite. Ask for room 308, it was very quiet and deluxe from the moment you step in the room. And it's hard to beat the location. Just two doors down is a fantastic restaurant (The Attic), a recommendation from the friendly staff, Fabio, at the front desk.RK

<Content>Good value ! Stayed 4 nights at the beginning of October after reading the previous reviews. Well presented building from the front which looks good at night. Stayed in Pedralbes Room (room 104) which exceeded our expectations for a 3* hotel. Very clean  spacious, good bathroom, a little tight on wardrobe space but okay for short stays. The room has a nice little private decked terrace at the rear of the hotel so is away from Ramblas and quiet, good for some fresh air ! Very good staff. The room could do with its own tea / coffee making facilities. The hotel is about two thirds of the way up Ramblas (right opposite Le Meridien) so not as much hustle and bustle as the bottom end near the marina. The hotel has no restaurant but when in Barcelona your probably going to be out and about anyway and there is plenty to choose from.

<Content>One of the best! Stayed here with my husband in late Sept. on our first ever visit to Barcelona. I actually chose the hotel based on trip advisor reports and it was even better than I expected. The location (on the Ramblas) was terrific, the room was clean, modern and very spacious. The front desk staff was super friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel!

<Content>Lovely Comfortable Room We have just returned from a 5 day trip to Barcelona, for our 25th Wedding Anniversary, and we couldn`t have chosen a nicer, more convenient hotel to stay in. Our room was on the 4th floor and had a small balcony with views over La Ramblas. The hotel sent us a big bottle of Cava which, unfortunately, I didn`t have time to finish !! (My husband doesn`t drink). The room was always beautifully cleaned and re stocked with toiletries every day, and was a dream to return to after a long day sightseeing. A very big thank you to all the staff at the Montecarlo.

<Content>A wonderful hotel!!!! My husband and I stayed at the Montecarlo for four nights in mid September and found it to be very well located, nicely appointed, clean, spacious, and to have very friendly and helpful employees. Upon noticing on our arrival that our luggage had not arrived on our flight, they took the initiative to take a copy of our reference documents and look into it for us. We received the luggage the next day. The staff was in a word, excellent, and they all spoke great English. They recommended great restaurants too! I agree with others' comments that the hotel should have a higher rating than 3 stars. We felt it was an excellent value for the price.The staff made a nice gesture to me as I celebrated my birthday while staying there, which they discovered from my passport, it was a lovely touch.This has absolutely nothing to do with the hotel, but please watch your purses/wallets extremely closely while in Barcelona, I had my purse stolen while sitting at Farga cafe (just down the street and around the corner) having a cappucino about 11:00 one evening, and in retrospect am fairly sure that the waiter there was in on it. Also, if you have time and transportation, I highly recommend a side trip to Roses and/or Cadeques, two charming coastal towns north of Barcelona. Sign me thrilled in Virginia

<Content>Great hotel overall The plusses outweight the negatives. The plusses: great location, friendly staff, clean and updated room (at least mine was). The negatives: VERY strict on guest policy. During the day, had to have dialogue with front desk to allow to have friends come up to room to hang out. During the night, no guests, no way, no ifs ands or buts. So impossible to bring a date back to hotel, which they should have disclosed prior to booking. Have never heard of such a restrictive no guest policy. Would not stay there again because of that. But overall, very nice hotel.

<Content>Favorite Hotel in Eurpoe My fiance and I stayed at Hotel Montecarlo for four nights. We stayed in seven hotels in Europe and Hotel Montecarlo was our favorite. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. They greeted us with maps and brochures about events in the city. The location is wonderful, walking distance to most site and the metro. When you step out of the hotel's front door you land in the middle of La Rambla. The energy on La Rambla makes it one of the most successful urban streets in the world. It is a great place for people watching, shopping and sipping sangria.The hotel room was spacious, clean and quiet. I love the crisp, clean, white, soft bed linens and the modern well designed bathroom. Breakfast was wonderful but a little pricy at 14 eruos each. I can not wait to return to Barcelona and stay at Hotel Montecarlo!

<Content>The lap of luxury We stayed here for one night as the 5* hotel we had booked with were unable to house us for the night due to refurbishment. We were told that this was a lower class hotel so they booked us in to a suite. I am now astonished to read that Montecarlo is only a 3* hotel, as it was head and shoulders above the 5* hotel we had booked. The service was impeccable. The doorman came up to show us how all the mod cons worked, and we were handed a map and various leaflets about events and attractions in the city upon arrival. We were also recommended several restaurants (she wrote all the names on the map for us), and the Tapas restaurant that she said was her favourite turned out to be a treat. The room was utterly fantastic. It was cool and spacious, with no street noise whatsoever, despite the location on the bustling La Rambla. The room was stylish and sophisticated, with plenty of storage, and overlooked a pretty courtyard. We had electrically adjustable beds and electric blinds that were operated from the bedside. The small living room area was comfortable, and the mini bar was extremely good value (around 1.5 euros for a soft drink - as opposed to 5 euros in the 5* hotel we were in for the rest of our stay!). The best feature was the fantastic jacuzzi, a wonderful touch and very relaxing. The hydrotherapy shower was a little baffling but I wish we had stayed there a little longer so that I could have worked it out! I felt like we had our own little paradise amongst the heat and mania of the city, and if I were to return to Barcelona, I would without a doubt stay here.Great location, wonderful staff, fabulous rooms.... Book now!

<Content>Bang On Stayed July 13 to15 2005. The staff especially SARA were very helpful by recommending tapas bars and resturants as well as going over the maps they gave us on tourist sites,The room was right on Las Ramblas and when you closed the sliding doors it was very quiet. The bathroom had a large jacuzzi tub with robes and slippers.The bed was top notch, and the room very clean and tastefully decorated.Icannot believe this is a three star hotel,Ihave stayed ingood4 and 5 star hotels that do not even come close to this.The price is very good for the quality you get. Just keepdoing what your doing well done

<Content>Unbelievable room My husband and I stayed here one night post cruise. What a wonderful experience. From the moment you walk in the air conditioned, marbled reception area you know you have found a special gem. The location is unbeatable...our room had a balcony that overlooked the crazy La Rambla. The dual sliding doors were EACH double pained so there was not a bit of sound. The huge room was more like 3 rooms...the bedroom with the wonderful adjustable beds, TV, etc. Then a sitting area, where you actually entered the room, with 2 wing chairs and side table, then the incredible bathroom. It was all marble with an awesome Jacuzzi tub (Oh! How good that felt after walking all day!), a full shower with the columnar shower heads, massages, etc, a stationary bike (!), bathrobes and slippers, bidet, toilet and double sinks. This was the ultimate. The staff was very, very friendly and helpful. Also free internet on the computer in the lobby. If we ever return to Barcelona, I will not even bother to research hotels...this is my choice hands down!

<Content>Friendliest of staff , made our stay in Spain What a lovely hotel. Airy, spacious rooms. Everyone we met ( staff) were friendly, helpful and knowledagble of the area. They made our stay in Spain a very enjoyable and memorable one. The location is excellent, on Las Ramblas. For the price the standard is superb. Beware of restaurants on the ramblas as pricey and found to be a bit of a rip off eg charge extra for sitting outside, deliver beautiful tomato bread that you presume is complimentary and then charge for, would be ok if this happened once but all the time so so check your bill before paying.Back to the hotel, recommended gorgeus places for tapas etc and even surpised us with champagne in our room for our honeymoon. As a hotel manager myself , hats off to you all you are doing a great job keep it up.Muchas Gracias para todo!Maria Carolan and Martin Nolan

<Content>Great Locale  I stayed there with a friend for a week in June. We found the location superb and the staff to be professional and very helpful. The room was very clean and functional. While the bathroom was a bit small, the jet-tub made up for it and was great after a long day of walking about. On the otherhand, while the adjustamatic bed is also a neat touch, we found the mattress that went with it to be a bit too soft for a comfortable nights rest. There is a great breakfast place right next door, so probably best to forego the hotel breakfast. Overall I would highly recommend the Montecarlo.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Montecarlo for two nights before departing on a cruise from Barcelona. This hotel is wonderful! The rooms were excellent, spotless clean, beautiful bathrooms. The location in the heart of Las Ramblas is fantastic. We would not stay anywhere else if returning to Barcelona!

<Content>How good can it get! What a fantastic hotel! in the heart of Las Ramblas. I stayed here for 3 nights with my wife for her 30th Birthday. The hotel is just perfect. You walk in from the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas into an air conditioned tranquil setting, The staff were great and service was understated. If you need something they will sort it out for you without fuss. They were friendly but not overbearing. The room we stayed in was spacious and clean. We had a balcony that looked out on to Las Ramblas and yet as soon as we closed the balcony window it was perfectly quiet. The hotel gave us a free bottle of Cava for my wife's birthday and it is this type of thing which makes this hotel so great.I cannot recommed this hotel highly enough and will be recommending it to anyone I know who is thinking of going to Barcelona.

<Content>Perfect My wife and I spent her 30th Birthday at the Hotel Montecarlo and we cannot recommend it enough. We were so well looked after by the staff and nothing was too much trouble. The solarium on the 6th floor (hardly used by guests) provided a lovely view of the Barcelona skyline. So many little touches helped to make our 3 night break perfect. Thanks again for the cava for my wifes birthday!

<Content>If in Bacelona, you must stay in hotel Monte Carlo!!  We have traveled to the Caribbean, Mexico, London, Paris and extensively in Spain, and we have never been so impressed with a hotel. This hotel is rated 3 stars but their huge rooms (even by American standards) have features of 4 and some 5 stars. Located in the heart of the city Las Ramblas you will get a GREAT VALUE for your money!!! ALL THANKS TO TRIPADVISOR REVIEWS!! This was our very first time using this reviewer鈥檚 service.Our double room was modern and spacious. It had as comfortable a bed with dual remote controls allowed either of us to raise or lower head and foot positions for sleeping, reading, or television viewing. The bath featured attractive salmon-colored marble tile, a wood veneer ceiling, full size tub with shower and whirlpool, and bidet. Matching bathrobes and slippers added an accent of luxury.There鈥檚 also a rooftop 鈥渟olarium鈥?with chaise lounges and a view of Las Ramblas below. Free Internet access is available at a computer just off the reception area adjacent to the lounge.More extraordinary than the amenities, however, was the service. Everyone we met was pleasant, friendly, and quick to smile. They provided excellent dining, and tourist planning suggestions. While we were able to handle most matters in Spanish, every one of their staff was able to switch to English easily and spoke it exceptionally well, they all speak Spanish, French, English and local 'Catalan' as you will find out in most places of this impressive city.If you stay here make sure to go to nearby Ciudat Comtal (Bar and Restaurant) for great Mediterranean food, fresh seafood and tapas. Also, take the tourist tour bus and make your visit Poble Espanyol and most of architect Antonio Gaud铆's landmarks (Sagrada Familia, Casa Batllo, La Pedrera, Parc G眉ell, etc.). We will make sure that all of our friends, co-workers and relatives that want to travel to Spain go to the unbelievable Barcelona and ONLY stay in this incredible hotel.

<Content>An outstanding hotel!!!!!!!!!!!! Just got back from our honeymoon in Spain. Our first 2 nights were in Barcelona at the Montecarlo. I must say that this is an outstanding hotel. I travel alot in the States on business and have traveled enough in Europe to know that the room we stayed in was unbelievable. A jacuzzi tub that REALLY IS large enough for two people. The waitstaff was pleasant and helpful on our questions about the city. The location is great. Just west of the cathedral.This is worth every single penny I spent and highly recommend the hotel!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Lovely hotel, perfect location I stayed in this hotel at the start of my honeymoon this May based on what I had read in Tripadvisor. Having looked at the website I e-mailed the hotel to find out about making a booking and mentioned we were starting our honeymoon... I received an e-mail giving me a discount on their top room -Making it cheaper than the one I was going to book! When we checked in, we received champagne and strawberries and a congratulatory note from the staff. The hotel itself is at the top of Las Ramblas which is a perfect location - there are lots of shops, restaurants and bars nearby. The open top tour bus routes both run from the top of the road and there are about three metro stations on this street.Our room was a suite which had a jacuzzi bath and a steam and sauna shower - It was great when we worked out how to use it! The beds are remote control comfort beds and were amazingly comfortable! The staff were friendly and very honest - I actually received a call having left the hotel about a top I had left behind beside the bin in a plastic bag to throw away...I would definitely recommend this hotel to any one...

<Content>Ignore the rest - book this one! A fantastic hotel in the heart of Barcelona, close to all the sights. We booked this after reading the good reviews on this site, and we are thankful we did! Modern, luxurious room with lovely bathroom with a double jacuzzi with inset lights, and comfortable, large double beds (move electrically up and down for reading etc.). Balcony on front well worth it - two double glazed sliding doors keep all the noise out at night. Hotel staff very helpful - spoke English and gave directions to places etc. Air conditioning struggled to keep room cool in June, though. Free internet access in lobby useful. We would stay here again.

<Content>Much better than expected! Stayed here 2 nights prior to a cruise. Excellent location with great security. The front entrance doesn't open unless the front desk sees you on closed circuit TV. As with most US tourists, we arived in the morning before 10am expecting a wait for our room. Not the case here, we immediately were shown to a very clean comfortable room in the back (quiet) section of the hotel. Push a button next to the bed and the room is instantly blacked out. What a great feature for tired travelers. Good price and excellent helpful front desk staff. I'd recommend this place to anyone.

<Content>Super hotel booked the hotel after reading up on it in tripadvisor.com. I booked direct with hotel who answered e mails quickly. I asked for a quiet room and was given one. It was at back of hotel and the view was of a wall - however we got the peace and quiet we asked for. There was a bit of noise on our first night May 29th from other guests but for the rest of the week the room was pretty peaceful. There was a quiet rumble from the Metro trains every few minutes but with aircon on it was not that noticeable although did take a little getting used to.We had a Gracia room on Floor 1. Gracia rooms have a small sitting room attached with armchairs, CD player and TV. Beds were comfortable and the bathroom was luxury with a superb shower and separate jacuzzi bath.The front desk staff were friendly, polite and more than helpful. They spent ages helping my son find a skateboard shop in Barcelona!We were careful and had no problems with pickpockets. They are around but then so are the police who were constantly patrolling Las Ramblas/Catalunya. We walked miles and travelled daily on Metro and had no problems. Just keep on guard.For a 3 star in a super location this hotel is to be recommended.

<Content>Best 3 Star Hotel in Barcelona, Spain My wife and I and another couple who are our friends stayed at the Hotel Montecarlo, 124 La Rambla, Barcelona, Spain in May 2005. This is absolutely the best of the three star hotels we have stayed at. The rooms were spotless, and more spacious than we expected. The staff was very friendly and helpful which helped to ensure that our stay in Barcelona was exceptional. I personally would have rated this a four star hotel. It was better than some of the four star hotels we have stayed at in the U.S.A. The hotel is located in the upper section of La Rambla which put us in just about the center for attractions and activities. We definitely will stay at the Monte Carlo on our next visit to Barcelona.

<Content>Hotel Montecarlo is Fabulous We stayed at the Montecarlo May 22, 2005. I chose this hotel after reading other reviews on Trip Advisor. I must say they were right on! The location of the hotel can't be beat if you want to be in the heart of LaRambla with convenient access to the metro and buses, as well as walking distance to major tourist sites. The room was excellent, very modern (well suited for business travelers as well as vacationers), very quiet, and I absolutely loved the plush, adjustable bed. The jetted bath was heavenly after a long day of sightseeing, and I especially liked the bath products (including premium bath salts for the tub). I was somewhat worried about the room because the hotel could not guarantee non-smoking. The room was free of any trace of cigarette odor. The bi-lingual staff was extremely accommodating, friendly, and knowledgeable. To top it off, the room rate was reasonable compared to other properties in the area. This was a very good find, and I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>What a value This hotel was so much more than expected. Even upon first entering the marble front steps and marble pillars, you have to be impressed. I have stayed in many 3 star properties and this one has to be the finest. There are 2 elevators, an empressive lobby, a bar, and a breakfast room on the main floor. There is a beautiful sitting room on the next floor, with a view of Las Ramblas. The rooms are well appointed with 10 foot ceilings with beautiful crown moldings. The adjustable bed is extremely comfortable. There are double windows, each with double pain glass to keep out all of the noise and an electric shade in between them that will completely darken the room. With a mini bar, a jacuzzi tub, t.v. with ppv movies, robes, it has all of the amenities of a higher rated hotel. The staff was extemely helpful and friendly. The location couldn't have been better, just 5 minutes up Las Ramblas to Placa Catalunya. I can't wait to go back and stay there again. And they can keep my pajamas.

<Content>one of the best hotels we have stayed in... We decided to stay before our cruise to adjust to the new time zone and was very impressed. Our room overlooked Las Ramblas, very comfortable and quiet, there were two glass sliding doors to block out the noise and the beds were adjustable for a great nights rest. The bathroom we took pictures of, a two person whirlpool and was divine after a long flight. The staff was great, free internet to send our emails, the morning breakfast was not to be missed, the location was great and we even found a restaurant called the Attic, a couple of doors down on the same side of the hotel that had early supper times...for us Americans...the menu was in English.The hotel is owned by a family for 60 years as we were told and you could really tell the pride they have in this great jewel of a hotel...the staff made us feel very welcomed...will be there again if we are ever in Barcelona...

<Content>Incredible Finish To Our Honeymoon My wife and I have used this website to plan several trips and I have never taken the time to write a review but have to share our experience at the Hotel Montecarlo in Barcelona. After a long day of traveling from Costa Brava, a hike around Montserrat and the adventure of returning a rental car into downtown Barcelona during Friday rush hour we arrived at the Hotel Montecarlo. We had our backpacks on and looked quite disheveled from the day to say the least when we arrived at the Hotel. The Hotel staff from the moment we stepped in until we had to leave on Sunday morning treated us better than any of the previous Hotel stops where my wife has Diamond status. They were aware that it was the last couple of nights of our Honeymoon and after we returned from a walk of La Rambla we were surprised by a bottle of Champaign in our room. We were given room #311 facing La Rambla with a great balcony with virtually sound proof doors to close out La Rambla or let it in, an incredible Jacuzzi tub, and a soft, comfortable, individually adjustable bed. Great Location, Perfect Hotel, Perfect Staff! Thank you so much for the best end to our two week European Honeymoon! We will be back!

<Content>Hotel is fine, service and location are not fine I stayed here with my husband and first, you need to know that La Rambla is kind of grungy - it's like a street fair and not quaint at all.Our room was fine albeit small and the common space is rather nice, but the service was lacking, if not plain rude.Our room was next to very loud tourists who were screaming and what sounded like running around the hallway at 4am. When I called the front desk the next day to request a room change, they reprimanded us for not calling in the middle of the night and reporting the incident, when in fact, we had.I was genuinely surprised by the abrupt and impatient tone of the front desk staff. They were not particularly sympathetic, apologetic or accommodating. I would never stay at Hotel Montecarlo again and would discourage any one I know to do the same.

<Content>Excellent hotel The Hotel Montecarlo is located in the heart of where the action is - La Rambla. Easy walk to many places. The staff of the hotel were superb during our stay, and the room was modern, clean, well appointed and very quiet. I can highly recommend it.

<Content>Hard to imagine a better home base in Barcelona the Montecarlo was just out of our price range, but we came close to saving the difference bynever needing to take public transportation; the location is in the very heart of Barcelona, and almost everything we wanted to see was a beautiful walk away. we had a Sants room, which was large, modern and luxurious. the staff was friendly and competent, took care of making sure our cab was there and waiting for us at 3am when it was time to go to the train station, and just generally made it an incredibly comfortable stay.nitty gritty: standard but relatively reasonably priced mini bar, standard safe, good size closet in separate dressing area, double paned windows, bidet and jacuzzi.complaints? no balcony (although many other Montecarlo rooms have them and I should have just asked for one), which made the Montecarlo's incredible view of The Ramblas and Barcelona a little torturous each night that the sun did that really amazing thing. there's a roof deck, but it closes before sunset, which I suppose keeps it from becoming a party up there, but man were we bummed when we headed up there with a jug of sangria. just one more: the adjustable beds were pretty entertaining, and great for waking up and lying around reading guidebooks, but there's no getting around the fact that two single beds pushed up next to each other are kind of irritating if you are the kind of couple who sleeps curled up with each other. I fell off in the middle more than once!I will strongly recommend the Montecarlo to my friends and family who visit Barcelona, and look forward to returning there sometime soon!

<Content>Nicest Hotel in Barcelona My husband and I just returned from a whirlwind trip in Europe that started in Barcelona and ended in Rome. The Montecarlo was our first stop and was outstanding. The location is perfect and the staff is the nicest in Europe. In fact, much nicer than the staff of our SilverSeas cruise that we met in Barcelona. The rooms were simply lovely and very clean. We had room 301 with a balcony overlooking Le Rambla...spectacular! The staff helped us with our quest to see all of Barcelona in 3 days and did a great job in getting us to fall in love with this beautiful city. Every recommendation was perfect. We want to return to Barcelona soon and when we do, we will definately stay at the Montecarlo again.

<Content>Where not to stay in Barcelona The hotel Montecarlo is very comfortable with a big jacuzzi bath and if you are lucky to get a view a good view of Las Ramblas. It麓s a shame the same cannot be said of some of the staff. I booked a stay of 4 days in the hotel and discovered late on the second night that my pyjamas had disappeared. Apparently they had been scooped up when they changed the sheets. When I asked when they might find them the next morning they said they would send them on to me and there was no apology, implying it was my fault for having pyjamas. They obviously thought I should make do without when it was hardly my fault that they had disappeared! When they hadn麓t appeared that evening I said that that was not good enough so they eventually gave me 30 euros to buy some more. It took them 48 hours to find them (I got them as I was leaving). The pyjamas were returned without apology, unlaundered and the pair that I had bought were taken off me! If you add that experience to fact I had to request refills of soap and tissues, the bed didn麓t work (it was supposed to move like a hospital bed) and the water that came out of the taps was brown, it麓s hardly the kind of service one would expect for paying 200 euros a night.

<Content>Simply great! Hotel Montecarlo was centrally located, on the Ramblas and within easy walking distance of all central areas. We got the airport bus service to Place de Catalunya, and it was a short walk to the Ramblas and the Montecarlo is situated near the top end of the Ramblas.The room was large with a balcony overlooking Ramblas. Bathroom in particular was spacious with hydrobath and double sinks, toilet and bidet etc. The bed was electrically adjustable - perfect for sitting up to read or watch TV.Hotel staff were very helpful and polite. Gave us good recommendations for eating out and directions etc. If I was going back to Barcelona the only thing I would change is I would pre-book certain restaurants. The better restaurants are always booked, although you can get served later in the evening, ie around 10.45pm.We loved Barcelona and everything about it.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Just returned from a 4 night stay at this hote. The staff was incredible. They noticed it was my birthday from my passport and had a bottle of cava and a card waiting for me in my room. Very safe and secure hotel and the rooms were wonderful. Ask for a room overlooking the garden, lots of windows in this room. It is not as big as the deluxe room, but still very nice. We had a bigger room first that looked over La Ramble, very quite. Would definity stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful stay My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Montecarlo for 4 nights around New Years Eve. The room was comfortable and staff very helpful. Ideally located for sightseeing. We took the Metro in from the airport and were able to walk to the hotel from the train station. While on the Ramblas, it is on the north end so it was not too busy yet within walking distance to most sights. Would definately stay again. A tip, we did not have breakfast at the hotel and perferred instead to walk around in search of coffee and pastry.

<Content>Could not have asked for more My husband and I stayed here in February 2005 for a weekend city break after reading other TripAidvsor reviews. The location is ideal - only a two/three minute walk from the main bus and underground stations at Placa de Catalunya and centrally located on La Ramblas. The staff were very friendly and inviting on arrival and could not have done more to help. They even remembered our room number when we returned from our day out on the second day to hand us our room key. Our room was very comfortable and clean, not especially spacious, but they seem to have thought of everything as far as amenities are concerned (adjustomatic beds, jacuzzi bath, bidet, mini-bar etc.). We did not have a view from our room window, but we spent most of our time exploring Barcelona anyway. Breakfast was very nice with a good self-service selection and the staff would bring freshly-squeezed orange juice to your table and your choice of tea (they had a huge selection of teas) or coffee. Overall it was an excellent base to explore this beautiful city and we could not have asked for more for the price we paid. Would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Hotel Montecarlo...Muy Bien! My husband and I just returned from a week in Spain and were blown away with both Barcelona and the Hotel Montecarlo. We chose the hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews and were thrilled. Everything you read here, from the comfort of the beds to the pleasant helpfulness of the staff is true. We had room 513, facing La Rambla, and enjoyed the open-aired front view each night till it was time to close the world out and sleep like babies in the adjustable, soft beds. The large round tub with jacuzzi is an utterly welcome treat after extended travel or a long day on one's feet. I would highly recommend this charming, wonderfully located hotel to all (and wish I could say the same for the hotel we booked in Madrid, which we did not get from TripAdvisor). Again, a charming place with consistently pleasant and helpful staff.

<Content>Couldnt have been happier My daughter and I spent three nights at the Montecarlo in February. It was everything we had hoped for: great location, wonderful, friendly staff, very comfortable room. We were right on Las Ramblas, and could take in the scene from our balcony, yet when we closed the sliding doors, it was completely quiet. I don't know if I've every stayed in such a quiet hotel room. The room was very modern and comfortable. The staff helped us with everything we needed. Definitely would stay there again.

<Content>Excellent! We have just returned from this hotel. The room was large, clean and well equipped. The bed (adjustable) very very comfortable, and the bathroom so luxurious. On top of all this the staff were the friendliest we have ever encountered. The best hotel we have stayed in. We will definitely return.

<Content>Great Hotel! My wife and I just got back from our mini vacation in Barcelona. We stayed at Hotel Montecarlo, and we loved this hotel!! The service was great, and the room we stayed in was excellent! Our room faced La Rambla, tastefully decorated (the bed...oh, so comfortable!!), and the bathroom equipped with Jacuzzi.About the service, as I said earlier, was excellent!. I just wanted to acknowledge a young fellow in particular (I think his name was George or Jorge...). He was very helpful and attentive. We will definitely go back to this hotel again.

<Content>Comfortable and convenient We stayed at the Montecarlo for two nights as part of our honeymoon and found our room very comfortable. It was at the front of the building and had a small balcony overlooking the Ramblas, plus a wonderful jacuzzi-type bath. The staff were so helpful and, realising it was our honeymoon, brought up a lovely bottle of cava to our room! The desk staff could not have been more helpful. This is definitely a hotel I would stay at again.

<Content>Good Hotel... Great position/view We went to this hotel during December with my daughter aged 9 for her birthday. We booked a junior suite, which consisted of a bedroom, a separate living area, a little patio and a shower/hydro sauna combination with a jacuzzi in the bathroom. The most annoying factor was that when I'd booked this online, I had made a request for an extra bed for a child in the comments section, I even phoned up SRS to make sure that this was possible for the room type we'd booked as you couldn't specify a child occuping a room with parents on line. When we arrived at the hotel however, they claimed that they had not been informed and had no record of such a request. What appeared to be manager of the day made a bit of huff and puff about putting in an extra bed (rollaway style). This was a little annoying, particularly as it was my little daughters birthday present. I also thought it bad form that they charge full adult rate for an extra (rollaway) bed being put in (about $50 per night if my memory serves me correctly), particularly in a suite where you have a separate 'living area' anyway. Though reading through the fine print once you've booked, they do say children over 3 are charged at the full rate.Eventually it was sorted it out however, and the room was nice enough, though I thought a little dark, as it was on the side of the hotel.. it did have a little balcony which was nice. The decor was a little brown/white and minimilist for my liking. I would have liked tea/coffee making facilities in the room as well, but we did order snack/drinks via room service and it was fine.The general staff were pleasant and helpful. The hydrosauna is fun, however, the instructions are not great.. it took us a little time to work out how to get a steam room effect in it.. and you have to wait quite a while for it to get going (we though it wasn't working)...The hydromassage takes some working out as well.. we all got hydromassaged heads.. because we couldn't work out how to stop the 'top' jets (suitable for very tall people I think!).They do need to put some new plastic instructions into the shower as the ones inside are worn away in parts. The view from the hotel is just fanstastic.... Barcelona bustling and all the mime artists in the middle boulevard, and you are SO in the middle of it all. A short walk to the cathedral, which at Xmas was nice with the market. The metro stop is close at hand as well, handy for visiting all the spots.Overall, a good hotel, reasonable rooms, great position.

<Content>There is absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel You don't even have to think about it. Just book this hotel. This was my 6th trip to Barcelona, and I travel extensively throughout Europe. I have never had a more positive hotel experience for this price range. I booked the hotel for 115 euros (an Internet special) and was ready to ask and pay for an upgrade after I arrived and could see the room. I didn't need to - the room was perfect. Spacious (for Europe), quiet despite having two large windows (double paned, completely noise-proof), sparsely but chic'ly decorated (like a boutique hotel). The beds were soft and so comfortable, with good linens. The bathroom was large and clean, with Jacuzzi tub.The best thing about this hotel is the location. It's across the street from the covered food market, and we had a delightful experience getting up and stumbling literally across the way to have a breakfast made on-the-spot from fresh local produce, meats, and eggs. You are within a short walk from everything you could possibly need or want - the harbor, the Placa Catalunya, two metro stops, the Old Town, and a multitude of restaurants and shops and bars/discos.I will never stay anywhere else in Barcelona. I would change my dates of travel just to be able to get a place in this hotel!

<Content>Perfect Hotel for first trip to Barcelona - 21st Jan 05 I recently visited my husband for a long weekend while his Ship was alongside in Barcelona so the trip had to be perfect and somtimes a hotel can make a differnce on the weekend. This hotel was beautiful, the staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful. We did not eat in the hotel as we wanted to experience local tapas restuarants, however we could not have wanted anymore and if we had more time would have eaten in the hotel. Our room was facing the main street La Ramblas and had perfect views and there was hardly any noise. Our only fault was that the room was a little narrow and the double bed was two singles pushed together, it became a little tiresome pushing them together every so often.We will definitely re-visit the Hotel Montecarlo again.

<Content>very impressive We live in and travel extensively in Europe. This hotel is perfect. We spent New Years in Barcelona. Our room overlooked the Ramblas and we spent the last of the evening on our balcony. When we returned inside...closing the doors and curtain...the noise ceased! Could not have asked for a more perfect location or nicer staff. Our room was delightful. Highly advise this hotel!

<Content>Loved this place! Just returned from 3 days at the Montecarlo. We arrived late morning after an overnight train ride from Rome, hadn't slept and figured at best they could store our luggage. They were able to check us in early! We were able to freshen up and felt much better. The location is excellent, they staff were all great and very helpful. We were #506 on the back side of the hotel, completely quiet and the beds were sooo comfortable...we can't tell you about breakfast because we never made it. The sheets were great, so comfy. It is like an oasis off La Ramblas. We stayed all over Europe this trip and this was our favorite hotel. I recommend it wholeheartedly without any reservations. I told them I didnot want to write a good review because then the hotel would always be full and I would not be able to stay there again and they promised to always make room for us.

<Content>Very nice, great location We stayed at hotel Montecarlo this past May. We were both very pleased. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the hotel very clean. As far as the location is concerned, I don't think one could find better in Barcelona. We walked to everything! Our room, although a bit small, was very comfortable. We had a room facing the Rambla and we very much enjoyed sipping wine in late afternoon on our deck. We'll never forget the hottub and the wonderful bath salts. Just a blast!! We have traveled to Spain, France, Germany and Austria this year. We have enjoyed great hotels and great locations. Quite frankly, hotel Montecarlo stands up to all of them. We just came back from Munich, where we stayed at hotel Kapinski right on Maximillian Strasse. Nice hotel, great location - triple the price of Montecarlo! Montecarlo wins!! I hope everyone enjoys this hotel as much as we did. We're sure you will.

<Content>Montecarlo saved our Honeymoon My husband and I spent one night at Hotel Montecarlo as an extra weekend trip to our honeymoon cruise. We chose this hotel because of it's location and we wanted to maximize our sightseeing time. We checked in at 8:30 in the morning and they were ready with a smile. The room was on the top floor, very cozy and tastefully decorated. The marble bathroom and jetted tub were wonderful! The bed was so comfortable, and we were so exhausted, so we took a quick nap. We then headed out for some sightseeing around 11am. The hotel's location right on Las Ramblas is perfect. Everything is within a manageable walking distance. Unfortunately, within our first 10 minutes on a very crowded metro, my husband was pickpocketed. (Beware! I've never seen such absolute professionals!) We tried to find the culprit, but of course it was impossible. We returned to the hotel immediately. The staff was great and offered to call our different credit card companies for us. The gave us a map and great directions to the police station. All in all, they were very helpful and very apologetic that this had happened to us in their city. We spent our entire first day trying to do damage control with credit cards and bank accounts, and then tried to do a little sight seeing. We returned later that evening. The front desk staff had changed shifts by then, but they were still as helpful and friendly as ever. As soon as we walked in, even the young lady at the front desk immediately asked us if everything was alright and if we needed any additional help. We thanked her then went on to our room to relax a bit before dinner. Within 5 minutes of being in our room, there was a knock at the door. The front desk had had a beautiful fruit basket and a nice bottle of chilled champagne brought up to us. Again, they apologized that we had been robbed in their city and hoped that this 'small gesture' would help in some way. After feeling so violated and distraught all day, and glancing warily at every passerby, it was so nice to know that someone wanted to be kind to us! The next day, the hotel even held our bags for hours after we checked out, just so we would have a safe place to keep our things and still get to see the city. What was to be a dream trip to Barcelona turned into a temporary nightmare. Thanks to a few thoughtful people at Hotel Montecarlo, it still turned out to be a wonderful end to our honeymoon. I DEFINITELY recommend Hotel Montecarlo to anyone wanting to thoroughly enjoy their trip in Barcelona. It made the difference for us.

<Content>A standard 3-star property nothing more We stayed in the Montecarlo for two nights (December 3-5). We got a good deal through the SRS website which included a free room upgrade (if available). First of all, the information the hotel give on their website is a complete lie. They claim all rooms have adjustable beds and massage tubs. That is NOT TRUE! They have something called the standard room which has none of these facilities. Secondly, the free room upgrade did not exist according to the staff (I had it on print but they said no!) but if I paid an extra 30 euro a night then they would upgrade me. They said bad information about the information on their website and that was it. After getting very pissed off I got the deal worked out that we stay one night in the standard room and one night in an upgraded room without extra charge. The standard rooms is nothing but a small room with a rather uncomfortable bed. In my opinion, the standard room is representable for a 2-star hotel and nothing more. The upgrade room was a lot better, bigger and brighter with adjustable beds and a water jet tub. The beds were very comfortable and is it one thing I care about in hotels then it is the bed. The room was also very quiet. The staff is a very mixed bag, one of them was very rude and arrogant while one of them was among the most serviceminded people I ever met in a hotel. If you are lucky and you get everything you have reserved without any hazzle, well, then the Montecarlo is as good as any 3-star hotel. But given all the problems I cannot recommend this hotel and the only thing that stopped me from giving it a Terrible rating is the A-class location of the hotel, that some of the staff tried really hard to fulfill their obligations and that the upgraded room was very comfortable and quiet. Go for a 4-star hotel instead, you might have to pay just a bit more but the fact is that the Montecarlo is a basic 3-star property and nothing more.

<Content>Disappointed After all the good review, I was disappointed. Room was on small size, could hear elevator all night, loud group down the hall, great view of blank wall. Expected more for the money.

<Content>Too Good for just 3 Stars One of the best hotels I have stayed in for a while. We booked on a web special, a great price for the centre of Barcelona. They also upgraded the room when we got there, which was a quiet one away from the Ramblas, a good size for a city centre and exceptionally clean. And the staff, well they were simply second to none!

<Content>Excellent In Every Way The Hotel Montecarlo is the perfect place to stay in Barcelona. Do not let the fact that the hotel is on La Rambla dissuade you. Rather, enjoy the fact that you will have an oasis of calm in the middle of the chaos that is La Rambla. Last week we spent 3 nights at the Hotel Montecarlo. The entire experience was great; even before entiring the hotel since we were met at the curb by a polite and helpful bellman. The hotel is small by comparison to some of its local competitors with only 55 rooms, but in our view this lends an air of intimacy to the place. It does not take long to get to know the staff, and while the hotel lacks a concierge this is not a negative factor since the entire front desk staff is knowledgeable and more than willing to assist with cabs, reservations, directions and so forth. Gus, from Seattle, was particuarily delightful and helpful. Everyone on staff spoke English, and this added to the oasis quality of the hotel. Our room, no. 102, was quite large with a king sized bed in a separate bedroom, a sitting room with a bar, TV coffee table and seating for two in a bright windowed room, and a huge bathroom that included a whirlpool bathtub and a separate shower stall. The room was very well soundproofed and the AC was efficient and quiet. The Hotel Montecarlo will be our hotel of choice in Barcelona.

<Content>Great 3 star hotel! Hotel Montecarlo is at least the best 3 star hotel ever! Great location just in La Rambla almost a minute to everywhere. We had a deluxe room in the 4th floor facing La Rambla wich was great, the room was excellent for a 3 star hotel, special mension for the bathroom, huge with a 2 pers. jacuzzi and a great shower.I strongly recommend this hotel instead of a 4 star hotel with highest prices!!!!CiaoAndrea

<Content>Loved this hotel! My husband and I stayed in this hotel after our Mediterranean cruise in August. Before the cruise we had stayed in a different hotel in Barcelona. This hotel was wonderful! The staff were so helpful and they spoke perfect English! The room was so comfortable...we ended up taking too long of a siesta on the fluffy, down comforter and craftmatic adjustable bed! We also were able to relax in the jacuzzi tub and marbled bathroom. What a great find. We will recommend this hotel to everyone! Great location, too!

<Content>Great staff, great location, ok rooms. Just like the title says. Staff was incredibly nice, had great recommendations on where to eat and drink, and even helped us get into a fully-booked restaurant in less than 5 minutes through the owner. Location is great if you like the Rambla. Very busy, touristy, but fun. It's a couple of minutes away from the Gothic quarter anyway, which is quiet and very quaint. Rooms are pretty nice, clean, with jacuzzi. Ask for a room with a view of the street though, as our room faced onto a wall. Would recommend.

<Content>What's not to love I spend more than 100 nights in hotels around the world a year, and I can tell all that the Montecarlo is one of the best hotels I had stayed in. First, location is right on the main Rambla street. Staff are very friendly and all speak excellent English. Service is great and room is well furnished. The best of all is that the AC works very well. I like to stay cool and sometimes I even had to turn the fan to low as it blows very cold air.I would recommend the hotel to any particular to details travelors.

<Content>Loved It! We just got back from a two night stay at the hotel Montecarlo in Barcelona and the room exceeded our expectations. I booked the hotel based on reviews on the Trip Advisor and was not disappointed. The room actually was a suite with a pocket door that separated the bedroom from the sitting area. The large marble bath had a jacuzzi tub. The hotel provides terry cloth bathrooms and slippers in the room for your use.The hotel staff went out of their way to accommodate us when we were trying to find a way to ship packages back home instead of carrying them on the plane. They found boxes, packing material and tape. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>The best Just came back (last night) from a trip to Barcelona. We stayed at The Hotel Montecarlo for 3 nights. It was fabulous and, by far, the best hotel of our 14 day trip through Spain. We may have had one of the more expensive rooms (176 Euros per night plus tax) but this was worth it. The room faced the street but the double glass windows muffled all the noise. The furniture was beautiful - very lovely woods. The bathroom had a jacuzzi. Breakfast was expensive but if you want to eat a full meal (hot and cold foods) then the price might be ok. The service was very attentive. When the staff saw that we went outside to buy the International Herald Tribune, they told us that they had them and that they would save us a copy each day. And they did!

<Content>Amazing! Booked this hotel after reading the reviews on this site. Amazing location, right on Las Ramblas (there are 5 ramblas, this is on the Rambla Cappuccino, about a three-five minute walk from Plaza de Catalunya, where you can catch the metro). Free Internet access as you walk in, great prices for room service and great service in the bar. We met friends there nightly for a drink before going out. Staff couldn't be more helpful. We bought flowers for a friend and dropped them off at the front desk so we didn't have to carry them and they put them in water and held on to them until we came back for drinks that evening. Bathrooms are large and clean--ours had a jacuzzi tub (ask for room 201). View of the Ramlas is great--double glass doors to keep out noise. We had no problems. Radio, CD player, television, AC, minibar, comfortable beds. A+! Oh, breakfast is not included and is around $16 euro. We found great deals at cafes near by for a croissant and coffee for about 3 euro. Be sure to try some of the places off the beaten path. There are great cafes and restaurants to be found just meandering through the streets behind the Ramblas.

<Content>Definately worth a visit! I booked the Hotel Montecarlo off the back of the reviews I had read on trip advisor. I would normally head straight for a four or five star hotel for a short break to ensure we had no issues surrounding the quality of our accomodation. However, the reviews were so positive and the location seemed ideal so we decided to give it a go.The location is ideal if you want to have a base from which to explore Barcelona on foot. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful (although they wouldn't book a taxi for us, advising us that it would be easier to flag one down outside - which it wasn't!)Breakfast was excellent, especially the scrambled eggs (just delicious) and there is a great roof patio area where you can lie and soak up some afternoon sun if your husband likes to crash out for a siesta (as mine has a tendancy to do)!The rooms were clean and smart but a little bit generic for the character of the building. This hotel isn't cheap for a three star property and from looking at the outside of the building I was hoping for a little more character in the rooms.I was also a little disapointed to find that our room was equipped with two beds pushed together rather than a kings size bed - this is no fun if you are there to celebrate your wedding anniversary!!This hotel is definately worth a visit as long as you bear these things in mind before booking.

<Content>Couldn't be Better!! The best location in Barcelona. Right on the Ramplas, but with double glazing to keep out the noise at night. Very smart rooms with electric beds  powerful jaccuzi baths. Big balcony.Excellent buffet breakfast (12 sorts of tea!)Friendly, bi-lingual staff who sort out restaurants, taxis etc.Very good prices. It's a 3 star because they havn't got a restaurant (there are many, many great restaurants in the area, anyway) and they have no disabled access (although this is being built as we write)I'd go back tomorrow!
