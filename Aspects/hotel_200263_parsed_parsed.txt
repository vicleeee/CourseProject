<Content>Good value in excellent location Stayed in this hotel with my husband from 26th - 30th Oct 2008.Very pleased with the location just 2 tram stops from Alexanderplatz from where you can get trains, buses and trams to every part of Berlin. Hotel was very clean, reasonable size room, very comfortable bed and excellent continental breakfast for 9.50. Staff friendly and gave advice on transport, sights to see etc. Just one quibble! only one towel provided per person and this a smallish bath towel which I was told was the standard in Ibis hotels? However when I queried this there was no problem getting extra towels ( though the maid removed these and only left 2 fresh ones the next day!} Berlin is so easy to get around. The Berlin Card is well worth getting as it gives 3 days of travel on buses, trams, trains underground etc plus discounts to all museums etc. The bus lines 100 and 200 are excellent as they travel through all the tourist attractons in the city.Would be happy to stay in this hotel again because of the price and the excellent location.

<Content>Think Twice The room is really small, the tv simply didn`t work, people from the front desk and the restaurant are rude, because they think they speak english well and they don`t like to repeat answers, however, their accents are terrible, sounds like eating rocks while talking...

<Content>Corporate, Clean, Comfortable, Courteous.... We've stayed at the Ibis in Mitte probably 5 or so times over the past 8 years, as it's in a beautifully convenient location as far as we're concerned. For those of us flying in on a 'cheap flight' to Schonefeld, you get straight onto the Regionalzug at the railway station at the airport and get off at Alexanderplatz. The Ibis is on Prenzlauer Allee and takes about 10 minutes to reach if you're reasonably healthy. If you can't face the walk, use the tram - there are tram stops in the road opposite the hotel which means that you have good links to other parts of the city. You can always use the tram to get to the nearest U or S-bahn if you need to, or simply don't fancy a long walk anywhere.The Ibis is not particularly cheap, but the rooms are clean, spacious, and comfortable. They are well soundproofed, which is just as well as the road is busy 24/7. The breakfasts are not included in the price, but if you opt to take them you can really fill up from the wide ranging buffet provided. I noticed that a previous reviewer had said you can't do anything about the view of the factory - the first time we stayed this was derelict and there was a squatters party going on in the roof area. The factory has now been converted to a gym and business complex as the whole of Prenzlauer is becoming a bit of a yuppy paradise. And as for seeing Alexanderplatz - that's the whole point of staying in this area of the city!! You can't miss the TV Tower from the hotel if your room looks downhill, and it's a great reminder of the old East.The staff are really helpful - we've asked them about various bus times and how easy it is to get to places etc and they have always offered assistance. At the end of the day, Ibis are an international chain and you're paying for what you get. This isn't always a bad thing, because if you've used the Ibis or similar elsewhere, you have an idea what to expect. Book the hotel, check in, and relax.

<Content>clean and friendly A group of us spent three nights at this hotel and found that, while simple, it suited our needs. The rooms are a little small but that's not unusual for Europe and, more importantly, very clean. We were very pleased with the breakfast offered: a good variety of breads, meat, cheeses, cereals and yogurt. The close proximity to the Alexanderplatz station made reaching any area of the city we wished to visit easy. The only weakness that we found was that the walls are thin so you can hear your neighbors at times. I wouldn't be opposed to staying here again.

<Content>Great Value Accommodation My husband  I stayed at the Ibis Mitte Berlin from 10 - 13 March 08 and could not find fault with this hotel. We took advantage of the IBIS Happy 30 deal and got 3 nights for 149 Euros - which was an excellent bargain.The Hotel is in a very location, a mere 5-7 min walk to the Radio Tower  Alexanderplaz station. The Hotel rooms are basic standard but bright and clean. The bathroom was lovely and had a great shower. I can't understand why previous reviews have not been satified with the room because I believe that the room more than met my needs. In fact I think that the hotel offers excellent value for money and I was able to put more money into other aspects of my trip rather than focus too much on a luxurious room which I didn't spend a lot of time in. IWe had a TV in our room and a hairdryer was also provided in the bathroom. Our room was on the top floor (7th floor) and we had a fantastic view. We had breakfast on our last day in the hotel at a cost of 9.5 euros and it was very good indeed. The hotel also has free internet access in the reception area. All the staff that we spoke to were very friendly.Berlin is a lovely city and I would recommend it to anyone for a lovely city break. We also visited Berlin Zoo as well as visiting Brandenburg Gate, The remaining parts of the wall and Checkpoint Charlie. We went on the opentop bus (15 euros per person - hop on hop off) which left from the Ratthaus (Town hall) which is located near Alexanderplatz station. Well worth doing as it stops at all the famous landmarks/interesting locations in Berlin.Public Transport was sadly on strike when we were there so we didn't get a chance to travel on the trams, or metro -- but this did not hamper our enjoyment of a beautiful city.

<Content>Really not great My fiance and I stayed at the Ibis Mitte for 3 nights in July 07. We previously lived in Berlin and so know the city really well. As we lived in Prenzlauer Berg and our friends and fiance's sister live there, it seemed like it would be a decent base for our long weekend. We were planning on being out most of the time so were just looking for somewhere clean and convenient to sleep in east Berlin.The hotel was not good. The rooms are really small which wasn't really a problem for our 3 night stay but they are very dated. The bathroom is also tiny and dated and the whole place looks like it could do with some modernisation. It is a very basic hotel which I would expect from Ibis but it just doesn't have a nice feel and what makes this hotel worse is the staff. Staff at reception were unfriendly and quite rude. My fiance is German and I speak fluent German so we had no communication problems however we really had the impression that the staff at reception just couldn't be bothered. Check-in was ok but nothing special. On our 2nd night we went to ask something at the reception before going out for dinner. I had sprayed some perfume before we left the room (quite a normal thing to do I think) and whilst we were waiting at reception a woman working there started complaining loudly about my perfume to her colleague beside her was serving us! Not a problem if she doesn't like my perfume but how odd to start complaining about it in front of me! I went down to reception to ask for a hairdryer on another occasion and had interrupt the 2 receptionists from their personal conversation so that they could attend to me (my pet peeve), not only that but I then had to leave a 鈧?0 deposit for the hairdryer...Overall the hotel is not good and the staff there aren't making it any better. Location is handy for Mitte/east Berlin but I certainly won't be staying there again.

<Content>Avoid at all cost! Maybe the worst hotel in the Europe. Small room,heating was out of order ( outside temp. was 2 C ), needless to mention that there was no hairdryer, for a room that costs 105 Eur o. Thank God it was clean. Breakfast was also a disappointment .

<Content>worst hotel ever!!! I have been to many hotels in Europe and this one was the worst! Thier description was very misleading, the staff was not very friendly nor helpfull. They gave us wrong information RE: the subway which ended up costing me 80 EUR. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The room and hotel was dirty and the breakfast was not worth the 9.50 EUR.

<Content>No walking Required! I stayed at the Ibis Mitte twice - once in 2003 and again in April 2007 and found it very easy to book, find and get to. The Ibis hotels website was easy to use and provided maps of the hotel's location. Used in conjunction with a Berlin transport map, getting there from Schonefeld was easy beyond words - only one change of train needed.The hotel has a tram stop right outside and the U-Bahn station at Rosa-Luxembourg Platz was within easy walking distance (if I'm truthful - the tram route passes the U-Bahn station, so there's no need to walk!) This means you can easily link to U and S-bahn by using the tram. The hotel was clean and well worth the price charged. Staff were friendly and very helpful, especially when dealing with my pitiful attempts at German! They all wear name badges with flags that identify which languages they speak. The bar was well run and served Berliner and Warsteiner (available in most German Ibis hotels) beers. Snacks were easy to arrange and tasty.The room was basic but was ideal for use as a base for seeing Berlin. Take a trip to the top floor at night for a brilliant view of the radio tower at Alexanderplatz.I would recommend the hotel to anyone visiting the city. I've stayed in many others in the city and haven't found anywhere else with such good and easy to reach transport links.

<Content>Good value and location You know what you are getting with an Ibis hotel,a clean and comfortable room with double bed,modern bathroom and plenty of storage space.Although situated in East Berlin I feel this is the most convenient of the 9 Ibis hotels in the Berlin area,there is a tram stop 150 yards from the hotel taking you to one of the main rail stations (Alexanderplatz) in five minutes from where both the U Bahn and S Bahn quickly transport you to the main shopping areas and tourist attractions.For stays of 3 days or more there is a welcome card starting at 21 euros which is excellent value and entitles you to unlimited travel on the trams and rail networks within the greater Berlin area,it also includes numerous discount vouchers for city attractions,pubs,clubs restaurants etc.There are some excellent restaurants in the Kollwitz street area just a 10 minute stroll from the hotel.There is a 24hour filling station on the side of the hotel so best to ask for a front or rear room,it is however handy for newspapers,drinks and snacks.The hotel has a small bar serving light meals and snacks during the evening.We found the staff courteous and helpful at all times.Bookings are best made on the Ibis website,you are unlikely to get a cheaper deal on any other site and at an average of 拢50 per night is very good value.

<Content>Just the Job Just returned from a lad's weekend in Berlin where we spent two nights at the Ibis. Although booked well in advance we were able to get a shared double room for 81 euros a night. Staff were very friendly, rooms clean, showers good and powerful, close to Alexanderplatz which is a good start point for the day and night. Not sure if they actually take stag weekend block bookings as the 14 of us booked separately, but they were tolerant of high spirits in the bar area as long as there was no larking around elsewhere - which was clear, understood and a good time was had by all.A good base to discuss some of the truly bizarre things this town has to offer - especially when you happen upon the Christopher Street demo by chance

<Content>A So So hotel out of the way This hotel is cheap and cheerful. There is a tram outside and a subway stop about 10mins away. The hotel is pretty basic and there isn't much to do around the area. It may be in Prenzlauer Berg but it's about 1.5km to the Prenzlauer Berg scene.

<Content>Quite good value for the money Like the title says, a really good value for your money. Very clean, quite professional staff. Not really in Mitte, but Mitte starts 100 meters south. Internet service was buggy. You had to buy 12 hour vouchers for 8 euros. It was a faulty system, and when it failed (killing connections before 12 hours were up, and on one occasion failing within 20 minutes) I could not get a refund.Otherwise, a great place. I doubt I could have stayed anywhere else as nice for the money.

<Content>perfect position My wife and I have just come back from Berlin having competed in the Berlin marathon and have recommended this hotel to our travelling friends. The room although basic had everything we needed and was spotless. The hotel was in the perfect spot for us as we ate out every night at local restaurants up the road which were excellent value for money. Transport is very accessible with the S-bahn opposite and the U-bahn just down the street at Alexanderplatz. The staff were very professional and friendly and even though this can be a busy hotel they managed to attend to us quickly.The only downside was at breakfast as peak times could be a problem with so many people crowding the eating area due to the food being in a central area with tables at each side.We will be staying here again next year.

<Content>just what we needed in a hotel We stayed at the Ibis Mitte Hotel in Berlin for 7 nights in March 2006. Spotlessly clean, quiet and very convenient. We used the superette at the gas station next door for snacks...which I had not read about beforehand.The trolley is just outside the door, and the underground subway is 2 blocks away...as is a full grocery store.We would stay here again.

<Content>No problems at all My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in December 2004. We also took advantage of the 49 euro deal and it was great value for money considering that it is not much more than a private hostel room. Our double room on the 6th floor was spacious and clean. As you walk in there is a hanging rack and shelving unit, and then there is another door opening into the bedroom. This was useful in keeping out the sound of other guests walking along the corridoor. The bathroom was standard size, very clean, though it could have done with a better fan to get rid of the steam. There is a bar behind the reception desk, and though we didn't have a drink there, the prices were cheap and they also serve snacks like soups and nachos. The people at reception were very friendly and helpful, and kept the free apples and sweets at the front desk well stocked. We passed on the 9 euro breakfast and bought heated rolls and fruit from the petrol station next door - there are small tables where you can eat standing up, italian style.The location is not exactly smack bang in the centre of things, but the 10 min walk to Alexander Platz was nothing to complain about. Although the area doesn't look particularly appealing, we felt very safe walking around the area late at night. Berlin Mitte was a great area, lots of cosy little restaurants and shops which was about a 20 minute walk away. There are also many little bars to explore in the area north of the hotel. Though this hotel lacks charm and will not add to your 'german' experience, it is a very good option for those on a budget.

<Content>Best deal - fine place My wife and me stayed for two nights at Hotel Ibis Berlin Mitte at Jan 2005 end enjoying much our stay there. The hotel is modern, well equiped in a very good location for transports (The Tegel TXL bus just behind the corner). Nice and helping staff. Room with all you need - (extra soft towels etc.) - hair dryer at the reception. (There you can get an apple or candy even...) Wev'e got a special bargain price of 49 Euro - worth every cent! Recomended!! Nothing to do about the view of the factory nearby and the Alexander Platz - but you can overlook it.

<Content>very good value We visited Berlin in June 2004 and found the hotel very clean and the staff were very helpful. The rooms were larger than expected and great value for money. The hotel was within walking distance of Alexanderplatz where there is a very efficient metro system serving most areas of Berlin. In the evenings we visited some bars within walking distance of the hotel but admittedly hard to find which were open very late. I would definitely go back to this hotel again.

<Content>Nice hotel, good location We stayed at the Ibis Mitte for 3 nights at the start of December 2003. The hotel is in a good location, just 5 minutes walk from the Alexander Platz U-bahn, and you can easily walk all the way down to the Brandenburg gate from the hotel in a morning too. The staff were really friendly, the room was very clean, the hotel was clean and welcoming and the price very good. A really good place to stay.
