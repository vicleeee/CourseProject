<Content>Pretty good all round Stayed for one night pre cruise. Mainly because we were tired, but also because the airport courtesy phone (only to this hotel) was out of order, we took a ten minute $14 taxi ride. The hotel, despite being in an office block commercial area is quite impressive with a nice lobby and the general areas, particularly the bar, where we had a decent snack and the restaurant where we breakfasted were very nice. Pool area was also well kept with an unusual waterfall feature.All of the staff we met were pleasant and very helpful, the concierge arranged a cruiseport shuttle bus for us at $10 per head, but be aware a cab should only be $24 anyway.The corridors and rooms were disappointing. Everywhere was very clean but with obvious signs of wear and tear. Airport noise was just loud enough to be annoying even although our room was on the opposite side. View of the lagoon was nice but a new building was going up next door. There is nowhere else within walking distance to eat, but there is a small shopping centre about four blocks away. I would'nt discourage anyone to stay here but I expect there is better to be found.

<Content>Very Good Close To Hotel I have stayed at this hotel twice in November for one night each time when passing through Miami.The hotel is very convenient for the airport, with shuttles every half hour (be aware that you should proceed to the arrivals level to find the shuttle bus).The reception you receive is very friendly and efficient and the rooms are very clean.The cocktail bar is relaxing and Breakfast is a pleasant experience.Good gym, and pool area. It is difficult (apart form the occassional noisy jet) to know that you are just 5 minutes drive from MIA terminals.Not the cheapest, but represents good value for money, and strongly recommended.Berkshire jpb - 11/08

<Content>Bed from Heaven! This is a very nice and hip hotel and it's close to the airport, which has its advantages and disadvantages. The rooms are spacious and well appointed, everything is clean and the maid service really pays attention to details (such as replenishing toilettries and decorating the tissue box). The swimming pool area is well-kept and the waterfall is a definite plus. The bar has great cocktails, always served with a smile and a variety of snacks, which is a nice touch. But the highlight of my stay was the bed, probably the most comfortable I have ever seen. The combination of down comforter, pillows and featherbed was just heavenly. I highly recommend the hotel for anyone who needs to stay near the airport. It is not convenient for the beach area though. Other minuses were the fact that you can hear the airplanes land and take off (yes, the windows will vibrate), and the lack of free wireless internet although they have computers next to the bar that you can use at no charge. They also charge for parking but if you don't have a car they offer a free shuttle to/from the airport.

<Content>A good choice close to the airport Clean, safe, friendly staff, very good location for shopping (easy access to main roads on the way to the best malls and even in the neighborhood), good parking. If you don't need to go to downtown it's a very good place to stay.The only problem was with the tap of the tub which was not working well and I had to ask three times to be fixed and finally get to use the shower comfortably. The price was excellent, considering the category of the facilities.

<Content>Good value This is a very nice hotel ideal for the airport, being fairly close by shuttle service. The room was spacious and very clean and although typically furnished, it is quiet which is very important especially so close to an airport. Breakfast was good and hot and served quickly as we has an early fllight to catch. Check-in was very effecient with a porter bring up our luggage. I did feel that the bar was slightly overpriced, but being a captive audience, I suppose you expect this sort of thing. For an overnight stay to catch an early flight, I would definitly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great airport hotel!!! This was defenetly one of the best airport hotels i've stayed in!!! We stayed on one of the top floors and had a beautiful view of the lagoon. The room itself is very nice, rather modern which I personaly like. The bath is also very beautifull. The bed is incredibly comfortable!!!Room service is very good and friendly, as is the complete staff As we waited for the airport shuttle, the bellman gave us an ice cold water. The Starbuck in the loby is very handy and so are the computers with free internet. Didn't use the pool but it looked nice as well.Would stay there every time again!!!

<Content>Great hotel! My husband  I recently spent one night here  it is a beautiful hotel. We were in Miami the night before we left for a cruise. The hotel is 5-10 min from the airport and they run a shuttle from airport to hotel, which was very convenient. The concierge set us up with a shuttle from the hotel to the cruise ship pier which worked out very well. The property is beautiful and the staff was extremely nice  helpful. I highly recommend it.

<Content>Great airport hotel We stayed here one night, having just flown into Miami and before driving to the Keys the next day. The staff were helpful, friendly and efficient and we were given a free upgrade.Our suite was clean and nicely decorated. The bed and specially the pillows were so comfy that we wished we could have stayed longer! Breakfast was very nice and we would stay here again.

<Content>Overpriced and definitely not worth it. We booked this hotel for an overnight flight we had in Miami. From the website and reviews we thought it was going to be a nice trendy/new hotel, but it was far from it. You can tell it is an older hotel with a bad flip/lipstick remodel. Although they upgraded us to a suite complimentary, we didn't see it as an upgrade. Not only did it have a bad odor from the extremely old rug, it also wasn't completely furnished.Also, we wanted to order room service since we didn't arrive until late and had to catch the first flight out. They not only charge an automatic 19% gratuity to any order you make, but they also charge a $2 delivery charge. I can understand papa johns charging a delivery charge to cover the gas increase, but when it is room service, I think that is just ridiculous.Paying $120/night, this hotel was extremely overpriced for the quality.

<Content>Not all that I know this review is a bit late, but thought I'd give my two cents anyways. My sister booked 3 rooms at the Sofitel via Priceline. Reading the reviews/pictures, the hotel looked nice. We got the price of $120/night for each room. We were on a family cruise and the Sofitel was our post cruise hotel. It was a convenient location, free shuttle to the airport. the next morning for our flight back home. We got off the cruise ship and headed to the hotel in our rental car. The first thing we noticed was that you had to pay for parking! I did not think that was necessary in a hotel where there wasn't much around anyways, mostly office buildings and parking did not look like it was at a premium. We were early checking in and wanted to drop our bags off first because we were planning on spending our day at Sawgrass Outlet Mall (which is amazing!). It was around 12 and no rooms were available so we put all of our luggage/bags on one cart and asked the bellhop to store our stuff and when our room was ready, just to put all of the luggage/bags into one room and we would deal with it when we got back. We did tip him and he did put all of our stuff in one room which was great. We shopped all day and by the time we got back at the hotel after dinner, it was late. We decided to return the rental car instead and that way we did not have to pay for the parking. We were all so tired by the end of this and we still had to pack/re-arrange our luggage to make room for our purchases from Sawgrass. When I walked into the room, what a surprise. The room looked very old/worn, nothing like the pictures! The red door to our room looked like it was from the beginning of time! The carpet looked gross and dirty, the walls needed a paint job, the washroom did not even look that clean! There was actually a used q-tip on the floor under the sink! My brother took a shower and he said there was no water pressure and it was not draining properly, he was in 3inches of water while showering! I did not bother to even shower. We had 2 queen beds that looked very nice, presentation wise. I was looking so forward to just getting some sleep but it was the worst bed I have ever slept in! It must have been 20 years old! I was afraid to pull the beds sheets off the bed just to look at the mattress. It was so soft/un-supporting that I just sunk in. I woke-up with a sore back of course. I would not recommend this hotel, I think you would be better off at the Hampton Inn where you even get breakfast included with your stay. I was on the 9th floor, first room on the right - so if you get that room, try and switch!

<Content>One of the best we've been to....!!!! We were so overwhelmed by how good this hotel was that we are still talking about it. Great room with a fabulous bed we did not want to leave. We never saw a maid or cart in the hall, yet all was always perfect and clean. The staff above all were superlative. Each and every one was more than friendly and helpful. And the food, for fussy world travelers, was really delicious and beautifully presented. This hotel is way superior to most Miami Beach hotels and if you have a car the 15 minute ride to the beach is not bad. Besides, there is a fun pool at the hotel with a gigantic waterfall so you always hear the wooosh of water.

<Content>Great stay We were only here for one night on our way back from Costa Rica and REALLY wanted some authentic Cuban food. The staff was great and gave us directions to the greatest Cuban place and then directions from there to South Beach. They even highlighted the route on a map for us. Sounds like a little thing to do, but it seems hard to get anyone to do anything for hotel guests anymore.The room was very nice and the bed was so soft (especially compared to the ones we had been sleeping in during our Costa Rica trip).I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Perfect if you want to be close to the airport Very comfortable hotel with a nice bar area, free internet access, lovely pool and friendly staff. Only issue is that it is quiet a distance from south beach and the main tourist areas (30 dollars in a taxi). But overall this is a good airport hotel and would defo reccomend it

<Content>Pleasant staff and very nice My husband and I are very pleased with this lovely hotel. We were greeted warmly, even though we booked through a discount travel agency. Our room is large, king size bed and non smoking. The hotel has all the amenities we could want. (does not have a fridge, but we didn't need one, nor want one). I suppose a person could find minor flaws in the rooms, but really, they are minor!! Our room is immaculately clean. The bed is comfortable and cozy. The onsite restaurant is expensive and there isn't much within walking distance (so far I haven't found anything, but I'm still looking). We'll probably have dinner here. There is a lovely lagoon behind the hotel which can be seen from some of the rooms, I'm sure, but we have a front of the hotel view.The pool is really pretty and convenient. Exercise room is around the corner from the pool. Starbucks (mini) on site. They don't have the skinny latte's, which I generally get, but you can still order non fat latte's. (same thing without the SF syrups)We are staying one night at the end of a cruise with NCL. and paid $12 each for a shuttle from the port to the hotel door. Parking is an additional fee, I believe $8 if you have an auto. For the price we paid, ($119, $138 after taxes and resort fees) we think we got a great deal.

<Content>Pretty nice hotel. I liked the hotel. They added a lot of nice touches, such as the paintings on the walls and sculptures in the lobby. The pool was nice and clean, as well. You could tell in some places that the hotel had been renovated, but they did a good job. The only problem I found was with the cleanliness. The first room we stayed in was leaking water in the ceiling. It was raining in Miami. The toilet in that room was also not clean. The good thing is, before we could call the front desk to complain, the bellman had already told the front desk what happened and they called me and offered us an upgrade. That was good. In the new room, one of the beds had crumbs in it. When I called housekeeping to ask them to change the bed, they never showed up. We were late for dinner, so we left and came back later that night. When we got back, I called housekeeping again and the night shift was great! They came right away and changed the bed and even redid the bathroom and touched up the entire room. They were also very nice about it. I'm a travel agent and I got a good deal on the room at $199 a night. All in all, it was nice for a night and the staff were very nice and hardworking, except the day housekeeping staff.

<Content>Not as appears We thought this hotel would be convenient to the airport and looked exceptionally nice. We were kind of surprised to find that it was a longer drive than expected to the airport. It was situated near a runway however, and we heard planes landing all night long! Also, the photos on the site made it look MUCH nicer than the rooms actually were. Some have been fixed up and some have not. We got a have not room and it was pretty bad. There were hairs on the bathroom floors, beat up tiles, chipping counter tops, dirty carpets, etc. Yet it was $250 a night! What a rip-off. I would have left if we hadn't checked in so late. We complained in the morning and they immediately gave us $50 off room price. It was as if they are used to the complaints and have a policy in place to discount your room price by $50.I would not stay here again, no matter how close to the airport!

<Content>Not Great I stayed there mid March and it needs a big do over.The Lobby is OK but the room is tired. Holes in the blackout,louvre missing on the closet,curtains do not shut properly and the bath tub was plain dirty with mold and a need for regrouting.The amount of noise from a garbage pick up at 6 am woke up all the rooms I am sure.AAA should check this out again as it is not up to there standards

<Content>Nice stay at the Sofitel We found this hotel through Trip Advisor and booked it through Travelocity. It is very difficult to get a hotel in the Miami area at this time of year for just one night. We were leaving on a cruise on the next day. A hotel shuttle circles through the Miami airport every half hour. you just go out and wave it down. There is no charge for this service. While you are close to the airport, the rooms are very quiet. We got in early enough to use the pool area (where you sometimes did hear jets). Check in was quite easy, however I had to tell the receptionist that I was a Sofitel preferred guest. She did not see this on the reservation, even though I had specifically called the hotel with my guest number. She asked me for my number, which I happened to have on me. While I was getting it out, she found it on the original reservation. This entitled us to a free drink at the bar (quite delicious in a very nice setting). She also gave us a cork to use for a free glass of wine with a food order. We did have lunch in the restaurant. It was rather pricey, but it was convenient and quite good.The room was nice, much like the pictures on the website. The bed was quite comfortable. However, in a few areas, the wallpaper was beginning to peel away from the wall. The bathroom was very clean. Toiletries were from France. We took a cab from the hotel into South Beach. It was rather expensive. I think it was about $40 or $50, one way. The concierge told us that a shuttle to the port was available on the hour in the morning. he put our name of the list. Cost was $10 per person. It was there promptly at 12:00 p.m.Check out was easy and the bill was accurate.

<Content>Top Shelf We stayed at the Sofitel for one night pre cruise. This hotel is first class all the way. We were picked up at the airport by the hotel shuttle (that serves you cold bottled water) from a pleasant and helpful driver. The check in was quick and courteous from classy uniformed staff. The room was very comfortable, probably the best sleep ever. None of us wanted to get out of bed. The bar / common lounge allowed the entire family to sit and enjoy a drink and some appies prior to the excellent dinner we enjoyed. It would be nice if the pool was heated, but this wasn't a big deal.You won't be disappointed.

<Content>Excellent and good value We stayed one night as it's very close to the airport and we had an early departure. It's only a 5 min drive from the airport but you don't hear much plane noise.All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.The room was a good size although the bathroom was slightly smaller than expected. The main point is that everything is spotlessly clean and very comfortable.A couple of things were missing though - no safe and minibar which I expect as standard in this class of hotel.We arrived quite late and didn't wander around the area but there is a tiny shop in the lobby for small items such as bottled water and crisps/chips.No complaints about the food as both room service and breakfast was good and reasonable value too.Strongly recommended

<Content>Slightly Below Sofitel Standards, but Still Good The Sofitel Miami is located just 5 minutes by car from the Miami Airport. Half the rooms offer a nice view of the lagoon.The rooms are very spacious and feature the usual Sofitel bed (my favorite). The bathrrom were OK, but felt more like those you'd expect from a Hilton or a Marriott.Those driving will find the parking lot in front of the hotel very convenient. You do howeever need to pay before exiting (like in any parking lot). The room service food I had was excellent and prepared on time. I enjoyed the outdoor pool as the gym is also convenient.The shortcomings of the hotel were the lack of minibars in the room, the Marriott/Hilton style bathrroms and the fact that ice cream (in room-service) was only available in pints (Ben  Jerry's). Also, I wanted a pair of slippers (not already in the room) to go to the swimming pool but getting the message across to the spanish-speaking maids proved VERY difficult.The staff was very friendly and helpful during my stay.

<Content>Decent, but not special Stayed at the Sofitel Miami pre-cruise for one night. Received a discount through a professional org.; wasn't dirt cheap but was much better than the advertised rate. Hotel shuttle from airport was speedy and we didn't wait long at the curb. Bed, as others have mentioned, was very nice. Firm, but not like a slab of rock. Our room was adequate, but kind of run down overall. Bathroom grout was stained and the bathroom sink cabinet was shabby and marked up. The TV speaker in the bathroom was a nice surprise. Kind of freaky at first, but then I realized how much I enjoyed being able to listen to the news while I was primping. Our room was really nothing special - didn't feel like a fancy hotel. Airport noise was not a bother. Service was prompt, efficient, and mostly friendly. Breakfast buffet was average - had some French touches (crepes, jams, fancy eggs). Coffee was served from a French press and was delicious. We noticed little bugs crawling up the wall by our table (we ate inside). None on the table, but that still gave me the willies. The shuttle to the Port of Miami was very affordable. I suppose I was hoping for something a little more special and distinctive when I booked the Sofitel Miami - we were celebrating our anniversary (hence the cruise getaway) and I wanted our whole vacation to be awesome. I didn't feel like the Sofitel met my expectations in this regard. It wasn't as lush as I had hoped and was led to believe.

<Content>great stopover Having one night stopover in miami between flights it could not of worked better. Arrived at miami airport with no hotel booked and rang the sofitel from an ad at airport .The hotel told us to get on the sofitel bus which leave regulary from airport which turned up virtually straight away. The lobby and bar areas look fantastic with a stunning swimming pool directly outside. The beds were extremely comfortable and rooms a nice size with a great lake view. This is a 4 star hotel and a good one at that. Probably not a holiday hotel as it is not to close to beaches but very good value for what we paid i would definately stay here again in simular circumstances.

<Content>OK if you get it at a discount I had signed up for the Sofitel Priviledge program hoping that it would be the start of a beautiful relationship, but such was not the case. Arrived at 1:30 in the morning, which meant that I had missed the last airport shuttle and had to pay $15 for a cab. My request for reimbursement was met with a Gallic shrug. There was no indication that my room had been upgraded and no so-called welcoming gift. The sour faced bartender tried to cheat me by charging half price for the guaranteed free glass of wine. There were a few things that I liked: the free internet in the lobby, the quietness considering its proximity to the airport, the comfortable bed, the $10 per person shuttle to the Port of Miami and the relatively easy walk to nearby shopping, pharmacy, restaurants and manicure/pedicure. All in all, it was not too bad an experience and I would probably stay at this hotel again, but only if I got a steeply discounted rate through Hotwire.

<Content>A Fairfield Inn Masquerading as a Sofitel Prior to this stay, I had thought luxury when Sofitel came up. No more. While there were some nice aspects to our stay, we would not return and not recommend others go. Trip Adviser has stellar reviews of other hotels within walking distance. Our seminal experience was at Le Bar. Surly Sam, the bartender, basically told us what we could do with the TV remote. (Should he have taken the day off?) He had gone missing when a group of young men were seeking drinks. He showed after an 'underling' had appeared to take care of the men, and Sam treated his 'underling' as well as he treated us. I must admit he was upstaged by the cost of 2 drinks here. We were in South Beach one night and got twice the number of drinks plus some delicious bruschetta for the same price of two drinks here. Note that was in South Beach. However, if getting insulted and soaked is your objective, go to Le Bar!On a positive note, the lobby leads to a stunning seating area overlooking the lagoon. The concierge and bell staff is first-rate. Check-in and out was efficient and friendly. Going upstairs we found the hallways unexceptional to dull. The drab wallpaper was rippled or torn or scuffed. The room was OK. As a previous reviewer said, there is no sheet between you and the comforter, leading us to wonder if a clean comforter is placed on the bed after every guest? No mini-bar. The room was spacious with a nifty little alcove with chaise for reading or watching TV. The bed was comfortable. Nice closet with iron and ironing board. Room service for our morning coffee was always friendly and timely.So what else is not to like: the noise in the hallways. This is the first place I have ever encountered a dog barking in the hallway about midnight. Lots of talking and yelling back and forth several times. No fan in the bathroom, so you have to open the door to clear the condensation. The towels are thin and few. (We stayed at a Hyatt a couple months ago and had a towel rack full of towels in our bath. How can you wash your hair and get it dry with the same towel you have to dry yourself with?) As a final note of disbelief, our maid left us no wash cloths on our final night there. Why on earth do they have you come and go with an activated parking card when you can enter after a certain time without using it? When the woman at the gate tried to explain, we couldn't understand her, and she couldn't understand us. Yes, I know they want to extract their daily $8 but this system isn't reliable. We had the same lack of understanding with messages left for us. I love other languages, but the whole reason for speaking is to be understood. I've gone on more than enough. We wished we had stayed elsewhere. I later learned for the amount we paid (sorry it wasn't Priceline but through a travel agent), we could have had oceanfront at the Marriott!

<Content>Overnight stay Sofitel is 5 minutes from the airport and we used it as a stop over prior to our flight home after a cruise.The hotel is clean and tidy and good value for money, the restaurant is pricy but the food was off a high standardThe rooms wer large but basic, no fridge, tea making .The area around the hotel has no facilities so if you require food or drinks etc you are tied to the hotel which has a Starbucks but this is only open at certain times.The shuttle service is free and is very good.Would stay here again if i only needed to sleep and it was one night

<Content>Can recommend the Sofitel Airport Miami Excellent hotel from speedy check-in onwards. Only 5-10 minutes walk to local shops including Publix (open Sunday), restaurants and RC church. Rooms were clean ,comfortable and quiet, breakfast buffet good, staff helpful, pool area clean and uncrowded with lovely view of the lagoon. We didn't find the 24 hour hotel cafe until the following morning - not realising you have to walk through the restaurant to get there. Maybe it should be signposted? My only other adverse comment would be that the airport shuttle bus filled very quickly on Sat evening - we were lucky, but others at the second terminal were left behind. Still, at the price we paid on Hotwire I'd be more than happy to take a cab. I'd stay here again and recommend it to others

<Content>So-So At the Sofitel Miami Not exactly what you would expect from the Sofitel brand. Two strange things: there was no sheet under the bed cover and our Christmas presents were unwrapped by housekeeping! They didn't take anything, but you could clearly tell that they tried to re-wrap it but they did such a poor job that it was obvious! I don't know about you, but I leave my luggage in the room with the belief that they will be safe - not rummaged through!The staff, other than the peeking into gifts, were very nice - the concierge was especially helpful and nice (I called three times for directions and he was more than helpful, he even offered to stay on the phone to help me find the exit). Other than that, I was disappointed. The hotel was dull, there were cobwebs (with spiders) in the walkway to the room, it was quite shabby on the outside and there was no coffeepot in the room. It was, however, clean.

<Content>Great style, a few things could be improved though The hotel lobby, bar, restaurant and pool are very stylish, as well as the room itself. The furniture did however look a bit oldish. Surprisingly, my room did not have either a safe or a minibar. On top, Internet access was not free ($9 a day). Similarly, the parking was not free, even for the guests ($8 a night). Given the location of the hotel, there is nothing you can do there without a car...For a hotel of this class, I was surprised that these amenities were not included.Otherwise, my stay was nice.

<Content>A fab hotel. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone. This hotel is bright and the decor very modern. It was extremely clean and the beds were really comfortable. It has excellent food and the staff are really helpful and attentive.Although It's close to the airport you couldn't hear it during the night.I thoroughly recommend this one for either holidays or just a one night stay.

<Content>Sofitel noy up to standards As you may see in my previous reviews, I am not a moaner and all of my hotel stays have been good to perfect, but I must admit that this one is a NO NO!!We stayed at the Sofitel in Miami because we thought that Sofitel was a luxurious brand name. What a mistake concerning Miami. It is run down and needs a BIG renovation. Our room (502) on the fifth floor had views of the restaurant extractors which made a lot of noise during the night. (more than the planes opposite taking off and arriving at the airport!!). The rooms are describes as French chic (I live in France) Ours was cheap looking with stained carpet. They have NO safe, NO tea  coffee, NO minibar, NO fridge. The dirty windows looked on to a small balcony which was closed as there were 2 rusty unused air conditioning machines (or some sort of machines) lying on the floor in abandon. The drapes didn't close properly, and the toilet dripped all night long. All this for a chic hotel. I would have prefered to stay in a cheaper hotel nearer the city center or even next door at one of the other airport hotels. There is also NO valet service for the car park. I will not go again!!

<Content>Felt like a Valued Guest We stayed at the Sofitel Miami airport pre cruise 3rd Nov 2007 this was recommened to us by our travel agent. From being picked up at the airport Saturday afternoon to checking out Sunday lunch time staff could not do enough for us to make our stay feel special. On arrival they apologised our room was not ready so they gave us a drinks voucher for the bar and looked after our luggage. We did not make it to the bar before a staff member advised us the room was ready and our luggage was on its way. Later in the evening we went down to the bar to use our drinks vouchers. Even though there was a wedding party in the bar area the bar tender acknowledged us and we were served very quickly. Another staff member found us a seat in the bar area and took our food order. I know it was only burger , fries cheesecake and coffee. But either it was the long flight from the UK or one of the best bar meals we have ever had,service was 1st class.Our room was very quiet and the bed was just heaven in the morning we had breakfast really good value. Hotel arranged for transport to the cruise port checkout smooth and they wished us a happy cruise. We will use this hotel next time we are in Miami and recommend it to our friends on cruise critic web site.

<Content>Really liked the Sofitel.......hated the inflated prices for food November 9, 2007We stayed at the Sofitel for one night prior to our cruise. Things started off rocky when we waited for over 20 minutes for the complimentary shuttle to the hotel. Why it took over 20 minutes for the shuttle seemed ridiculous since the hotel is approximately 1.5 miles from the airport.I thought the hotel was very nice and everyone we encountered was very nice and helpful. We had a room with two beds since there were three of us. I thought the room was very nice and the beds and bedding were wonderful. I will say that the bathroom could use a little sprucing up.......the white ceramic tile has seen better days. I did however like the complimentary toiletries.With the exception of some fast food places there aren't many places to eat that don't require a minimum taxi ride of $15 each way. We did walk to Walgreens to pick up some last minute items for the cruise.My biggest gripe was that the prices to eat at the hotel were outrageous...............$8 for a bowl of french onion soup, entrees at the restaurant were $25 and above. We ended up ordering room service for dinner which cost approximately $35 since by the time we took a taxi ride for $30 and then you add dinner on top of that. The food was good though. We also ate at the hotel for breakfast for convenience and the bill came to $55 for three people. I had a bowl of oatmeal that was $7and my husband and son had the all you can eat breakfast buffet. I think you can do the math. I

<Content>Not Worth The Money Stayed one night. Pictures on internet do not paint clear picture of this location. Drinks at bar (draft beer $8.00)and food menu prices are very high, rooms are dirty with spots on the rug and chairs, dirty windows with pigeon stuff on the ledges, no towels at pool and overall poor service from front desk staff. This hotel must of been great years ago, but needs some major fixing up. Overall, the hotel wants to paint a picture as a top quality 4 star European hotel, but it has far to go in my opinion. In the morning, I woke up to find take out menus (Chinese Food and Pizza) under my door and my room was on the 7th floor. Where was the security. No great shakes for the money, but is close to airport with an early morning shuttle. Will not stay again.

<Content>Simply....... WOW This hotel is simply beautiful. When we arrived, my husband was like, WOW this is our hotel???? and thought I paid much more than I actually did. The service was great, every one was very friendly and kind. Unfortunately we didn't get there until like 9:30pm or so, and were unable to enjoy some of the things the hotel has to offer, but still enjoyed our stay. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. I am in LOVE with the down comforter they have. We had a king room booked I believe, but they were out so they gave us a 2 queen with a lagoon view, so that was fine with me. The only thing that was not up to standards was the pool water was very cold. I don't know if it was because it was late and it had been storming the past few days, or if they keep it that cold. We couldn't really enjoy the pool too much. The breakfast was very expensive; I had expected the restraunts to be that way but wow! I absolutely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again; I just wouldn't eat there :)

<Content>Good stay Stayed 3 nights for a business meeting. It was a very nice stay, very close to airport, food was good, nice room, but appeared a little dated, nice restaurant and meeting rooms. Shuttle bus available for Dolphin Mall for only $5 return which was a great deal vs taxi of $25 each way. Concierge very helpful in choosing restaurants, securing taxi and also giving me bottles of water. Fitness centre equipment was excellent and well maintained although not air conditioned which was uncomfortable. The pool also nice with a good view. Only complaint, was that one break period, lots of ants over our food. But it seemed to be solved for the next day.

<Content>Good - But Not Great The room was nice, lobby and check-in pretty good and bed was very comfy. Pleasant surroundings overall. However - the walls are very thin. I could hear everything in the hallway. When soors slammed, my bed shook. And yes, you are at the airport. So you will hear the occasional plane rumbling nearby. The location is pretty good. I'd give this place about a B.

<Content>Great Airport Hotel Travelling to Miami for work, practicality usually wins over and I end up staying near in the Airport vicinity. However, the Sofitel makes up for this in leaps and bounds. It is in a standalone building with a large carpark and easy access. The rooms are very nicely furnised. Service is excellent with good amenities. On my last stay in mid August it was about 10pm and my TV wasn't working. They called out the Maitenance manager who gave it a quick look then said it would be easier to move to a room two doors down, if I would like. He arranged everything and had the new keys delivered and wiped the cost of the room service dinner I had had to cover the inconvience. Top marks!!!!I also had the pleasure of spending some time in the pool which was very enjoyable and the bartender (during the day) in the downstairs bar was a great assett to the hotel. Again top marks. No complaints and would recommend this hotel. The rates were very reasonable.

<Content>Sofitel Miami Style Over the years we have stayed many times at the Sofitel near the airport in Miami. We are always surprised at how good the service is and how clean, stylish,  chic the rooms are. Granted, we are there on business, but it is a such a delight to find a great priced hotel with all the nice amenities and European service. I would recommend it over most of the airport area hotels.

<Content>New favorite! This was our 3rd time this year to stay at this hotel. It is our new favorite for sure. We used to stay in SoBe all the time but now prefer to stay here. The bed! OMG the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Check is in easy. Rooms are spacious and very clean. We had room service every morning (continental breakfast. Yum) and the staff were so nice. Housekeeping was invisible. We never saw them yet our room was spotless when we returned every afternoon. We never dined in the restaurant as we prefered to cab it across to the restaurants in South Beach for dinner. It doesn't cost a thing to sign up with the hotel group (accor) and become a member. For that you get some perks which include early check in and late check out, and free cocktails on arrival. Maybe even an upgrade to a one bedroom suite (we got that once!). Enjoy!

<Content>pleasantly surprised As we booked an airport hotel we were not expecting a lot. But after taking the shuttle bus to the hotel and painless checking in, I was very surprised with the size of the room. Our rooms were a lot nicer than we expected them to be for what we were paying. There was plently of space in the rooms to leave luggage lying around, an extra bed and a cot without much trouble. In comparison with other 4 star hotels this was therefore a bonus. Although there was no fridge in our rooms, when we asked for it ( for medical reasons and for storing babyfood) a minifridge was delivered without any questions asked.The kids loved the pool and it was very pleasant to sit by the pool for the adults too.The hotel did get busy with airline staff and cruisers at some point, but neverfelt overcrowded.Free internet access for guests in the lobby was very useful and the computers were usually available.Even when sitting outside, I can't remember that we were bothered by the noise of airplanes, so I guess that only some rooms have problems with their windows. Mind you, we do live in London and are therefore used to airplane noise living under numerous flightpaths.I agree with the other guests that the hotel restaurant is expensive but since we only stayed there for two nights, we didn't get the chance to really find out whatelse was around. If you can, find out where to go instead of the hotel restaurant before your arrival.Overall, very nice rooms and good hotel with adequate facilities.

<Content>Good Value - - Needs Some Updating I've stayed at this hotel on three different occasions.Pros:1. Service: Excellent service. Staff are polite, professional, and prompt. Perfect.2. Beds: Very comfortable. The feather beds they use make the beds almost addictive. As good or better than Westin Heavenly Bed or Marriott Revive.3. Pool: This hotel has a very nice pool area.4. Conference Service: excellent. Our lunch was excellent too.5. Location: across the freeway from the airport. Only 15 - 20 minutes from South Beach. Longer during rush hour.Cons:1. This hotel could use some renovation. I didn't think it was dirty, but needed to be painted. Other than that, no problems. I think this hotel is a good value.

<Content>Disgusting 1. Dirty over all! the carpet in my room was from 1978 when it used to becalled a holiday inn, I felt like I got dirty just closing the drapes(which were old school thick plastic daylight killers from an all nightroadside motel)2. Noisy! not only did they put me next to elevator and ice machine, butmy window was on airport side and not sealed so I felt like I was in theair traffic control tower3. Rate! They charged me over two times the rate at which I booked, which isnow in dispute with the credit card company. To further the point they claim a paperlesscheck in and you never sign a rate card and paperless check out so Iwouldn't have seen the bill without asking4. No amenities! No mini bar, no store in lobby, no coffee in lobby, nomorning newspaper in room, small weird wash cloths, only 2 towels total,tiny crappy shampoo, smallest  worst TV seemingly purchased second handfrom closing Holiday Inn in Bulgaria (with only 20 channels), no magazines in room, dirty iron that soiled my shirt, no bible,no pen, no writing paper5. No Sheets!! 20,000 room nights in that bed before me and no sheets to cover the mattress????? Agghhhh!!!!6. Other. clicker didn't work, door lock questionable, I could hearpeople walking to elevator and getting ice from the 1 inch gap at base ofdoor, total pain parking with the gate and tickets (I had about 10 ticketsin my car console by end of 3 days and it took 10 min to get out eachtime), above ground backyard pool, no place to jog

<Content>Very nice but restaurant way overpriced. My wife and I stayed for one night after coming back from a cruise. We pulled into port at 8:am Friday morning but checkin wasn't until 3:00pm. We took a chance and arrived at the hotel around 11:00am. Our room wasn't ready but the clerk offered to upgrade us to a business suite at no extra charge! I thought I already got a great deal for a regular room at $145/night but now I got a business suite worth $325. The staff was very accomodating and very helpful. The beds are very very comfortable. The pool with it's waterfall is really cool. The airport is only five minutes away and they provide free shuttle service. Since we didn't have a rental car, they provided a driver to drive us to a local restaurant at no charge. The one downside about the hotel that I can mention is the menu prices. I checked the restaurant menu and the entree's were very pricey, all $20+. So we ordered room service for a light meal. Two panini bread sandwichs with fries and a liter bottle of water: $42.00! By the pool we had two strawberry daquiris: $21.00! This did not include tips. But overall, I had a great stay and if I'm ever there again I'll use their shuttle service to a local restaurant.

<Content>Comfortable stay We stayed here after being married  prior to cruising the next day for our honeymoon. It did result in a funny story to tell  all worked out well. When we arrived they checked us in, but upon getting to our room, found a half naked man just out of the shower! We went back to the front desk  explained, the man showed up  basically he had asked for a late check out at 2pm and they had cleaned the room thinking he had left, but he never did! Funny start to our newly married life, but not their fault. They were very accomodating and gave us a much larger suite, many extra towels when we asked and a $100 certificate to the restaurant. We found the bed to be wonderfully relaxing  comfortable, the shower pressure was great, the meal in the restaurant was very upscale  delicious. No sounds from being near the airport at all! Overall, a great stay and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Will never ever ever ever return! We stayed at the Sofitel Miami on May 13th, prior to a cruise leavingfrom the Port of Miami.Unfortunately our bags were lost by the airline, so we didn't have any toiletries (e.g. razor, deodorant, etc). We asked the front desk if the could provide us with these items, just for the night. Insteadof providing this complimentary they charged us almost $30 for it. During our last trip we stayed at different hotels (Travelodge, Hyatt, Ritz Carlton and Hilton) but all hotels provided these items complimentary, upon request or in some cases without even asking.When the above was over with, we went up to our room to find a dirty room with numerous hairs in the bathroom. The give us a new room without hesitation.The hotel is nice, but the service is (besides the shuttledriver) very very bad.In this aspect, I would like to share our experiences with Royal Caribbean the day after our stay at Sofitel. When we arrived at the ship we told them that we were expecting our luggage in one of the ports of call. They wrote everything down and said they would contact the airline.After we checked in they, without asking for it, gave us two t-shirts, two toiletbags with all the necessary toiletries, a voucher so that we could get our laundry done (free of charge) and a voucher for a free tuxedo rental at formal night. We have never had service that good! Thank you Royal Caribbean.

<Content>Decent Hotel We flew in to Miami prior to a conference at another venue and spent two nights here. I was impressed with the hotel and found the room large.The bar area had a strange atmosphere but was friendly enough and the bar tender was excellent. Bar meals were also excellent value.The breakfast tried to be very upmarket and was of good quality. I'm glad that I wasn't paying for it as I found the cost of over $25 to be a little steep.The location was excellent for a late arrival or in need of an early departure but then again most airport hotels are! The check-in was friendly but none of our rooms were ready (I was travelling with two other business partners) - a bit odd considering we arrived at 8:30 in the evening!All in all, I would certainly recommend this hotel for air travellers as the standard is good.

<Content>Will NOT Return We pre-paid for the trip through AAA. I called the hotel the day before our trip to confirm and everything was fine. When we arrived to the hotel after a very long day of travel we had to deal with an incredibly nasty front desk manager who insisted we provide proof of the pre-payment (she demanded a bank statement from 6 months ago!). We spent our first hour calling our travel agent  credit card co in an effort to have a fax sent of the confirmation. I found the rooms to be OK - not great. Bathroom VERY small. Not enough bath towels. Although we did meet a few nice employees(the shutte driver was wonderful)- overall we felt that the service had quite the attitude. I would never return here and would not recommend the hotel to anyone.

<Content>Not all it's cracked up to be The hotel staff were very nice at check-in. The lobby area is beautiful at first glance. We had problems getting a top sheet for our bed. I never heard of using a blanket instead of a sheet. Never got one when I asked. Also, they are stingy in the towel situation. We got 2 bath towels and one hand towel. So, if you wanted to take a shower in the morning, you were out of luck if you didn't hang your towel.Also, there was broken glass by the pool and a child got hurt during our stay. It may be impossible to prevent this but they really need someone to do a clean sweep of the pool area every morning. Plus, they had no immediate first aid available. It was uncomfortable to witness.We ate in the dining room for dinner. Very overpriced and not a very good value for the money. After spending $279.00 for four, I was quite disappointed. Plus, I shared an entree with another person in my party!!!!!!!It's not all it's cracked up to be. I did get a letter of apology from the manager so I guess they are paying attention to reviews.I wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Well-appointed  I was fairly impressed with the look and feeling of the hotel upon entering the lobby. The check-in process went smoothly, and the staff were great. My room was on the 9th floor, looking out toward the runway/airport (there was very little noise from the planes). The decor and furnishings were very classy and bed was plush  comfortable. Because I had visited the hotel's website, I had slightly higher expectations about the degree of luxury and grandness.... the room was very nice but not as amazing as the website represented. Overall, I'd give the hotel 4 out of 5 stars, and would likely return.

<Content>Everything I thought Miami would be Went during June for a Business Trip, really liked the hotel. The food was GREAT. The restaurant was clean and upscale with the Miami look to it. The beds were just awesome, duvet covers and feather beds! It was very clean and very quiet the entire stay. Took a tour of South Beach, the tour driver picks you up from the Hotel. The front Desk was extremely helpful arranging this for me. The hotel was next to a Lagoon and very beautiful at sunset. The pool was nice too. Internet connections in the room was accommodating. If I could afford to I'd stay there again for sure, even if it is beside the airport.

<Content>Nice Facility, Accommodating Staff Lovely hotel, large clean rooms, very nice pool and spa. We also enjoyed breakfest in the hotel resturant. Proximity to airport and free and frequent shuttle service made it very convienient for our travel stopover. On arrival, our flight was delayed 4 hours, and the staff made a special effort to feed us after the resturant had closed. The morning we checked out, they also did a rush order breakfest for us so we could get to the airport and catch our international flight.

<Content>Great Hotel For A Night We stayed here for one night after arriving at Miami airport quite late from a flight from the UK. We arrived at this hotel at about 10 oclock at night and were greeted by a door man. I had booked a standard double room on a website and when we checked in, a friendly man told us that he given us a room with a nice king bed. This was a pleasant surprise, and the room was great. It was spacious with a surprisingly large and very clean bathroom. The bed was gorgeous, so soft, it was just what we needed. The view from the window is of the Lagoon and airport run way. We slept very well and did not get disturbed by the planes at all. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel, we had a quick look, but it looked a bit fancy for what we needed after our flight. So we drove out to Coral Gables area and grabbed a bite at Dennys. After a great sleep we checked out first thing in the morning, but we would definately stay again. It is a great place for a good night sleep after a long flight.

<Content>Com si, com ca My wife and I stayed in the Sofital Miami when we were on our way to South America. We arrived from the West Coast and stayed overnight continuing our trip the next evening. We arrived in Miami International Airport at about 10PM, we called the hotel for the shuttle but it never showed up. Another hotels shuttle took us there. We tipped the driver generously. Hotel was pretty good, my wife ordered room service that evening and it was way overpriced. Breakfast was good the next morning. The hotel was nice enough to let us stay until 6PM with no charge as our flight was not leaving until late that night. Overall good. But convenient only if you wish to catch a flight at MIA because it is not conveniently located close to anything else.

<Content>Nice Hotel Nice room check in was a breeze but not to much to do near there if you don't have a rental car so felt a bit stranded for the better part of the day i spent there. Did take a walk to a local supermarket to buy some water and snacks. Food was good for the most part but the same as you would find in any hotel. Bar pricing was a bit high for a glass of wine with tip $16 bit over priced. Would stay there again one nice thing i did find out is that they have a suttle service to the port of miami for $10 per person one way. Better than the $35 taxi fare that they charge

<Content>Watch out when you call! When I tried to make a reservation for april 07, their web site mal funtioned. ( after I clicked to finalize the reservation and my personal infos were already entered)I wanted to follow up with the hotel and see if my transation went through so I called the hotel reservation directly to inquire.The girl from the reservation department would not check her computer to see if my reservation made through. To my multiple requests to check her computer, she replied,  did you get a confirmation number at the end? with an attitute.When I told her that I wasn't too sure about it, she replied, then you don't have a reservation.We did this same dialogue three times until I was irritated enough to tell her to just forget it.In my opinion, the person who handles phone represents the image of the hotel. If that's the attitute I will face when I get there, I should just forget about it and move on to another hotel.

<Content>Nice, comfortable stay but they charge extra for car parking I stayed there for one night. The hotel was very clean and had an upscale feel to it. The room was nice, comfortable, and quiet. The only thing I didn't like was that they charged extra for parking my rental car. I guess other hotels in that area do the same.

<Content>Excellent value! Good points: Good location and has comfortable beds. Excellent value, we paid 125$ directly through their website per night. Would stay here again. Property well kept and extremely clean.No so good points: Had supper on New Year's Eve at their restaurant, quite pricey for selection which was offered. Kitchen seemed unorganized, several tables were complaining. Maitre D seemed overwhelmed, and offered free bottle of Champagne to almost all tables to compensate for mediocre food and service.Vending machines were defective and would not accept paper denomination, when asking the front desk for change, no one was of any help. Pool was cold, would be great if it were heated.

<Content>Overall good experience High class hotel. Overall great staff and fast, friendly service. Not so impressed with the restaurant. Food was way overpriced compared to the quality. Our waiter was terrible. Dinner took over 2 hours with lots of idle time. Rooms and especially the beds were wonderful. Great rates on Sofitel's website.

<Content>Love this hotel! We booked this hotel through Priceline for $80 and had not heard of it before, so we were a little skeptical. This is by far the best hotel we have ever stayed at. The shuttle was a bit slow (but what shuttle isnt at a busy airport), but the driver was very friendly, offered cold bottled water and displayed the utmost professionalism when we reached the hotel as he brought our bags in for us. Check in was smooth, reception and conceige very friendly and smiling. The room was gorgeous. We had a great room overlooking the runway of Miami airport, and of the lagoon. The noise was very minimal considering we were so close to the runway. The bathroom was exceptional with beautiful marble tops, and was nice and bright. The bed....well, the bed was something I wish we could have packed up and brought home with us. Fluffy, comfortable and made you want to stay in it all day long, it was so comfortable. The duvet and pillowtop mattress was like a huge fluffy cloud. Can you tell we loved it? The poolside was beautiful and we enjoyed the well stocked and clean gym room. This is a highly recommended hotel and we cant wait to go back! Enjoy your stay!

<Content>A comfortable one night stay. Sofitel Miami AirportNov 2006Reviewer. Berkshire. UK.We stayed at the Sofitel for one night early in November. To stop the courtesy bus at the airport required me to dodge between the traffic, rush across the road, then wave violently. The driver seemed to be doing his best to avoid picking anyone up. The reception staff were courtious and friendly (rare in Miami Area). As in most airport hotels the drinks and food were quite expensive. We had a turkey sandwich which was well presented. The following morning we had breakfast, which was a real pleasure, and got the day of to a good start.The portions were quite reasonable and served by friendly staff, although the service in the bar area was a little slow, due to three people showing up at roughly the same time. Unless you have a car and want to drive for food and drink, it seems you are stuck with the hotel restaurant. If I stay here again I will probably push the boat out and eat here again, as it is such a nice restaurant.The bedroom was generous, clean and comfortable. It overlooked one of the active runways. I am a very light sleeper, but , the only plane that seemed noisy was a take of early in the morning. I think the majority of people probably would not have been woken by the noise. The king size bed was without doubt the best hotel bed that I have used anywhere in the world. The pillows were just as good.Overall, I felt like I was staying in a good quality hotel, where the staff made an effort to give good service(except the bus driver).Should I stay at the airport again I will definately try and stay at this hotel.

<Content>Perfectly adequate We arrived from the UK early pm after an eight hour flight and 'phoned the Sofitel to make arrangements for the airport shuttle. Unfortunately, it was not a good start as 2 shuttles drove straight past us without the drivers even glancing towards the waiting area - despite us waiving maniacally. Another call to the hotel produced the promise of a return pick-up and indeed we were whisked away on the comfy shuttle but only after a total of 55 minutes wait. Yes, in hindsight we should have simply got a cab. Thereafter, we enjoyed a restful stay. The staff were obliging and helpful. The rooms were a good size with fine queen beds, excellent shower and good general amenities. The bar area and restaurant were light and airy but the air conditioning in the restaurant was (shall we say) overzealous. Brrrrr. The food was very good and the service likewise. We thought the prices were pretty steep and maybe the bar snacks would have offered better value - but we were on holiday. There's are small shopping mall about 10-15 minutes walk away that has a liquor store, pharmacy, supermarket, fast food and restaurant if you need. All in all, the Sofitel provided a good, clean comfortable overnight stay.

<Content>Relaxing ambience despite airport proximity We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights between a flight from the UK and a cruise. 2 days because we slipped in a visit to see the Dolphins play!When we arrived at the airport we got a taxi rather than wait for the shuttle - we were tired and also there are 4 of us. It was only a few minutes away anyway.Arriving at the property was initially a little disappointing - the hotel have made (in my opinion) a mistake by having a little shop right inside the entrance which serves to rob the hotel of an impressive atrium entrance that I like in these sort of hotels.There was a further disappointment - we had two rooms. When we arrived in one there was a sink full of recent ice and empty beer bottles in the bathroom so we had to move and ended up on different floors (7 and 9)!I also found the planning of the light switches in the room to be odd - we arrived in the dark and spent several minutes feeling the walls looking for non-existent switches - they are all on the wall and floor lights. Also, as someone else said, there is only one robe in each wardrobe?Please do read on because, after a slighty faltering start, it just got better and better.Good points - The public rooms are truly lovely - classy, art-deco style.The pool area is great - plentiful towels and never busy.The view from the rooms over the lagoon is lovely and restful even though the airplanes are landing just behind it. In fact we quite enjoyed watching the planes - you could just hear them but it was not a problem.The beds were absolutely gorgeous - featherbeds to lie on and top-quality linen.The concierge was very helpful - as we left for the football he handed us four bottles of ice-cold water telling us to take care in the heat.I thought the restaurant was very good indeed. Others have said that it was expensive - maybe by US standards but by European, not so much so. Besides, it was worth it. The room was a very stylish white with touches of red glassware and the like. You might need to cover shoulders - the air-conditioning was pretty 'full on'.The breakfast in particular was lovely - I had a continental which consisted of a basket of lovely bread and pastries made by the resident French chef. My family had cooked plates that were also great. We were also presented with complimentary strawberry smoothies. We ate two breakfasts and a dinner there and everything was good - I would have preferred my apple pie served hot however.There was also a little cafe situated behing the restaurant - many people bought breakfast there and then walked back through the restaurant to the bar / lounge situated overlooking the pool area.The hotel runs a port shuttle for $10 per person.This hotel should not just be considered an airport hotel. Although you are away from the busy areas, everything is a (relatively) short taxi ride away.

<Content>Surprisingly great airport hotel I was very pleased with the Sofitel. I arrived very early in the morning, and the staff was able to accomodate me for a very early check-in. The room was very clean, with nice decorating accents throughout. The towels were very large and soft, and the robe was a nice luxurious touch. The pillow-top bed was also very comfortable. The view of the pool and lagoon was very refreshing. There was surprisingly very little airplane noise, seeing as I had a very up-close view of the runways as well. For the price I paid on Priceline ($77), it more than worth it!

<Content>Nice hotel near airport -comfy beds, but Hot! Beautiful bathroom - Relaxing pool My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a night prior to us returning home. We didn鈥檛 have any problems checking in. The rooms were nicely decorated and clean. The bathroom was beautiful with the granite countertops. The bed was heavenly. The bed has a featherbed and feather comforter. The only thing I did not like about the bed is that there were no sheets and all that down made it HOT! Don鈥檛 they realize that the hotel is in Miami! The hotel is really close to the airport. You can see it from the room. The pool area was nice. The hotel has a restaurant, but like most restaurants in Miami, it was quite expensive鈥︹€ut good! There is a little pastry / coffee shop in the back of the restaurant. The prices were very reasonable. You could get yummy pastries, small sandwiches and good, ol鈥?Starbucks coffee. A lot of guests might miss this little gem because you have to walk through the hotel restaurant to get to it. I only wish it stayed open all day and did not close at 2:00PM. The only problem I had was when I left my sunglasses at the front check-in desk. I went back to see if they were still there and the girl told me she would check and see if they were in lost and found. She came back and said she did not see them and told me to give her my room number just in case they found them. I checked back with the front desk later on that day and the same girl said they found it and that they put them in my room for me. I went up to my room and did not see them. I went back down the stairs to ask the girl about it and she said she would check into it and call me up in the room. I waited and waited and finally I got a call. My husband answered and the girl told him that there was a mix up and that they think they may have returned the sunglasses to someone else鈥檚 room. Then, she later said that they never found a pair of sunglasses to begin with and apologized for the confusion. My husband said that she sounded really flustered and didn鈥檛 really have her facts straight. If they made a mistake, I can understand that, but I rather them just whole-heartedly admit it, rather than beating around the bush. I never had a noise problem in my room. Elevators worked fine for me, although my husband had a problem with the elevator not working right a couple times. I paid $95 a night, which I thought was a good value for the money in Miami. Parking was $7. Most other hotels in Miami charge a lot more, so I didn鈥檛 mind paying only $7. Other than the whole sunglasses incident, everything was fine at the hotel. I would recommend it to people staying in Miami for a couple days. It is a nice hotel and for the most part, service was good.

<Content>I would stay somewhere else So I booked the room directly with the hotel online. I decided to go for the room that was the cheapest of $95 if you prepay. I gave my credit card details and received the confirmation etc. Then a day later I received an email from the General Manager apologising as they'd lost my credit card details but confirmed that they still had my reservation. So as to avoid giving my details again and chance them losing it I said I would pay when I got there which he agreed. Now I secretly hoped that for the cock up that they would maybe upgrade me or at least offer me something. Nope! I ended up getting a cab because I waited so long at the airport for the shuttle that I didn't think the shuttle was going to turn up. When I got out of the cab there wasn't any bellman, just an elderly security guard who ended up having to bring my bags in for me. I felt awful as this man shouldn't have been lifting heavy bags (but he was sweet and insisted) I think the bellman turned up slightly later when I had finished checking in.Checking in wasn't great. I gave the girl my credit card and asked if it was going through as I'd been having problems on my holiday with the card going through sometimes and then other times not. She said it was fine and then five minutes later she asked me to pay in cash and pay extra cash if I thought I was going to charge anything to the room. When I enquired again about my card she just replied oh yeah that hasn't gone through so will you pay in cash now. It's stupid but that really annoyed me. I had other cards to give her and I specifically asked her and explained the problem. It also didn't help that another girl came out from the room behind laughing and then then the two of them decided to have a conversation and giggle and laugh in front of me as if I suddenly wasn't there. Not really what I expected from a decent hotel.Anyway, going to the room I thought that the coridors felt really grotty and old. It felt as if I was walking through a 1 or 2 star hotel and I expected to see bit padlocks on the doors. The room was nice but it was old. Everything felt just a bit grotty although I couldn't specifically point out one thing. I felt nervous as well there for some reason and double locked the room.I had a flight in the morning and had asked for wake up call and fortunately I woke up early with a headache as I never received the wake up call. Good thing I was up as I could have easily missed my flight. You would think that an airport hotel would make wake up calls a priority point for them as their main customers are people who stay whilst in transit. I felt disappointed with this hotel. I think I would have got the exactly same standard of room and service (actually I think I would have got better service) if I'd stayed in a cheaper hotel like the Hampton Inn or Embassy Suites etc. Next time I think I'll do that. This hotel just wasn't worth the money.

<Content>Good airport hotel for one night The Sofitel was a very nice airport hotel to stay in for one night. The room was very large and comfortable. We had a bit of a problem with the air conditioning during the night... couldn't get it adjusted so it was either too hot or too cold. The staff was all very professional and friendly. Our only complaint was that the airport shuttle (to be picked up from the airport) was very, very slow. It took 50 minutes for us to be picked up (after calling the hotel three times, too... they said 5-10 minutes each time). All-in-all, though, it was worth it for one night.

<Content>Nice for One Night After a horrible day in and out of airplanes the airline sent us to the Sofitel. Their shuttle runs between the airport and hotel every hour (what kept us waiting for a loooong time at the airport) but the hotel is very nice. Even though the rooms are small, they have clean and very comfortable beds, clean bathrooms w/plenty of towels and nice amenities. They also have a kind and accommodating staff. However, if you鈥檙e staying at this Sofitel, try to ask for a room far from the ice machine because it can be very noisy.Breakfast at their restaurant was good enough.Even though the hotel is very near the airport you can hardly hear the airplanes so I imagine they have some kind of sound insulation (or I simply passed out and did not hear any noise at all...).The only setback was that at first we were given a room which was already taken by someone else because when we entered the room we found bags and glasses over the beds. So I imagine that you鈥檇 better be careful with your belongings but in fact I believe this can happen to anyone.... All in all I think it was a nice stay and I believe it is a good hotel for those who want to be near the airport, but of course there are hotels in Miami that are much nicer than this Sofitel. Don鈥檛 get your expectations too high and you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Average Rooms - Beware of Biting Ants!!! I stayed here. The rooms are average but I had a horrible experience.My clothes in the room became infested with ants that ended up biting me all over and leaving painful red welts.I shudder every time I think about this hotel.

<Content>Nice but not comparable to others in the Sofitel chain We spent one night at the Sofitel on May 27th. We were very much looking forward to this stay having stayed at a Sofitel in Athens Greece and Philadelphia, what a let down if you are comparing apples to apples. Our stay was average, not the level you would expect from the Sofitel chain - the workers very nice and accomodating, the room was little plain in comparison. Our only big complaint was that the pool was very dirty and the guests partying around the pool were very offensive and used very offensive language, I was appalled that management did not address this, we had our young son with us so we did not spend much time around the pool because of this. Upon check out the next morning we realized there were some rap musicians staying there as well, these were obviously the guests that were at the pool the evening prior.I would not stay at this Sofitel again I would consider the Marriott or Hilton next time.

<Content>Loved the Hotel wished we could have stayed longer We only booked this hotel for one night as were flying out to LA the next day and wanted a hotel close to the Airport. We had stayed a few days earlier at The Hyatt Maimi (my review on this was poor) before heading down to Key West for a few nights then back to Miaimi. We wished we had stayed in this hotel for the earlier nights. Whilst not centrally located, its only about 10-15 minutes drive to downtown Maimi, we would recommend it.Check in was great - we also got upgraded to a suite, the suite was wonderful, very large separate bathroom, huge separate lounge area and quite a spacious bathrom.The bar area looked pleasant and we took drinks out by the pool and relaxed for an hour or so which was pleasant. This hotel that night had a lot of English people staying in it before leaving for Caribean Cruises so a lot of cheeful conversation with other guests which added to the ambience. . We had dinner in their main restaurant which was superb, the service was very good and the food was excellent. We decided to have coffee in the bar area and this is where it all fell apart. The Bar area is quite large and people were also eating snacks. After about 10 minutes of trying to get a waiters attention my husband gave up and went and found one. He was quite rude and we explained we only wanted coffee and a liquor told us we would have a big wait as they were more concerned about serving the food people. We then left immediately. Fortunately for us the Manager of the Restaurant was passing as we left and could see we were not happy, he took us back into his Restaurant and organised our coffee straight away. ( It was not complimentary ) but he did at least seemed concerned re our plight.Would recommend this restaurant for business travellers or couples and tourists if you dont mind staying near the airport. But a much better hotel than the Hyatt Miaimi which was more centrally located.

<Content>Great overnight hotel Arriving in Miami at 1130pm, the shuttle was a treat as we were asked if we wanted water which was wonderful, we were given a cold water bottle....I ordered room service as they served untial 1am. I was given a deluxe room and the bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows and a fluffy pad on the mattress. The top covering was a year round down comforter, it was very nice as the air conditioning was on..I also stayed there on the return portion of my trip which was also very comfortable and nice. Great place to stay for overnights as it is an airport hotel.

<Content>Great for one night Got a really good deal of about $100 through Hotwire for one night in transit from UK to JamaicaHotel shuttle bus was waiting when I left terminal building. Check in smooth. Given a room on 4th floor which overlooked the cooling fans on one side and the car park on the other. But for that price and at 8pm at night I wasnt too disappointed.Ordered room service,-and this is my only complaint- when it was delivered I noticed the cheeck had been lft blank for a tip even though it says quite clearly on the menu a 19%( where did that figure come from?) gratuity and a $2.50 delivery charge would be added automatically to the bill. I pointed this out to the delivery person who said ' we only get half of that - that's why its left opened'. If this is true , surely a company like Sofitel needs to get its act together.They wouldnt get away with this in their European Hotels. I should have queried this further at the timebut tiredness put a stop to thatAnyway, food was very good. Had a great sleep in a very comfortable bed. Easy check out with free coffe in reception at 0600hrs and shuttle bus waiting. All in all great value for money.

<Content>Not what we expected My husband and I arrived at the hotel later in the evening after travelling all day and we wanted a cool drink and snack before going to bed. The lounge is lovely to look at but very few of the tables had been bussed. As we sat there the manager walked through, had an arguement with the busser in front of us which then spread through the bar staff. We wanted to change our table as we were near a large group of noisey men but the tables were dirty. The hotel itself was very clean, the room was average, no minibar or water. Our experience was not what we wanted and we won't return.

<Content>Will go again My son and I stayed here for one night before returning back to the UK. It was located five minutes from the airport but the rooms were so well insulated you barely heard the planes taking off next door.My 4 year old thought it was fantastic having an airport next door.The staff were very helpful especially when I said I was disappointed with the first room they showed me. Immediately I was upgraded to a suite and moved several floors up to get a better view of the lagoon.We spent the day lounging by the pool (which was a bit cold!) and they also extended check in to 2.00pm so we could change ready for our flight in comfort.The food was great, albeit by US standards a bit pricey.I would not hesitate staying here again and my friends who dropped us at the hotel are also considering a stay. The staff were friendly and helpful.I recommend this hotel to anyone with time to kill who doesn't want to hang about at the airport. the shuttle bus was every half hour and took no more than 10 minutes to get to the terminal.Well done to the staff.

<Content>European elegance at an affordable price Convinient hotel close to the airport. Payed $ 115 on Expedia for a King bed. Good price for the quality of the hotel. I would not pay above $ 200 a night as some published fares i've in other sites. Don't let the shabby appearance on the outside fool you!! looks like it needs some paint but the interior is very nice. Stayed there for one night on our way to Venezuela. . The good: rooms are nicely appointed and clean. Nice bed. European decor and ambience. The bad: parking is not free and food is expensive. Overall: I would stay again for doing business in Miami or stopover through Miami International Airport.

<Content>Nice stay The very attentive and helpful staff is this hotel's best asset. Every employee seemed well-versed in good customer service.The hotel shuttle to/from the airport runs every half hour. It would have been nice for the hotel website to mention that this runs regularly to avoid having to call on arrival. The Miami airport can be a zoo in the pickup/dropoff zone and it is helpful to know exactly where you should be (up on the 2nd level where the Departures come, NOT on the ground level for Pick-up) and when to expect a shuttle. The staff was very helpful in locating the shuttle and providing an ETA when I called, though. The hotel public areas are lovely. The rooms seemed a bit more average, but very clean. The VERY fluffy down bed things are wonderful. Rooms have internet connections (wired, about $10 per day), and I believe I heard someone say there was wireless capability in at least some areas of the hotel (though the colleagues who said this were not having success in making this work, so unsure what the details are). Clearly heard the TV in the room next door (seemingly through the closed connecting door). No coffee in room. USA Today available in lobby. Late check-out was available on the date I was there with Sofitel guest membership (free, sign-up online).The restaurant on site is also lovely and food is prepared in a reasonable amount of time. Menu is not extensive, but seemd to include a decent variety. Approximate prices=sandwiches/hamburger around $12-14 with fries or salad, entrees more around $20, soups/salads around $8-10. More wines on the menu than food.Would be willing to stay here again for business if needed. Would definitely not be my first choice for a comfortable family vacation - making it nicer probably for those of you who would like to avoid comfortable familes on vacation! :-)

<Content>Post cruise stay at the Sofitel I had done a lot of research on Hotels for our pre and post cruise stays while in Miami and decided on the Sofitel for our post cruise night due to its proximity to the airport and the free shuttle. I had booked the hotel around 3 months in advance of our trip and was able to get it for $122 per night by booking thru their website. It was more than I wanted to pay, but was very happy with the hotel.It is too depressing for me to get off of a cruise ship (the most comfortable bed and pillows EVER) and end our vacation, so I know must stay one night post cruise. Little did I know that this hotel would make me feel like I was still on the ship!!We debarked around noon and we were to the hotel by 12:30 and checked in. The lobby was beautiful and the doorman/bellman very helpful.The room was gorgeous and shockingly, the bed was just as comfortable as the one we had just left on the ship.There is a telephone in the bathroom and the sound from the television is piped into the bathroom so you dont miss a moment of your favorite show, news or music. .You can hook up to the internet at the desk in room for $9.95. Being outside on the deck by the pool and the water was heaven as I sipped on a Mojito ($8)....I didnt even have sealegs as my body was still on ship time. Felt like I was still on vacation. Views very nice outside and there is also a garden-patio area. A couple of guys were fixing the crocodile fence on the other side of the pool near the ocean. Apparently part of the fence had come down during one of the hurricanes and they were closing it up the day we were there to keep the crocs out! We did not see any nearby or anywhere.Menu prices were high for food, but they had huge servings. They serve you a medley of olives and little baked cheese type crackers that are baked on premises.Grounds are very nice; hotel inside and outside is just stunning and pleasing to they eye. Staff friendly and helpful and they treat you sooo good.Only downside is that there is not anything nearby that you can walk to (like Bayside) but overall, it was a very pleasant stay. I may stay there again someday, but next time will look for a hotel that is closer to some action (restaurants, beaches etc) as I found $13 for a bagel, salmon and red onion a little too high priced for breakfast!! They do have a nice menu and although not on it, I heard the bartender take orders for chicken fingers and burgers (not on menu). My Mojito was made from scratch and was the best I have ever had....maybe not worth $8, but must have been good since I had ALMOST 2 1/2 drinks!! Our morning pot of coffee was almost $15 delivered to our room !! Granted it was beautifully presented, but worth that much?? It included gratuity, but we still gave the girl $2. So total was $17!!!(NOTE- I have tried unsucessfully to upload pictures to this site. I have some very nice ones of the rooms, lobby and grounds)

<Content>Contradiction How can it be explained that hotels charging double the rate of others offer much less services and are even inventive in finding items to put on your bill? We stayed in another airport hotel offering a nice pool area,free coffee,internet access,local calls,parking and breakfast???The Sofitel Miami's rate was double and offers none of these niceties,a smallish pool, and charges heftily for all the above plus 7$ to allow guests to park on their own open air parking. Room,bathroom were O.K. Too long waits at the elevators.

<Content>Ok, but not as good as other Sofitels We stayed one night at the Sofitel Miami Airport on the way to Jamaica. It was ok, but not as nice as other Sofitels we have stayed at. The outside of the building is terrible, some of the letters in Hotel Sofitel were burnt out. The building also looked old and not well taken care of. Maybe it is due to the humidity, as when I got out of the cab I thought I might suffocate due to lack of air! Inside the lobby was very nice, as was the bar area and restaurant. We did not eat at any of these but they looked very nice. The room was a nice size and we had no noise problems at all, even though we could see the planes taking off from the airport. The room did have a musty smell to it, also probably due to the humidity. I didn't let it bother me too much as I figured all hotels in that area were probably pretty much the same. It was ok for one night but I don't know if I would have been able to stand it had we been there longer. Room service was ok, nothing special as typical room service is. Prices are high, so be prepared. One of the things I thought was terrible for a Sofitel was no mini bar or water in the room at all. Hopefully this will change. It was not horrible but I probably would pick somewhere else to stay if I go again.

<Content>Great staff - Surprisingly great overall I am a local Miami resident who just spent the night at the Sofitel due to lack of power at our residence. Booked the room through hotwire for a great rate. I had never stayed at the hotel but had visited for a day conference. I was very pleasantly surprised at the level of service. We order room service-my husband had ordered a pasta dish-when he received it he realized it came with red sauce-he called down and the staff immediately brought him the dish as he wanted it. With in 20 minutes-we got a call from the Operations Manager apologizing for the miscommunication and letting us know the dish had been removed from our bill. The room was well appointed. Bathroom was average. They had wireless internet access for a rate 9.99 daily and tv internet as well. There were a few down falls that I was willing to look over since the service was so good-1. 1/3 of the windows had transculent drapes-that's it-so in the morning the sun was hitting us in the face 2-you are charged $7 for self parking-for each vehicle you bring in 3-no mini bar or water in the room and lastly, in the morning, the walls seemed to vibrate a little as the hotel is close to the airport. Also you are charged a dollar to make a local call. Satisfied with the hotel based on the rate and service we received-I would not however have paid full price for the room. For that-I would stay at the Ritz in the grove or Key Biscayne.

<Content>Wonderful Experience We had a wonderful stay at the Sofitel in May 2005. The staff was very helpful. There were no hidden charges on our bill, but as expressed by many others the pool was unusually cold. We are looking forward to staying at the Sofitel in Miami again.

<Content>Very Good Hotel With Exceptionally Nice Staff I stayed at the Sofitel two nights recently on both ends of a trip to South America. I was very pleased with the hotel. The staff were uniformly friendly and did all they could to make my stay enjoyable. The room was fairly big...and the views of the planes taking off from the Airport were great. The bed was one of the best that I have ever slept in. Food at the restaurant was good...but expensive. Food at the bar was much more reasonable.All in all, it was a good stay and I would not hesitate to go back again.

<Content>Are all these bad reviews for the right hotel? We loved it! My husband and I stayed here for one night on our honeymoon on our way out to a Caribbean Cruise. From the moment the shuttle picked us up from the airport to the time they dropped us off at the dock, our experience was beautiful and luxurious. The bed was possibly the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Everything was fluffy-soft and feathered and we felt like royalty. When we asked for a local seafood restaurant, we were directed to one nearby but we couldn't get a taxi to drive us the two miles (it was Spring break and they were very busy) so the concierge had one of the valets drive us in the hotel's cadillac. When it was time to come back to the hotel after dinner, they even picked us up so we wouldn't have to wait for a taxi. The next day was Easter Sunday and the Sofitel hosted a beautiful Easter Buffet. Neither my new husband or I were that hungry so we asked if we could just have a cheeseburger. Although the kitchen was closed to menu items, they agreed to prepare us cheeseburgers, which were served to us on the patio outside. The service was impeccable and again, we felt like the most important guests the Sofitel housed. I cannot find one negative thing to say about our experience there. I even called the manager when we got home to compliment him on his staff and his establishment. I look forward to staying there again next month for business!

<Content>Great Lobby-Nightmare Room! Hello everyone! I stayed at the Hotel Sofitel in Miami last month for one night. I stayed at the hotel because my Carnival Cruiseline brochure had it listed as a place to stay before debarkation at the port of Miami the next day. The brochure stated they offered complimentary shuttles which I assumed went to the Port, which wasn't the case. The shuttle is from the airport to the hotel (Carnival has since made a correction to their brochure). The shuttle that picks you up at the airport took about 25 minutes to drive by us. Once he picked us up he drove around the airport three more times looking for people to take back to the hotel. Something my party and I joked about, but was rather rude. The road to the hotel is a bumpy one! Hold on tight! You drive through a construction site which never seems to be finished. Once you arrive at the hotel you are greeted by a rather nice entrance way and lobby area. This is the only four star area of the property- trust me! It looks very nice, but people- do not judge a book by it's cover! Our reservation was somehow lost and it took them 10 minutes to find it in the computer (don't ask me how- we made reservations directly through the hotel). Once at our room we noticed a rather contemporary look with nice lighting, but to deserve a four star for the rooms is ridiculous! I have stayed in a few four star hotels before in Germany and throughout the US and this was my first dissappointment. The beds actually concave which only happen when they are old. No other complaints about the rest of the room. The window overlooking the man made resevoir also looked out upon your faux balcony which the pigeons have taken over and the bottom is COMPLETELY full of white droppings. Not a pleasant site to look out upon in the morning! The windows in the room aren't the greatest. Considering the hotel is next to the airport, the noise at night might keep some people awake. The bathroom was nothing special- marble countertop. The pool area is a little outdated. One nice hotel amenity is the fact that the pool is open 24hrs a day. This is the only hotel I have ever been to where that option is given. The pool is not heated and there is NO hot tub! The bar inside is very nice at night. It is located next to the exit for the pool, so at night most of the people who have been drinking stroll outside to smoke which makes it seem crowded at night. Plus most people drinking do not want to be near someone dripping water everywhere when they get out of the pool. The poolside furniture is unique. It is made of a heavy guage white plastic. Not very comfortable, but comtemporary to say the least. One thing that struck me odd was the fact that the outside hotel sign located at the top of the building said  Hot Sofitel. The E and L were actually missing. I had a conversation with a business traveller in the morning who stated the sign has been that way for over 6 months! The hotel overall was a complete dissappointment. If you are looking for a place to stay before departing on a cruise in Miami, I would consider the InterContinental which is extremely close to the port! If you want to pay the price for the Hotel Sofitel and be disappointed go right ahead, but remember.....I warned 'ya! : )

<Content>My worst hotel experience I came to know about this hotel when I was searching on Priceline and expedia for my trip to Miami. The ratings were 3.5 stars on expedia and 4 stars on priceline and so I booked a room directly on their website expecting at least a 3 star experience.But it was my worst hotel stay experience.1.This is the first time I was charged for parking in a hotel, $7 a day.2.The lobby attendants didn鈥檛 even help move our bags when checking in and out of the room.3.The room was big (king suite) but was old. I would say it was ok.4.They didn鈥檛 even a bottle of water and coffee/tea in the room as a courtesy when you check in. Even a 2 star hotel has all these.5.They advertise as free internet access, but charged $10.6.One of the nights, when we returned to the room at around 10.30pm, we couldn鈥檛 get into the room due to the electronic lock malfunction. It took 4 visits to lobby and the room, before they could send an engineer to look into the problem. My wife and daughter were so tired, including me. They didn鈥檛 even offer a standby room to rest. They did after I insisted and complained about the service. And our baggage also got locked inside the room. We couldn鈥檛 even change our clothes and freshen up. And this was the worst part of our stay in that hotel. In spite of all these fiasco, they never offered a discount or anything.Based on my overall experience, I would rate this as a 1.5 star hotel.

<Content>Nice Hotel, not as bad as they're saying. Just stayed one night on the 14th of May, and thought the hotel was great! Upon arrival, the bellman greeted us with a smile and asked if we would like help with our bags. He even offered to drive us to a local Cuban restaurant we asked about! The check-in was smooth and quick, asked for a corner room and got it. The room was nicely furnished. Only complaints were of the tub (dirty, non-taking-a-bath appeal), and the photos on the wall vibrated every now and then when a jet flew by (just took them off the wall for the night). Might ask for a room on the opposite end of the airport.Restaurant was way too expensive for our taste (order of chicken wings were $14!). No problem, just walked to a local restaurant.All in all, nice hotel for the deal i got on Expedia ($89).

<Content>The perfect place to stay in Miami - Luxury at an affordable price The hotel was really good value for money. It has a free shuttle service to and from the airport. The Dolphin Mall shuttle bus stops here and picks you up and drops you back which is great as getting around miami using public transport is not an option and Taxis can become expensive.The staff at the hotel were really good, Eduardo on Concierge and Raul the operations manager were terrific and made our stay as comfortable as possible. I can not believe why other people have reviewed it badly, the rooms were really nice and we couldn't ask for more.

<Content>S'Wonderful Sofitel! Are we staying at the same Sofitel? We travel quite a bit... and have stayed at the Sofitel Miami a few times. We always use it as a layover hotel on our way out of the country via Miami, or to board a cruise ship the next morning. We have never had problems. Actually, I take that back. The very first night we ever stayed there a few years ago, the morning after we arrived the toilet wouldn't work, it continually flushed. They had maitenance up within a few minutes, and as compensation comped us with a free room service breakfast, which was really quite good! We have stayed in nicer hotels... but the Sofitel really can't be beat, when your talking dollar amount and location. True, it isn't a 5 star, but if you're researching hotels, just by the pictures, you showed know this is no Ritz, Four Seasons, or Waldorf-Astoria! Don't be so hard on the hotel. The bell boys WILL allow you to take your own luggage, we always do. The Shuttle service is quite decent (ask for the limo shuttle... it's a nice touch,) as are the front desk clerks. Some of them really go out of their way to make your stay comfortable. Our last stay in February 2005, they authorized my credit card as always, but I needed the money as we were leaving that morning. I wish I could remember the gals' name, but she went out of her way to have the authorization removed so we wouldn't have any issues with the cruise authorization. The process took roughly 15 minutes, and she did it willingly and with a smile! The restaurant IS expensive.. you definatly don't get what you pay for... but the bar menu, just outside the restaurant is about half the cost. I even think the food is better! Beware though... the bar staff can be a bit snooty! One gentleman has been there for eons, and must feel like he owns the place... and treats you as such. As for the rooms, they are nicer than most. Again, we are talking 4 star quality, not 5 star! We have never had a problem with cleanliness, or lack of supplies. We return to the Sofitel for so many reasons. If you'd like to see pictures of the Sofitel, visit our website at www.resorthoppers.com and click under the Bahama cruise.

<Content>Good pillows, courteous staff While waiting for a plane home at a very busy march break, we enjoyed our short stay. Our third visit to this hotel and we still like it. The coffee shoppe Le Patisserie was as good as any in Paris with the only drawback being that it closes at noon. The pool is not heated and is too chilly for the winter weather. It would be fine in summer. Really nice amenities, great exercise room, lots of complimentary bottled water. The restaurant is expensive but great food. Free shuttle too and from the airport and to the Dolphin Mall. Walk to the grocery store, and fast food outlet nearby. Try and get an internet rate. The concierge can arrange anything and is always available.

<Content>What a JOKE!!! Worst place I've ever stayed! Stayed there on March 18, 2005 with wife and in-laws in route to cruise. This is an Accor hotel which I found out is owned by the french. I did not realize that most of the employees were french, because the lots of guests staying in the hotel were french. I guess that makes sense because If I was staying in Paris I would probably look for an American owned hotel. Anyway, The service was lousy. The food in the restaurant was very expensive. Caeser salad was 14.00 , hamburger 12.00 and coffee five bucks and was not of starbucks quality. Waiter after taking order never came back... at all. Had to find another waiter who took our order again and when she brought it to us she never returned to check on us. Never filling water or Ice tea glasses at all. Hotel service was just as bad. No other restaurants' in walking distance from this hotel. Hotel charges Taxis just to to come on property so there are none waiting to take you anywhere. Windows are broken on back side of hotel and letters of name are missing. Same goes for inside. This hotel is very dated, furniture worn out in lobby. Needs several coats of paint to upgrade. Don't have a clue why it's rated four stars. I've stayed in Motel 6's that are better than this. PS no coffee maker in room either.

<Content>Never Again Not even a child will swim in the freezing water of the unheated swimming pool. Waiters at restaurant were unfriendly. Food was overpriced. Beautiful lobby but totally shabby rooms. We tried 3 different room locations until given a room with two beds which we asked for in the first place. Not worth the money!

<Content>Sleep In The Lobby If You Ever Wind up Here We booked this hotel as a Four Star property on HotWire. It seemed to have everything we were looking for in a one night stopover before leaving the following day on a cruise; convenient location, shuttle, full service restaurant  room service. What sounded perfect was perfectly awful.We flew in from LA, arrived at 9:30 pm,  (after waiting more than an hour for our luggage to catch up with us), stood at the designated area for the Sofitel shuttle.After 40 minutes, a Sofitel shuttle did appear but it was traveling at roughly the speed of sound. This was remarkable insofar as the general airport traffic was all but gridlocked. Not to be caught asleep at the switch twice, we moved bag  baggage off the curb  into the oncoming traffic lane. Another 30 minutes passed  a second shuttle appeared. My husband literally stepped out in front of it. The door opened, the driver stuck out his head  said, Bonjour, I am full. Well, he clearly wasn't full  after a brief but animated discussion, we took our seats on the van. As we drove out of the airport people were literally flinging themselves at our van. It looked like the evacuation of Saigon. The moral of the story? Forget the shuttle, take a cab. Not only will you get to the hotel with some sanity left, you won't be tortured all night by the anguished faces on those you left behind.By the time we reached our hotel, the only food available was via room service. Thus, we did our fine dining on a chaise in the corner of our room, balancing plates on our knees. We preferred this over dining on the bed, an option which past occupants had clearly chosen. Remnants of their meals were clearly discernable on the bed skirt  spread. As we drifted off to sleep, my husband asked if I would like the air conditioner turned up. I glanced up at the vent, saw it was covered with a black sooty film, decided it was most likely a lethal form of mold  declined.Up early the following morning, my husband brushed his teeth while I turned on the water to bathe. Much to my astonishment, the water from the faucet was distinctly brown. Well, distinctly yellowish-brown to be precise. And the deeper the water got, the more yellowish-brown it became. As hubby brushed away, I debated with myself the most tactful way of discussing this with him. I decided the conversational method was best. Honey, why do you think our water is brown? I asked in a neutral tone. Sauntering over, still brushing, he managed to mumble, They must have lots of sulpher in it. Do you really think all the water in Miami is this color?, I asked. This must have given him pause because he stopped brushing  called the front desk. The water was brown, he was told, because it had been turned off for several hours, the day before  there was sediment in the pipes. OK. Fine. But couldn't they have told us that BEFORE we used the water? Afterall, they did tell us we might not have phone service in our room...couldn't they have thrown in, at the same time, that we'd be bathing in sediment-infested water?We were in this property for about 12 hrs  overstayed by 11 hrs  45 minutes. How it ever got a 4 Star Rating is now one of the great mysteries of the Universe.

<Content>Not Bad, But not good either.. Went to Miami in Feburary of 2004, had a good time but had some problems. 1. Expect to pay about 10 bucks a day just to park your car in the hotel parking lot.2. As another user said, the pool was freezing. Sure it was the middle of Feburary, but it was 80 degrees during the day, and with a high class hotel like that, you'd think they could afford a heated pool.3. The Hotel Resturant was nice, but very overpriced.These are just a few things.. But there were just little things that bugged me. They would not allow you to move your baggage yourself so they basically forced you to use the concierge service and to tip them, they gave us the wrong rooms and the staff was overall pretty rude.. This was our first trip to miami. Overall, had a nice time at the beach, but if you are traveling with a family to this particular part of florida, I suggest you drive about 45 mins. North and goto Ft. lauderdale. Spent a day there and everyone was very nice. Hope this was helpful...

<Content>ok!! We liked the Sofitel! Room incl. bathroom looked good. Ask for a corner room, they are spacy. Service was excellent at any time, concierge and lobby staff were very helpful always. Location is great, directly at a lake, 5 min. away from the airport. The hotel seems to be built in the late 70's, some parts of the lobby need some new furniture. All in all a good deal for roundabout $ 90. Only problem was that you pay extra 7 dollars per day for parking (with security, but there is no other parking space available, so you must pay if you come by car) and 10 dollars for internet on the room. Other hotels for less money offer internet on the room for free!

<Content>Average...Not as good as Reviews Average hotel. I was disappointed because of some heightened expectations after reading reviews. This is a clean hotel, with small rooms, and above average service.

<Content>Nicest Airport Hotel Ever My husband and I travel often. Usually if we stay by the airport, choices are limited to motel-type facilities being shaken by airplanes. The Sofitel changed our feelings about airport lodging. The staff is friendly, ensuite dining is offered, and room furnishings are casually elegant with a European flair. Our high floor room has a beautiful view of the lake and surrounding area. Although the airport is within close proximity, noise was minimal. Bathrooms are very nice with granite countertops and luxury products. The pool area is stereotypical Miami deco with a geometric waterfall. All areas are pleasing to the eye,Definitely exceeded our expectations. We'll be flying out of the Miami airport a lot in the coming years . . . have found a hidden gem in the middle of airport hell.

<Content>Is this the same Hotel We were concerned by some of the adverse reviews about this Hotel but decided to try it anyway as we were only staying for one night.On arrival the door was opened for us and our bags taken up to our room which proved to be well furnished and confortable. At all times the staff proved to be polite and helpful. The hotel is not in a good location if you intend to stay in the Miami area but it is perfect for the airport. Breakfast was excellent.I would rate this Hotel well above average for an airport facility.
