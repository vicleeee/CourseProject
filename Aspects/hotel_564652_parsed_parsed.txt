<Content>Satisfactory with a plus Very convenient location close to Sky Harbor. Shuttle very timely, efficient staff. Decent food from restaurant. Our breakfast server was great, she really put the plus on what would otherwise have been a nice stay. The property was very clean.Not a big fan of the sleep number beds.Overall we were pleased and we would definitely stay here again in the future.

<Content>Great stay! Stayed for three nights for business and one for pleasure. Great staff, unique room layout was perfect. Very convenient location. My wife left some clothes in a drawer which we didn't realize until we got home. The staff was very helpful and mailed them to us at no charge. I recommend highly.

<Content>Lovely hotel for airport stopover, airport shuttle, nice breakfast We stayed 1 night, flew in from the UK and returned to the airport the next day to get a bus to Flagstaff., so we didn't have a car.  We phoned for the hotel shuttle bus from the free phone in the airport, which was easy to find (with some help, there are people in the airport employed to stand around being helpful, which is welcome after the 1.5 hour queue for immigration) and it arrived within 10-15 mins as promised, the journey took 5 mins. In the morning the shuttle left every 20 mins.  The room was big, comfortable and clean, same for the bed (sleep number - what's the big deal? it's just a firm but comfortable bed), there was a wetroom shower which worked well. There is a restaurant and room service in the hotel if you need it, we didn't use it. The $10.95 breakfast was really nice, with fresh fruit, porridge, bagels, waffles as well as bacon, sausage etc.  There was a PC and printer in the lobby, but don't leave it till 8am to print your boarding pass, you won't be the only one. A great place to stay for a quick stopover. The location would probably not be great for a longer stay.

<Content>Rooms that don't exist We booked at this hotel for the location and for the sleep number bed as we have one at home. We were on a 8 night business trip.DAY1:We booked a 2 room king suite that was smoking with a sleep number bed. We got to the room and found the layout to be very poor. You can not use the wheels on your luggage to get from the enterance to the bedroom area because it was so cramped. We checked for bugs and that was when we found out that we were not given a sleep number bed. They charge a premium for this bed so we were unhappy and went to the front desk.They did finally admit that the room we booked does not exist in this hotel. The Radisson Hotel website said it did and when we called in our reservation they said it did. We asked if they could please move us to a room with a sleep number king that was smoking or move a sleep number bed into that room. After 1.5 hours of going round and round with the front desk they did finally say they could switch rooms for us the next day and discount the fee for the room. Since we haven't checked out yet we don't know if they are going to actually correct the billing. DAY2:We came back to hotel the next day after sight seeing in the area to switch our room only to find our old room keys had been deactivated effectily locking us out from our luggage. Back to the front desk we went. They corrected the keys and we swapped rooms and returned the old room keys. DAY3:We asked the front desk for an extra feather down comforter to allow the 2 of us sleep comfortably. We put in this request in the morning. We came back early evening and find out now we had our keys deactivated again and went back to the front desk. We got into our room and found no extra blanket that was requested in the morning and we did see them write down the request with the room number. We then went out to dinner and came back to find a different style blanket than requested and are very uncomfortable.We have 6 more nights and 7 more days to go. We have never had this many problems in such short of time. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my family or friends. Also the area doesn't seem to be the best.

<Content>Great airport hotel Stayed here 2/10/08, very nice stay. Booked through Priceline but no mention of Priceline at check in. We were on 3rd floor, king bed, overlooking a/c unit and parking structure but no noise from either. Loved the Sleep Number bed. Room was clean except a tissue on the floor in the bathroom behind the garbage can and when searching for my shoe I lifted up the bedskirt and there was lots of junk under there, like they don't vacuum very well underneath things. But countertops were ok and bath  bed linens were fine. When we first went down the hallway I wondered if the room was really going to be a non-smoking as the hall reeked of smoke but the room was fine, no smoke smell. We had breakfast in the restaurant. We ordered from the ala carte menu as we didn't want the whole $11 buffet breakfast and it was okay. Front desk staff were always very pleasant. It was handy that they had a computer and printer right in the lobby for guests to use free of charge. I could print out my boarding pass. Wireless internet worked fine (but I don't carry a printer). Didn't use the shuttle as we had a rental car. You are a long way from the rental car return at this hotel, I think if you rent a car it might be better to stay at a downtown hotel, seemed closer. Or, take your car back the night before.

<Content>nice enough This is a nice hotel, everything here is just fine except for the location. If this hotel was on the beach somewhere or in the mountains it would be real nice. We thought we lost our camera and called the hotel and they had us leave a voice mail for the lost and found. Well antonio called the next day to let us know they had not found it. Pretty cool.

<Content>good for a weekend...but needs some work stayed for a weekend - hotel is starting to show its age and use - clean, quiet - bathroom sink backed up, staff there in less than 5 minutes to address it - only problem was that all night long the sound of water backflowing from somewhere else into our bathroom sink pipe was going on as well - I think it's time to upgrade this place - maybe some new paint, new sinks (ours had a crack in it) - overall, an OK place to stay if you want to be near the airport - I've stayed here several times and overall the experience is OK to above average - oh yes, they also need more than one person at the front desk during high-usage checkout time - my compliments to Michele, a very nice front desk person - but she needs more help, especially when you have several people checking out all at once in a hurry to get to the airport -

<Content>Nothing special We got this hotel for $70 a night on Priceline. We only stayed here one night. We drove here from San Diego after being in SD for 5 nights. We wish we stayed in SD. Phoenix is extremely boring, with nothing to do. The downtown area is filled with homeless people and just very dull. We will definitely not be returning to Phoenix ever again. San Diego is amazing.As for the hotel, it's in the airport zone, so it's convenient if you have a flight to catch, but didn't matter for us. If you're not used to hearing planes all night, you might have trouble sleeping. The staff is very friendly and check in was quick. There is no hot water in the shower, it only gets lukewarm. The beds are very uncomfortable (sleep number). Many people like sleep number beds but I find them to be very uncomfortable. There is a fitness center that consists of 2 elliptical trainers, a treadmill and some machine that's supposed to simulate weight training. Would have been better if they put a rack of dumbells in the place of the machine. The pool was still open, but we didn't use it since it's freezing here. Overall, if you're coming to Phoenix for a vacation, I would seriously reconsider another location, like San Diego. But if you're just driving through like we did, you can see that there really is nothing to see.

<Content>Nice rooms, good restaurant We stayed at the Radisson Hotel Phoenix Airport North on 44th St. using United travel vouchers. The hotel was very nice, and we used two rooms, one with two double beds, and one with a king size bed. All had sleep number beds, which we had not used before and were very comfortable, although not as comfortable as memory foam. My 12 year old daughter enjoyed adjusting the bed! The hotel is in an area that is not too far from the airport, but it is not within walking distance to any restaurants, so you鈥檙e stuck with the hotel restaurant if you don鈥檛 have a car. However, we had dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was very good. We were able to call a free hotel shuttle from the airport, although they gave very unclear directions to where to meet the hotel shuttle, talking about a blue diamond that we couldn鈥檛 find. From terminal 2 (United) go out from baggage area and all the way down the baggage area sidewalk to the right, until you鈥檙e out from under the covered area. Don鈥檛 cross over the traffic to the rental car shuttle area. Also used small fitness room, only a few pieces of equipment for lifting weights, but treadmill worked fine. Didn鈥檛 have a chance to try the outdoor pool. There was free internet service on a computer in the lobby which was handy for checking on flight times.

<Content>A very pleasant surprise! We wanted a hotel close to the airport followinga latish arrival at Phoenix from London. Following a very long delay at Immigration because their computers had crashed we finally reached the hotel at about 8 p.m. Parking was plentiful and check in very efficient. We were very please with the size and cleanliness of our room. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. Room service arrived within the promised 20 minutes and the food was very good. Check out the following morning was equally swift.All in all this hotel is highly recommended by us.

<Content>Great Value! Great Staff! I booked this hotel based on reviews and was NOT disappointed. The staff at this location is great, especially Jahanna (Assistant Front Office Manager). The location is easy to get to/from the airport so it's great if you're going to be in and out of the city quickly. Rooms were clean and very comfortable. It's an awesome place at a great price. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great for early morning travel I got a great deal on Priceline for this hotel, and in addition to the great price, I got wonderful service from everyone I encountered. We stayed here the night before our 7 am flight. The hotel is only a 5-8 minute drive from the airport. We dropped off our rental car the night we arrived (and got there with pre-printed directions, thanks to the front desk staff) and the courtesy shuttle came and picked us up to bring us back to the hotel. The front desk staff also recommended some good restaurants - we ended up across the street at the Chinese Cultural Center, which was a neat experience. The pool was nice but the hot tub was too hot to get into, seeing as how it was 100 degrees at 9 pm! The room was nicely appointed - Sleep Number bed was awesome, and there was free bottle water and chocolate mints to enjoy. Overall, a nice, luxurious hotel to enjoy!

<Content>Fine for nondisabled guests, problematic for those of us with disabilities. We stayed here for four nights and the stay was a better than average experience. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful but didn't always give us correct information. The computer in the lobby was a wonderful extra. We are used to that amenity in Best Westerns and it's one of the reasons we often choose Best Westerns when we are traveling. This is the first time I've seen this at a Radisson and it meant we didn't have to lug our own computer and could still stay in touch with work email. The room was clean and comfortable. But the disability accommodations in the shower that were extremely problematic. The built-in tile seat at the end of the shower farthest from the shower head and controls was a bit too far to be reached by the shower head on the hose. The shower head on the hose was so difficult to turn on and to figure out how to turn on that we had to call the maintenance person -- who couldn't figure out how to turn it on, either. Finally, my husband figured it out -- accidentally. The shower curtain wasn't long or wide enough to contain the water and so the floor got flooded. There was always ice water in the lobby and that was wonderful because it was so incredibly hot outside.Although I had made a special call directly to the hotel to make sure that the disability accommodations would work for us and to make sure that we would have a fridge waiting for our medications and that all feather pillows had been removed, when we arrived there were feather pillows on the bed, no fridge, and the shower had the problems I mentioned above. AND they had no record of my calls and requests. VERY annoying -- but, alas, very common.Still, the staff responded as quickly as they could to the problems, corrected them as well as they were able, and made sure to give us a first floor room. Nice people on the staff but not trained to deal with guests with disabilities, only technically in ADA compliance. But we would stay here again because most hotels are no better in terms of disability issues and often not as nice as this place.

<Content>Nice~ We got a good deal through priceline(bidding) and this hotel is great. It has clean room, comfortable bed,  friendly staff. Free internet access is a big plus! A Chinese grocery store  several chinese restaurants are within the walking distance (even under the heat!) We really enjoy the stay! The only complain is that their TV is not working properly. The sound  image can't match.

<Content>Great Airport Hotel This was a Great hotel. We loved it. Clean spacious room. Nice pool. Helpful staff. Free internet in the lobby. Pleasant overall stay. Someone mentioned that it's not close to anything besides the airport---that's true. We stayed here to catch a morning flight out. I woudln't recommend it as a home-base for a Phoenix vacation but it was a really great place for us to stay on the end of an Arizona vacation that included Phoenix, Sedona and Williams. We really liked this hotel. We were pleasantly surprised.

<Content>Nice...but needs somethings The hotel's big plus is it's proximity to the airport however that is about all the its really close to. There are few places to eat at nearby. There is a restaurant onsite and they do offer room service but there wasn't anything so appealing on the menu. I traveled with my 15mo old and my husband but we didn't stay in a suite which would probably have been a much better choice with a young child - the room was nice although the bathroom (one of my pet peeves) was certainly lacking in some areas. The toilet ran every time you used it and the handle fell off or was close to falling off on each occasion (I even had to take the top off the tank in order to fix the handle once - not what you'd expect on a hotel stay) and the tub spout dripped and dripped, there was some noticeable ceiling damage and peeling wall paper...Room service was quick but the food was filling more so than appetizing. While we were there they must have had some sort of leak or someone spilled water on the floor because they had a large fan outside our door for probably 12 hours or more drying the carpet. I liked the room decor when I viewed it online and it met my expectations in that regard. Everything outside of the bathroom seemed very well taken care of. One thing to keep in mind is that although they serve breakfast in the mornings, it is by no means complimentary. To summarize we stayed two nights for $48.00 a night, we had a king sleep number bed which was nice too. I would consider staying there again for the price we paid (I wonder if they put priceline guests in rooms that aren't as nice or have issues?)but in a different room. I enquired about the suites and was first told they did not have any suites or any rooms with refrigerators, they later said they did have suites and I could upgrade for an additional $40.00 per night...not bad considering that the suites were supposedly going for $169.00 per night during our stay but we were only staying one more night so we decided to stay put instead of lugging all our stuff (and a sleeping baby) to a new room in them middle of the night.

<Content>Really nice place and quiet on the weekend. Stayed here for one night prior to a flight out the next morning. The place was excellent in every way. Room was spacious and clean as was the entire hotel. No breakfast provided but they did have free coffee and free internet access. Only drawback was no good restaurants closeby. I used the website where you bid for a room. Give it a try.

<Content>Nice suprise! I don't usually use Priceline, but what a nice surprise getting this 3-star hotel near the airport for less than $70. I read that some got it for $50, so next time I may bid lower. Since I was flying out the next morning this place was the best. The shuttle was fast and friendly. So was check in (mine was fast: no line and there were 2 employees at the desk). I was very impressed with the rooms. They were clean with nice bathrooms and that sleep number bed is a dream. There was also free wi-fi which is very impressive for any hotel not to tack on an additional charge. Since I was tired, I did the quick walk to the Chinese cultural center and had dinner at the bar at the Golden Buddha. This is not your typical Chinese restaurant: the clams in spicy garlic sauce were amazing! So was the crispy quail appetizer. Also, the bartender (I think his name was Patrick) was very friendly and made my evening a pleasure (especially having to dine alone!). Btw, I highly recommend staying at a SAS/Radisson when in Europe. I stayed at one at the Manchester, England airport and was really impressed!

<Content>Wow this is a Radisson? In my personal opinion, I usually find Radisson hotels to be the bottom of the three star class. They look ok from a distance but when you get up close they are brimming with problems. This was a pleasant exception. This is a very nice three star hotel. All of the staff I encountered was friendly and helpful. The room was almost perfectly clean (and I think there is no better complement for a hotel than that) The forward Hilton-like space maximizing design of the room was nice as well. The sleep number bed was great. The shuttle to the airport takes eight minutes (I timed it) One other great thing about this place is the proximity to this Asian cultural center food area/office complex two blocks north of the hotel. It is hard to see from the road. When you get past the Chinese garden and walk in the arches you discover a whole asian mall full of Chinese restaraunts and a vietnamese superstore. The only problems I could see would have to be the lack of a business center. That is pretty inexcusable for an airport hotel. Especially since they can make it pay for itself if they want to. Another issue might be the staffing at the counters. They were nice, but they really needed a couple of extra people when I was there. The line was too long, but I was only there one night, might have been a fluke. All in all a great place. I would gladly stay there again.

<Content>I'd go back A beautiful hotel, inside and out. It had friendly staff that asked each time you went by the desk if they could be of assistance and I had a very comfortable room. I was concerned though that the tub drained slowly and I could feel the soap scum from previous bathers. I told the desk staff directly about the problem and they were very courteous, appropriately apologetic and very prompt to get someone to snake the drain, but no one ever cleaned the tub. I took a shower the next day. The hotel otherwise looks and feels very comfortable and the staff responsive enough that I would certainly try it again to see if this was just an exception.

<Content>Ok, a good Priceline (low cost) choice We had late flights in so we stayed here via Priceline prior to heading to the Grand Canyon. Our kids were exhausted so we put them to bed immediately (it was 1 a.m. our time) and unpacked. I went into the bathroom and the toilet was overflowing. We called down immediately and it took 4 phone calls to get someone up there. The thing was POURING out water.We then had to change rooms (opposite end of hall, would it kill them to move you nearby in these circustances?) and it was fine from there on out. We were in the place less than 12 hours in total, so for the price we paid ($62 + taxes) it was fine.

<Content>More like a 2+ star rated hotel This was just a jump off point for us. Our flight landed at 10:30pm and instead of driving to our resort in Scottsdale we opted to stay close to the airport for some rest. We got the hotel for $50 on price line so I can't complain too much, but it was just an average hotel stay with the general houskeeping/front desk issues. The room was not a sleep number bed which we were told it would be, it overlooked the airport and massive air conditioning units on the roof (not a big deal, we were only there to sleep) and the room was pretty unkept for being a clean room the bottled water they provide was half empty and never replaced, the bathroom floor still had hair and misc paper in corners, bathtub needed a scrub, the coffeemaker still dirty from last guest and the bed, although made, seemed oddly not fresh, as if they never changed the sheets....kinda skeevy but I chalked it up and went to bed. When we checked in, everything was closed and we were starving (by the way we found it odd for the bar to be closed at 11pm on saturday night in a large city like this), so we ordered take out at a nearby italian place who delivered to our room in about 45 minutes.As previous guests mentioned, the AC units are SO LOUD. You can't even hear yourself think when it is going, but the room was too warm not to have it on so we had to put pillows over our heads to sleep. The airplane wasn't even that noisy...it was terrible.I would say that this hotel has been way over rated here on tripadvisor and that it is a great hotel if you can get it for $50 a night on priceline, but if you paid regular rack rate at $149 it isn't worth it.Overall a basic hotel room worth about $50 a night, which is what we paid so....as it goes, you get what you pay for.

<Content>Convenitent to airport, overpriced, noisy room The Radisson is convenient to the airport. Desk staff were clueless when we asked for recommendations for fine dining. Management should provide them with list of restaurants, menus  driving directions. AC in room was unbearably noisy. Could not hear TV when it came on  woke us up several times during the night. Noticed that there are a number of other national chain suite hotels nearby for less $ with breakfast, a nice convenience if you have an early flight to catch.

<Content>Excellent in every way We stayed here one night in March. It was excellent in every way. (Decor, comfort, cleanliness, friendly and helpful staff.) We used express check in for a late arrival time of 10:00pm. A last minute change of plans had us arriving at 2:00pm. Our room was ready and we were able to check in early. Since we had some unexpected free time, the nice young lady at the front dest gave us very clear directions to a shopping mall. When we left I forgot one of my purchases. I called and spoke to the housekeeping manager who assured me they would mail it to me. When I got home 3 days later it was waiting for me. I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Okay, but don't understand the raves We reserved a double/double and were given a king. Nice room, but it wasn't going to work for the three of us. The desk quickly switched our room, but the new room was a bit crowded. There were used towels in the bathroom as well as clean ones - obviously not cleaned well. I didn't have the energy to move to yet another room.The restaurant felt pretty deserted, cold and impersonal. We didn't get one of the great deals that some other reviews have mentioned, but I can't blame that on the hotel. Okay stay, but I'm guessing there might be some better choices near the airport.
