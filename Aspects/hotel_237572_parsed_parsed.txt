<Content>GREAT EXPERIENCE We were totally pleased with this hotel. The location is on a very quiet street but just a block away from a main thoroughfare and the bridge to Leidesplein. The major museums are a 5-10 minute walk, trams are readily available. The staff was among the most pleasant we've encountered in 40 years of traveling to Europe. Our room was LARGE and the terrace overlooking Vondelpark was a delight. things that stood out..washcloths,!! a grab bar so you don't kill yourself getting out of those deep European tubs, and 2 separate duvets on the king sized bed so a blanket hog husband is no worry! The breakfast, inclided, was substanial with meats, eggs, and cheeses. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone.

<Content>Great hotel!! Just got back from a four day stay at the Hestia with a group of friends.Location was excellent. Five minutes from the bustling Leiseplein area (with trams to all other areas of Amsterdam) yet situated on a quiet street. There was very little noise during the night.Check-in was fast, easy and efficient. The rooms were very clean and quite spacious for Amsterdam, equipped with a TV, radio, hairdryer, safe etc. Beds were comfy and there was spare blankets provided. The stairs were a bit steep but there was a perfectly accessible lift so it was easy to get up and down.Breakfast was totally fine, what I expected for the very reasonable price, and the coffee was delicious! There was a lovely veradah to sit outside, and a house cat named Gregory.Rooms were cleaned every day to a good standard and fresh towels were provided. However, what made this stay so enjoyable was the combination of excellent facilities for the price, and excellent customer service. It is a very personal service at the Hestia. Whenever we needed help, for directions or advice, nothing was too much trouble for them. We were able to store our bags for as long as necessary on the last day as we had a late connection.The Hestia is just fab, would recommend to anyone!

<Content>A Wonderful Experience I visited the Hotel Hestia during my first trip to Europe, and my first solo trip. I booked a single room, situation in the front of the building.It was small, but comfortable. The bathroom was very small, but average size for Euro hotel bathrooms. My luggage was lost en route from Scotland to Amsterdam, and the customer service number they provided me had recordings in Dutch. The owner of the hotel offered to call and arrange for me to receive my luggage. She was a godsend!! I can't say enough about how much she improved my stay in the country.The location is perfect, about equidistant from the liedesplein, the vondelpark and the museumenplein. It was also easily adjacent from a number of public transport stations.

<Content>Great place to stay Our family of 5 spent 4 nights at Hotel Hestia at the end of May. We had a large room ensuite with windows that opened over the backyard. The hotel is in a great location, is very clean, and has a good, small buffet breakfast included. The staff were very kind and helpful. We enjoyed our stay and would stay again.

<Content>Perfect Stayed here for 4 nights on our first trip to Amsterdam, and our experience with the hotel was great. We arrived before our room was ready, but the manager on duty stored our bags and let us relax on the hotel's back patio after our long flight. I was expecting a much smaller room based on some reviews, but we had the double-twin medium room and there was plenty of space for us and our luggage. Staff was always very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast spread in the morning always kept us full until lunch. The hotel is on a nice quiet street, but the great restaurants and bars in the Leidsplein as well as tram stops are only a short walk away. It also backs right up to Vondelpark which we really liked. You won't get luxury here, but we were more concerned with enjoying the city than our hotel. Would definitely stay here again, and would recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>So helpful We were three older couples; stayed for three nights. Only minus was the rooms were small. Otherwise this hotel is a great value! Quite clean, very quiet, no street noise, a lift, a nice variety for breakfast, pleasant breakfast room and lovely outdoor patio. The well-staffed desk will arrange cabs, tours, you name it. Ruth made us a breakfast goody bag to take with us for our 7:15 a.m. plane the night before. Staff could not have been more helpful or kind!

<Content>strange name, smashing hotel This is an unassuming but absolutely spot-on hotel.Our room was large and clean.The hotel's location is great, in a nice quiet pleasant street but with Leidesplein an easy 5 minutes walk away ,vondelpark even closer and nothing really far away.The breakfast room is nice ,with a small charming patio garden off .Breakfast was limited in choice but not volume, and was absolutely fine .The hotel has an understated character.The staff have not been on the corporate greet and meet course as it is a private family hotel, but they'll look after you just the same.We'd definitely go back.

<Content>good location The bigger rooms are spacious and nice. Quiet, architechturally quaint street; half a block down are six buildings side by side, each representing a different European style. Big Vondel park is real close, as is Leidsplein with all the restaurants. If you can hoist your bags on the tram, it's an easy five minute walk from the stop at Leidsplein.Good breakfast. Friendly lady working day shift. petty crime warning: If you come as a group keep eyes open for the odd street urchin trying to take advantage of front door confusion and making off with a handbag or wallet--and I'd heed the same warning in Vondelpark.

<Content>Nice, reasonably priced, and convenient hotel My friend and I stayed here in a double room on a girls only vacation. The people at the hotel were very pleasant. This is a tiny hotel, with a teeny elevator, but was perfect for our stay. The room wasn't gigantic, but we were in Europe, so it was as expected! We had our own bathroom which was great. The room and bathroom were very clean. Their complimentary breakfast was relaxing and everything was fresh and available. The hotel's cat came to visit us as we ate. We found that the hotel was right near tram stations, shopping, and the park so it was very convenient for our trip. It was also on a side street with a quiet and pleasant atmosphere. As we left, they gave us a token gift which I thought was very nice of them. I would absolutely stay here again. It was a very quaint hotel with affordable rooms, close to the hustle and bustle of the city, but off it enough to provide quiet when needed.

<Content>I thought it was pretty good I stayed at the Hotel during the weekend 19/22 October travelling with my wife and another couple. We were very lucky to have room 15 which is large, spacious and includes a balcony overlooking the rear of the premises. The room was clean, simple without being over decorated and had a bath and shower.Our friends felt aggrieved as they had paid the same price but were stuck in an attic room with two single beds pushed together. Their room was cramped. I loved our room though the lighting was very dim. The hotel is ideally located and once we discovered how the tram system worked it was easy for us to travel from near the hotel right to the heart of the city. The staff were very friendly and spoke excellent English. Breakfast was different to the good old fried breakfast and there was plenty of it. The one thing that was strange about Amsterdam is the thin narrow stairs which are very steep (great for the calf muscles) The lift helps though as without it i wouldn't recommend it for young children or the the elderly. I am sure there are many finer hotels in Amsterdam but you get what you pay for and afterall this is a capital city. Would I stay there again? Absolutely !

<Content>Little gem in quiet area near the action Husband, 2.5 year old, and I stayed for 1 night at Hestia. We just arrived in Amsterdam from a looong trip from Asia, and needed a place to stay before taking the train to Brugge.We paid 168 euro for a room with 3 twin beds, inclusive of breakfast and taxes. To be honest, when I first arrived, I was rather shocked by the smallness of the hotel and the room. But a later stay at a different Amsterdam hotel conveyed that Amsterdam small hotels are just that....they are small.BUT, we had a very nice stay. The location was super nice. In a quiet area, but just 5 mins walk to the Leidsplein. We could oped the windows at night. The beds were super comfy. The breakfast was adequate. The rooms were clean. And we had space to put 2 big suitcases and a stroller in there. There were lots of other similar hotels in the area (we saw Owl, Vondel, Roemer). I suspect these hotels are all quite comparable.

<Content>Would have given Hestia 5 stars...... ...if my double room was a little more comfortable and larger. I stayed for 5 nights and although I was by myself, the room was rather tiny. It wasn't too much of a problem because, like I said, I was alone, but the bathroom was way too small and particularly narrow. So narrow that I couldn't bend over the sink because when you stand in front of the mirror, your back is already pressed against the wall! That's pretty narrow.My main gripe would be that another double room in the hotel probably costs the same but is most likely larger.Other than that, the hotel is great. The staff very friendly and helpful in every way. Room cleaned and towels changed everyday. Safe and fridge in the room along with tv and phone. Perfect location if you want a nice quiet place to stay. Very close to the nothern entrance to Vondelpark. A brief walk to Museum area. 5 Minutes from Leidesplein..... After many stays in Amsterdam over the years, I consider Hestia a nice deal, especially if you're at least 2 people traveling, since you will probably get one of the decent size rooms. I recommend it highly, all things considered.

<Content>Great for families The Hestia is a great choice for families. Terrific location and good amenities, as others have said. Triples and quads are large and comfortable. Staff friendly  helpful. I'd stay again if travelling with three or more. Tiny elevator not a problem for most people but probably a barrier to anyone disabled.

<Content>Exactly as it said on the tin! Just back from staying at this hotel and can report that it was a good experience. The room (a medium one) was a decent enough size with TV, mini-bar, safe etc. Everything clean and tidy. The bright and airy breakfast room was welcoming in the morning. The buffet breakfast was ample with plenty of choice of cold meats, cheeses, eggs and cereals. If you really wanted to you could eat to your heart's content! People in other reviews have commented about the small lift. Yes, it is small, but my wife and I and a case fitted in cosily, and hey, who stays in the lift! The staff were friendly and helpful (thanks Ruth and Arnuld and the others whose names I never caught). All in all recommended.

<Content>Really disappointed Stayed recently in this hotel and thankfully for only one night. Staff very obliging , location very central, quiet and refined and on the whole the hotel could be described as clean but our room was ludicrously small. We were in room 35 - top floor facing the front - and I am not exaggerating when I say the room housed a double bed and that was all. If we wanted to open the suitcase we had to put it on the bed and there was no room to put anything anywhere. The bathroom was also tiny - so cramped and box like - a small shower cubicle and a tiny sink and toilet. Maybe we drew the short straw because I saw other rooms that were being cleaned and they were much bigger. I would have not expected to pay the price I did for this room. I would also have expected a reduction for being given this room which needless to say we were not awarded. I heard the hotel manager asking another guest at breakfast if they wanted to change their room to something bigger as they were staying a few nights - maybe this is their policy - shove guests into the small room if they are not spending lots of time or money there. Disappointed. Be careful.

<Content>Only place I'll stay in amsterdam Three of us (my mom, a friend and I) stayed at the Hotel Hestia the last week in May and I can honestly say I will not look for another hotel in amsterdam. This is it, the one we will stay at any time we go back. What a location. Just a few minutes walk to Vondlepark, one way, and a few minutes walk to Leidsestraat or a canal bus the other direction. And yet the Hestia is on such a quiet street you feel like you're miles away. Perfect.What a room. Our triple was huge, even for american standards. And totally clean and updated. Now I have heard that some of the doubles and singles are on the smallish side, but I can only comment on our room. HUGE. Three comfortable beds, a table with four chairs, a large balcony overlooking the street.......who could ask for more. All I can say is if youre looking for comfortable beds in a quiet clean room, this is it.What a staff. The gentleman who checked us in had only been working at the hotel for a few weeks and was perfectly lovely, completely helpful, and genuine as could be. The morning staff who fixed the breakfast and ran the desk were wonderful as well. Sweet, fun, and helpful yet again. There are parrots in the backyard area and an adorable cat named Gregory who hangs out in the breakfast room. The price was perfect too. All in all we LOVED this hotel and would highly recommend it. Do be careful though as the stairs are steap and the elevator is tiny, not for wheelchairs unfortunately as there are no bottom floor rooms. See you at the Hestia.

<Content>Great Value for money Stayed at this hotel in May'2007, and it was fantastic. We have been to amsterdam a couple of time so knew what area we wonted to stop in, we wonted peace and quite and to be away from the hustle and bustle of the city and this hotel was fantastic. on a side street just off vondel park, the location couldnt have been better, and just round the corner from the ledei-square exactly what we wonted.The rooms were large and spacious,with a HUGE window. (when we've been to amsterdam before the bedroom windows are usually very small and make the room look dingy) The Lift was extremely small and scary but thats about the only thing we could moan about( and thats just being picky), the breakfast room was bright and cosy, the staff were extremely friendly and just wonted to help and make recommendations of where to go and what to see. The minibar in the room was Very cheap but the hotel didnt mind you buying your own stuff and just using it as a fridge. All in all this was one of the best hotels ive stayed in and should be visited by anyone traveling to amsterdam. I would def. stop at this hotel again and def. recommend to any1 thnkin of stoppin at this hotel it was fantastic.

<Content>"Small" Hotel This hotel in Amsterdam has a lot going for it, such as a great location on a quiet street near the Van Gogh Museum, helpful staff, and a decent breakfast (included). However, it has one big drawback: the rooms (at least ours) are tiny. We had to stow our suitcases in the (tiny) shower in order to have space to move around in the room. Also the elevator is tiny, which gets interesting if you are trying to get more than one bag up to your room at the same time. Not so bad for a single person, but ask for a larger room (if they have any) if you are a couple or more.

<Content>Great value and location Great value for basic creature comforts. Located on quiet street near museums and Vondel Park. Small tidy rooms, adequate lift, nice breakfast, and very helpful staff. Recommended to anyone, singles, families, seniors, couples, looking for quiet, basic lodging. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends/family.

<Content>Fantastic quality, great location, breakfast  I just got back from a 4-night stay here with my Mum and we felt that we couldn't have chosen a nicer hotel. For the price (we paid 140 euros per night for a large triple room as all twins were booked), it was superb. The room was HUGE (and had a balcony too), the breakfast was lovely with plenty of choice (cheese, ham, cereal, muesli, yoghurt, fruit, boiled eggs and a variety of breads to toast), and the little breafast room was delightful, with french doors leading out to small, sunny garden, which was frequented each morning by 3 green paraqueets! The location was perfect too. In a quiet, exclusive-feeling road, but just 5 minutes walk from the Leidseplein (a hub for nightlife and bars), canal bus stop for tours, and practically next door to the Rijks Museum, Van Gogh Museum and Vondel Park. Tram stops from the Leidseplein also take you to Dam Square or Centraal Station in around 5 minutes. Perhaps not ideal for younger traveller who want to be within a short walking distance of the old centre (home to the red light district, shops, famous 'cafes', Dam Square, lots of restaurants etc...), but for us this was a bonus - the centre, although the oldest part, is not exactly the most 'desirable' or pretty part of the city. We felt we were much better off where we were and really if you wanted to, you probably could walk to Dam Square within 30-40 mins. At the end of the day, Amsterdam is pretty small, so if you don't mind walking a bit it doesn't really matter where you are!All in all, a fantastic stay that could not be faulted.

<Content>Great family hotel We stayed here for 4 nights in April (recommendation from the Rick Steve's book). My husband had a conference in the Dam area, and none of the conference hotels would accommodate 4 people! This place was cheaper than most of the conference room hotels, and breakfast was included!Since I was traveling with my husband and two kids (6  9) I wanted a place that was safe and quite. This hotel was ideal for us. We stayed in room16, (which was large by European standards) it had a nice balcony overlooking a quite street. Since my son got sick soon after our arrival, it was nice having a large room that allowed my husband to work while my son got through his illness. We also stayed in Room 2 (which is even larger), it had a nice view of the back patio. I originally booked the hotel for 3 nights, but realized I needed it for another night for our flight out, and luckily they were able to accommodate us. The pillows/bed/showers were very nice. I'm afraid my kids will be spoiled because it was so nice. It is very close to the Leidsplain and Museum area, so you can walk to alot of sites. If you want to get to the center of town, it's only a 5-10 minute trolley ride to the Red Light District and Dam area. (Get a strip card from the TI at Leidslain about 6E for a strip card of 15. You need to use two strip cards/trip.)The breakfast was fine for everyone, no one felt hungry. The kids especially like the chocolate sprinkles to put on their bread. You can buy a wifi card if you bring your own computer.

<Content>a great recommendation Hestia was recommended to me by a work colleague  I wasn't disappointed. A small, family run and very friendly hotel. Stayed 4 nights in a 3-bedded room (no. 16) which was plenty large enough for us, and has a wide balcony overlooking the street. Room very clean and comfortable: our only grumble was the shower temperature was fiddly to set / adjust as both hot  cold flows had to be set separately. Breakfast buffet was perfectly adequate, albeit anyone looking for hot food will have to be contented with only boiled eggs. Location was very convenient for the Liedseplein, where there are masses of eateries to choose from (especially if you're fond of Italian) and also within easy walking distance of the museums area. Would be happy to stay at the Hestia again.

<Content>cozy ** friendly ** delighted stayed in hotel hestia for 3nights with 3 of my boys in a quad room, very spacious, cozy beds, warm, clean, big bathroom, clean sheets and towels daily most importantanly friendly staff which was run by a family. Now the bad side was that it was about 20 mins walk to Redlight district and Dam square but very close to light central for shopping, eating drinking. will definently go again worth the price....

<Content>A very nice small hotel We found hotel hestia to be clean, safe and quiet. The rooms were very comfy, the beds were heaven, and the family who run it were very friendly, and polite. The breakfast was fine for us, but if you like a huge cooked breakfast you will be a bit miffed!Only quibble was the noise from the lift beside our room, otherwise there was no noise. Its in a great location, we would definitely stay again.

<Content>Great staff, cozy rooms - don't hesitate! Terrific staff! Clean, cozy rooms, soft comfortable beds. And yet, the bathrooms are something out of a Tim Burton movie. I'm surprised I didn't hear a Danny Elfman tune ever time I lifted the toilet seat lid. However, for the price you cannot get anything better in Amsterdam. The location is terrific. This was my third visit and second time I've stayed at Hotel Hestia. My last visit started in a different hotel that was the same price, but so offensive that I had to change to Hotel Hestia. This time I searched the internet for two solid days trying to find the perfect hotel. Lo and behold, Hotel Hestia came up on top of my search each time. Using Hotels.nl also was a terrific experience. Lowest prices on the internet by a landslide. NB: keep your hotel key with you. They are a small family run hotel and lock the doors at night. If you have your key, no problem. If you are running late for check in just give them a call. They will stay up waiting for you with a warm smile and greet you at the door. If you are a seasoned traveler who has stayed in many cheap hotels then you will understand why this one is a gem. If you are looking for luxury and American standards you will be disappointed. This is a quirky, cozy hotel.

True, the breakfast is a little sparse, but so what! THe hotel is clean, the rooms ample in size and the mattesses are great. Not to be missed!

<Content>Lovely family run hotel Booked this hotel fairly late on having been put off of the original one I'd booked. Found it easily from the instructions given. Easy to get to from Centraal - choice of 3 trams, and only a few minutes from tram stop. Lovely family run hotel - made us welcome. Beds comfortable, rooms are a little small, but had everything we needed including a mini-bar (farily reasonably priced) and a safe which we used. Ony criticism was that our room (number 40) was right next to reception / front doors. Consequently we were woken up early both mornings by people checking out/talking / phone ringing / radio. Breakfast was good, fresh fruit  yoghurt, cereals, toasts etc. Also we were given a 10% off voucher for the canal boat which we used. Overall we would definitely go back, but would ask for a different room!

<Content>Nice hotel We stayed at the hotel just 2 nights from 28th of August. The hotel was small, but very nice. I better like this kind of hotels than the big, huge glittering hotels. First of all, the staff (I think it was a family) were very kind and helpfull.We were in the medium room. This was nice, bright and clean, little bit small but confortable (in Amsterdam everything is small :-) ) . The breakfast was good. There was breads, toast, salami, ham, cheese, eggs, m眉zli, joghurt, milk, jam, mixed fruits, tea, coffee and orange juice. The breakfast room was nice and clean too. The hotel milieu and all Amsterdam was wonderful. The transport from the hotel was very easy, just a little walk and there is everything: tram station, restaurants, shops, bank and beautiful streets.If I will go to Amsterdam I will choose this hotel.

<Content>Very nice I stayed here 3 nights. My single room was tiny, but functional. There was a small balcony attached and looked out onto the garden. Unfortunately it rained all 3 days so I never really enjoyed sitting on the balcony! The only problem was since I was near the stairs and on the 1st (european) floor, I could hear a lot of people clomping up and down the stairs. Also late at night I could hear the staff getting the breakfast room ready. But that is the only complaint.The breakfast was basic, but good. The hotel was located on a residential street, so it was quiet. It's right near the Vondelpark, great for a stroll or a jog, and the Leidensplein, and several museums. It's not super close to the center, but it's a great walk, and there are several tram lines nearby. I would stay here again.

<Content>Great Little Budget Hotel I just returned this week 4-05 from a stay at the Hotel Hestia. Overall it is a great little hotel and staff were very nice and helpful. I stayed in a Single Room which looks just like the pictures on their site BUT was very tiny. They switched me after my 1st night to another single room ( not sure why). The 1st room has a balcony and garden view but was near the elevator and stairs and was a bit noisy. The 2nd room faced the street but the bathroom was larger and seemed bigger but with no balcony. Overall the only problem was hot/cold temp of the shower- hard to control and noise at night with the stairs. Otherwise it was quiet and the bed was tiny single but comfortable. The room was cleaned daily and TV had cable and decent breakfast was included. Due to Smoking rooms my room did get Smokey smell at night_ I do not smoke. But for the money and location near the Museums I would stay again. Due to bad planning I had to leave before the trams started and I needed a taxi which the staff called and arranged for me- they were great and let me check out the day before and just leave my key on the front desk. Price for the whole stay was exactly as I had booked it-no surprises.

<Content>A very nice reasonable Hotel We just got back from Amsterdam having stayed at hotel hestia for 4 days, we were very pleased with this little hotel, the family who run it were very polite and friendly. The hotel is clean and in a lovely neighbourhood,its quiet at night with no street noise, but the elevator does make a bit of noise, the rooms are small, but tidy and clean,the showers could be a bit more powerful, but they did the job, breakfast was very nice and we found it to be plentiful. We would return to this hotel, we foudn it to be good value for money.

<Content>Excellent value for money Myself and my girlfriend stayed at the Hestia in early March. Arriving late on a Wednesday night was not a problem, and we were in our room within 5 minutes! As we were on the 4th floor, we just about managed to get our luggage in the compact lift - luckily as like most places in Amsterdam, the stairs are steep!We had a small double room, we knew what to expect and were very happy with it. It was clean and tidy, and the bathroom was very clean. The mini-bar is an added bonus, and we did take advantage!!! Be careful though, you can run up a bill!The hotel is well situated, 5 minutes walk from Leidseplien [sp] area/square, which is excellent for travel links around Amsterdam [canal bus  trams].It is also very close to the Museum area and the Vondelpark. Overall we were very happy with the Hestia, and would definetly recommend it. It made our stay in Amsterdam very enjoyable.
