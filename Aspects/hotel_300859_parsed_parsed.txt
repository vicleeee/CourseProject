<Content>Like a Drum With a Hole in It . . Can't Beat It! Forget those super-critical that gripe and moan that it isn鈥檛 a true 4-star, it is. I have traveled for business and pleasure for more than fifty years and stayed in better and in a hell of a lot worse. The rooms are as good and as well appointed as any 4-star hotel in any country. Are there better? Sure, but so what? From the well appointed lobby to the private dining rooms, from the details of 110/220 outlet in the well tiled-bath with separate tub and shower room to the tea service set, it is not only a 4-star but exceptional value. We took a SmarTour and were amazed at the value, location and cost. The breakfast (included) is plentiful and in many ways the basis for survival in Beijing for those who are concerned with the cleanliness and safety of less than top- flight local restaurants at top-flight prices. The other food at the hotel is horribly over-priced and tastes like Styrofoam, however. It is not only walking distance to Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City and Wangfujing (shopping street  Wangfujing creepy-crawler-on-a-stick eating alley) but a few blocks from the Friendship Store, KFC, Pizza Hut and Micky D鈥檚. It is less expensive than an Econo Lodge in Savannah or a Holiday Inn Express in Tupelo, yet comparable to any Hilton, Sheridan, Forum or Crowne Plaza in LA, NY or Chicago.

<Content>Nice but be careful We stayed from 11-30 thru 12-6. Very nice hotel  most staff speak english. Did not eat at the hotel, there's a great Muslim place across the street for breakfast, pleanty of little places all around for great fresh food. Jack, the bell capitan, hooked us up with a few places to eat  a car to the Great Wall at Badaling for 600RMB without any side tours for 6 hours. The pool  sauna were nice in the cold weather. Be careful of the basement. It advertises a Karoke Bar in the basement, but it's seemed to be several VIProoms with girls and some were not really dressed when we first came across it early in the am. The rooms were fine, beds were REALLY hard and the floors not cleaned. Short walk to the square, about 15 minute walk to the pearl market. Nice location.

<Content>Good location Stayed at the Capital for 4 nights. Room was spacious and good value for the price. We were at the club level  they provide good breakfast at the club lounge so that you do not have to be with the crowd ( although I suspect you can get more choices with food). Concierge was very helpful. Within 10 mins walk from Tianmen square  subway station. Overall, excellent value for money.

<Content>Not a pleasant stay Looks like this place was nice at some point but no longer is.I stayed on the 11th floor of Tower B. I think the Tower A rooms are the nicer ones. First thing was I had requested one bed and there were two. Secondly the room was VERY hot. When I called down to the desk and they sent someone from housekeeping up to the room he just opened the windows. He said the air conditioning system was shut down for the season and no matter what I set the thermostat at, the air would blow hot. With the windows open the room never got comfortable but did get bearable. However, the room was now very noisy. All the street noise filtered in and that made it tough to sleep. Also, every day room service shut the windows and the rooom was hot when I got back from my day out.The bed was uncomfortable, the T.V. was small and fuzzy and the water temperature never got hot enough for a comfortable shower or shave.All of the hotel restaurants are very expensive and the food is fair at best. I stayed at some really nice places in China. This was the only bad experience.I would not stay there again!

<Content>Nice hotel, but We had a very nice room. Clean and nicely stocked with amenities. A lovely turn-down service at night. I agree with the other reviewers that the food is OK, not great. We had a Peking duck dinner there and it was marginal at best. You can get much better Peking duck in L. A. The comment about the front office staff is true also. I had an issue on our bill where we were charged for something we did not buy. They were not crazy about the idea of wanting to remove the charge. It took forever and some help from our Chinese tour guide. I think that they were just trying to wear me down in hopes that I would go away.

<Content>great hotel and great location we stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and were very pleasantly surprised. The lobby was large and modern. The room was very large and clean with a beautiful modern bathroom with walk-in shower and soaker bathtub. Terry robes and slippers were provided as well as complimentary tea/coffee/water. The towels were thick and fluffy. When my daughter arrived the third night, another bed was added and things were cramped but not intolerable.There were at least 4 restaurants in the hotel. We didn't try any but saw that one offered a buffet breakfast with combination western and asian food for about 160 yuan-this seemed very expensive.The hotel had a small bowling alley and a swimming pool. The pool looked great and we were sorry we didn't bring swim suits.Check-in was efficient. Staff was friendly and most spoke some English. They were very helpful when my daughter arrived in the middle of the day. We were out touring and they contacted us on our guide's phone and he was able to tell them and her where she should come to meet us.Location was excellent- 5-10 minute walk to Tiananmen Square, the subway, very interesting markets and also some up scale shopping.. There was also a supermarket where we could buy yoghurt, cheese, fruit, etc. for breakfast.We would definitely return there.

<Content>Good location, quality hotel My husband, daughter and I stayed at the Capital for 4 nights. The rooms are quite small so having an extra bed in the room made for cramped quarters. Nevertheless the rooms were well furnished and very clean. The beds are hard as they are all over China. This hotel is in a great location - walking distance to Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City etc. The hotel has a good range of facilities and restaurants. The service was fine but be careful of costs - a glass of milk ordered from room service cost us $8AUS. Otherwise we were happy with our stay.

<Content>grand soviet style The hotel itself consists of two blocks 鈥?both huge and connected through the lobby. Most of the staff speak English and some of them were helpful while others seemed to be at a loss. Our room was in block B, on 4th floor 鈥?two single beds, TV, safe, tea facilities, bathroom (a bit on a dark side), small fridge (which was not restocked every day). The mattresses were hard but surprisingly comfy. There were three English speaking channels 鈥?CNN, HBO and CCTV 9 (Chinese international channel). There seemed to be two places to have your breakfast 鈥?you get vouchers either for the caf茅 or for the four season restaurant. There is enough choice for breakfast although some of the items did not have their usual taste. Anyways, on to the main bit: location. It stands on a street that is busy with traffic and you do get the usual noise (although that could be just the rooms facing the east qianmen street). There are always taxis available. If you come out of hotel and turn right in about 10 -15 min. you鈥檒l get to the Tiananmen Sq. If you turn left and then again left at the first intersection you鈥檒l get to the main shopping street in about 15-20 min. Next to Tiananmen Sq. there are the: Qianmen street (it has been restored recently and most stores are still unoccupied, but the street that runs parallel to it has plenty of shops) and Laoshe Teahouse (which has daily variety shows starting at 7:50 pm and finishing at 9:20; the shows include 20 min. of Chinese opera, 20 min. of Kung-fu, acrobatics, tea ceremony, etc.)Hotel organised a private trip for us to the Great Wall (we chose the Mutianyu bit) which cost 900 (EUR 90 equivalent) for both of us. Overall the style of the hotel was soviet 鈥?what I mean is that it was rather grand but not quite all there; but the location is central, rooms are clean and all the facilities are present. My advise is stay at the hotel but do not eat your dinners there (the restaurants are much more expensive and the quality of food is not as good when compared to all the little eateries around town).

<Content>Beautiful hotel, could maybe get better located hotel though We stayed here for 6 nights in July 2008. This hotel is very grand and our rooms were lovely. The room was very large and the marble bathroom was excellent. The decor of the rooms was a little bit out dated (think dark green and browns etc).The breakfast is seriously overpriced however the cafe and restaurant serve decent food (including Western food). The cafe is open 24 hours which is excellent for late night snacks. The buffet dinner is ok, a little expensive, however it includes free flow wine which we certainly made use of :-)The hotel is about 15/20 minute walk to Tianamen Square and Forbidden City. It is also a 15 minute walk to Wanfujing St. If I was going to Beijing again I would prefer to stay up closer to Wanfujing St. It is the main shopping street and has a lot more hustle and bustle, a nicer atmosphere. Capital Hotel is somewhat isolated in it's location, there are no little shops or restaurants which you can pop out to.The staff were very friendly and helpful though. They even rang Pizza Hut and ordered for us one night when my boyfriend couldn't leave the room because of an injury. They have good English and wrote all of our taxi destinations in Chinese for us.Overall, a lovely stay in the Capital, very pleasant hotel.

<Content>Room Great, Staff Not So Great We just returned from Beijing after staying at the Capital Hotel for 3 nights. We had a deluxe room with 2 beds, and it was a very nice, clean, large room, well-decorated and appointed. The bathroom was large, attractive (marble counters), and had a shower/bathtub combo. The bed was comfortable. The air conditioning was excellent. The lobby of the hotel is also very lovely and elegant, and the hotel even has a small bowling alley for guest use for a small 30 yuan (about $4 USD) fee. The indoor swimming pool is a bit small but adequate.I would give the rooms at this hotel 5 stars, but the staff 2 stars. The front desk staff are not very friendly. The first night, I asked a front desk person to call a local tourist attraction phone number to get information about a Great Wall tour (I would have called, but I don't speak Chinese), but the staff person at first refused to call the number. I asked again, and he reluctantly agreed to call the number for me. It only took about a minute of his time; I'm not sure what his problem was.The next night, I needed some currency exchanged, but they stop exchanging currency in the hotel at 10:30 PM. I went to the front desk at about 10:40 PM unaware of the currency exchange closing time, but they refused to exchange any currency for me until the next morning. I know it was 10 minutes after closing, but their guest guidebook says to contact the front desk for currency exchange after-hours. Apparently they won't exchange any currency at all after-hours. You would think they would try to accommodate their guests' needs.The WORST though was the business center. If you want to use the Internet, prepare to get GOUGED badly. They charge 2 yuan per minute for Internet use, or roughly $18 USD an hour to use the Internet, which is a blatant ripoff. They also charge $1.50 USD per page for printing, another ripoff. The most I was charged for Internet in all the other Chinese hotels I stayed at was about $5 USD an hour. Also, the lady in charge of the business center lied about how much time I had spent at the computer. I noted the time I sat down at the computer and started using the Internet, but she said I had started 10 minutes earlier, happily charging me 20 yuan more than I should have been charged. I told her that was not correct, but she argued with me.The bellboys were good though, helping us with luggage and getting taxis for us. The front desk staff speaks pretty good English, so at least you can look forward to that.The hotel restaurant we ate at (the cafe on the first floor that serves breakfast), is overpriced, but that's the case at most hotel restaurants. A Coke costs about $3 USD, while it's about 40 cents from a local Beijing restaurant or shop. Avoid hotel restaurants if possible, because you generally get gouged.The hotel is within 10-15 minutes walking distance of Wangfujing Street, 10 minutes walking distance of the metro station, and about 15-20 minutes walking distance from Tiananmen Square/Forbidden City.Overall, I recommend this hotel for the great rooms and reasonable room rates, but don't expect friendly or even professional service from the staff. This hotel would have gotten 5 stars if not for the staff.

<Content>Capital Hotel was great We stayed at the Capital Hotel in late April with a SmarTours package. The hotel was great and the location was very close to the Forbidden City. Hotel was very clean and the staff was very friendly. Sure the beds were hard, but it really was not much of an issue. I would stay here again. Taxis are very inexpensive and make getting around the city very easy. They always have taxis right up front at the hotel. We did book a car for two days because we wanted to head out of town and go to the great wall and didn't want to relay on taxis to try to get back. We looked on Trip Advisor and found lots of driver recommendations for John. We e-mailed him before we went and booked his services for two days. The night before we were scheduled to go to the great wall John called our hotel and advised us we might be better to switch days so we will have nicer weather for the great wall. He was right, it rained the morning we were scheduled to go and was a beautiful day when we ended up going. John's English isgreat and he was full of information regarding Beijing. We really enjoyed our two days with him and would highly recommend his services. We e-mailed him at [--] and he has a website at www.beijing-driver.com. All in all, it was a great trip at a very reasonable price thanks to SmarTours. It was our first time using SmarTours and were very pleased with the service and hotels they provided.

<Content>a perfect stay This hotel is perfectly located. You can easily walk to the Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, a subway station or the famous Wangfujin Street with all its shops. It is really convenient in such a city locked by endless traffic jams.I stayed in the new tower where rooms are very comfortable and perfectly clean. The breakfast buffet was delightful, served in a quiet garden-type restaurant. I also went to the Italian restaurant on the top of the main bulding: beautiful sight over Beijing and a good quality restaurant.This hotel is definitely a must in Beijing at a very reasonnable price. Do not hesitate to book there.

<Content>WOW!! what a bargain We booked Capital Hotel through a group package for really cheap. I was very nervous because it was so inexpensive, but boy was I wrong. I felt like I was in some big, international hotel in a multicultural city like Toronto.It was a very large and lovely hotel that is an excellent value for the money. Every morning included an american style buffet breakfast where you could load up on carbs to get you through the day. The beds were like rocks but the room was clean and nice. free internet too was a huge bonus!Dont hesitate to stay here.

<Content>great hotel We just traveled to Bejing with our teenage daughter and stayed at the Capital Hotel. Great location with that little market across the street and so close to everything. Our room was just like a really nice American hotel and those hard beds were so comfortable even though at first we were not so sure as they have no springs! We ate a lovely included breakfast every day at the nicer hotel restaurant...delicious American style eggs and toast and everything Asian if that is what you want. The hotel feels a little like Las Vegas as all the big hotels in Beijing these days, but enjoyed drinks in the lobby bar and found the prices very reasonable. You can even order pasta, etc. at the coffee shop type restaurant if you need a change from all that Chinese food. We would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Stay We stayed 3 nights at the Capital Hotel in Beijing and we were impressed with the accommodations. Yes, the beds are rock hard, but where in China are they not! The room was spotlessly clean. We loved the robes, slippers, and super soft towels. Having a safe to secure valuables meant that we didn't have to worry about carrying all our important papers. The hotel is an easy walk to Tian'anmen Square and the Forbidden City. The breakfast that was included with our stay was quite good. Our room was on one of the non-smoking floors and did not have a cigarette aroma as we've found in other non-smoking rooms in other hotels.Although not located in the hotel, but almost in the hotel's parking lot, we found a wonderful little noodle shop. Go out of the hotel and turn right and turn right again. We liked it so much we stopped there twice during our stay. We ate very well for less than $4 a person.

<Content>Perfect location with great breakfasts This hotel is perfect for those who want to explore Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City and some of the really great shopping in the Wang Fu Jing Shopping Area. The shopping district is three blocks north of the hotel on foot, and you can catch the subway (Red Line #1) from there to the SIlk Street mall, which is amazing. Many of the hotel clerks do not speak English fluently, so allow time for checkin and checkout. Our room was on the 9th floor of the B Tower. The room was large and had a gigantic window. It was cold, however, and we never managed to decipher the cryptic thermostat. The beds are very, very hard- just about like sleeping on the floor. We asked for two additional quilts, and once you fold the quilt under you, it is bearable but we went home very stiff. Our bath had a gigantic soaking tub and a decent shower: both very nice with plenty of hot water. The daily breakfast buffet was great: toast, pastries, eggs (scrambled or omelets made fresh), sausages and bacon, potato cakes, porridge, cereals, fresh fruit and juices. Try the marinated egg which is a hot hard-boiled egg in a mildly vinegar sauce. The breakfast dining room is large and comfortable and the staff is attentive. We loved the breakfasts since they opened at 6:30 am and we walked off a lot of calories every day. Be aware that the money exchange desk can only convert dollars to yuan, not vice-versa, so dont change too much money the last day of your stay or you will have to wait in the lines at the airport to convert back to dollars. Also, the ATM in the lobby charged us a 7% service charge (this will vary by bank, of course)

<Content>Walking Distance to Forbidden City! There were 6 of us in our group, including two teen-agers. We had three rooms booked as part of a Pacific Delights tour. We choose this hotel for its' proximity to Tianamen square, the Forbidden City and other places such as the Pearl Market and Silk Market.Our rooms were clean and always kept clean. Sheets were changed daily and the bathrooms were very nice. Yes the beds were firm (actually hard) but we all slept well and were comfortable. The public areas were also very nice. The teens like the bowling alley in the lower lever and spent one night bowling.We only encourtered a few problems. The rooms were very hot. Luckily the windows opened and we did take advantage and kept the open the entire week. Also one night we were very tired and decided to eat in the downstairs coffee bar were we had breakfast every morning. That was a disaster. Not only was the food inedible, but everyones order was incorrect and took an hour to get straigtened out. We had to go get a hotel manager as the wait staff did not speak enough English to understand us.I also found that the staff at the front desk were not friendly at all. They never smiled or initiated any conversation even a hello or Good Morning When approached they would just stare at you until you spoke. But the porter in the hallways as well as the chambermaids would greet us whenever we passed them.I would stay at this hotel again. It was clean and a very short distance to many places I wanted to be close to.

<Content>Better The Some We arrived late in the evening but check-in went very smooth and without problems. We stayed in the new Tower B and the rooms were just fine. House keeping did a fabulous job. It seemed that she heard us leave in the mornings for breakfast and the room was done almost everytime when we returned, a very pleasant surprise. Our room was inclusive of breakfast which was great. There were plenty of choices to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. We looked in on the pool and excersize room, which looked very nice but we were too busy site seeing to utilize them. The hotel has a money exchange which is very conveniet also. The location of the hotel is great to, cabs are available at the front door, buses right out front on the main street and the subway is only three blocks away and nothing is cheaper for getting around the city then their subway system. If there is anything negative to say about the hotel it's that their bed mattresses are very, very firm and will take a few nights, if ever, to get use to them. House keeping was nice enough to bring me a few blankets to help pad the bed which helped but did not cure the problem. Would I stay there again, absolutely, the location makes it worth while..

<Content>Great hotel We stayed at this hotel as part of the Smartours package. I thought it was great. Rooms were sparkling clean. HBO, CNN and a few other english stations on the TV. Very close to Tianamen square and other tourist spots. Internet was available for a price in the room (didn't get the exact price) but I used the computers in the business center instead (about .25 cents a minute). Great toiletries in room (razor, q-tip etc) that was replenished each day. You also get free tea and coffee with a kettle, as well as 2 free bottles of water a day. Yes, beds were harder than in the US, but I actually found them to be really comfortable. Bathroom was very clean as well, and had huge soaking tub. My husband took regular baths (as the hotel provides bubbles in addition to shampoo and conditioner).Breakfast had a nice spread. Made to order omlettes and eggs, dumplings, fried noodles, congee, along with sausages, fruits, cereals, french toast etc. Really enjoyed out stay at the hotel!

<Content>It works Stayed here twice in January - when we first arrived hotel was arranged as part of tour, and then when we returned independently at end of trip, we elected to stay again. Location is marvelous - walking distance to so many things. Hotel is quite nice. Tower A is suites, and Tower B is large regular roms with 2 double beds. Yes, all the beds are quite hard. You will be so tired that you will sleep anyhow. Yes, they may have plumbing challenges - first room toilet required plunging, and second room (Tower A) had both a stand up shower and also a tub with a flexible shower holder. Stand up shower - water never turned on, and flexible shower holder worked only weakly ( not enough to take a shower). The suite in Tower A was gorgeous, and we were only there 2 nights, so I took a bath. The breakfasts are buffet style with lots of things that you are not sure what they are, and enough things that you can recognize so you will be able to eat. I suggest taking a few snacks from buffet for during the day since it is generally hard to figure out the food in China. The biggest problem with this hotel is that there are not alot of ppl who speak English, and the few that do seem not to understand that you may need some help, even if you keep trying very hard to get some information. The most help you can count on, ( and you can count on it) is that the bellhop will write in chinese for you where you want to go, and you can show this to the cab driver. ( Tip -Get him to write the whole day itinerary down for you) This works sometimes, but sometimes cab drivers won't stop for foreigners, and sometimes the driver can not ( ? will not? ) read the writing. So you get back out of the cab. Overall the hotel rooms are well located, and very nice, the breakfast is edible, but you will have your work cut out for you getting around. This is true throughout China.

<Content>All glitz and no substance This is an attractive hotel, but that is as far as it goes. The shower drain in our room was blocked and flooded the bathroom while taking a shower on our 1st night. The tub drain wasn't much better. Upon our return from a day's outing for our 2nd night, the drains were still blocked. Nothing had been done to fix them. They offered us another room, but with a 4:00 AM departure the next morning we made do with the tub shower by standing on our knees; using it standing up was next to impossible as there was no holder at head level. The tub was not clean enough to sit in. The room's rug was filthy.

<Content>Great value for money I just returned from a short vacation in Beijing where I stayed one night in Traders hotel and 5 nights in Capital hotel. The Capital hotel is located in a walking distance from the Forbiden city, Tiananmen and Wangfujing - the shopping street. I paid 70 USD per night at the Capital hotel, which was about 100 USD less than the Traders wanted for the same nights. I was surprised to see that the Capital is in fact a better hotel. The rooms were newer and cleaner, the service level was similar and the location of the Capital is way better if you are in Beijing for site seeing. The only disadvantage of the Capital hotel was the bed in my room. It had the hardest mattress I ever slept on, but with an extra blanket this was easily solved. I joined a couple of organized tours available from the front desk of the Capital hotel, since the groups in both cases were very small (6 people in the first day and 3 on the second day) and since only hotel guests joined the tours, I assume that the hotel owns the guided tours company. However, the first tour wasn't that good as the guide wasn't too much into guiding and just let the group wander in the different sites. The second day was the exact opposite! thanks to the guide (Laila) the tour was wonderful; she spend all day with us explaining, showing and sharing her skills. If you get to Beijing for a short vacation I definitely recommend the Capital hotel. If you join a guided tour offered by the front desk, ask to join Laila's group.

<Content>Skip this one, there are others better I must say our experience at the Captial Hotel started off bad and continued through the 5 day stay. It took 40 minutes to check in and the staff didn't tell us what the issues were. My wife described the hotel as a mile wide but only an inch deep. They have a very large labor force but when asked to do something about a problem, they have limited english and customer service skills to handle it. The location is great - walking distance to the major sites. The room was warm and when we called to ask for help, they said the heat was on because of the time of year and just open a window. We did so but the pollution and noise kept us up. The beds are VERY hard. We have been to other Chinese cities where the beds are firm, but these are the most severe. If you need some give to your mattress, don't stay here. I didn't sleep well the entire time. The restaurants are good but pricey for Beijing. Finally, my wife accidently left her diamond earrings on the table in the room since we left at an unGodly hour to catch a flight home to the USA. We alerted the night manager (from the airport - 1 hour later in the very early morning) and asked to be contacted since we were sure the earrings were there. We never heard back from them. We were able to contact them by email after a few days and all they said was they had checked with the housekeeping staff and that they were not there. Yeah, right. We never received word from the night manager or the hotel manager. All in all, we survived but we felt the experience could have been a lot better for the money. There are so many places to stay in this City that are better for the same price. Skip the Capital. But if you do stay, be sure and not leave anything behind...the staff will keep it...unlike many hotels in China.

<Content>Great Hotel!!!.... Just returned from a trip to Beijing and stayed at the Capital Hotel. GREAT HOTEL! The room was very clean - bed was hard but that is normal in China. Staff was pleasant and spoke well enough english for us to get by. Food was good, Spa was beautiful and bowling alley is just cool.I recommend this hotel to any traveler. It is in a good location - close enough to Tianemen Square and to the Walking Street area.

<Content>First room dirty, second one great. We arrived early morning, it was the first step on our visit to many parts of China and Hong Kong.When we first arrived we were greated with a smile and we were allocated a room in the B section of the hotel. This room was very scruffy with a pungent smell of tobacco and the clothes and laundry was not up standard for a 4 star hotel. We complained and was given a room in A section, it was definately an upgraded room and it looked 100% better than the one we had come from with a walk in shower and a bath.The staff at the hotel were very helpful and really friendly. The location of this hotel was excellent, it was a short walk from Tianamen square and the Forbidden City, and it was situated near shops where you could buy water and snacks. We found that the chinese people in the square would stop and talk to us, I was told later that they wanted to improve their English language skills. On times it did get a little annoying, but we were on holiday so what the heck.The hustlers were very persistant, but we found a sharp No, seemed to work really well.

<Content>Great location and the right price The Capital Hotel is a large full service hotel in a great location, a couple of blocks' walk from The Forbidden City and Wangfujing Ave (pedestrian shopping street). For other touring, we hired a driver (=$40 per day ) and while he spoke very little English, we had the front desk write down (in Chinese characters) our destinations for the day, and never had a problem. We typically take public transport when traveling but taxis and car hires are so darned cheap, and it's such a nice way to see the sights.Room was OK size for 3 adults/two oversized twin beds and a rollaway (extra charge for rollaway) took up the space in the room. Room was not fancy but was definitely 3* or maybe even 4*, nicely decorated, fabric bed headboards and nice paintings in room. Curtains blocked out all light, a nice touch.Room was clean and comfortable, and we had a street view (not noisy from our 8th floor room). Housekeeping service was iffy (beds not made one day but bathroom cleaned). Ask for more water anytime you need it and housekeeping will deliver. Water is not potable. Pool and dry sauna were nicely kept. Beware that the showers down at the pool do not offer soap or shampoo, so bring your own from your room. Breakfast was included in our rate of US$112 per night (a great rate based on my research and the hotel quality), a large buffet with a few Chinese choices (dumplings, noodles) and American (omelets) and European (cheese and salad) standards. There is a bowling alley (4 lanes) in the basement and 2 other restaurants in hotel, but don't spend your $ on hotel restaurants when you have Beijing at your doorstep. Across the street and a bit to the right of the hotel is a little grocery store with cheap/local prices and selections, so you can stock up on more water, snacks, beer etc. It's also a good cultural experience, to browse the shelves and see the standard food products that local citizens buy everyday. VERY interesting! Be forewarned : hotel staff does not speak a lot of English, so be patient in communicating your needs.

<Content>Great location This was a lovely modern hotel in a great location. The rooms were clean with large beds and a great walk in shower as well as a bath.The buffet breakfast was good with plenty of choice.There was a small supermarket over the road for buying bottled water. There were no bars nearby but the hotel bar was ok and drinks were not too expensive.Turn left out of the hotel and in a short walk you reach Tianemen Square and the Forbidden City. We did a guided tour on one day and then went back on our own for a further afternoon as there was so much to see. We were photographed as much as the buildings as we seemed to be the only westerners there that afternoon but it was all friendly.There were some beggars and street sellers but as long as you didn't look at them there were no problems.

<Content>Worst hotel experience in 40 years of travelling My wife and I spent two weeks in China in May 2007. We arrived in Shanghai, spent 3 days there then travelled to Hang Zhou, Changsha and finally to Beijing for a day before flying back to Rome. Our travel agent booked us into the Capital Hotel in Beijing and gave us a choice of a deluxe or a superior room. The deluxe room cost 799 RMB (without breakfast) and was 100 RMB more than the cost of a superior room. We selected a deluxe room and was given room 1101 on our arrival.I have spent the last 40 years of my life travelling around the world and I know what to expect from a 3 stars rated hotel as opposed to a 5 stars hotel. My evaluation is based on the value we received for our stay. In other words value for money. We did not expect a 5 stars experience.Anyway, to cut a long story short, the room was not what we expected from a deluxe room. The carpet was old and tatty, the airconditioner did not work (it was unpleasantly hot that day), the shower door could not close, and the taps dripped all night. We mentioned these to the reception, asking them if we could change our room, but were told that the hotel was full and there was no other deluxe rooms available.We thought to ourselves if this was a deluxe room, we would hate to think what a superior rooom looked like, let alone a standard room. We went over to the other tower which had superior rooms and saw that the rooms were much better than ours. It looked like our room was earmarked for refurbishing and we were unfortunate enough to get the room before it was refurbished. We went to the front desk and told them that we did not mind getting a superior room seeing that they were much better than our deluxe room, but told that it was not possible. The staff at the reception desk were also quite rude about it.I filled in the hotel questionnaire and left it sealed at the front desk before leaving the hotel the next day, but I have not heard from the hotel management. I gave my full contact details in the questionnaire because from my past experience, I have always been contacted by management of hotels, particularly the good ones, whether my reviews were good or not so good.

<Content>Enjoyable Stay Found the hotel a very pleasant place to stay, in an excellent location. Rooms very spacious, comfortable,  clean, with all the usual amenities. Stayed here for 2 weeks, and found the staff all very friendly and helpful, from the doormen, reception staff, and especially the very funny bell hop!. Ate at most of the restaurants, and while more expensive than those independently run, the food was very good, and value for money. There is also a very handy mini supermarket directly across the road, ideal for getting drinks, snacks, toiletries etc. Would definately recommend.

<Content>Expensive hotel! The rooms are clean and spacious. The mattress is Chinese-style. i.e. it'll feel very hard if you came from a Western nation. The restaurants in the hotel are average and expensive. There are better ones in Beijing. My friend got hit by a US$40 bill for printing 10 pages in the business center. And to rent a projector for use in the conference room is US$200 per day. Are we in China?The Chong Wen Men subway station is less than 1 KM to the East of the hotel. The Qian Men station is less than 1 KM to the West. But I prefer the Chong Wen Men station because it is less messy over there. The location is good and central. It's walking distance (West then North) to Tian An Men and Gu Gong.

<Content>Very Pleasant Experience Just got back from 11 days in 4 cities, First stop was the Capital in Beijing and we were pleasantly surprised. Excellent central location, very attentive staff and we didn't see any trace of the under construction problems described elsewhere. The breakfast buffet (included) was quite good, even if not entirely Western in composition. Complimentary Internet access on the hotel's computers was the best we saw anywhere and the location was exceptional - eat breakfast looking out over the Forbidden City, with White Pagoda at Beihai Park in the background. Only negatives: carpet in the room could use to have been replaced a couple of years ago and it took forever for the water to get hot in the shower. We'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>Loved the Capital Hotel We stayed here for 4 nights with Smartours travel group. The hotel is modern and has tons of great amenities (pool, sauna, gym, great buffet breakfast). The location is also great, a 5 minute walk from Tianenman Sq and the Forbidden city. The only drawback is that the beds are hard as rocks! But I think this is normal for Asia. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Capital location We stayed at the Capital in February 2007 for 12 days. The refurbishment referred to in previous comments has now been completed. We had a standard room (with extra bed) which was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was pristine! Staff were friendly and helpful and arrrangng trips was done without hassle. Food was good with European/American options. The hotel is in a great location- within walking distance of the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square. Don't miss the Temple of Heaven, a rickshaw ride around the Hutons and The Peking Opera! Taxis are the best way of getting around the city and cost around 70pence (GBP) within the central area. Get a 'taxi card' from reception which has the Hotel address in Chinese and you'll never get lost! We found Beijing to be safe and friendly.

<Content>hmm...Not expecting this. Stay Away!!! This hotel is under renovation. Allot of things weren't available, and or not working. Look for other options. The pool, is not the same as the one shown on websites. Much smaller. Although the Lobby is very nice but...The Problems: Our room walking in, seemed nice, until we sat in it for a few minutes, the temp was 90 degrees, and the thermostat wouldn't work, the hotel staff provided us with the option of opening up our window after confirming that the heater wouldn't shut off (If you've been to Beijing, I believe you'd like to not breath too much of the air outside due to the smog). Anyways, after much deliberation with the front desk, they moved us to another room (same problem with heat). Finally after, again speaking to management again (and them confiming the same problem being reported with heat issues elsewhere in the hotel), they upgraded us to better room. Another problem, When entering the bathroom, there was a horrible smell coming from the drains, almost like NYC street Sewer drain. We accepted defeat and covered all the drains in the bathroom with towels to diffuse the smell. Lucky us...There were more problems: The lobby smelled like strong nail polish remover the entire stay while we were there, the prices were very expensive for drinks (across the street is a mini market buy drinks there) the sauna was broke, the pool's heater wasn't working properly (so it was cold), the buffet wasn't that great (food was luke-warm/cold, and re-cooking some of the empty better dishes apparently was a chore along with taking up allot of time, you'd expect better because of the price you pay), another restaurant was closed on the 20th floor because of renovation, there is no disco/KTV because it hasn't been built yet. Their Internet service is expensive (side note: we found a international hostel across from the railway station for really cheap Internet; use it there (6RMB for an hour) Also upon entering the hotel from the street its all being torn up with construction; it very unappealing (we've should have put two and two together!). Plus upon asking the front desk on how much for making an international phone call they told us the wrong price instead of 10RMB a minute, they told us 1RMB per minute (I even twice asked them if they were sure about the price), so getting a massive phone bill and further aggravation of dealing with management, just put the finishing touches on a very bad hotel stay....perhaps in a year this place will be better.Until then Stay away!!!

<Content>Excellent Breakfast Buffet Capital Hotel Beijing China Date: March 2006Reviewer: A TripAdvisor Member from New JerseyThe breakfast buffet at this hotel was fabulous. They had every food imaginable to eat. My room was huge and comfortable. The hotel lobby is very spacious with some shops on the second floor. The hotel staff spoke english very well and they were very helpful.The hotel is in a good location. If you don't mind walking you can walk almost anywhere from the hotel. If you need bottles of water you can buy them across the street in a little grocery store for very little money. You can also get a good massage (blind massage) across the street too, and it won't cost much either.

<Content>Faded excellance As our first stop on a trip to China this was not a great introduction. The hotel foyer resembles a cross between a shopping mall and an office block reception area. The staff are amenable but not overly friendly. Allow plenty of time for changing currency, out of all the hotels we stayed at in China we had more forms and took longest doing it here. The rooms are clean, spacious and have good facilities but they have seen better days and the whole place is screaming out for an overhaul.Unexpected high point is the basement bowling alley which was a fun way to pass a few hours. Location is good as you are only 15 minutes leisurely stroll from Tiananmen Square.Breakfast is good with an interesting selection of western and chinese foods on offer.

<Content>Stayed 1998 not 2002; lovely hotel Stayed August 1998 (no choice of 1998 in drop down) when hotel was probably very new. It was huge and impersonal but staff were helpful and efficient and our large room was impeccable: Huge bath, separate huge shower, huge superking bed, lots of supplies. If still as good, would recommend unreservedly.

<Content>Great location/room! This hotel is in a great location for tourists. The staff speak English very well and the lobby has city maps to help you navigate around. The subway is nearby and for two or three yuan, you can take the train right to T. Square or to the shopping district. There's a bank and 711 nearby as well. I used the ATMs which had the plus logo and found it quite easy to use. Oh, and beware of the exorbitant internet charges in the business centre. You'd be better off finding an internet cafe.

<Content>Great position! This hotel is centrally located, safe and within walking distance to Tiananmen Square, Wangfujing Street and Forbidden City. It was quite cold when we were there and in 1 out of the 3 rooms we had, the heating was turned up too high and they suggested we open the window to adjust it. Curious comment as was -12 outside! The rooms were spacious, the beds really hard and we were on the 11th floor with a view across the city to the mountains (when you could see through the haze). The toilet in our room was interesting to say the least. It talked to us at night! Don't ask! But still o.k. and showers/bath were hot and clean.Breakfast was not quite European. Dinners when eaten there were basic,although the beer was cold. Didn't use the indoor pool which looked clean but smelt of high chlorine levels. Lobby was fine, staff friendly but most had little English language. Using the business centre for emails etc. was a difficult task but got there in the end and was not a cheap option.Enjoyed our stay and this hotel is good value for money if playing tourist.
