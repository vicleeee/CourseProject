<Content>Gret Hotel In Florence I have just returned from 2 nights at the Montebello Splendid in Florence. Overall the hotel is excellent and a great base for exploring Tuscany. We stayed in the Family Duplex Room as there were 3 adults. The room was very spacious, well appointed and the beds are very comfortable. The bathroom is very good with an excellent shower over the bath. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. We asked for restaurant recommendations each night and both were excellent choices. We like to eat where the locals do and enjoyed fabulous food. The breakfast buffet was very good with both hold and cold choices. The champagne on offer was a nice touch. The hotel is situated about 15 minutes walk from the centre of Florence and it is a pleasant walk along the river. We all love Florence and have now found a perfect place to stay for future visits.

<Content>Great Charme The hotel has a lot of charme and is located in the perfect spot: very close to the main shopping area and the main monuments and at the same time is quiet and away from the tourist crowd. We had a deluxe room, very confortable and clean. They didn't have an ironing board. The staff has been helpful and friendly; they have organised impeccable trips to Siena and San Giminiano and the outlet outside Florence (my wife was happy...). We were recommende two great restaurants: la Giostra and Buca Mario. The restaurant in the hotel is a nice alternative if you are lloking for a quiet alternative: excellent quality and price. The breakfast was abundant and FREE!!!A great charming hotel if you decide to spend a romantic w-end in Florence.

<Content>Is it worth 5 etiles....!? The front is luxury and the staffs are good.But the guestroom is not very luxury.I stayed a classic double room,there was no bathtub in the bathroom.And, it has no ventilation fan in the toilet!! Some guests drunk and made marry at the hotel's bar,it is in front of the hotel's courtyard, till 2:00 AM.It was so noisy to sleep,but any hotel staff did not aim to stop it.The breakfast is good.The location is not very convenient for sightseeing.(a little far from the center of the city)

<Content>Excellent in every way!! This hotel is quite simply fantastic! It is located close to the centre of Florence yet tucked away enough to be quiet. The staff were magnificent and helpful in every instance. The hotel is comfy and the food great. I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone.

<Content>Fabulous The hotel is excelent, the attendants very helpfull and fast.The room is very nice, especially the bed, the bath tub and the balcony.The breakfast is good too.The distance from the city center is not that far, it麓s ok during all day, during the night if you麓re not used to walk, you may take a cab, but it麓s ok by feet, I did not get a cab in the three days I麓ve stayed in hotel.For the price I麓ve payed, was a great choice.

<Content>good stay at the Montebello Splendid Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Montebello Splendid and have to say i thought the hotel was very good.The location is a 15 minute walk along the river or through the narrow via's to get to the main tourist area. To us this was an advantage because the area is quiet and the local restaurants do not have the extremely silly prices evident in the tourist area.The front desk was always helpful and our room was pleasant and comfortable.I would reccomend the hotel to anyone visiting Florence.

<Content>Loved the hotel My wife and I just returned from a fabulous trip to Florence, Italy. We went there as a side detour of a business trip that I had to Germany. We called it our early 30th anniversary celebration vacation. We stayed at the Montebello Splendid hotel and we loved it. The hotel is fairly new, circa 2004, but it was built and decorated in traditional Italian style with antiques, hardwood floors, marble bathrooms, plus jacuzzi, LCD TV, and fully automated room controls. The room was plenty big enough for all our gear and included 2 nice arm chairs and a table which are in addition to the TV/computer desk, unlike many rooms in Europe which tend to be tiny. We had booked a standard double but the hotel upgraded us to a deluxe double including a balconcy with table and chairs for free of charge. The staff was very helpful and friendly and always available. They even pre-arranged reserved tickets for us to a couple of the museums in Florence. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a wide variety. The hotel and the rooms were 1st class and we look forward to staying there again if we ever get to go back.

<Content>Beautiful spot My husband  I stayed at the Montebello Splendid in late October and found it to be one of the nicest of our entire trip to Italy. We loved the small courtyard with fountain, the lovely reception rooms and the luxurious rooms. The beds were extremely comfortable, the furnishings very high end (e.g., silk tapestry walls, silk draperies, glassed jet shower, fresh flowers in the common rooms). The small bar was a little quiet but if you wanted more of a crowd the Westin Excelsior was just down the street. The place was spotlessly clean and very quiet at night so you could really get a good night's sleep. Highly recommended!

<Content>Don't waste the money! My wife and I just returned from a trip to the Tuscany area that included 4 nights at the Monebello Splendid. Just to give you a reference, we try to stay at 4 star hotels such as the Ritz Carlton whenever possible. We are not afraid of the rates if the service is great.This hotel's service was way below what it should be. The accomodations are very nice. Great beds and bedding. Great bathroom and tub/shower. We stayed in a junior suite.Service is their problem. Their attitude was also very unfriendly. Upon our arri val, we found that one of the two TVs did not work properly. We called the front desk to let them know and they said they would send someone to check it out. They never did.We then stopped by the front desk and asked again. They said they would send someone up but they never did.Prior to departure, we requested a wake-up call for the early the next morning. They never called! Fortunately we had set both of our cell phones for an alarm otherwise we may have missed out flight home.Don't spend the money for this hotel. There are plenty of other fine hotels that are closer in to the main tourist area of Florence.

<Content>Lavish luxury Five star luxury - had a great room - comfy big bed plus jacuzzi bath and luxury toiletries Hotel has fantastic reception rooms for eating or relaxing in as well as a really peaceful courtyard garden - great for sitting and reading and having afternoon tea (or drinks) a real haven of peace - away from the busy centre Breakfast on the first day was a bit chaotic but improved after that - loads to choose from and all freshly prepared We went for a real pamper experience and were not disappointed It is a bit of a walk into the centre so make sure you take good walking shoes - its between 20-30 minutes walk depending on how fast you are or how much shopping you are bringing back

<Content>Montebello Very Splendid Indeed!! We recently enjoyed a 3 night stay at the Montebello Splendid to celebrate our 30th Wedding Anniversay. The Management very kindly gave us a free room upgrade to a large room with a nice balcony, also included a beautiful fruit platter.The staff were charming and most helpful throughout our stay, we would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to our friends.Nearby restaurant Il Profeta is also to be recommended.James  Pat MorganYorkshire, UK

<Content>Totally Disappointing We stayed at the hotel in August 2008. In all honesty, we were disappointed on multiple fronts. Here are a few to note:1. The carpeted corridors before the elevators were extremely smelly.2. The room was no where near what was depicted at the web-site and they were smelly.3. The rooms need to be renovated as all furnishings were old or poorly maintained.4. The staff were not motivated and had an overall negative/careless approach.5. The hotel rating in my opinion should be 3 star and not 5 given the standard we say.We checked out earlier predominantly for the above reasons.

My husband has back problems, and this was the only hotel we stayed at in Italy where he slept the entire night. The beds alone are worth the price! They are VERY comfy and clean, which we rate very highly. I think they have a special type of mattress which did the trick. Very luxurious rooms, with relaxation in mind and believe me that is definitely needed after long days walking on tours. I really cannot reiterate enough how great the bedding was in this hotel, because its so important to get a good night's sleep while travelling. Breakfast was great, full buffet. We ate at the restaraunt one evening, and the food was spectacular. The staff was helpful. I would stay there again.

<Content>Hard to Find Hard hotel to find, but when you do it is delightful. Parking is tough, but such a nice job of rennovation. Breakfast staff not the friendliest, but everything else was very good.

<Content>Not worth it The rooms were small, but clean. The hotel itself was very quite and unique. If it was not for the company at breakfast, we felt as though we were the only people in the hotel. The staff rarely smiled and I always had to search for someone to help me. I had to call the front desk at least twice before anyone picked up, and it was not because they were busy. I felt that everytime we were out of the room and had to run back for something, there was someone in my room doing something, cleaning something. It was slightly alarming. The hotel was set out of the way from most of the attractions, so we had to take a cab to dinner or walk 20 minutes. If I was to stay in the neighborhood again, I'd stay around the corner at the Grand Hotel, otherwise, for a more lively neighborhood, stay closer to Ponte Vecchio. Overall I do not think the hotel was worth the money, there are much nicer hotels in the area.

<Content>Luxurious room with excellent breakfast My husband and I stayed at Montebello Splendid for two nights during our honeymoon in July. We booked a standard room and were upgraded to a beautiful junior suite. The room has a spacious bedroom with a queen bed, a small living area, and a bathroom with shower (no bath tub though). The AC keeps the room comfortably cool when it's steaming hot outside. The buffet breakfast is excellent with a wide selection of egg, bacon, sausage, cold meat, pastry, cereal, yogurt, fruits, and cheese. The sun-lit breakfast room, friendly server, and free copy of USA Today (newspaper) set a relaxed atmosphere to start a day.The fee for a cab ride to the Florence Airport as well as the train station is quite reasonable ( 20 Euro). The only minus is the location - the hotel is about 15 minutes walk to major sights. However it's not a problem for us as we love strolling along the Arno River. The room has no river view. (In comparison, Grand Hotel and Westin Excelsior are located by the Arno River. I considered those two hotels when booking but preferred the more modern Montebello Splendid.) The reception staff is friendly, but not overly enthusiastic in recommending tourist spots. Overall, a pleasant stay in a romantic hotel for a good price. We wish we could stay there longer! Pros: Luxurious suite, excellent breakfast, good value Cons: No view, slightly far away from major sights

<Content>Great deal at fabulous hotel! I made the reservation through hotel website and I got a special deal with discount on 3 nights stay. I booked a standard room, but upon check-in the guy at front desk informed me that we were upgraded to deluxe room. During the whole stay, I probably experinced the best customer service in my life. The whole staff at front desk asissted me in any kind of information, reservation and reccomendation. Very professional and extremely friendly!Spotless accommodation with full marble bathroom and jacuzzi tab. The only negative point is lack of coffee and tea maker.Within a couple of block you can reach the river, some casual but yummy restaurants and a small market for any occourrency.Comparing to the other five stars experiences in Italy, this hotel is probably the best in value for money. Would stay here again.

<Content>Poor service, not 5 star I had one night stay in classic standard room, the enviornment and facilities (exempting internet) are good enough, but the service of staffs was terrible. I faced the problem to use the hotel broadband service in the room, the room interactive system didn't work at all, also my laptop couldn't find out the wireless login page that the hotel should offer. So I asked the front office to help me, but even 2 staffs coming to my room respectively, they were totally not familiar with the system so couldn't fix the problem. I asked them to change to another room, but the staff said it's fully booked, even I think it's a lie obviously. They also promised to send a technical support guy in the morning to fix, but there was nothing happen, no staff coming even not call for excuse.Anyway I gave up about the internet for that night, but surprisingly when I checking out, the hotel tried to charge the fee of the internet!! Of course I rejected it.And finally when I finished the check-out to head to the taxi which parked in the outside, there was no any staff to help me to carry the bag! Do you think that is the service quality of 5 star?That was my worst experience in staying in a 5 star hotel, I won't go there anymore!

<Content>Beautiful hotel I paid over $350 a night to stay in a single room. The hotel was not bustling at all. I was disappointed that I couldn't be upgraded to a double room given the fact the hotel was far from busy. The hotel lobby, bar and rooms are impressive. The service is just okay. I wouldn't say I felt welcomed each time I came back to the hotel, nor was there that personal attention for someone such as myself travelling on my own. You can definitely come and go in this hotel and not talk to anyone. The breakfast was very good but I was disappointed with their bread selection (after all, this is Florence!) but the selection was more than adequate. The room when I arrived still had hairs in the shower and the sink, all the more reason to be annoyed with the hotel as I had specifically treated myself to a 5 star hotel at the end of my 2 week, 4 city, vacation and this room was the least clean of all my hotels. The bathroom was very small. My room was on the ground floor and pretty noisy. And, out of all my other hotels who offered free wireless, this one had to charge 14 euros each day for internet access. The hotel only had one restaurant really close by, as in around the corner, and overpriced. There were no gelato shops or shopping right outside the door. The closest attraction was the bus terminal and the duomo about a 10- 15 minute walk. I would suggest staying closer to the city center. The staff really wasn't that helpful or courteous but they weren't rude by any means either. I felt since I was staying in a single room, they didn't feel the need to provide the level of service I am often used to when travelling for work and pleasure.

<Content>Exceeded our expectations The Montebello Splendid is the perfect hotel for a short break in Florence. It is expensive, but worth every penny (cent). The service and attention to detail was excellent. We booked a deluxe room which was beautiful, with double doors to a large balcony overlooking the lovely courtyard. Breakfast was great - catering for all tastes. Can't wait to go back.

<Content>Boys Weekend I've been to Florence a few times in the last years and have always stayed in the centre. Montebello was by far the best I've been in so far. Rooms are small, but very nice with great layout and amenities. Service is outstanding. From breakfast, through to the small hours of the morning drinking martinis on the terrace, the staff are attentive, pleasant and exceeding all expectations. And then when you consider the price! The value is outstanding.

<Content>Splendid at the Montebello We just returned from a four night stay in this lovely hotel. We stayed in the family room with loft with our two teenage children. It was spacious, comfortable, and lovely. The breakfast was wonderful and had such a variety. We eagerly looked forward to it each day. We especially liked the small touches in the service at this hotel such as the turn down and chocolate at night, the luxurious linens on the beds, and the towel warmer. The location was execellent as it was about a 15 minute stroll down the Arno to the Pontevecchio and the Piazza Della Signoria. We loved it!

<Content>Amazing hotel  Beautiful, luxurious hotel, superb service and breakfast. Very good and nice to have the welcome meal, available in the restaurant on the first night of your stay. Some cool gadgetry, including automatic shutters on the windows, and a lovely shower and jacuzzi bath. Pretty good location and fairly quiet, however if you want to be more central, may not be the best location. No kettle in room, and no iron, and none available. However, you can order and pay for laundry service. Amazing city. La Rotunda is a real find, just 3 minutes walk from the hotel, great restaurant and live music bar.

<Content>Very pleasing We spent five nights at the Montebello Splendid and were very satisfied with our visit.Room 206 is a junior suite with a small sitting area with two chairs and a large desk with 20 inch tv. The bedroom was comfortable with nice mattresses and linens. The marble bathroom was tight, but functional. Fluffy towels warmed on the rack were welcome.The television was worthless as the computer controlling it was not functioning properly during the last two nights of our visit. As it was a weekend, they were unable to get it up and running. This was a minor inconveniene, but slightly annoying. This reinforces the many reviews complaining about the technology.Montebello Splendid is a great place to stay that is a short walk from the center. Compared to our hotel in Rome which was on Piazza Navona, I would have to say I really liked the quiet beyond the center offered by the Montebello Splendid.Would gladly stay here in the future.

<Content>5 above average nights at the Montebello We stayed 5 nights at this hotel and overall it was a good experience. The location is about a 20 min walk from the ponte vecchio a little of the beaten path, but this suited us well. Our first room was next to a family with a crying baby but the managment was accomidating and put us in another room. The breakfast was standard for a 3-4 star Florentine hotel. The decor was very nice and the staff helpful but not overly friendly. Our room was split level with the bed up in a loft. The bathroom was nice and spacious with good bath products. The internet access was spotty at best and expensive. Overall I would recommend this hotel and would consider staying here again.

<Content>A real beauty I felt as though we were staying in a Medici villa. This is a gorgeous hotel. No cost was spared in the decorum of this fine hotel. The staff makes you feel like you are someone special as soon as you check in. It is far enough from the bedlam of the center of Florence that you are not bothered by any noise plus its close enough to the center that you can walk there in no time. Ultra modern facilities in a beautiful setting. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Montebello Not so Splendid We were unfortunate enough to spend 5 nights here as part of a conference for my husband.Initial impression- the decor is dated and garish- has absolutely no charm- although there are some fake artifacts in the lobbyThe desk clerks reminded me of Fawlty Towers! Indeed the whole hotel reminded me of Fawlty Towers.Our room (suite) was done in a dark red wallpaper with gold lions on it! Our window - we only had one from the bath looked out at squallor in the surrounding streets and the locals washing!Our children had a sofa bed which had seen better days- so had the vinyl chairs around the glassed topped table. Oh and there was a significant flight of stairs from our front door to get up to our bedroom. Toiletries were very ordinary! The housekeepers were nice and tried hard though. It was not their fault they were working in this tastelss characterless supposed 5 star hotel as they call themselves.The gym is down in the basement and again there are no windows.The buffett brekfast is just like the hotel tasteless and lacks any authentic Italian charm- food is rehashed from the night before or breakfast the day before.Could stay in a 3 star Vegas italian theme hotel and feel more Italian charm than the Montebello Splendid- very disappointing

<Content>Wonderful Experience We just spent 10 days in Italy. This was our favorite hotel. The room is spacious for Italy and the bathroom is wonderful. There is a jacuzzi bathtub and shower and two sinks in the bathroom. The bedroom is located in a separate loft area upstairs. The room is quiet and stays very dark. The service is excellent and the hotel is very helpful in making reservations for you. There is internet access in the rooms. This is an amazing hotel - you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel First impressions on arriving at this hotel set the scale high, and fortunately the rest does not disappoint. The entrance from the road opens into the pretty garden terrace with fountain at its centre, past which are the steps to the hotel lobby.We stayed in a junior suite, with the lounge area perfectly sized to allow comfortable breakfasting and / or relaxing. The bed was incredibly comfortable - so much so that it was a bit of an effort to get out of it each morning!Many reviews of this hotel centre on one complaint - its location. It is an easy and pleasant 15 minute walk along the Arno to the centre (and could be done in half this time if you are a fast walker). Frankly, if this is likely to be too far to walk, I would question the wisdom of staying in Florence at all, as you will undoubtedly cover far more ground than this simply walking between museums, cathedrals and gelateria! I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to couples and business travellers.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel Florence is a beautiful city and this is a great hotel. Nice quite neighborhood. Within walking distance to most interesting areas and close to good food. The breakfast was very wonderful. The staff was helpful friendly. Our only complaint was that the third bed in our room was not much more than a camping cot. Not comfortable for teenage children. The best food we had in Florence was close by at Armandos. The staff can give you directions.

<Content>Fantastic hotel The Montebello is a fantastic luxury hotel which I highly recommend. Stayed recently in a deluxe double room which was ideal for our family (four of us). Our stay was for seven days.Being a double room with a bed downstairs and upstairs there was plenty of room and the room itself was immaculate. Despite what some have written we found the staff to be extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel has everything you want plus more. The only thing wish it did have was a pool (it was 40 degrees everyday of our stay) but it is almost impossuble to find a hotel in Florence with a pool. The buffet breakfeast is excellent and not to be missed.The location we found to be ideal. It is really no more that a very leisurly 10 minute walk to the heart of Florence and is surrounded by many local restaurants which are much cheaper than those in the heart of Florence.All in all I recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a luxury experience

<Content>Sea of Calm in a Bustling City Me and my husband stayed for a week at the Montebello and had a wonderful stay. The staff was very nice and accomodating and although not in the middle of the tourist attractions (about a 15 minute walk will get you into the thick of it) it was very near several good restaurants and shopping areas. The internet conection ability was not the greatest due to the keyboard provided however the staff was very accomodating and provided a separate mouse which greatly increased the ease of use. Rooms are smaller than in the US, but was fenomenal compared to European standards and the jacuzzi shower was amazing after a long day of sight seeing. I highly recommend the morning breakfast buffet to start off your day, it has everything you could ever look for and in included in the rooms fares. Very romantic and very attentive, I would definetly go back.

<Content>Fantastic stay We haven't a single quibble with the Hotel Montebello Splendid. The hotel and its courtyard were a serene and welcome respite from Florence's chaotic Vespa cluttered streets. Our room, a multi-level suite, was terrific. The bathroom was generously proportioned and spotlessly clean. Slippers and towels were provided. The room included a TV/computer ($12 a day for internet, the interface was a bit clunky). The service was excellent. We especially appreciate the efforts of the barman (wish I could remember his name), a gracious gentleman that took very good care of us. Other staff arrived at our door as quickly as their feet could take them. We enjoyed breakfast and evening drinks outside each day. The breakfast included a nice selection of meats, cheeses, yogurts, pastries, cereals, and juices. The coffee was top notch. Being in Florence and wanting to see as much as possible, we never tried the restaurant for dinner. The hotel is a small hike into the middle of the city, but not bad at all (especially the hike down the Via Porta Rosa or along the Arno). And as a tourist in Florence, you're going to be doing quite a lot of walking anyway. It is relatively close to the Santa Maria train station. All of this comes at a price, the hotel is not cheap by any means. Perhaps we do have one quibble.

<Content>Professionalism zero The hotel is really not professional. Be sure when you book a room on the online sites because they don't know how to update their availabilities with extraordinary overbookings. Not a 5 star service at all !!!! We found a new location because their will to find a solution was 0 !!!!

<Content>Adequate, but not recommended Our junior suite was small, but adequate. The bathroom was the smallest we have experienced in a long time. Service was responsive, but not friendly, and we were given incorrect information several times. I would stay elsewhere next time

<Content>Better than expected Our visit to this hotel was with a degree of trepidation given some of the adverse comments on Trip Adviser. What we found was a high quality hotel in a quiet area of the City.A nice touch was, on arrival we were given a pack which included a very good travel guide for Florence and the invite to book a welcome dinner that evening. We took advantage of the dinner offer and found the food to be of a good standard and the waiters very accommodating,which added to our perception of value for money. All other extras in the Hotel are quite expensive, but then so is most of Florence.We opted for a deluxe room which was of ample proprtions and very comfortable. The quality of decoration and furnishings throughout the hotel is of the highest standard.The Hotel only has about 60 rooms and during our stay was a tranquil oasis after the hustle and bustle of the City centre. Under local ordinance smoking was also prohibited in all the inside public areas,a feature we found particularly attractive. However the Hotel did have the benefit of a very attractive outside courtyard area where such restrictions did not apply. The breakfast buffet will satisfy most guests, but if your expectation is for hot foods you will be disappointed. Rubbery scrambled egg, fatty strips of bacon and sausages better not described are the only offer here. Much comment has been made about staff attitudes and perhaps it has been the odd experience which has given rise to these very negative views. We did, on one morning, encounter at breakfast, a head waitress who spoke to us like errant school children when we were having difficulty with the orange machine. But that incident apart we found the staff to be reserved, efficient and always polite and friendly.As for location, we found it perfect. Only 5 minutes by taxi from the main train station and an easy 10 minute walk into the City centre. Indeed the stroll along the river was very pleasant and certainly not arduous. Florence is a City full of of superlatives and there can be few better Hotels than this, to use as your base, for exploring all that it has to offer.

<Content>1st Class Hotel Probably the most technologically advanced hotel room I've ever stayed in. Everything was automated. Luxurious hotel all around. Best included breakfast I have had in Europe. About a 10 min walk to the center of town.Highly recommended.

<Content>Beautiful hotel albeit a little way from Firenze's main attractions We enjoyed our stay at the Montebello so much. Bedroom and bathroom + balcony (some rooms have them - try for room 114) were superb. Comfortable king beds, jacuzzi bath fantastic.Breakfasts were excellent and most of the staff could not have been more helpful. Hotel is relatively small and discreet but not stuffy. All nationalities were there including discerning Italians.Wonderful trattoria opposite which we discovered on the last night of our stay but the hotel restaurant is excellent and reasonably priced by Florence standards. Room service was good and speedy. We have to agree with a previous reviewer that the internet connection was troublesome and was not resolved during the course of our stay.It was a little bit out of the way for major attractions but we appreciated the peace and quiet.Would definitely recommend to anyone who appreciates quality.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel - Indifferent staff We just returned from a great vacation at Florence. We stayed 2 nights at Montebello Splendid. We chose this hotel from the recommendations of other trip advisors. It was certainly a beautiful hotel that was immaculately maintained - we especially liked the courtyard. The rooms were very well appointed and the variety at the complementary breakfast was terrific. It was disappointing, however, that the attitude of the staff - from the front desk and concierge to the restaurant - was more one of indifference - they were unfriendly and just didn't seem very happy being there. This was certainly not a 5 star experience.

<Content>A nice property with poor Internet connection The rooms and public areas in this hotel were very elegant and well maintained, and the location, 10-15 minutes by foot from the main attractions in Florence was reasonable. What was not reasonable was the dysfunctional Internet service, which marred our stay. Given that we paid top dollar and that Internet service was advertised as available, we were very shortchanged. The regular Internet service (through a very confusing arrangement combined with the TV) was impossible to master. The wireless connection to a laptop was often unavailable and, when available, was asking for username and password six times an hour. The front desk staff was sympathetic but unhelpful. I consider a reliable Internet service a necessity in my travels and hence I will not go back to this hotel.

<Content>hotel experience We just returned from Italy and we stayed at multiple hotels. One hotel that I have the urge to comment about is this one. The overall staff was overly unfriendly. For example, one thing that bothered me the most was when we were having our complimentary breakfast, our server dropped a silverware on the floor and she simply placed back where it could be used again. In addition, when my wife used the toaster, the toaster didn't work properly. And when we told the server, they gave us a look as though we broke the machine. However, the hotel room was great, but I would think twice before I book this hotel again.

<Content>Wonderful hotel - Highly recommended. Wonderful hotel - highly recommended.As we came for our honeymoon to Florence we spent a long time looking for the right accomodation. Contrary to what many people write, the hotel really is not very far from the center (perhaps 10 minutes by foot, walking at a leisurely pace). Once we saw the hectic center of Florence we realised how much nicer it was to be staying in the area the Montebello is located in (including some wonderful restaurants nearby).The whole hotel is impeccabbly furnished and kept. I could not find a detail that was neglected. Everything was in perfect condition, including the rooms, which are beautifully appointed with lot's of high-tech extras. Excellent beds and great sound-proofing as well (i.e. you will not hear the other guests).The staff was friendly and upgraded us twice (once upon arrival and the second time 2 days into our stay).The interior garden is a haven of tranquility after a long day of touring and shopping. The only downside was the restaurant which we do not recommend for the dinner service.Don't hesitate to stay there, you will not regret it !!

<Content>Comfortable Stay We stayed in November and it wasn't full so they were upgrading everyone to the better rooms. Two blocks to the Arno river so no view from the large balcony were we drank wine and looked at the clotheslines across the way. Still this is a first class place where because of the location you save a lot of money. Big beautiful rooms, nice hotel, how can you not like the breakfast which is included, fabulous. We walked to town and enjoyed crossing the river at the first bridge you come to and walking down the other side of the river. Seemed much faster this way and I actually liked some of the restaurants on the other side of the Arno river. When we left we were telling them how much we enjoyed the stay and when our cab arrived to go to the train station (8 euro ride) our cab got a radio message they forgot to give us our passports back. Went back and when we got to the hotel someone left with our passport to the train station. Waited but was afraid we would miss the train so they told us to just go to the Cinque Terra and they would messenger our passports to the hotel where we were staying. My wife was nervous but we did it and they sent us our passports the next day,seems the post office has a cheap fed ex type delivery system. Our plan was to walk everywhere and take a cab back but mostly walked both ways. I liked this place, luxury at a savings, but again it is not in the center of town.

<Content>Fantastic We were going to Florence for a few days and wanted to spoil ourselves with a luxury hotel. And luxury we got!We walked into a beautiful lobby and were welcomed by really friendly staff. They were really helpful and gave us a welcome pack which included a guide book of sight to see in Florence (this was better than the one I bought from the UK!). We were then escorted to our room and made to feel very much at home.The room itself was well equipped, with very modern equipment (which provided my partner with much entertainment!).The bathroom was well laid out with ample toiletries, dressing gowns and lots of towels. The 'massage' function in the shower was lovely!The bar and restaurant teams were great, it was much quieter during the week which meant you got lots of attention. They were a little more stretched over the weekend but still were very hospitable.I would definately go back!!

<Content>Loved this hotel! I loved this hotel!! I really felt like home. The hotel is pretty small but very charming. The courtyard is so beautiful in particular at night! The front desk staff was so helpful and patient with my husband鈥檚 silly questions. They gave us great recommendations for restaurants and sights. During the 5 nights we spent in Florence we had 2 dinner at hotel restaurant (which I recommend), 1 at Latini (very crowded), 1 at La Giostra (Fabulous) and 1 at Trattoria Armando (recommended). Breakfast was also great with fresh fruits salads and pastries. The only minus point about this hotel is the light control: it鈥檚 very hard at night to press the right light command! Overall a great experience considering the good rate they offered us!

<Content>Great Choice as long as you are able to overlook the arrogant staff at the front We found the hotel exactly as expected - great room, comfortable bedbedding, complete room amenities,excellent ,quiet location. Wonderful breakfast buffet.Yes, a 10-12min walk to the center of the town but hey, get a bus tour or taxi if you can't handle this easy walk. Staying in the center could be a bit on the noisy side we thought. They have a somewhat unusual way of booking in that you must do so by fax confirmation or e-mail confirm instead of just taking the credit card over the phone. Tried to book 2 additional nites (after our initial stay) from the countryside but ended up at another hotel because of the minor inconvenience this creates. Yes, we would stay again, but certainly would hope they have an attitude adjustment up front. For comparative purposes we generally travel Westin or similar level. This was excellent value.Vancouver, Canada

<Content>Fantastic Stay We had a fantastic stay at this small but gorgeous hotel. The whole staff was very friendly. The concierge staff assisted us booking museums and some nice restaurant nearby the hotel (Trattoria Armando was excellent!!). Nice room with immaculate and comfortable bed. The location is not so central but is very quite and safe. I would probably stay again at this hotel during my next visit to Florence.

<Author>Sleepless_Travelers
<Content>So So We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights last week. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:- Away from the tourist hustle, bustle and madness- Very serene entrance (small fountain, yard, etc.)- Nice hotel lobby- Knowledgeable staff- Very good buffet bfast for European standardsCons:- Biggest one: LOCATION. While it's in a quiet/non-tourist area - it's at least a 20 minute walk to most points of interest. So pick what you prefer. If you like coming back for a few minutes to the hotel to take a breather every now and then --- this is not the ideal place.- Rooms need serious updating. Have overwhelming wall paper and colors. Carpet was old.I would not return to this hotel if I was to return to Florence based on location itself.

<Content>Wonderful I loved this hotel. The service was impeccable and the room was very comfortable with lots of details that made the experience special (e.g. bed-side controls to open and close the window shutters and turn on a do-not-disturb light on the room's door). The hotel is not as close to the center of town as some may want, but the neighborhood is a quiet retreat from the congestion just a few blocks away.

<Content>Not so Splendid! Just returned from Florence and my stay at the Montebello. There were good and bad things about the hotel but it's definitely not splendid; more like so-so! The rooms are not very large but satisfactory. They are tastefully decorated and the bathroom is a good size. The 'hydro shower was a plus. The breakfast was not great. Not a good selection and not the good quality food you would expect from a luxury hotel. The hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk into teh heart of Florence, but manangeable if you don't mind walking. The main problem with this hotel is the staff. They are indifferent and some don't even try to hide the fact that they detest tourists or Americans or both. I asked one particular gentleman at the front desk to just confirm arrangements that another staff member has made for me. He became annoyed and argumentative with me. I have stayed at many fine hotels and have never been treated this way. You would expect the staff to be polite and try to accomodate you. SO if you are lloking for a mediocre overrated hotel, far from the heart of Florence with apathetic rude staff, then this is the place for you!

<Content>Loved it! This place was terrific, great rooms and amenities. And...it was quiet. Other reviewers commented on the long walk to the central area, but it didn't strike me that way. 2 blocks to the Arno and a lovely walk into the central area. A nice way to counterbalance some of the terrific food we ate whilst in Italy. Only negative - the concierge sent us to a restaurant that was a hard core tourist trap - view was stellar but the food was only OK -- and we paid dearly for it.

<Content>Sometimes Splendid Put on your walking shoes if you stay here. It's a 15 minute walk to the shopping and museum areas of Florence. However, it is located close to the train station. The hotel or staff was not very efficient. The day we arrived, we learned that one of the two rooms we had booked was not available (we booked directly with the hotel). They did arrange for a room at a hotel down the street at a lower rate and comp'd us dinner for two. Hotel and restaurant staff was minimal and sometimes required us to go looking for a waiter. The breakfast did not measure up to the price charged for the room. The bathroom was small and the shower did not drain well. The hotel is located in a residential neighborhood and was quiet at night. There is a grocery store and laundromat within a 5 minute walk. The highlight of the trip was dinner at Il Profeta, just a short walk toward the center of Florence. Ask the owner, Claudio, for John Travolta's favorite pasta. We ate there twice and had fabulous meals both times. For the high price of the room in comparison to other rooms we stayed at duriring our visit, we would have expected more.

<Content>Almost splendid My husband and I stayed at the Montebello for 3 nights the week of July 10. The hotel is a short 10 minute walk from the train station and about 15 minutes from the major attractions (Uffizi, Accademia, etc.). This normally would not present a problem but proved challenging during record setting temperatures (high 90s,) and a taxi strike. The hotel was a welcome oasis. We experienced none of the problems with the air conditioning, internet, or flooding mentioned by previous reviews. The staff was wonderful. They reserved the Uffizi and Accademia for us so we did not have to wait in line. The concierge recommended a great restaurant a block or two away, Il Profeta. They serve a GREAT tiramisu! They also pointed us in the direction of a self-serve laundry that was right around the corner. Breakfast was included; however, it was awful! Mostly hard, dry pastries, cereals, one chafing dish with runny eggs and limp bacon. Although a short hike to the city center and shopping, the Montebello is very close to many restaurants and dining options. Take advantage of them. Other nice finds in the vicinity: an internet cafe, small grocery store/market, a newsstand with english language newspapers. The primary reason I rated this 4 instead of 5 is the room. Beware the rooms in the basement. They are EXTREMELY tiny. Barely large enough for the the two twin beds that were pushed together. The flat screen tv was also very small. The size of a screen on your average laptop. The bathroom, tiny and poorly designed. I'm 5'9, medium build. When sitting on the toilet, my knees were almost touching the facing wall and I had to reach about 3 feet for the toilet tissue. The shower is open i.e. no door; and because it was under the stairs, the ceiling sloped and narrowed. My husband is 6'1 and could barely stand upright in the shower. Also, because the shower head is facing the outer room, you could not turn on the water without it spraying all over the bathroom. After realizing this we took baths for the remainder of our stay. I would stay here again; however, I would request another room.

For us (couple on a shopping holiday) this was perfect - nice and quite location but within walking distance of the main shopping areas and sights. Walking back along the Arno in the evenings after dinner was also pleasant. Room was two story, perfectly clean and maintained and very quiet despite fronting the road. Never really figured out the aircon controls but that is probably my incomptence - likely weather was in the 90s the whole time so having the aircon on full was not a problem. Breakfast was excellent and service good. Ease of parking was a real bonus this close to the centre of town.Highly recommended - I can't imagine why anyone would want to stay right in the centre of town with all the noise (and dirtiness).

<Content>Very close to perfection鈥?#x201d; I have read the previous reviews sighting issues with air conditioning, the television remote, the Internet connection, its 5-star rating鈥?and I must say we had none of those concerns and that our stay was all but perfect. We had a large room with a balcony (#116) overlooking the hotel courtyard, which my wife and I both found it very comfortable. Florence was in the high 80鈥檚 during our stay and unfortunately a bit too hot to sit outside but it was cool in our room. The public spaces are well decorated and pleasant, clearly patterned after the Four Seasons model. We found that the staff was always pleasant and helpful. Our car was immediately attended to and our luggage unloaded upon arrival and loaded on our departure before we even could ask. We arrived hot and tired after a long drive from the Dolomites late in the afternoon, unfortunately just after the kitchen had closed. The bartender took pity and was kind enough to put an Insalata Caprese together for us. My only issue that makes me hesitate to say this is a perfect Florence hotel is its location. It is in a fine area but it is a good fifteen-minute walk to the center of the tourist action. This is a true mixed blessing when you compare it to other similar hotels such as the Savoy or any of the Lungarno Hotels. Yes, they are more in the heart of it all, but that is also their downfall. Its hard if not impossible to get your car to and the noise and the hubbub of the Piazza della Republica or the Lungarno Corsini aren鈥檛 ideal in my opinion to spend your down time in Florence. If you chose to stay here just be aware that it will require a stroll along the Arno or a cab ride to get to the heart of Florence. Overall it was a good experience and we would consider staying at the Montebello Splendid on our next visit.

<Content>Gorgeous hotel but.... We came to Florence on my birthday and spent 2 nights in this charming hotel. I have booked also a Welcome Dinner for this occasion but haven'd heard even 'Happy Bithday'....but still we had a nice time there. Our room was rather spacious (though I booked just a standart room , I guess we got DeLuxe), perfectly decorated. The bathroom was great with a Jacuzzi bath combined with shower and we have a separate dressingroom. The only complaint is poor air-cond. - it was too hot when it was off, and too noisy when it was on. And besides I found all those electronic control panel and remote internet from the flat screen rather useless - mail functions didn't work properly.The staff was rather friendly and helpful. The restaurant is excellent both during breakfast and dinner. The main advantage from my point of view - 1-location - quiet, safe and peaceful, 2- gorgeous interiors and very comfortable beds.I would definetely stay there again...but not in hot weather

<Content>Fantastic We visited 23rd-26th June 2006. It was a treat for my mother for her 60th birthday. The staff were very helpful and friendly and took the time to listen and chat. The food on the first night was a treat and despite arriving an hour after reservation (airport's fault) they were happy to wait until we had freshed up and settled in. Breakfast catered for all wishes and allowed us to have different choices each morning. The maid service was excellent and attention to detail could not be faulted. The flowers which they organised for the room were just as I had e-mailed and made it extra special for my mother. The room was above average in presentaion and space meant we had room to sit rather than be confined to the bed area. The bathroom was a big hit. The hotel whilst not in the middle of Florence, was close enough to walk and enjoy a stroll along the Arno each night and the area felt safe even late at night. The staff help with travel arrangements and luggage storage after we had checked out allowing us to enjoy extra time in Florence before setting off home. The exceptional standard of this hotel added to the whole experience of Florence which neither of us will forget.

<Content>Adequate Beware - do not choose the standard room if there are two of you. The room is tiny as is bathroom. If one person is using the desk, the other cannot pass by. Use the toilet and your knees need to almost fit under your chin. Layout of the room totally impractical with closet and bathroom up a flight of stairs within the room.In addition, room above ours had obviosuly had a major leak and our bathroom ceiling was mildewed and paint peeling in shower.Internet service did not work (froze) and although I was assured that it had been taken care of, froze when trying for 2nd and 3rd time.Tried to change rooms for all of the above reasons but particularly because of conditions in bathroom but apparently hotel was full (although hardly saw anyone around). Staff on the whole not particularly concerned. However, in their defence, and at my insistence, they changed our room on the 2nd day to the next grade of room which was very nice but for the flood on the floor when showeringNoted the next day, overheard a guest with similiar complaint (flooding bathroom) and again, the excuse was that the hotel was full and not much they could do about it.When checking out, had been billed for two days of internet (had only tried on first day), mini bar which we did not use. Got these credited without any protest and extracted a 20% discount for the first room night.

<Content>Excellent all round I stayed in early June for four nights. I found the location great, just far enough away from the hectic centre of Florence. To enjoy a quiet drink in the grounds was the perfect way to relax after the heat and noise of the city centre. The hotel is well appointed in every aspect, spotless throughout, the staff were responsive. No complaints wouldn't hesitate to book again.

<Content>This is NOT a five star hotel My wife and I have recently returned from out honeymoon staying in  5 star hotels in five differant cities in Italy. I reference this simply to establish a reference point for recognition of a true five star. The Montebello Splendid is a three star hotel at a five star price. Do not select this hotel if you care about having an air-conditioned room. The guest is not able to control temperature other than to vary the centrally controlled temperature by 2-3 degrees for maximum of 15 minutes. My wife woke one morning with a heat rash because of the unbearable heat. We complained throughout our stay to lower the temperature. This hotel's effort at energy conservation and increase to it's bottom line came at the expense of what could have been a pleasent three days. If you pick this one and you are the least bit heat sensitive remember you were warned! We prepaid on Expedia so efforts at refunds would be futile. Learn from our unpleasant experience.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in late May 2006 and loved it! The room was spacious and the bed was actually comfortable. We didn't eat at the hotel but was referred to a lovely restaurant within walking distance called Il Profeta that makes a wonderful tiramisu. Would definitely recommend to others and stay at in the future.

<Content>Cosmopolitan Luxury in the heart of Florence Staying at the Montebello Splendid is like being a guest at your rich aunt's in-the-city estate. The layout, with the courtyard and fountain, indoor/outdoor dining room, high quality stone construction, reinforce this home vs. hotel appeal. Indoors, the rooms and common areas are all richly appointed with marble, elegant furniture, art works, etc. Breakfast consisted of the standard Eurpoean items, but quality was a step above other hotels. Staff was helpful ... but I would not say more so than at the other decent hotels that we stayed at in Italy. The top attractions are within walking distance (Duomo, Ufizzi, Ponte Vechio), as is the main train station. But understand that by walking I mean 20 - 30 minute strolls, along the scenic river, or on pleasant neighborhood streets. That may sound like a long walk, but when included in the hours and hours of walking and standing that you will do at the musems, churches, shopping areas, etc, its just part of the vacation experience. The rooms in the Montebello have super comfortable beds, with nice linens. Lots of high tech electronics .. remote light switches  shutter controls, flat panel tv, high speed internet, etc. Bathroom overall was very nice, but the shower has a design defect, that causes the floor near it to get wet every time the shower is used. Just accept it ... what's a little wet marble anyway. Overall it was just the extra treat we wanted to have during the Florence leg of our multi-city vacation.

<Content>Don't miss the Montebello Splendid We were here May 19/06 for three nights. The May 25 review is spot on. The hotel is an oasis of calm and beauty. Staff is extremely helpful. Rooms are lovely, with fabulous beds, bedding and beautiful marble bathrooms. We met our three sons in Florence, but their baggage was lost somewhere in Munich. The front desk staff made call after call on our behalf. My husband had a toothache when we arrived. They referred him to a most charming dentist, who saw him immediately. We lost our tickets to the Uffizzi. The staff made sure we got in at our appointed time. I had read a review of the hotel restaurant that was not totally flattering. Don't believe it. The most elegant, relaxing and delicious meal we had in Florence was on the gracious outdoor courtyard of the Montebello. Make sure you accept their offer of the first night welcome meal, and go for all four courses. Their breakfast is also first class. A must-miss is Il Latini restaurant, unless you love to go to overrated tourist joints. The Ponte Vecchio is about a 15 minute, very pleasant walk along the Arno River. Don't miss the Boboli Gardens. And if you want to treat yourself to ne plus ultra in a leather jacket, go to Il Fiorentino at 48 Corsini (I think that is the address - it is on the way to the Ponte Vecchio right along the river).

<Content>Loved it! Just spent two nights at the Montebello in Florence (12-14 May). Great hotel, very smart, clean and tidy. Restaurant is great value and excellent food and wine. Waiter was brilliant and very attentive but not intrusive. Location is quiet and a nice walk along the river from the centre. Only one small negative point was the slighty aloof attitude of one of the reception staff (male). but everyone else makes up for him. If you are walking into/out of town in the evening, make sure you look out for the Beavers in the River Arno!Would definitely recommend this hotel, and Florence, which is lovely and generally very friendly and safe.

<Content>Excellent hotel We just returned from a wonderful stay at the Montebello Splendid in Flornece. Main review points: 1) Immaculate cleanliness, 2) Excellent staff, 3) Great bed (firm) with blanket and headboard cover changed each day along with the sheets if you like 4) very quiet for sleeping.The rooms are not huge but we did not care because we did not intend on being there except for sleeping. It is about a 10 minute walk to the Ponte Vecchio, but this is along the Arno river and is beautiful. A taxi canreadily be called (the radio taxis take about 2 minutes to show up) and the drive to the center of town is actually only 2 to 3 minutes. You can find a more centrally located hotel, but it will not be as quiet at night because of all the tourists revelling about.

<Content>Splendid is Splendid This hotel lived up to its excellent reputation. The deluxe room was beautifully furnished, the bed very comfortable, the Jacuzzi bath and shower and the rest of the bathroom luxurious. The public areas were also a pleasure, with a lovely courtyard for afternoon cocktails and alfresco eating. The staff were polite and helpful. I would only offer some small words of caution. The first room we were offered was under the roof and had a sloping ceiling, and shower only; on the other hand, it had a lovely courtyard view. It was also a smoking room, when we had specifically requested non-smoking- and double-checked at check-in.The location was good- close to the station and the River Arno and near enough to walk to most attractions. We enjoyed some good meals and friendly service at Harry's Bar which was about a 10 minute walk away.

<Content>Wonderful Stay in Florence My wife and I traveled to Italy with our 2-yr old toddler, loads of bags, and a stroller. Wait, what was I thinking? Actually, it turned out great. We stayed at the Montebello for 4 nights in March, 2006. The hotel itself is very beautiful and the staff are friendly and helpful. They staff were very friendly to our son, when the maid asked how old he was he held up two fingers, for some odd reason, his first and fourth finger, and she laughed and said that was the sign for 'bull', which gave us all a good chuckle.  The room was good size for Europe, the bathroom was large with very updated and powerful Jacuzzi showerheads and Jacuzzi bath! We ate buffet breakfast at the hotel every morning, it was a good selection, average compared to other similar class hotels, but sufficient. The automated orange juice squeezer was pretty cool. One thing I wanted to mention about the the hotel is too out of the way comments is that we simply got a taxi if we had to go any distance for only around 5-10 euros. Also do you want to stay across the street from ringing church bells early in the morning? The hotel was tucked away enough that you do not hear them. Also if you are coming to and from the Pisa airport take the bus service that the front desk recommends, the train was very delayed on the way from Pisa to Florence. On the way back we took the bus which picks up at the SMN train station, and it was great.

<Content>short, sweet stay The biggest downside to this hotel, for some, may be its location. It is a good 15 or 20 minute stroll to the beginning of the attraction area. We did not mind so much except in the pouring rain while lugging a case of Amarone back to the hotel.That being said, expect a very clean, well appointed hotel with modern bathrooms, and extremely comfortable beds. The breakfast room is lovely and breakfast adequate. Also a great fitness room but beware of the room temp. as I almost had a heat stroke and crawled up the stairs to the first floor.Florence is wonderful and we thought 2 1/2 days was the perfect amount of time. Our hidden gem was a fabulous wine bar called Bevo Vino on San Niccolo. It is mostly locals with a fun, colorful staff. We must of gone there 6 times during our short stay and had a ball each time.

<Content>great montebello We just returned from our trip to Italy. We stayed four nights at the Montebello Splendid. This hotel lives up to it's name. beautiful setting. rooms were the best. we had two rooms the double was larger and the queen was a little smaller. Both were beautiful with large bathrooms, up to date electronics fabulous beds with great linens. Service was unobtrusive.(they monitor the rooms to know when you're out for maid service. service at dinner was ecellent but i did find the nouvell italien cuisine expensive as was the rest of italy. This hotel is slightly off the beaten path but very quiet and close to the train station. We booked on expedia and the rate were low.

<Content>Very nice hotel! The hotel is very nice and very well designed. Rooms are comfortable and very clean. Breakfast was included in our rate and was served in the veranda facing the garden. Staff was very polite and efficient. The area is very quite with several bars and resturant and the distance to pontevecchio is 10 minutes walking. This hotel is better than other italian 5 stars hotel I've stayed before!

<Content>Comprehensive Review Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Montebello Splendid Hotel. As a single traveler, I felt safe. I experienced the best sleep in a very comfortable bed. I received a great rate from the hotel, and the hotel honored a 10% discount after I found a lower published rate on the internet. The staff was very friendly and helpful in directing me through the city sites. Some things to consider are location. If you want to stay closer to the train station, this is an ideal location. It takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to the Uffizi Gallery. After a long day of walking, this hotel may seem a bit far on the return. If your preference is a generic hotel european breakfast, then Montebello meets that requirement, however, better advise is to stop into a nearby coffee shop where the locals are, have an Espresso and treat, and save your appetite for a better lunch in town. Room size for a single is okay, yet very comfortable and very, very clean. The shower pressure in my room was insufficient and that is my only major complaint. The bathroom has a towel heater, which was very nice, especially in winter.

<Content>Stylish hotel! The hotel is absolutely lovely! Style is amazing in every single details. The fountain at the entrance is something you will never forget. Our room was a classic and was very comfortable, even if not so large. Te quality of products for breakfast was very high, including an automatic machine for fresh orange squeeze. In the evening they serve small appetizer at the bar, like cheese, vegetables, chips and special sauces. The Rossini cocktail I had was so tasty. Don鈥檛 miss their promotion for dinner鈥t鈥檚 a great value for money! No bad about the staff: everybody was very courteous and friendly with my family. Good place to stay!

<Content>Romantic Hotel I had a superb weekend in Florence with my boyfriend at Montebello Splendid! I booked a romantic room from hotel website at great rate without any pre-payment! The hotel is beautiful in every single area, including the courtyard and lounge area. Our room was perfect and romantic indeed! Beds are extremely comfortable with a very clean duvet. My boyfriend enjoyed the TV with wireless keyboard; he got many information about Florence trough the internet connection. The guys at the reception helped us with Uffizi ticket and gave us a very good restaurant recommendation: la Giostra.We didn鈥檛 have enough time to make the chianti tour proposed by the concierge, but we had great time sightseeing the most popular spot of the city center, including the climb to the duomo! If you arrive by car as we did, you can park it in the hotel garage (30 euro) and you will never use it again unless you would like to go out of Florence. In Florence is quite impossible to park, that鈥檚 why we preferred walking all the time.I can recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to spend a special anniversary in a romantic hotel in one of the most romantic city of the world!

<Content>Fantastic! This is a wonderful hotel! Forget the others, stay here. Florence is wonderful, the hotel is wonderful. I travelled with my husband  2 friends, the trip was for my birthday. Both couples had deluxe rooms with a balcony - fantastic. The pillows are amazing. None of us could fault the hotel in any way. I have stayed in some lovely hotels  this is one of the top. It is about a 20 minute walk into the centre, but so interesting. I am not a big walker, but enjoyed every minute. There are some lovely restaurants on the way, so you can make your reservation on the way in to town. We had a look at some of the other hotels  this is way ahead. The staff were fantstic, so was breakfast. If you make this one your choice, you won't be dissapointed. Enjoy!

<Content>Never to return The first impression sometimes is the most accurate. Upon arriving on a snowy wind-swept day, a guest had to help us in the door to reception of this 5 star luxury hotel. The concierge acted as if it was an inconvenience that we arrived at all. He was without a doubt the rudest, most arrogant fellow that we encountered on our trip. We had planned to stay five nights before moving on. The desk staff was unhelpful in all ways ( where to eat, what Hotels to recommend in Rome and elsewhere), the room was windowless (unless you consider the view of a tiny air shaft) and small considering the exorbitant cost. The atmosphere pretended to be elite and haute culture, but just came across as snobbish and pretentious in its fraudulence. There is nothing charming or splendid here. Great hotels fall over themselves to please their guests. We couldn't wait to leave a day early. By the way, this hotel is not centrally located and the surrounding area lacks any Florentine beauty whatsoever. Learn from our mistake. Don't stay here!

<Content>Perfect! The Montebello Splendid was even more than we hoped it would be. The hotel is elegant, comfortable, and quiet. The location is excellent -- a little off the beaten path, in a nice neighborhood about 5-10 minutes' walk to Santa Maria Novello. The staff was especially gracious, knowledgeable, and attentive. Breakfast was great. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a special place to stay in Florence.

<Content>Not good enough Firstly, the location, the decor and the room (especially the shower) were all great. The breakfast however was one of the worst I've ever paid for. We spent six nights in the Montebello, and I can honestly say that the only good thing about any of the six breakfasts was the coffee. The buffet breakfast is apparently served until 11am, but if you want anything more than coffee, and possibly a hard bread roll, then you better get there before 10am, because nothing is replenished, including the water. Don't get me started on the incredible rudeness and inefficiency of the waiting staff. In fact, there had been so many complaints from other guests about the waiting staff we were asked to put our comments in writing.Another huge problem in the hotel is that it is not sound proofed, so don't expect a good night's sleep - though the bed was very comfortable.When you stay in a five star hotel, and pay five star prices, you should not have cause for complaints - unfortunately we did.

<Content>great hotel I stayed in this hotel back in Dec 2004 for few days on my hhoneymoon. it was one of 4 luxury hotel I stayed in within europe. it was great, the room was high tech, the service was nice, it wasn't busy at all but it was Dec anyway. the best thing was the nice buffet breakfast, if you go there don't miss. the down side was the location, it wasn't very near to the center and it will take about 30 min to walk to center, and the other thing the room was on the small side but because of the nice desk, flat screen, high speed internet and the control keys on the side of your bed, you won't notice it. the bathroom was nice as well. I highly recommend this hotel. try to book directly on the hotel website as you can get the best deals from them directly( at least in my case)

<Content>Lovely Boutique Hotel Very nice hotel, good location and distance from train station and places of interest. Our room was very nice and spacious with a balcony. The hotel staff was very courteous and really took care of us. For example, we arrived a little earlier than expected and were provided with complimentary refreshments. Within 10 minutes our room was ready. The room power and lighting is all controlled by a smart card which took some getting used to, but that was nothing. I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>My home away from home After staying at five stars in Rome, Siena, (de Russie, Hassler, and the Grand Continental) I have to say that Montebello holds its own for one third of the price. A wonderful half hour walk (remember you are on the vacation and need to burn the carbs you are ingesting), this hotel provided a sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Florence. The staff provided a warm and welcome reception although it appeared at first to the hotel seemed to have been deserted when I arrived. Despite first impressions, I simply adore the two Francos at the concierge desk who made all of my reservations at the Uffizi and for dinner. I felt like a royal princess here. Great bath and supplies; breakfast was excellent in comparison to other places where an American breakfast like this served went for 29 Euros. What made it taste better is that it was included in the price of the room. Luxury and comfort ( the most comfortable of all beds on my trip). My first room was a little strange in that it had a series of steep steps leading up to the bathroom (loft type arrangement) -- I nearly killed myself going to the bathroom in the middle of the night when I missed the last two stairs, but upon my return from Siena to come back to see a friend in town, I was given a wonderful luxurious upgrade for the same $149 a night with breakfast included and without the strange stairs. What was terrific about this place is that I called the morning of my unanticipated return and Franco recognized my voice-- when I asked him about availabilityand whether they would assure the same expedia rate, he said that they were so happy that I was returning that of course they would keep a room for me.. From here on out -- this is the place i will stay regardless of the fact it is not a room with a view . As far as the inference that things were stolen in another reviewers review (see below) my experience was that all my belongings were safe here--- I never used the safe, left clothing and nearly 10,000 dollars worth of jewelry and clothes thrown around my room, never closed my suitcases and never missed one thing. The people i met at this hotel were wonderful. This is my home away from home when I am in Florence.

<Content>Beautiful, but never AGAIN!!!! I was there on business, but so excited to visit based on the reviews here and the photos on Expedia. The hotel was beautiful, but had other MAJOR flaws. I asked for a wake-up call for my early train to Milan and subsequent flight from Milan to London, that never came. There are no alarm clocks in the room so you have to put your trust in the front desk staff if you don't travel with an alarm clock. I ended paying $200 to change my flight and ended up staying overnight in Paris to connect to London the next morning. The front desk was unapolegetic about the mishap and charged me for the coffee they gave me while I waited for the front desk to scramble to find a new flight (there was no manager on duty at 10am????). Additionally, I noticed in paris that my prescription pills were missing from my carry-on bag (and were there in florence). I've never in 10 years experience, and 3 months on the road a year, had this happen. I noticed when I went to my room after the mishap that the cleaning people had been in the room, but I never would've guessed they were there looting my belongings. So as much as I would love to stay at the hotel again, I would NEVER based on my experience.

<Content>Stay Here... For Business or Pleasure I would agree with all of the excellent comments and reviews of this hotel. We stayed in the hotel for three days of our one month Eurpean vacation. Everything about the hotel was absolutely fantastic.The rooms were charming, clean and spacious. The bed in the room that we had was very comfortable. The hotel provides high speed Internet access in the rooms (wireless and LAN connection) for a small fee. The hotel staff consistently went out of there way to accomodate our requests for tours and even managed the shipment of gifts and packages to our family in the United States. They provided us tips on some very good restaurants as well.The breakfast at this hotel was very good as well. They offered an American and local breakfast that we enjoyed each morning.

<Content>Montebello: Very Splendid Indeed The staff was efficient, courteous, and prompt. Check-in and check-out were over so quickly, you thought you missed something. The room was large, clean, comfortable, with beautiful hardwood floors. Modern amenities. Large marble bathroom, with great water jets in the bath tub. The room had a nice balcony. This place would score big in the states. And the rate was reasonable. All in all, a fine experience.

<Content>Almost Flawless!!! Just got back from a trip to Italy with my girlfriend, I have been twice before, but this was her first trip to Florence. I was VERY impressed with the hotel, not only was the room beautiful and spacious, but the staff of the hotel were without peer. They were extremely helpful in making restaurant reservations and when our luggage got delayed on the flight over they took over tracking it down for us and speedily resolved the matter. The breakfast is better than most in European hotels, the Montebello Spledid is really comparable to an American four-star, with excellent staff and large comfortable and modern rooms. It is also located very close to the Arno, and since Florence is such a small city you can be just about anywhere within a 15-25 minute walk. The only small issue that we had was that the air conditioning could have been a touch cooler, we kept it on full at all times and would have preferred it to be more powerful. However I acknowledge that I like to sleep in a room much cooler than most people, so this would most likely be a non-issue for most travelers. I have already recommended the Montebello Splendid to several people and will definitely be returning there on our next trip to Florence.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel, Nice Staff- no pool :( I stayed for 4 nights in this lovely hotel. I stayed for business, so I did not pay for it. If I did, I am sure I would have been more picky, as it is high priced. [well, it is 5-star] The restaurant is expensive. It has a breakfast buffet for $25 Euro every day. Delicious, but I ate all over the city and had better or equal for cheaper. The staff is very friendly, most speak at least some English, and the service is good. The area of the hotel is a few blocks from all the action, so you have some quiet, but you are within walking distance of all the things you want to see. [if you have good strong legs and comfy walking shoes!] I had a great time! But, like I said, it was free! If you can afford 5-star and don't mind that there is no swimming pool, then this is your place!

<Content>Lovely hotel if you like walking This was the first hotel in our 2 week stay in Italy. I had originally booked the Una Vittoria, but changed my booking to the Montebello a couple of weeks before, due to the poor reviews of that hotel.First impressions of the Montebello were very positive. The hotel is tucked away down a quiet back street close to the station and the overall appearance of the place is impressive - very attractive building and foyer. Our room was smaller than we had hoped for, but was definitely luxurious, with walls decorated with fabric, high ceilings, super comfortable bed, flat screen tv. The aircon was not very efficient, and looked quite old. The marble bathroom was very nice, but a bit small. Actually getting into and out of the shower without tripping over the bidet, proved to be a bit of an effort.Location wise, we did find it a bit of a walk to the centre of Florence. This was a drawback and a benefit. We found that it was just a bit too far to pop back to the hotel during the day if we needed to. It's only about 20 minutes, but after all the walking we had done on our sightseeing, it was a bit of a drag. That said, the pay off was a good, quiet nights sleep which I imagine could have been a problem if we had stayed in one of the central hotels.Concierge service was cordial, if not exactly friendly, but we got the information we needed.We chose not to eat in the hotel. 鈧?5 for breakfast was a bit steep if you're not a big breakfaster. Dinner looked very appealing, but with such a choice of restaurants in the centre of town, we chose not to restrict ourselves to the hotel.Overall, we found this place very luxurious but with a price to match. If you don't mind the extra walk, then I would highly recommend it.

<Content>Classy Hotel Very nice 5 star hotel...and priced accordingly. Outstanding rooms...well amenitized with flat screen comboTV/computer was a nice touch. A bit of a walk in a city where you're going to do a lot of walking anyway...be prepared for a few extra blocks, but nothing outrageous. Very nice restaurant and bar, but we didn't eat there because it was by far the most expensive and we had many other options. Staff was efficient, but not necessarily cordial/helpful. Good place if you want outside of the historical core with first class amenities, but we found the less expensive, better located hotel we stayed at in Florence a much more pleasurable experience.

<Content>wonderful hotel! A beautiful hotel with central a/c which is needed in the summer. The service, room, and breakfast were fantastic. The hotel is a bit of a walk away from the medieval core but it was actually nice to not be in the middle of where the rest of the American tourists were.

<Content>Very different experience than others I made my reservation based on the comments here and perhaps because I was a single woman travelling alone and the others were couples, I may have gotten the short end of the stick at this hotel. My room was literally not large enough for me to open the desk drawer and walk around...I had to crawl on the bed to get around the desk. My room was on the ground floor and so noisy...I don't understand the comments about this being a quiet location because I heard every conversation from the street. And, the air conditioning didn't work in my room and I couldn't open the window because of the noise. I've travelled a lot in Europe and this was one of the worse hotel experiences I've had. I had stayed earlier in the week with my co-workers at the Monna Lisa which I had recommended based on reviews here and that one exceeded my expectations, so perhaps my experience here was just an anomaly.

<Content>Excellent boutique hotel in quiet neighborhood My wife and I enjoyed our stay here in this newly designed boutiqueish hotel. This was an excellent value in comparison to the run of the high priced hotels in Florence. Our suite was equipped with 2 flat screen televisions/monitors with internet access, our bed was quite comfortable and the bedding was good.The furnishings were nice but not 5 star caliber. Our bathroom although compact for a suite was very well appointed with all the goodies and decorated in an italian mordernism styling. The staff was helpfull but not overly warm as in other areas we visited, not enough buon giorno's, ciao ciao's, warm smiles and remembering your name. The location of this hotel we felt was great , just off the beaten path in a quiet neighborhood all within easy striking distance to the city center. We really appreciated this after staying at The Astoria hotel that was in the center of things on our way back home. I don't think I got 2 hours rest the whole night it was so noisy! All in all this is a really good 4 star hotel thats trying to become a 5 star . We wouldn't hesitate to stay here next time we visit Florence. Also a thanks to Carlos for his help with us veiwing our digital pictures on the flat screen tv.

<Content>A five star hotel in every respect Stayed at this excellent hotel at the end of March 2005. I would recommend this establishment to anyone wishing first class accommodation. The staff were extremely helpful without being intrusive. In my opinion anyone staying at the hotel gets valuue for money. I will certainly stay at the Montebllo the next time I visiy Florence.

<Content>Nice 4 Star Hotel My wife and four children stayed three nights at the Montebello Splendid Hotel in Florence, April 19-21. The hotel is nice and is tucked away down a quiet street near the center of Florence. The rooms were clean and well appointed, though not as large as other four/five star hotels in which we've stayed in Italy. The service was impersonal, perhaps a bit stuffy. I'm friendly and love to chat with hotel staff. The staff was polite, but not very friendly. Our first night was quite noisy, our rooms were located right next to the elevator/lift. The next morning I requested one new room and was reluctantly given one, though it was not ready until 6:00 PM that night. Our other room's access was in an outside courtyard. Since it rained during our stay, the walkways were wet. I've never stayed at a four/five star hotel where some of the rooms are outside. But, they were still nice. Florence is a bit dirty and of course an old city. The Ponte Vecchio Bridge is an overpriced and overcrowded tourist trap. We quite enjoyed the Uffizi Gallery and seeing the David. A half-day trip to Pisa was fun with my children.

<Content>Good Job Guys!!! My experience at the Montebello was absolutly excellent! Me and my hausband stayed in Florence in March for 5 nights and we had a great time. The hotel is beautiful and located in a quite area away from the mess of the crowded city center. In 5 minutes walking we got everyware!!! Rooms are very nice, clean and comfortable; you can access the internet through the flat TV of your room and it isn't expesive at all. The buffet breakfast is extraordinary: fresh fruits, home made cakes and a very smiling staff.We also had a couple of dinner at the restaurant and we were very sactisfied about the food and the very attentive and friendly service that the waiter gave us. The other nights were spent tasting some of the most recomended restaurant of Florence taht the concierge suggested us; the hotel restaurant was cheaper than trattoria...uncredible!We had a very nice treatment during our stay, the staff was very kind and helpful with us. The atmosphere is very charming and informal...that's way we loved it and we would come back.

<Content>For those who wish to be far from the madding crowd My girlfriend and I just returned from a 3 night stay at this, in our opinion, superb and romantic Florence hotel.We enjoyed the fact that it is a 15 minute stroll from the very centre, just near to the US consulate. The crowds can be rather intense and it was a pleasure to walk along the river and leave them behind.All of the staff could not have been more friendly, helpful, welcoming and informative.Take your pick from the large breakfast buffet spread and eat it in the conservatory or patio.The hotel itself has been newly refurbished to a very high standard. We founnd the marble or mosaic floored public areas and terraces delightful with flowers, antiques and much more to delight the eye.We loved our spacious and luxuriously appointed room and bathroom. The bed was large and firm with luxury cotton sheets which were changed daily with a turndown service.The only frustration was that I could not get my laptop to work on the hotel's network or wireless lan, but this was a very minor one and I was happy to leave thoughts of work behind.WE would definitely return to this hotel and plan to recommend it to friends that are visiting Florence soon.This beautiful small hotel, greatly enhanced a most memorable stay.

<Content>Bigger than I expected Although I had paid for a room with a double bed, instead of twins, they had us in a room with twin beds. The woman at the desk did move us to a room with a double bed, but it seemed like an effort and it was in the basement. This room was pretty, but it never got warm (I think the heating system did not work correctly in it), it did not have robes, the TV system did not work, the noise from people walking above was terrible, and there was no turn down service. The same woman at the desk the next morning said she would try to move us, but I do not think she did. Later that afternoon, the man at the desk seemed to have no idea that we wanted to be moved, but he looked for a while and found a different room for us. He told us it was the only one they had available that night but we could have a bigger room the next night (we decided it was not worth the hastle of moving for the time we were there). The second room was like a completely different hotel. It was very nice, quiet, warm, the TV worked, and the shower was great! All five days we were there the men at the desk seemed more helpful and friendly than the woman. The walking distance was easy to everywhere we wanted to go and there was a grocery store next door and several bakeries on the way downtown to get breakfast. I would definitely stay here again, but not in the basement. The rooms seem to improve exponentially as you go up the floors.

<Content>Great New Small Hotel Selected this hotel based on reviews on this site. Could not have been happier with the choice. Third of the price of the top hotels with I think better staff. Be sure and spend a late evening having desert on the patio in the Summer or sit at the bar with the most delightful bartender in the Winter.

<Content>Great Hotel Stay Here!! We just returned from 3 nights at this recently renovated hotel -- our room was smallish but very clean and well appointed. By far the best place we stayed while in Europe for 3 weeks, sadly it was the first stop. This Hotel really goes the extra distance. The breakfast was also worht mentioning. The best we had for inclusive packages. Some other reviewers found the location ideal. We felt it was a bit out of the way from the center of things but not too far to walk as we did. But if you plan to go back an forth during the day then it may be a stretch. The staff was great and I'd echo the museum access. We had not been able to get into the one key museum in advance and they made it happen (for an expected premium). We had a great time in Italy and especially Florence -- This as a great stop on our trip!!!
