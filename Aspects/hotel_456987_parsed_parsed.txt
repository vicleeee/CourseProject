<Content>It's ok Well if you are looking for a hotel that is centrally located and cheap I reccoment it.But I have to make sure that you all know that the rooms are small. we had 2 luggages and we couldn't fit in .But still it was a very clean hotel, with friendly staff and of course helpful.

<Content>B is great for a small but chic place to stay Comfortable, great rooms, free internet, great service by the front desk. Only tough part is that you need two connections to get there from the airport by train. Otherwise, the area is great and breakfast is average, but better than nothing.

<Content>Brilliant place to stay We`ve just ended a 5 night stay at the B Roppongi and it was an excellent place to stay. The room was perfect, very clean and comfortable. The staff were realy helpful and all spoke some English so were able to help us plan any trips out. The location is brilliant - tons of bars and restaurants nearby for the evening so you don`t have to trek too far of a night if you don`t want to. Also right by the Ropongi subway station which gave you good access to most places. All in all a brilliant place we would definitely recommend it!

<Content>Nothing to write home about We stayed in this hotel for 1 night on our return to Tokyo, and it was pretty standard really. It was clean and comfortable, but the room was by far the smallest we experienced of the 6 places we stayed in Japan, and there was a general lack of the little touches that other hotels excelled in. Also the breakfast was utterly awful, little selection, and all of it had been sat out since who knows when - do not bother, go and find somewhere else to eat! It's not that there was anything really wrong with the hotel, it was a perfectly fine place to stay, and convenient for the shopping/nightlife area round about, but it did feel a bit expensive for what it delivered, and if you're looking for somewhere a bit special or original, this isn't it. If however you're not worried about that and just need somewhere quiet and clean to spend your sleeping hours then you'll be totally fine, and to be honest most visitors to Tokyo probably aren't spending much time lazing round in their hotels anyway!

<Content>Excellent location with comfortable rooms Stayed in the B Roppongi during a quick layover to visit Tokyo before heading back to the States. Since we only had 36 hours to experience Tokyo after accounting for airport travel time, we were looking for something convenient. It's location couldn't be better, literally less than a minute walk to the main Roppongi intersection and subway station. The staff was helpful, though their english was limited. A buffet breakfast was included in the rate and it was OK. Include an egg quiche, juices, pastries and some cold cuts. The rooms were comfortable and sufficient, though not overly large and luxurious. I was staying with my best friend with a ton of luggage (5 suitcases plus other small bags for the 2 of us) and it wasn't uncomfortable cramped for us, though we primarily used the room to sleep and bath before going out.If you are looking for a comfortable, convenient room for a great price, this is your place. If you are looking for luxurious amenties, you probably want to go somewhere else.

<Content>Comfortable rooms We stayed the first night of our trip here. Its close to the subway, in a neighborhood with lots of restaurants. The lobby is tiny but nice looking, reflecting the small size of the hotel. The staff spoke English, checked us in, and gave us bath salts to enjoy. Our room was one of their simpler rooms, with two single beds. The rooms were small, with very little decor. But the bathtub was deep, and they had the fancy toilet. The beds and pillows were the most comfortable we would have on our trip. We enjoyed the included breakfast the next morning-- its Japanese breakfast but well done when I considered all the free breakfasts I have had in the states (cereal boxes and bad muffins for instance). there was an egg casserole, miso soup, salad, and a couple other things. It was a great deal for 135 a night, and we would stay again. Its only drawback is that its on a single subway line, so going anywhere involves transfers.

<Content>Thumbs up to the B Roppongi! In short I loved my three nights in the B Roppongi. I had read that rooms in Tokyo were small so I expected the worst. However I was pleasantly surprised to find that the room was actually quite a decent size, even with a large double bed in it. And the staff were extremely helpful and polite, bowing at every opportunity which my girlfriend and I found culture-shocking but also very endearing.The location was fantastic, right in the middle of the bustling Roppongi. The hotel is easy to find as well. Take exit 5 from the Roppongi Station and it鈥檚 only a few metres away. One tip for staying in this hotel however, the hairdryer is actually kept in a box in the bathroom. Unfortunately we didn鈥檛 realise this until our last day.In all, I would recommend the great value B Roppongi hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel! My stay at the B Roppongi in Tokyo was just great. After backpacking in Japan it was great to arrive in such a nice hotel. The interior is modern/warm and the welcome by the staff is professional, warm and not too much. They upgraded me to a bigger room since i asked for a kingsize bed and the rooms was very nice. Good beds with clean white bedding and good lighting in the room. The bathroom was average, it was clean but nothing special. The hotel served free breakfast which was really nice and simple but good! Egg, toast, juice and coffee and that's about it but it gives you a good start of the day.Specially for the price/quality of this hotel it is a 5 star.

<Content>Good, basic hotel in great location Hotel is very convenient for the night life in Roppongi and access to Roppongi station (50 metres from the front door). Use exit 6 from Roppongi statioin and hotel is just ahead on the right. Although situated on a very busy road most rooms seem to be at the side and rear of the hotel so we had no problems with noise. The ground floor has obviously been recently fully renovated but the bedrooms have only been spruced up. Having said that they are perfectly fine and very clean and comfortable.Breakfast is served in the bar area and is fairly basic but includes Western items as well as usual Japanese breakfast.Good value for what you get.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed here during Sakura season 2007. The room was a large corner room (4 large windows) overlooking Tokyo Tower. It was very clean and well priced. The staff were very friendly (even though we couldn't speak much Japanese, they were nice).Beware if you stay a while there's only one washer  (slow) dryer.Also, while it is close to the metro, it still requires a transfer or two to get to the more well-known areas.

<Content>Fab location Tokyo was not quite the shock we were expecting, but we were pretty tired and hot when we arrived. Train from airport to Tokyo station was easy, then we took a taxi to the hotel. We would have been completely stuck if I hadn't printed the name of the hotel in Japanese off the website. You could definately get there using the subway to Roppongi hills and then walking, but it wouldn't be much fun in August heat with heavy bags. Good clean room. Not big, but o.k. Location is superb. Don't miss the french bakery on the short walk up to the Mori tower. Brilliant for breakfast snacks. The hotel breakfast is a waste of time. Lovely staff though.

<Content>excellent standards, excellent value We stayed at the b roppongi for 1 night in November and thoroughly enjoyed it. We had been in Japan for a week and wished we'd had stayed in the b for the entirity. Its a very modern, clean hotel with friendly staff. The ladies get a little gift of toiletrieswhen you check in which was a nice touch. No spectacular views from our room but the location was excellent for the nightlife of Roppongi. This is the main district for bars, clubs and restaurants, however, like the rest of Japan it is not in the least intimidating or threatening. Close to Roppongi metro station which is handy if you arrive this way with all your bags. The room was very quiet considering its location. I'd definately stay here again.

<Content>Good location and spotlessly clean The location of this hotel is excellent. Right next to the metro station and the bars, shops of Roppongi. The rooms are a very good size and spotlessly clean with tv, minibar fridge etc for a 拢60 per night hotel The rate also included breakfast. Staff were friendly and helpfulDirections from Narita Airport If you are coming from the airport then either get the bus to the ANA hotel then it鈥檚 a 2 minute walk up the hill. If you get to Rappongi crossing then you have walked to far.If you are coming by train get the express to Tokyo station and then the Marunouchi line (red) to Ginza and change to the Hibya line (grey) and take exit 5 at Roppongi station

<Content>Great service and value in the heart of the action We stayed here for one night on arrival in Tokyo and could not have asked for more for the discounted 80 pounds rate on Expedia. The location was excellent, steps from the subway station and the room large -including huge queen size bed, and spotlessly clean with tv, minibar fridge etc. Staff were friendly and helpful. Not a luxury choice but much much better than expected and would highly recommend, particularly if you expect to be out late in Roppongi.

<Content>excellent location my wife and i stayed at the b roppongi for 6 nights in may. i was a little apprehensive at first going to tokyo but i needent have worried. getting to the hotel from the airport was my biggest concern but turned out to be a doddle. just catch the narita express train (NEX) to tokyo station and then get a taxi. it is worthwhile having the hotels website printed in japanese as we found the taxi drivers did not know where to go without it. the hotel is a 2 minute walk from roppongi hills and if you are not into japanese food, just around the corner is mcdonalds, tgi fridays and the hard rock cafe. roppongi is very lively at night but we never had any trouble at all and the japenese people are always very courteous. the hotel itself is excellent. the room was very clean, and a lot more spacious than i expected with aircon and free internet connection. i found it worthwhile taking the laptop and using the internet in the room to plan days out. the reception staff knew very little english but we got by ok. one nice touch was when we went out of the hotel in the rain, the receptionist ran after us to give us both umberellas. trips worth doing are to go to the shrine at senso-ji, go by metro, so easy to use. also joypolis was well worth it if you like theme parks. overall i would highly recommend this hotel and the whole tokyo experience. if this hotel were in england i would expect at least a 4 star rating. any questions feel free to contact me and i will try my best to answer them.

<Content>Lovely hotel Stylish hotel in a great location. We stayed here for three nights at the start of our holiday.The bedrooms were clean and comfortable, tastefully decorated, with all the amenities you would expect. We were worried about street noise as Roppongi is quite a lively area, but needn't have been. Slept soundly every night.A simple buffet breakfast is available each morning with a selection of hot and cold drinks, toast, cereal etc. Its pretty basic but enough to get you started.Our rooms weren't available when we arrived (it was first thing in the morning), but the hotel was happy to look after our bags while we hit the sights. Plenty to see and do near the hotel, with tons of bars and restaurants to choose from. The nearest subway stop was just a few metres from the front door.Would definitely recommend this hotel for first time visitors to Tokyo.

<Content>OK for budget traveller. OK for location The hotel was a few minutes walk from Roppongi station and in the hub-bub of the Roppongi district. The staff were limited in their English, but were accommodating and pleasant. The room was average size, but had a funny smell (reminded me of blocked drains) Decor, bordering on bland. The room was clean, and the bathroom spotless. The bathroom reminded me of a bathroom you would find in a caravan, all cheap thin plastic and aluminium. It was as if it was a ready made bathroom cubicle, just dropped into a corner of the hotel room. The room was also quite noisy and every evening we could hear either an over exuberant honeymoon couple in the throes of passion, or more likely some old fella watching the 'adult channel' a bit too loud. Not the best was to try and fall asleep in the same room as your teenage son! The breakfast was awful, but we didn鈥檛 mind as we went elsewhere. I personally did not like the area, and found it noisy, smelly and dirty and the touts pestering you to go into the numerous strip clubs overwhelming. It did not feel as safe as other parts of Tokyo. This may be because I am an old fogey in my late thirties travelling with my teenage son! We actually booked out a day early, and went elsewhere. We found three nights stay here plenty. We would recommend Roppongi hills for a bite to eat. We ate here every evening, and the food was great and cheap.

<Content>Definitely a Great Choice We stayed at the B Roppongi in Tokyo for a week in March 2006. The hotel is in a wonderful location in an upscale entertainment area with tons of restaurants, bars and grocery stores nearby. Also the Tokyo Metro station is located a half block away.The hotel is spotlessly clean and is nicely designed.There are really no amenities other than a restaurant and a bar. Hotel staff spoke passible English and were totally efficient when we needed them.The best thing about the hotel was the spotless, large and airy room which we had on the corner of the 9th (top) floor. Aesteticly the decore is a cross between The Embassy Suites an an Ian Schraeger hotel.In any case it was totally comfortable and had very nice bedding. Housekeeping was perfect.One peculiarity was that we could only use international calling card calls from the lobby coinbox phone. It was not possible to do so from the room. Breakfast had few choices and got drab after a few days. Not a shame to miss this if you have a choice when booking.All in all this hotel is a great value for a buck.I would definitely stay here again.As a seasoned traveler who held off on travel to Japan for years due to the high price of doing so I also have to say that Tokyo is quite affordable at this time. We found prices similar or a bit less expensive than home in Los Angeles for daily living. This is a great moment to visit this very impressive city.

<Content>Fab hotel in a Fab City After getting such cheap rates for this hotel I was really worried BUT I could't have been more pleased. What a find! Great location near the hustle and bustle of Roppongi, right near the tube station and on the main road so great for finding a cab. The room although very small was fine, the bathroom sufficient. The staff were just great, we arrived in Tokyo at 630 am so we arrived well before the 2pm check in and although we couldnt check in that early they took our bags and we were able to return a couple of hours later and check in well before 2pm. Would definitely return and stay here again.

<Content>Stylish, contemporary, friendly We stayed here in September of 2005 for a ridiculously low sum, and were blown away by how much we got for our money! The hotel is, admittedly, small, but so are most things in Japan. The rooms are spotless, the hotel quiet (a rarity in the centre of Roppongi!) and the staff extremely helpful and polite. Despite the previous reviews, we found that the staff actually spoke very good English, and couldn't do enough to help us locate our luggage which had been lost by the airline. Also it couldn't be more convenient connection-wise. Just get off of exit 5 of Roppongi metro station, and you'll see the B sign less than 20 feet away.The only down side was the very limited range of food on offer in the breakfast room (but then you're in Roppongi - the place practically bristles with coffee shops and restaurants anyway), and the single english language channel on the TV (CNN). Still, for this money and quality, we really can't complain.If I visit Tokyo again, I would probably just book in here without bothering to look elsewhere. A great hotel.

<Content>great hotel, would stay again We picked this hotel from a website and were most impressed. We stayed 3 nights and had a room on the top floor, in the corner. We didnt hear any traffic noise and slept well in the huge bed. The only TV we could understand was CNN and we were able to follow the terrible events happening in New Orleans with the hurricane. The staff were very helpful however their English was limited, as was our Japanese. Breakfast was included in the tarrif, and was ok. The location is good, and i felt quite safe walking around the area on my own. Bathrobes supplied and a high tech toilet!

<Content>Good location but a but basic Friendly service but very few English spoken. The staff will do all its best if he understands English ...The rooms are correct but not outstanding. Luxury rooms are more standard than luxury. Breakfast is very basic with very few choice.But the location is terrific, five minutes from Roppongi Hills and one minute from Roppongi Station.

<Content>Very nice room, cheap, but noisy I staid with my friend in a deluxe room and I was really impressed by the size of the room, it was also really cheap in comparison to other Tokyo prices (拢199 for three night for two on lastminute).Flat screen TV, large sofa, very nice bed and huge room.The only problem is the noise. I was staying in room 410 just facing the main road, one of the busiest in Tokyo and they were doing lots of roadworks at night which did not help.Although the staff was helpful their English was really limited.The room had feather pillows and duvet. To avoid if you are allergic because they do not have any synthetic ones to replace them.

<Content>No extra frills - but clean and safe! We didn鈥檛 book the hotel as it was booked by our client. Like a lot of things in Japan 鈥?it wasn鈥檛 large, but all in all it was a pretty nice hotel. Front desk staff were very friendly and tried their best to communicate with us despite the difference in our languages. My Japanese is non-existent, so their English was much much better. I was in room 809. Two single beds. The biggest problem is a lack of space to put your belongings. There was no dresser in which to unpack your clothes, and only a small rack on the wall to hang things. Thank goodness I was only one person and could use the other bed to store my suitcase, briefcase and clothing. If you were two people in the room you could be in trouble. The LCD TV was nice with only one channel that broadcasts in English (the ubiquitous CNN) but hey 鈥?you鈥檙e in Tokyo 鈥?turn off the TV and go explore!Broadband internet access is excellent 鈥?a must for any business traveller. The bathroom was great. All the way from the high tech toilet (you have to experience it to believe it) to the best shower pressure I have ever experienced in a hotel. It鈥檚 amazing!The place that you eat breakfast becomes a lounge at night. The guys behind the bar are amazing. Total showmen that know their liquor. Good martinis and a big selection of scotch. All in all it鈥檚 not a hotel with a lot of frills, but if you鈥檙e looking for a very clean, safe, nice hotel, at a very reasonable price, then it鈥檚 the one for you.
