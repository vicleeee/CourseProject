<Content>Wonderful Hotel  I loved my stay at this hotel. The hotel itself is pretty much brand new. I've read lots of other reviewers complain about the location, but my husband and I thought it was wonderful. Its outside the main downtown area, so yes its about a 15 minute ride to the forbidden city and tiananmen square, but it was such a more meaningful experience to be in a more neighborhood setting. The hotel is located on a long street full of restaurants and bars filled with all locals. We had amazing food that we definitely wouldn't have had if we were staying in the more touristy areas. For example one night my husband had all kinds of seafood cooked in 5 different sauces, while I had amazingly fresh vegetables that came out plate after plate after plate and our whole dinner was only 15 dollars. Also we found great shops with every kind of trinket you could think of, at amazingly cheap prices, because we weren't in the main tourist area. There was tons of shopping for anything from clothes, bags, luggage, to furniture and antiques. The employees at the hotel were so helpful and went out of their way to accomodate in any way they could. For instance we arrived at 3am and their kitchen was closed, yet they still found someone to get us some room service since we were famished. We just really had a fantastic time at this hotel. I guess if you are planning to only be in beijing for a day or two and see only the forbidden city and tiananmen square then maybe this isn't the place for you. But if you want to immerse yourself in more of the chinese culture and if you will be traveling anywhere outside the city (for example to the great wall or something) then this location is much more convenient and a better choice.

<Content>Meeting planners beware We used this hotel for a 2 day conference, and stayed here 5 nights in total.The hotel itself is positioned as business hotel so is slightly out of central Beijing. The rooms are fine and the hotel is in good condition - what you would expect from a Renaissance.The suprise came when our final bill arrived..... If you are a western company planning a business meeting then beware! Some of the points in our contract were lost in translation, and as a result we were charged a lot more for certain services than we were expecting - or they were worth. This tainted our stay, and means we will avoid using this hotel again for similar purposes!

<Content>Not good location My second time in Beijing, I have stayed at the Renaissance as I was not able to find better location during Olympic. Hotel is brand new but the service and location where not good.I have tried to order room service but they came with the wrong dishes. Staff barely speak english and were maybe train quickly to open this hotel on timeRegarding location, it is better to stay in Sofitel.

<Content>Great place This was one of our tour hotels. I was pleased how great it was. Rooms were 5 star western with all the amenities one could want including iron/board, robes, kettle, separate shower and bath and were very clean including carpets. Bed and bedding luxurious. The pool area was a nice place to cool off after a hot day. Breakfasts were included in our tour and included both asian and western items and freshly made omelettes or eggs.It cost me 14 yuan to take a taxi to subway and within minutes I was downtown. Totally travel time about 15 minutes.Starbucks right next door for those who can't do without a fix.Bar lounge had a great group singing. There is a convenience store almost outside hotel. There is an ATM in lobby or currencies can be exchanged at front desk.

<Content>Great Location and Value We were cautious about staying at this hotel because of its location. Like other tourists I would have preferred to be in near Tiananmen Square but honestly, I much preferred the hotel's site, which is in the northeast part of the city near the embassies and fantastic shopping, western-style bars and great Chinese restaurants. The taxi ride in took 15 minutes and cost about 25RMB tops. The hotel is modern, with a helpful doorman and front desk staff. The rooms are standard Renaissance - tasteful, functional and subtly luxurious. The health club was big (subpar equipment) and the pool was gorgeous, the perfect post-flight refresher. As a Platinum member I got to use the club lounge, which was fantastic and included a generous breakfast. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants at all (go and explore Beijing!). The only downside was no spa - just a sauna in the locker rooms.

<Content>A great start in China Our room was large and very comfortable. The decor was most attractive with lovely woods and other nice detail. We thought the breakfast buffet was very good and had much variety. The dining room was sunny and small enough to feel homey. Service was excellent and friendly.

<Content>Nice welcome to Beijing Great, comfortable hotel with good AAA discounts. Big, well-appointed room, clean spacious bathroom; friendly, English-speaking staff, and massage service in room and at the spa. Very nice, clean pool and well-furnished gym facility. Reliable, helpful staff helped us organize a half-day trip to the Great Wall with small bus tour (5 people total) and thorough guide Mike who spoke English well and told us fun, interesting facts about the culture and country as we visited. The tour cost us about $40 each and was well worth it. One down side to the hotel is the incredibly pricey breakfast... don't bother with it, go outside to the busy street and find something nearby, or if you are desperate, go next door to a small, but comfy Starbucks and have your American coffee fix or try a local specialty like a green tea latte. Great roast duck restaurant down the street for local cuisine at inexpensive rates. Nice intro to the culture and city, and easy to get to all the main places by taxi-- maximum 25 yuan -- about $3.50 from hotel to Tiananmen Square or Silk Market.

<Content>Great Service -- Reasonable Rate I stayed at the Renaissance for 8 nights in March. The hotel staff was great. If I called, I was always greeted by name. The hotel lounge band was excellent. I don't usually frequent hotel bars, but this band had me coming in every night (except Sunday when they are off).The breakfast was pricey, which is my only real complaint about the hotel. It's also not central to the tourist areas but the couple of days we had for sightseeing were not spent in traffic.

<Content>Outstanding Hotel I stayed a week in Beijing visiting my daughter. The hotel exceeded my expecations. From the help of the doorman whenever I needed a taxi, to the guidance of the concierge when I needed restaurant help, to the greetings of the front desk staff, everything was perfect. By the end of my stay, I was always greeted by name. The Club Lounge was exceptional. The staff was attentive in every way. The food was well prepared, the snacks were perfect. My room was large and comfortable. Housekeeping always made up the room quickly when I was out. I'm not used to an over the top review but this hotel deserves it. I used the health club each day. The equipment was fine though as is true of many urban hotels, more equipment would have been better. The pool was beautiful although I didn't use it. The hotel restaurants met my needs - a traditional 3 meal restaurant where you could get noodles or a hamburger and fries. The hotel has an upscale Chinese restaurant and a lounge with excellent live entertainment.My wife and I stayed at the Renaissance about a year earlier. We enjoyed our stay but since then the hotel has really polished its service. I had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend the hotel.

<Content>Nothing to complain about! I stayed here for work for 7 nights, and it had everything you need. The gym had decent facilities and even has an indoor pool, though a bit small, but enough to do some short laps. It has a safe, iron, a great view of the city (if the pollution gets blown away), and comfortable beds. The bathrooms are also very clean and modern. The staff is very friendly and the included breakfast at the 1st floor restaurant is excellent with both Chinese and western fare. Its location is the only thing that would potentially be a deterrent for choosing this place again. It is in the northeast corner of Beijing and probably a good 30 minutes from Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, and that's without traffic, which can add an extra significant amount of time. But the area is very safe and has a ktv and good restaurants across the street (namely the Bellagio). The only thing I found strange is there was no hairdryer. Maybe it was hidden somewhere but I didn't spend too much time looking for it.

<Content>Loved this hotel I've stayed in beijing many times and this by far has been my favourite hotel, the only negative aspect is that some might find that it is not located in the city centre, but beijing is a huge city and taxi fare are extremely cheap. The service in the hotel is ecellent, the staff are truely very helpful and have from my experience a very good standard of english. The heath centre on the top floor is very modern and open very late and in room massages are cheap and include tip. I ate out every evening but the breakfast overed a good selection of both local and western food and a chef to cater to any other desires of their guests. all in all a very good hotel and a very enyoyable saty

<Content>Great Room, Comfortable Bed We spent a number of nights here as we attended a function in the hotel. Had a great big room with a very comfortable bed. Good bathroom with shower cubicle and stand up shower in the bath!Great shoe shine facility - very efficient free pickup and return.Breakfast buffet was ok - the fruit could have been better for such a good hotel and the service was not always as good as expected. This is not unusual for what we found around China. Overall though, no complaints.The hotel is about a 20-25 mins subject to beijing traffic taxi ride into the main tourist areas and taxis are cheap. It is also in a good location for visiting the great wall. We had a fantastic day at Jinshaling and went to Starbucks next door for a pick me up coffee after our climb! The hotel charges for intenet access which is a shame but starbucks has free wireless access!Went to a fantastic local restaurant so worth coming out of the hotel, turning right and walking down the road until something takes your fancy. Good little local supermarkets for snacks and cheap water.Heard about a great local flower market but ran out of time and never made it!

<Content>Great Hotel but on the Outskirts of town We we allocated this hotel as a Priceline win and as such it was excellent value for money . The location is a little out of the centre but there are bars and restaurants in the area . Beijing is huge so you will inevitably need to travel by taxi during your stay . Taxis are very cheap but Beijing traffic is a nightmare so getting around town can be very tedious .On the plus side the hotel is near the Airport expressway so getting to the Airport is easy . The room was quite large with 2 double beds,very clean and comfortable and very much to the Renaissance formula  .The bathroom had a separate bath and shower . We found the staff very attentive and courteous .Overall we had a great stay in Beijing and we had no problems at all with the hotel and would have no problems staying there again.

<Content>Renaissance Rocks! We stayed in the Renaissance last week while in Beijing. We changed to this hotel for the weekend after staying in the Presidential Plaza. This hotel was a dream. Its lovely, clean, the beds are comfy, the rooms are big (really big), and the bathrooms are really nice. The health club is clean and modern, and the indoor pool is also nice. My husband and I got foot massages in our room which were also really nice, inexpensive, and including tip!The staff here was quite fluent in English and easy to communicate with. There is only caveat with which I recommend this hotel. Location. This hotel is in the embassy district, the area with the huge ex-pat scene. Its not downtown Beijing, but taxis are so cheap it didn鈥檛 matter for us. V鈥檋a meyvin yavin: this hotel is extremely shomer shabbos friendly!

<Content>Good Hotel - With Some Cautions My wife and I stayed here for four days recently while touring China and Japan. I travel for business in Asia periodically. First the positives: -- Clearly a new property/recent renovation - overall in good condition. -- Large room, with Marriott's new bedding that I expect from stays in the states -- There is a Starbucks immediately next to the hotel -- Nice dining option right across the street called Bellagio Negatives: -- About a 25-35 minute drive from most sights you want to see (about $8-12 USD per trip each way) depending on traffic. -- Cab drivers do not know this hotel - at all. Due to it being a new hotel I think....if you leave the hotel by cab you MUST take a card from the front desk that you can give to drivers. -- Getting from the airport is tough - the hotel web site does not have a way for you to print the hotel name and location in Chinese characters - and none of the drivers know the hotel. We had to drive to a near by, better known hotel and the front desk there helped us get to the Renaissance. For this reason alone I would not send co-workers or friends to this hotel. -- The staff's English is not up to par with other hotels I have stayed at in mainland China. And they are a bit aloof.-- At 4am one night a loud alarm clock in the unoccupied room next to us went off and it took 1.5 hours to resolve with the front desk clerk who seemed completely annoyed to have to help us. So overall - solid physical condition, but hard to get to and staff is weak for a Marriott. Pricing was OK. If going back to Beijing I would choose another location.
