<Content>Fantastic location, nice hotel The Gates Hotel is in a lovely part of Charlottenburg, the up-market shopping hub of Berlin. Close to the City's major attractions and with an excellent choice of restaurants in the neighbourhood. The room we stayed in was adequate and good value for the price - although the bathroom was hideous, grey-tiled with an institutional feel. The internet hotel concept seems a bit dated but what a bonus to have free internet access! (I totally resent the usually outrageous charges of the the chain hotels for 'net use). The staff at the Gates were efficient and very friendly, although the tiny lobby and lack of common areas meants there was little buzz about the place.

<Content>Great Hotel in a equally interesting neighborhood As part of my five day tour of Germany my niece and I stayed at the Gates Hotel in Berlin. The hotel is located what is known as West Berlin primarily what is considered the theater District.The Hotel is centrally located to both the subway system as well as the Bus system all within three blocks, if fact we used public transportation exclusively.If you have not traveled in Europe before get used to the idea that rooms are extremely small but efficient.Thuthfully if all you are using the room for is to sleep all you need to know it the rooms are clean,well kepTheir is a multitude of cafes that are open till all hours. I really did not run into an issues with rudeness, in fact for the most part people went out of their way to show there kindness. My best advise is get a day pass every morning for about 6 Euro and you are good to go on all transportation systems. We extensively traveled thru Berlin and the countryside. Well worth the Cost.I have many many more hints that I would be willing ro share if anyone is interested

<Content>Cute little Hotel in great location Hotel Gates is located in a great section of Berlin. Subway is close by - around the corner and down the street and so is a number of cafes, pasteries, a print/photo shop, book store, a t-shirt/jean store etc etc. If it was a nice day, you could walk to the Zoo Palast, or take the subway one stop. Hotel is very clean, adequate, geared for business person or someone attending a film festival, convention centre or for anyone who needs to stay in touch with the world via internet, or needs to get any information.Buffet was amazing. Great quality of food, big selection, and they changed a few items every day. Dining room, was huge, immaculately clean, and the wait staff were friendly and all spoke English which I was grateful for. Same with front desk staff. Very professional, friendly, English was perfect, and staff were very helpful. Some of them however, mainly the night staff would look at you suspiciously if they never saw you previously. After an exchange of pleasanteries and with your door key in hand, they were fine after that - just be patient with that.Housekeeping was very friendly. If you needed to sleep in t'll noon, you would be left alone . You should always put the do not disturb sign up even though when I was in Bologna, Italy, the staff there didn't seem to respect that sign.Overall nice stay, very clean hotel, spacious, simple decor, nice balcony view, large bathroom, white clean tiles, a girls best friend - a removable shower head with great water pressure and adequate amounts of hot water. Large bathroom mirrors and room for accesories. Ask for towels only if you absolutely need fresh towels.

<Content>Bad experience rude staff I booked rooms for myself and two business colleagues as we were attending a trade fair in berlin. It was difficult to find rooms as the fair co-incided with the Berlin Film Festival, but I managed just before New Year to reserve 3 Business' rooms at éˆ§?185 each per night.For the price paid, the rooms were very small, shabby and not in great repair - certainly not 4 star quality.When we complained, we were told that this was a normal grade room for the price we paid and that was all they could do. We said that as they were not up to standard we were leaving to find somewhere else (3 nights here would have been horrible).The manager said that there was little he could do and that we would be charged in full as they wouldn't be able to sell the rooms at such short notice - there were probably lots of people roaming around the city desperate for somewhere to stay.He didn't handle the complaint very well and we just left and found somewhere else which was much better.Inflated prices due to trade fair/film festival perhaps, but the room quality remains the same all year round. If you can, avoid at all costs.

<Content>very convenient and clean Single traveller on business. Stayed 12 nights. On a quiet street with a number of small restaurants nearby. Reasonably priced. One hundred meters walk to U-Bahn (U2) station that is only one stop from Zoological Gardens or 300 meters from S-Bahn near the main shopping street Kurfurstendamm. Very helpful English speaking front desk staff and friendly chamber maids. Breakfast can be included in room rate if requested when booking. Breakfast staff friendly and efficient. Good selection of food choices on breakfast buffet. Single room was small but well appointed with good closet space. Shower but no bath. Refrigerated mini-bar. Couch and desk with PC and free high speed internet access. High speed internet is a priority for me as I take along Vonage and like the convenience of being able to have my phone connection wherever I travel. Hotel can provide limited number of day passes for S-Bahn, U-Bahn at about 4 Euro. Underground parking available at comparable price to other nearby locations. Overall, excellent value for price !

<Content>Absolutely faultless! I stayed at this hotel for three nights over the new year period.It is located in the K'Damm area of Berlin which is quite a posh area and easy to get on to the public transport network. The nearest underground station is savignyplatz but in practice you will find it easier to reach uhlandstrabe as it gets you to more places quicker.Checking in was easy and I was soon in my room. I was mainly attracted to this hotel because of the free internet and it worked superbly - be aware though that it is not wireless so your device will need an ethernet port. Don't despair if it hasn't as each room comes with a PC anyway - never seen this before!The room I had was a single room and was quite small but very well presented with mini bar and modern bathroom. Checking out was easy and the hotel even allowed me to pay in British Pounds - very easy!I paid æ‹¢220 for three nights in a standard single room. Overall, very pleasant made all the more novel by free internet and PC in every room.Would I stay here again, yes, without a doubt. Top marks!

<Content>Wunderbar with an asterisk I chose this hotel because they advertised PCs in every room and free Internet access. That sounded terrific, because I was in the middle of a long trip and needed to be able to catch up on messages without spending too much time and money in a smoky Internet cafèŒ…. Unfortunately, the Gates' Internet connection died on Sunday morning and wasn't fixed by the time I checked out a day later éˆ¥?very disappointing, considering how much emphasis the hotel put on it in their advertising!The room was very large and comfortable, and the hotel's in a quiet location not far from the Zoo Station (which is, of course, no longer the main station and not quite the lively area it once was).

<Content>Wonderful! Terrific hotel! We had a huge room with very high ceilings, a pullout couch, a mini frig and a computer. One of the best breakfast buffets we've had in Europe- the cappucino machine was broken but the sparkling wine made up for it. Staff was very friendly; and there were apples at the front desk for us and candy for our soon. Super location- easy access to the S bahn and an easy walk to the Zoo station. Lots of little shops and restaurants in the area. Highly recommended- would definitely stay there again.

<Content>the standart by which i judge all others i am writing this a couple of years after i stayed here because i value other people's reviews so much. i travel frequently these days and i have yet to stay in a hotel that is as clean and pleasant as the gates hotel. i usually stay in hotels in the 3-4 star range although that doesn't really say much giving he range of quality among starred hotes.but the gates sparkled. and the service was very good. it is in the west of berlin which isn't the hot spot that mitte in the east is( although there are still plenty of nice cafes, patisseries and restaraunts nearby), but i would gladly give up that sort of convenience for a comfortable clean hotel, and the internet access can't be beat.

<Content>Very clean  Just back from a brilliant long weekend at Hotel Gates am Ku'damm - (--). The location is great on a quiet street, and getting around the city is easy as it's very close to Ernst-Reuter-Platz underground station which is only one stop on the U2 line from Zoo Station.The room was clean  modern, great bathroom with fab shower - always hot  powerful.Most impressive was the free in-room laptop with broadband access - great to check out restaurants/train times etc.Add the breakfast - you might think it's a bit pricey but there's a massive buffet with everything you could possibly want - with both Continental and hot breakfasts - there even seems always to be an hot oriental breakfast option!Fabulous places to eat and drink within short walking distance:the cafe just down the road on the corner Knesebeckstrasse/Goethestrasse sells great sandwiches.The Indian restaurant a few doors up on Knesebeckstr is brilliant.Mar y Sol restaurant, also on Knesebeckstr at Savignyplatz, serves great Spanish tapas.The Eldorado restaurant on the Ku'damm just down from the junction with Knesebeckstr does great steaks - even better than Blockhouse.I have to agree with a previous post that Berlin is a must-see city and the Gates is the place to stay.

<Content>Well run Berlin hotel Stayed here for 4 nights last week. We did our research into various hotels and this one, despite a couple of complaints, seemed fairly good so we went ahead and booked. We were not disappointed. Contrary to a couple of reviews, we found the staff on the front desk to be diligent and friendly, (my German is schoolboy stuff but passable, their English was excellent). The rooms were spotless and cleaned every day and apart from the odd person walking across the courtyard at night, it was pretty much as peaceful as you'd want.The location is fabulous: 500 metres from the Ku'Damm, 100 metres from the nearest U-Bahn Ernst Reuter Platz, 200 metres to the nearest S-Bahn Sauvignyplatz and a mere stone's throw to the nearest restaurants (which ranged from the homely and inexpensive to the more pricy ones)We tried hard to think of any negative things to say about the Gates, and can only think of two:1. Being Brits we love a morning cup of tea, but this facility, so common in most European hotels, was not available in the room. There is a coffee house 50 metres away, so it's not like you can't get an early morning drink.2. We were here in Spring and the weather was just turning pleasantly warm, and a large opening window was a nice touch in these days of sealed units and aircon, but I feel that in July and August, when the weather gets a lot hotter, aircon would be a bonus to be savoured.There you go, two very minor points, not even worth calling complaints really.We've stayed in hotels across Europe and paid more for a lot worse, and we both agreed that this was without doubt the best deal we've ever had. Booked through Expedia, flights and accommodation for 4 nights came to a touch under æ‹¢200 each flying from London. Excellent value for money, and made all that much better by having such a comfortable, well-run hotel to base ourselves. We'd definitely reccommend it.

<Content>Solid hotel, if you can get a deal Stayed here for two nights. Got a great deal on expedia 93 Cdn plus tax. (No breakfast) Free in room internet, with either their computer or your laptop. This seems to be a rarity in Europe where they like ripping you off for in-room internet. Bed very comfortable. They didn't do the two twins pushed together to make a bigger bed trick. Very quiet place. Near both S and U Bahn. Nice West Berlin neighborhood. Good hotel courtyard. Didn't eat there, but hotel eateries are usually a gyp anyway. Would stay there again. I had a slightly awkward door, often had to shove it open.

<Content>Very Disappointed I booked the hotel for one night. Due to the delay of my departing flight in Dublin, I missed my connecting flight in Frankfurt, as a result of that, I arrived in the hotel about 7 pm intead of 6 pm that I advised the hotel.To my horror, the hotel gave my room away because I turned up one hour late. They tried to get me to pay extra (a lot more) for an upgrade to a suite which I refused. This, in my opinion, is very bad practice.Finally, they agree to put me into a hotel nearly (I had to carry my luggage and find the hotel myself). The second hotel was a great hotel, even though it has the same star rating, it is a cheaper hotel. Obviously I could not get any refunds, so I couldn't help to feel that I have been robbed.

<Content>Stay at this hotel! We spent five nights at this incredible hotel in Berlin. This hotel is worth twice the price they charge. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were very large and comfortable, with lux bathroom (had a regular shower and a waterfall style shower), and the room had a balcony. It was quite and clean (clean by German standards, so it was exceptionally clean by American standards). The location is also very good, a quite street two blocks to subway and a ten minute walk to the main West train station, Bahnhof Zoo. I travel quite a bit for work and this was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. Don't think twice, book this hotel now!

<Content>The Gates is great Just returned from 5 days in Berlin at the end of 7 weeks travelling and found the Gates to be the best of any of the 18 hotels visited (including Hiltons and assorted 4 star establishments). The hotel is stylish and the staff were friendly and accomodating. My room was huge, the bed was supremely comfortable, the bathroom clean and well equiped and the 24/7 free internet access allowed me to check out all that Berlin had to offer, book onward rail journeys and keep up with work and friends in the comfort of my room. The hotel is close to the U-bahn (only 1 stop from the main station), a short walk from great shopping and the associated restaurant across the road offers delicious food served with flair and charm.All round The Gates is a real winner.

<Content>The Gates - Fabulous hotel with free in-room PC/Internet Fantastic hotel, especially if you need online access 24/7. I'm self-employed and this hotel is perfect for checking your emails without lugging a laptop around or visiting internet cafes. The rooms are ultra-clean, shower massive and drenching and KING size beds which is an unusual and welcome bonus. The breakfasts are huge buffets with smoked salmon, bucks fizz, cheese, bread, pastries and even egg, bacon and sausage too. The Gates is situated in the theatre district - very beautiful, quiet with fabulous places to eat and drink within short walking distance. Berlin is a must-see city and the Gates is the place to stay.
