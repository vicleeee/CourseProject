<Content>Great location and Great Value At first glance, an odd property since you really never see the hotel and enter through the garage with hotel occupying top floors of old office building.I visit New Orleans often and prefer staying near but not in the French Quarter and there are plenty of hotel options that fit this description but for the location and price you will be hard pressed to find a better option than the Hilton Garden Inn.Very pleasant and helpful staff, and extremely well managed property that offers all the amenities of typical Hilton Garden Inn brand including free wireless internet, and breakfast. Parking here is very expensive at $30 a night with seems excessive to me but generally on par with other city garages. Rooms are very clean, and modern but small work out room share the top floor of property adjacent to small rooftop outdoor pool.Location is great only blocks from French Quarter, Poydras, and Canal.

<Content>Great Location and Nice Overall Hotel This was my second stay at this Hilton Garden Inn in the French Quarter. I booked it primarily because of the price (around 90.00) and since I had stayed there once before and I am a Hilton Diamond Member I knew what to expect. The hotel is kind of secluded, so be careful or you will pass right by it on the narrow one way street it is located on. Valet parking only is kind of expensive, although not as much as the Doubletree just a couple of blocks down. Lobby is on the 11th floor, and the rooms are from 12 on up. It strikes me odd that you can do a daily park there as a tourist for 6 to 10 dollars a day, but as a guest it was 28.00, plus tax. But with the low rate I didnt see a reason to complain. Hotel check in was fast and friendly. Room was clean, nice, and quiet with a slight view of the water.Breakfast was good, and as a diamond member it was complimentary. I don't know if I would have paid 10.00 for it. Valet was quick to bring the car down and assisted with luggage. Harrahs Casino is only about a 4 block walk and Canal Street if only about 2 blocks away. I would definitely stay here again if I could get the same low rate, even with the parking feee.

<Content>Nice Hotel - Not Quite in French Quarter My family stayed at this hotel when we came to New Orleans for a graduation (got a group rate of $99). The hotel is clean and comfortable. The staff was polite. However, if you try to check in early and they say they will call you when your room is ready, don't believe them. PLEASE NOTE: This hotel is NOT in the French Quarter - it is about 3 or 4 blocks west of Canal Street. It is an advantage because it quiet. It is a disadvantage because there is nothing around. If you want something quick for breakfast, something from Starbucks or an ATM, you'll need to go for a walk unless you want to eat at the in-hotel restaurant, which will charge you an arm and a leg for a bagel and a Coke. Also note that parking is about $25/day - about standard for NOLA.I would stay again but would bring walking shoes.

<Content>Good Location / Quiet My wife and I stayed here on May 18th  19th. We pulled into the parking garage and were greeted by the valet who was Ok but not overly cheerful. The man who came for our luggage was very nice and offered us directions and dinner ideas. Check in is on the 11th floor which is weird but I think the first 10 floors are parking. The front desk staff were very welcoming and were more than happy to book a tour for us the following day.Our room was on the 16th floor. It was your standard Hilton Garden room, clean and comfortable.If you turned left as you left the hotel and took a left at the first corner and walked two blocks and crossed Canal St., you were on Bourbon St. It was a bit of a culture shock at first, my first impression was loud, dirty and seedy. We stopped in a club and listened to some jazz, had a drink and relaxed. We then left Bourbon St. and and walked a few blocks and a strange thing happen, we loved it. We will return to explore more of the city in the future.As for the Hilton Garden, we would not hesitate to return.

<Content>A Strange Neighborhood The Hilton Garden Inn is located on a side street of Canal Street. Though this is very close to the French Quarter itself, the somewhat sketchy walk through these side streets made me wary of staying there alone. Beside its location, the hotel and its staff were wonderful. There was a tendency for loud yelling at 3am in the morning as college-age students returned from their shenanigans on Burbon Street. I would recommend this hotel if you have someone to stay and walk with and if you can get a special deal that includes free parking (it is a 26 dollar fee otherwise).

<Content>Nice This is a nice, clean place to stay if you don't want to pay the high price of the French Quarter.We stayed for 6 nights so the fridge and microwave came in handy. The staff could have had better knowledge of the streetcars and a little better at directions but we had maps and were able to get around fine.We ate at the restaurant twice because everything around the hotel closes by 2 pm and we didn't feel like going back into the French Quarter. We both liked our meals but we also had enough sense not to expect a top notch meal. We ordered sandwiches and salads. We had a different waitress both times and thought they were great. My only complaint is the room wasn't cool enough. They did send someone and it got a little cooler. They called a few hours later to make sure we were happy and to see if we needed anything else. I felt it still was a little warm for me to sleep but since I'm from New England and used to cold nights I figured it was more my problem than theirs.

<Content>Great Hotel, good location An excellent hotel although the location is a little misleading. The property is actually in the central business district about 1-2 blocks from canal street which is the western edge of the French quarter. I felt safe in this area and it was a bit of a hike to the converntion center, my place of business at the time. The hotel lobby is located on the 12th floor which is a bit odd but it works. The rooms were clean and the buffet breakfast with omlet station is just fine. I would stay there again.

<Content>A not so bad hotel in new orleans I just was in this hotel for a week. Overall, I would say it's an averagely nice place to stay in New Orleans.On the positive side, the rooms are quite big, well equipped and clean. The beds are nice and comfortable. The room had a small fridge as well as a microwave oven (although I used none of them). Also, the hotel is quite conveniently located, very close but not inside the (noisy) French quarter. The staff at the reception was professional and efficient.However, everything was not perfect. First, the internet connection was *amazingly* slow. Both wired and wireless connectivity was available, and both were slow. Moreover, the wireless signal was very weak in most of the room. Food taken at the hotel's restaurant was really average and the restaurant staff was really painfully slow. In summary, this hotel is not extraordinary, but if all you need is a simple place to stay then it's probably a good choice.

<Content>Mediocre at best I stayed here for two nights for a big concert event in town. Although I had requested a non smoking room, I arrived about 9:30 pm and was informed that no more non-smoking rooms were available. I consequently explained that my booking confirmation said I had reserved one. Not taking much interest in what I had to say however, the girl at the desk remained straight faced, not even offering an apology for not being able to accomodate my request. When I continued to inquire about it, she got an attitude and said that they had been booked for 2 days and You can't touch these rates. Ridiculous! Besides the fact that it wasn't true, what do your rates vs. other hotels have to do with your service? We agreed to do business under certain conditions at a certain price, period.Well, realizing I was fighting a losing battle, I took the smoking room. The room was ok, but the view was awful. Seriously, it was a bright sunny day outside the next day, but the window was always grey because it faced the center of the hotel - which was nothing but other rooms with bad views and no sun because this square hole ran all the way through the hotel to the ground.The room stunk as well. A nasty, overdone airfreshener type smell that hung over the room made me feel nauseous; fortunately however, I was not in the hotel much during my stay.On the positive, the room was clean, the maids were pleasant, and some of the other front desk employees were more helpful. But the bed felt like sandpaper...GIven the variety of hotels in New Orleans, I don't think I would stay here again.

<Content>Good, but don't eat here! OK, now this was my first time in New Orleans so I took a bit of a flyer on the hotel. Location was good, quiet and just off the main Canal St and close to Bourbon St (without the noise) - I don't think in hindsight I would stay anywhere too close to Bourbon...Hotel was clean and easy to find and I would stay there again, price was reasonable at $159 a night however there were a few niggles. Firstly, there is a compulsory $2.50 charge per day for having a safe in your room. C'mon people, be honest - just add it to the total room charge upfront. This is just cheeky.Also, we had problem with never getting shampoo as the cleaning staff couldn't read the labels in English and got the mouthwash confused with shampoo. I know this because we asked them!Finally, whatever you do, do not eat at the 'Great American Grill' their in house restaurant. The food is very very poor, overpriced and the service dreadful. The waiter and waitress had to call over the manager to open our wine because they had never used a corkscrew before!!!! The steak was so over cooked I felt like re-soleing my shoe. No, no, whatever you do go out and eat. Food and service aside I'd stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Stay We stayed at this hotel for a weekend in New Orleans. The location is great - a few blocks from Canal and Bourban Streets. We had a corner suite with a king bed. We had lots of windows with great views. The room was very clean! Parking was $26 per day. We would certainly stay at this hotel again in the future.

<Content>Great Deal for New Orleans My wife and I stayed overnight at the HGI CBD/French Quarter on December 30, 2007 and was pleasantly surprised with our accomodations given our rate of $84 plus $26 for parking. The size of our standard king room was exceptionally large by New Orleans standards and comparable to what you find in new construction HGI's around the country. The hotel is a conversion and not very welcoming from the street level entrance which is a parking garage. However, once you reach the lobby via the elevator to the 9th floor, you know you are in an HGI with the exception of a much larger common area than most. I can attest to the earlier reviews that the location is both quiet and convenient. In fact, Harrahs is only four blocks and the French Quarter maybe three. The pool area on the roof provides a nice view of the city and the smallesh fitness center overlooking the terrace is a nice touch. There is very litte wear on this hotel at least on the surface. What a deal for $84 and in New Orleans during peak nights a deal for at least twice that. Oh, did I mention they threw in free breakfast for my wife and I given my Gold Hilton HHonors status?The only problem we experienced was a fussy thermostat that resulted in us waking to a warmer than desired room. After fooling with it a while, things cooled off. Not a big deal to this frequent traveler who has experienced his share of problem temperature controls in hotels costing 3 to 4 times as much.

<Content>Good Hotel This hotel is great for a weekend stay. We had a large, clean room. It is not a luxury hotel but this was fine for us because we were not spending a lot of time in the hotel. There is a great view of the city from the pool at the top of the hotel.I would recommend this for business travelers as well.

<Content>Great Getaway There were lots of good deals in New Orleans but this hotel for $79 a night was the one I chose. My son and I stayed here and had a nice sized room with double queen beds. The hotel is within easy walking distance of most attractions. Free wifi, cookies in the lobby, quiet, it was really nice. The only complaint I had was the pillows.. They were really thin and cheap.

<Content>Very Good The Hilton Garden Inn on Gravier was a life saver for me and my family. During the Bayou Classic I had to find a place to stay after arriving a another very disappointing hotel, I called the Hilton and they were able to accomodate us. Check in was quick and very courteous. I felt very secure with my children because you have to have key card entrance to the floors. The rooms were immaculate. I could say so much more, but to sum it all up I was very pleased and would stay here again.

<Content>Another Great Stay at Hilton Garden Inn This was our second stay at this hotel. The first time was Mardi Gras 2005. The location is conveniently located to the French Quarter--two blocks from Canal St and 1/2 block from Carondelet which becomes Bourbon across Canal.Rooms are a good size. Very clean. Very quiet. Beautiful view of New Orleans from the roof patio/pool area.Only downside is that the restaurants across the street from the hotel are not open during the weekend as this area is the business district. There is a restaurant in the hotel open for breakfast and lunch. We used it for breakfast the last visit and it was fine. Service was a little slow.For those thinking of coming to Mardi Gras 2008, remember that Canal St is usually closed due to the parades. If you are staying in the quarter, your cab will have to drop you off at Canal St and you will have to drag your luggage across the street to the many hotels. While it might be fun staying in the quarter if you are on 24 hour party mode, its much quieter at the HIlton Garden Inn.

<Content>Great stay at the Garden Inn I recently stayed here over the weekend with my teenage son and adult niece. Good location - only a few blocks walk to the heart of Bourbon street. We got a great rate when we booked on the website. The rooms are large - there was plenty of space for the 3 of us. Beds are very comfortable. The entire hotel - lobby, hallways and rooms were all clean - looked almost new. It was so quiet it was hard to tell if there were other guests on our floor. Housekeeping was great - you couldn't tell they were on the floor until you saw their cart. We went out on Saturday a.m. and when we returned, in addition to cleaning our room houskeeping had neatly lined our shoes along the wall, placed our toothbrushes in a glass and organized our toiletries on the bathroom counter. We did eat breakfast at the grill there - buffet is $10.95 - and they make omelets, pancakes, french toast, etc. to order. The staff there is very friendly and attentive. Also this is one of very few hotels there that offer free high speed internet in the room. I would recommend this hotel for a great stay that is close enough but not in the Quarter.

<Content>Nice Stay during Jazzfest Hotel is a nice quiet almost hidden gem. Stayed here for 2nd weekend of jazzfest. Easy walk to Harrahs, stinky bourbon st., plenty of cabs drive by, friendly staff, nice free breakfast (diamond hhonors benny) , room always made up nice when I returned, small pool but had it all for rmyself - just right. Small little bar for a quick drink and good bartender. I'd stay here again.

<Content>Back in New Orleans I visit New Orleans often and when I do I usually stay at a Hilton property being that I'm a HHonors Member. This was my first visit to this particular property. Check -In was fine. Breakfast was outstanding. Lunch was just as good. I especially enjoyed the Ribeye Steak. There were some problems with my room. Fridge was unstable. Room not very Clean. No safe in room. No remote for TV. Parking at this Hotel is just plain horrible. Valet takes forever and Self Parking is almost impossible with any vehicle larger than a ford taurus.

<Content>Great Hotel! We choose the Hilton Garden Inn as our pre-cruise hotel. Everything about the hotel was to our liking. Check-in was a breeze; the rooms were clean and spacious. Internet was free. And, of course, the hotel was a short walk from the French Quarter and the Riverfront. My only disappointment with the hotel was the fact that the fitness facility was small and many of the machines were broken and the outdoor heated pool was filled with dirt and debris. Other than that the hotel was great and we will definitely be staying here again!

<Content>Very Pleased! We recently stayed at this hotel located only 2 blocks from Canal St. and the French Quarter. We were very pleased with the accomodations. Housekeeping, front desk, valet, and other hotel staff were very friendly and always offered assistance. The hotel breakfast was good as well, which included eggs to order, waffles, pastries, biscuits, grits, sausage, bacon, yogurt and other yummy items. The rooms included microwaves and refrigerators which definitely came in handy with children. There was FREE wireless internet and the lobby on the 11th floor was very comfortable and inviting. The hotel is located in an office building in the CBD of New Orleans. We were able to walk to the French Quarter in 5 min. The hotel is also walking distance to other attractions such as the Aquarium, Harrah's Casino, and the free ferry to go over to Algiers to the Blaine Kern Museum. And the price for only $80 per nite from the hotel's website. Add another $11 and you can get the Life's Getaway package which included breakfast for 2 adults and 2 children.We will definitely stay again at this hotel when we visit New Orleans. Great for families and kids.

<Content>Great Location and Value near the French Quarter I am a fan of Hilton Garden Inns, the moderately priced but nicely appointed member of the Hilton family. I have stayed a number of times at this particular hotel as my husband stays here for his business trips and I often join him. From the outside, this hotel does not immediately attract you as the lobby is located on the 11th floor of the building, above a parking garage. But once you get into the hotel, it is very welcoming. The staff are some of the friendliest and most accomodating I have come across. Hilton Garden Inn rooms are nicely appointed and have a microwave, refrigerator and a coffee maker. The rooms are good size and the hotel has a rooftop outdoor heated pool with great views and a nice but small gym. The lobby has a very welcoming and comfortable lounge area as well as a business center with complimentary computer, printer and supplies. Wireless internet is available free in the lobby and free, wired internet is available in rooms. As Hilton diamonds, we received a free breakfast buffet--purchased separately this nice all you can eat buffet with made to order eggs and all the fixings including juice and coffee is $10.95. But what really makes this a standout is the great location at a reasonable price. You can often get a room at a AAA or AARP price or $99-$139 depending on time of year (major events excepted). Last weekend we were there for the pre-Mardi Gras parades that start three weeks before the actual day. We were only two blocks from the parade route and three blocks from Canal St and the beginning of the French Quarter. New Orleans is a great city for walking and there is lots to do. Be sure to visit the Louisiana tourist information center on St Ann Street in the French Quarter and also take advantage of the free 90 min French Quarter walking tour that starts at the Jean Lafitte National Park Service center on Decatur (tickets given at 9 am to first 25 people). I love the ambiance, people, music and food of NOLA and I look forward to many more trips and stays at the Hilton Garden Inn.

<Content>Comfortable Stay I visited the Hilton Garden located on Gravier Street. The location is good especially if you want to walk to Harrah's.It is maybe four blocks down from the hotel. Once there you can also visit the Canal Place shopping center. This is a upscale center with a lots of name brand designers. The convention center is not far from this point. In the opposite direction you can walk to the French Quarters. Gravier is a narrow street but cars can get through.My room was plesant, Hilton had not gotten to this hotel to upgrade the bedding, which is what I enjoyed at previous Hilton hotels stays. The staff said they were working on it. Breakfast and lunch are served at the hotel. There are places you can walk for dinner, especially on weekends.The lobby is located on the 11th floor. This hotel is in the CBD/French Quarters so there is a fee for parking your car. I did not have a car but noticed there was a valet parking cars.Now to the staff, my pet peeve. They front desk was very helpful. There was not a request they did not answer with great customer care skills. I would stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful hotel We stayed here for New years this year. We booked the room only a month before the trip. We were able to get a pretty good rate at $129 a night. None of us were complaining at the price and such last minute notice for New Year's weekend.It is on a side street that the cab driver didn't know for sure where it was but once he found it we were good. It was pouring down rain when we got to NOLA but fortunately there was a covered area to pull up into so we didn't have to get any wetter than we were.The check-in is on the 11th floor but it really didn't take long to get to the floor. Check-in was quick and efficient. The staff was very helpful.We had some difficulty using the key in the elevator but I think that was more user error than any fault of the hotel. The room was very clean and very spacious. There were 4 of us staying in the room and had plenty of space. There was a microwave and refrigerator in the room. The view wasn't that great but we weren't there for the view.It was pretty quiet too. The staff was really good about giving us a late check out since our train didn't leave until close to 2p. It was within three blocks of Bourbon street. Everything was pretty much within walking distance. In fact, we ended up walking back to the train station on that Monday. However, I would not walk back to hotel by yourself if you are a woman. I'm a pretty confident woman but my friend and I were a little nervous coming back from Emeril's on some of the side streets and we had a guy with us. Too many dark doorways from where businesses haven't come back. Stick to main streets and groups and you will be fine.Overall, I would stay at this hotel again and again.

<Content>Quiet, yet close to it ALL My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn on Gravier St. for the the Saints playoff game against the Eagles on Saturday 1/13/07.  Being from the area (Marrero, La.) and not wanting to drive home after the game, we decided to find a room in a SAFE area close to the Dome AND near the French Quarter (You know...in case we won, we did). We found it here.  Roughly 4-5 blocks from the Dome and 4 blocks to the heart of the Quarter. It was ideal. Valet parked our car WITH the ability to go in or out as we pleased for $20 (not bad, especialy on a game day). Lobby is on the 11th floor. Checked in quickly and went up to the room. Average room. Clean, king-size bed, dorm sized reffer, microwave, view of the growing crowd at the Super Dome blah blah blah. Staff VERY friendly. Above average buffet-style breakfast in the AM. Every breakfast food imaginable available. Eggs oatmeal grits waffles muffins cereal and so on. $11 good deal. If you're looking for something in a decent neighborhood,quiet enough to get some sleep when you're ready to, and yet close to the action... this is it. Will stay here again when the need arises.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Great Location We were in New Orleans for the Sugar Bowl. The Hilton Garden is located 2 short blocks for the end of Bourbon St. It is also only 10 minute walk from the Superdome. It is close enough to put you in the middle of the excitement quickly, but far enough away for a quiet room. We never had any concern walking to the hotel no matter what time of night. The rooms are spacious and clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. It is a very good hotel for the money.

<Content>Very Quiet Spent one night in early October in this hotel. No on site dinner restaurant but they do offer breakfast and lunch. Rooms are large and the quietest I have ever slept in. Located only two blocks from the Canal street end of Bourdon Street, it has great access to the French Quarter, without being on top of all the noise.

<Content>Good place to stay for business Stayed at the hotel several times following Hurricane Katrina, and was probably one of the best properties downtown. The rooms were more than adequate in size and the beds comfortable. The staff was pleasant to work with, and more than accomodating to any needs or questions.Notes:-Lobby is on an upper floor (11th, I believe). Made waiting for elevators, especially at night somewhat of an adventure.-The hotel is about 4-5 blocks away from Canal Street and the mess that is Bourbon Street. If you are looking for a quiet night away from revelers, this is a pretty good option. The only problem is that all of the bars and resteraunts are in the Quarter. -The breakfast is food. Nothing special or different over a 1 month period. -No mold was observed in the guest rooms, but a small spot was see on a hallway ceiling. The staff knew about it but could not find the source of water. Nice to see a staff that knows about mold (for once).Overall: I would definetly stay there again for business, but maybe not for adventure.

<Content>Excellent choice Let's get the hotel review out of the way first. This Hilton is located on the top floors of a mixed use building in the CBD but only a 5 min walk from Bourbon St. It's one of several old office buildings that have been reborn as hotels for (mainly) business and convention travellers. Our room was well done with nice decor, extremely comfortable beds, a small fridge, and extra sound-proofing. Heard nothing from fellow guests or from outside the whole time. Service was friendly and efficient. They dinged me $20 for parking but the room rate was so low it was still a great deal. The rooftop pool was small but offered a great view of the city, at least what's left of it. Which brings me to my comments on the city of New Orleans itself. A visit here in 2006 is a very sad experience, probably alot like a visit to Berlin immediately after WWII. Yes the French Quarter is up and running, you can get a Hurricane at Pat Obriens and an outstanding poboy at Mothers, but much of the city is basically a disaster area. And the saddest part is--nobody seems to care. Here and there you'll see some clean-up and rebuilding going on but not much. On Bourbon Street, where on previous trips it seemed that the food and the music were the primary focus, now the strip clubs dominate, and the party atmosphere is gone. God bless those that have stayed on and are dedicated to restoring the city to its former glory.

<Content>Very good place to stay This hotel is a very nice place to stay. The rooms and common areas are well kept and clean. The hotel occupies floors 11-18 of what appears to be a mixed use building. The pool (oversized bathtub) is on the roof along with the gym. The roof area is an open area that provides a nice view of the city. I believe that the free wireless access is available on the roof so you can surf outside and watch the city. The hotel has an eating area and what appears to be a bar. Both have limited hours and the breakfast was fair but I opted to go across the street to Steve's for breakfast on day 2. It is a little walk to the Quarter or to the Riverwalk area. Overall, a fine place to stay and they are in much better condition than most of the hotels in the city. I will definately stay there again. There also is a nice little pantry area adjacent to the front desk for a few little munchies and drinks when the crave hits. Wireless access was fine but slow so switched to the wall outlet which was fine until the whole connection went down. It came back up and the speed was much improved.

<Content>Proper and correct, but The hotel was proper and correct. My room was spacious, clean, quiet, and comfortable, although not as close to the French Quarter as the name implies. Three blocks away is still three blocks. But the hotel could have done better. When I was there (June, 2006) many other hotels were offering to their customers, who were attending the first large convention to return to NOLA, such emoluments as: free breakfastss, free dinners, free WiFi service, free glasses of wine, free non-alcoholic service at the bar, etc. They were meant to impress, and they did. Compared to other hotels, including the Hilton Garden Inn on St. Peters, which offered a colleague complimentary breakfasts for the duration of his 6-day stay and free non-alcoholic beverages at the bar, and an Embassy Suites, which offered another colleague a free 1/2 bottle of wine in the evening, this hotel was downright abstemious. All that we got were free USA Todays plus toll house cookies and lemonade at the end of the day. To be sure, when I asked the manager about some of these differences in service, he agreed to comp me breakfast for 4 days. I thought that offer should have been made to all clients at the time they checked in.At the same time, food service at the hotel (during this first post-Katrina convention) was decidedly inferior. The hotel has a small kitchen, which serves only breakfasts and lunches. With the exception of omlets, much of the food appears to have been prepared elsewhere and delivered to the hotel and is only mediocre. Unfortunately that includes the morning coffee. Curiously, it was worse -- less tasty -- than such places as Dunkin Donuts or even my favorite diner. Croissant, typically mediocre everywhere outside of France, had the correct shape, but tasted like Porter House rolls. And my Egg Beater omlet with onions, mushrooms, peppers, and ham never got beyond the look of scrambled eggs with all those things mixed in. At least it tasted OK, and by the 4th day they'd followed through on my request to cut back on butter. I had but one lunch, and it was adequate: a pre-made tuna wrap.The hotel boasts of having an outdoor pool. It does; it's on the 18th floor overlooking much of the city. At about 9' x 15' it's about the same size as some large closets I've seen and therefore not really much good for anything other than some kind of baptismal dip. The fitness center with the standard treadmills and stationary bicycles was adequate.Staff was helpful and considerate, which travelers expect often to their disappointment. I was not disappointed. In keeping with the city-wide campaign to make everyone want to come back, staff was friendly and efficient; proper and correct.In sum, the hotel made my stay comfortable. Nothing remarkable or memorable; just proper and correct.

<Content>What is considered the "French Quarter"? The hotel is lovely. However, it is QUITE a few blocks from the French Quarter which could be a problem late at night after visiting Bourbon Street. Overall, I prefer hotels on the other side of Canal Street, closer to the Quarter.

<Content>Great Service Based on previous reviews I chose the Hilton Garden Inn French Quarter to block rooms for family/friends for my wedding which was at the end of May. I looked at the rooms prior to my decision and found them to be better than average and were very spacious. The group sales rep, Esther, went out of her way to work with me and was very understanding as I changed the amount of rooms needed several times. I was also able to get a great deal considering it was Memorial day weekend and I am pretty sure this hotel offers great prices even without the group rate.Most of the guests were able to make their reservations without any trouble and I wasnt made aware of any problems with anyone's room or check in/out service. In fact, my friends/family went on about how nice all of the staff were and had a wonderful time. The location of this hotel is very unassuming and can be a little difficult to find, however, it is a very convenient location to both the casino side and french quarter. I did not officially stay at the hotel, but as the person who blocked off approx. 20 rooms for 2 nights, I did not hear anything but positive remarks and wanted to show appreciation to the hotel and group sales staff for easing part of my wedding planning stress.

<Content>Good value and quiet rooms We visit New Orleans each May. This was our first stay at the Hilton Garden Inn and it won't be the last. The staff was very friendly. The room was large by New Orleans standards and was in great shape. It was cleaned completely each day. The room had a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, iron, ironing board, and free high speed internet access. Though the hotel was fully booked, we did not hear a sound in our room and there was never a delay for an elevator. A small, but nice pool is located on the roof. The French Quarter is only a block and a half away. If this hotel were in the Quarter, you'd pay twice as much, so a short walk did not bother us. A room key is required to take the elevator to any floor except the lobby. We never felt unsafe. There was no evidence of damage caused by Hurricane Katrina.

<Content>Post Katrina With extreme trepidation we attended our first Mardi Gras. The Hilton Garden was an excellant choice for our stay. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, everything works! Close to the parade routes on St. Charles, only a few blocks from the French Quarter, and a 10 minute walk to the Casino. The in house breakfast is a hearty buffet of eggs, meat, home fries, and of course grits. They make a terrific omlet too! The rates were very reasonable, we paid $100+ less than comparable hotels. Book early! This may sound like a commercial, but we were very pleased. Drawbacks? There is NO curb appeal, the front door spills out onto narrow Gravier street, there are some empty store fronts across the street due to the hurricane. There is a convieniece store 50ft from the door open 24 hrs. and has GREAT fried chicken  cold beer. VERY satisfied.

<Content>Wonderful place This place was absolutely wonderful. The rate was much less than other neighoring establishments and I got a great room too! The Internet connection was lightning quick, the beds were so soft, and the bathroom made it feel like home. Also, it is within easy walking distance to the French Quarter. I stayed here two weeks before Katrina hit, so I hope it's still in the great condition it was before the hurricane.

<Content>Wonderful Room/Wonderful Service I stayed two nights at this location (8/6 - 8/7) before leaving on a cruise. This was right before Hurricane Katrina. I don't know when the hotel will be open again-they aren't taking reservations right now. But when it opens again I would recommend it highly. Our stay there was a delight. Our room was beautiful with excellent amenities. The front desk staff were professional, helpful and very friendly. When our air conditioner malfunctioned the hotel engineer tried to fix it and when he couldn't we were immediately moved to a mini-suite. When we checked out the parking valet gave us his cell phone number in case we got lost on the way to the cruise dock. The view from the pool deck on the roof couldn't be beat. I hope that everyone connected with the hotel is safe and that this Hilton will be back in business soon.

<Content>Great Hotel!!! I had searched the Internet, reviewing comments from Trip Advisor on different hotels in the New Orleans area for our recent trip from July 29, 2005 to August 3, 2005.I had actually booked another hotel, however, they was putting us in a smoking room for one night of our stay. This made me very uneasy because I am allergic to smoke!And, I ran upon the Hilton Garden Inn and read all the positive comments and booked it instead.This is a great hotel!! It is very clean and the reception area is very welcoming. We arrived on Firiday night. When the elevator opened on the 11th floor, it was so refreshing!The receptionist and front desk persons were very pleasant and they had a tray of cookies to welcome you.The rooms are large. I was a little worried because we had a king size bed (that was all they had when we made our reservations), but it was very very big and I did not brother my husband by tossing.The bathroom was very clean.You can easily walk to the French Quarter and places to eat.We rented a car( we had appointments) and decided to use the parking at the hotel $20 per day for convenience.The driving in New Orleans is very easy. The signs on the freeway are in large letters. For example, if the directions to get off on 239 B, the signs are well labeled. We did not have any problems getting to our various appointments.The staff at the Hilton Garden Inn very friendly, helpful and willing to give you assistance.I will stay at this hotel the next time I am in New Orleans!

<Content>Loved this hotel We stayed at this hotel for a conference that was being held at the convention center. I was so impressed with the cleanliness and kindness of the hotel staff. It was very close to Burbon Street, within walking. If you wanted to go to other places in New Orleans, the friendly staff always called me a cab. It was also very quiet. When I was in the room, I couldn't hear anything going on in the hallway. I had a very nice stay for a very good price. I would stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel for the money Just opened in Sept. 04. Great overall, including the restaurant (open for breakfast and lunch). A block and a half from Bourbon (around the corner from the Hampton) - safe, even at night for 2 women. However, as in any city, keep your eyes open, and stay alert.Beautiful, spacious room (no view), loved the rooftop pool (though small) with a great city view. They have a small bar in the lobby (which is on the 11th floor - parking garage is underneath) and a fitness center. There are also some nice, reasonable places to eat within a block (if you're in a hurry and tired of the overpriced places in the Quarter).Be aware that parking is $20 a day (and there are multiple taxes on EVERYTHING). Also be aware: there is a penalty fee if you leave earlier than what you had reserved. We got in one night earlier (and actually paid $20 less for that night) and had to leave a night earlier than we planned (and found out later that they had billed us for a penalty fee - the price of the room - for our early departure). When I called to complain, the Weekend Mgr. said that it described the early departure fee on the registration form I had signed (which of course no one had pointed out either when we checked in or out). I would say the biggest problem we had was with the Registration desk and some of the mix-ups that occurred, including not getting our room cleaned the first day, and not showing that we had checked out. Just check everything carefully (checking in and out), so you won't have any surprises.

<Content>Underpriced and a Great Great place to stay in NO I was in town for a convention and all the official convention hotels were filled up. I found a rate of $79/night for this hotel and decided to try it, knowing very well that $79 is likely to purchase nothing more than mediocrity.I was pleasantly surprised. The service is outstanding (and their staff are very very courteous and knowledgable - beyond what you would expect for a hotel of this price). Customer service is very responsive. For example, when I checked into my room, the air conditioning was not working. I called down and they said engineering will be right up. Not expecting them to come for at least a half hour (or more, like most major hotels), I was getting ready to take a shower. They knocked on my door within 5 minutes of my getting of the phone with the front desk. The front desk staff gave me a new room and provided a bellman within 3 minutes to move my stuff to another room.Now, I would certainly expect this from a corporate or luxury hotel (and they often don't even deliver). I was very surprised to get this type of service from a Hilton Garden Inn at such a low price.The rooftop pool is about the size of a 2 king beds side to side. Still, the rooftop pool and deck ofter a fabulous view of the city and river.The hotel is 2 blocks from Bourbon Street, yet in a safe and remarkably quiet area that is free of straggling drunkards at 2 am.The rooms were nice and adequately furnished - free 10baseT T1 internet connection (with free copying, printing and faxing from the business center). Beds come as one king or two fulls. Rooms are large. There is a separate disk. The room was tidy and the room service was more meticulous than what I've experienced at places like the Four Seasons and Ritz.The limitation of the hotel is that it lacks opulence or charm. While the rooms are tidy and nice, the quality of the fixtures and trim is adeuate. For example, there is grouted tile on the floor of the bathroom and no marble. The window fixtures are a very ugly industrial steel. The hotel is in a corporate building, with the hotel lobby is on the 11th floor (although it does have a bad, lounge, and restaurant.). That's why it is a Hilton Gardenn Inn.So, if you're looking for an inexpensive place to stay for a few days, then I would recommend this. It is definitely underpriced for the value and I would say that it's a great deal for your money and you are certainly not taking any risks by budgeting down to this hotel. Choose this over a boutique hotel. Spend the money that you save by staying here on the good life in New Orleans.

<Content>Great value and location Just a couple block from Bourbon Street and all the French Quarter activities, this hotel is a great value. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Room was more than adequate - large, clean, and with all the amenities you would need. Would definitely recommend it.
