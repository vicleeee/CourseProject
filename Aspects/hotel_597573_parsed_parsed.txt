<Content>Aweful square pillows Hotel is very clean and well maintained in a quiet neighborhood and close to Montparnasse Station. However, you have to cut across the huge station or walk around it to get to the shops and restaurants. Better for those on business or want a quiet retreat. The bed is comfortable but what is very strange are the square pillows which are ok for kids but very uncomfortable for adults. These are OK as cushions but entirely inappropriate for a business class hotel. The shower and amenities are good and there is a nice flatscreen TV with CNN, BBC and movies on demand. The wireless broadband is fast but expensive. The breakfast is good and the reception staff are very polite, responsive and speak good English. Overall, ok but if comfortable pillows are important, this may not be your first choice.

<Content>Good value hotel for stay with kids Stayed here for long weekend. We had a good size family room, very clean, high standard room with good bathroom, toiletries, tea making facilities and fridge. We found it to be very good value for a family room in Paris. The location is good, in a quiet residential street close to Montparnasse station. If you arrive by Eurostar you can get the metro line 4 direct to Montparnasse from Gare du Nord. There is a lively theatre area very close by with some good value places to eat as well as more expensive brasseries. The metro is nearby, but we mostly used buses, which take you to the main tourist areas, and are easy to work out with clear information about routes, stops and times at every stop. You can get books of tickets from the machine in the metro station which can be used for both. The hotel service and staff were fine, except the breakfast on Sunday was dire, everyone arrived at once so we had to queue to be seated, all tables were full, and we had to queue for bread, toast and juice. They did knock it off the bill when we complained. Also beware of the drinks prices in the bar. We managed to spend about æ‹¢60 over three nights on a couple of drinks each.

<Content>Plesant Stay - Good Location My husband and I stayed at this hotel during the first leg of our honeymoon. The hotel is generally very nice - modern furniture and a rather contemporary look and feel. Upon check-in, the staff was very courteous and professional. We arrived shortly before the noon check-in, but were not allowed to check-in early. We were, however, allowed to leave our luggage in the locked side office until our room was ready, so we used the time to walk around the neighborhood and get acquainted with what was nearby (which is A LOT in terms of coffee shops, restaurants, and the mall - which is one of the 'Gallerie Lafayette' shopping centers).When we did check-in, we were given a room on the second floor which was pleasantly clean and presentable. Linens were plentiful and we were generally overall happy with the accomodation. Interestingly, the room had two separate bathroom areas. The first was the actual toilet room, which was immediately to the right upon entering the hotel room. The other, the bathing room (equipped with full shower, sink, and tub) was in the general vacinity of the bedroom area. Although we are not traditionally accustomed to this set-up, we assumed it to be characteristic of the hotels in Paris. Compared to other hotel room stays, we found the room to be on the smaller end in size, so the separation of the two bathroom areas was not all too bothersome. Our only negative observation - which we had read about in another review - was that the shower door did not close properly. It appeared as if it had not been properly installed. It was difficult to close at times and it leaked water out onto the bathroom floor. We did not dine in the hotel restaurant, but we did frequent the bar area and were pleased with the drink selection as well as the late-night appetizer/tapas menu. The bar staff was courteous and the environment friendly. We did have breakfast in the restaurant area on our second day; however, we did not particularly care for our experience or the selection of food. In researching our stay at this hotel, we were aware that many of the guests are on business-related trips, as the hotel is in a financial/business district. As such, most of the quests staying at the hotel were on business, but we did find other guests traveling on vacation, as well as families with small children. In any case, upon coming down for breakfast on the second morning, we waited in line as the maitre d' seated guests in the restaurant area. Our turn came up in line, but rather than seating us, the maitre d' turned to a number of guests to our right and sat them beforehand. These folks were clearly dressed in business attire whereas my husband and I were more dressed down. I mentioned to the maitre d' that I didn't think it was very courteous of him to have seated others before us when we had clearly been waiting in line. He said he understood my concern, but then added that there was no need to make an issue of it. I thought otherwise, and later mentioned the incident at the front desk. The receptionist was very understanding and apologetic and offered to remove the charges for breakfast. She even made a point to say that the hotel treats all guests the same, whether they are on business or not. As for the breakfast, we were not entirely impressed with the selection and would highly recommend stopping at one of the many creperies or coffee shops in Paris as the selection tends to be plentiful and more characteristic of Paris. Lastly worth mentioning is that, one of the best features of this hotel is that it is located right next to the Gare Montparnesse which has easy train and metro access. Literally, almost every metro line can be picked up here. We were comforted in knowing how easy it was to travel about Paris and how accessible we were to this main hub. It definitely gave us a good feeling in knowing that we could get anywhere we needed to go in the city, without having to be directly in the center of Paris. If we were to return to Paris, we would highly consider staying at this hotel again. The accomodations were pleasing and the location was very convenient. If you are looking to stay here, we recommend booking directly through the Novotel's website. There are several promotions (City Breaks, Early Booking) which apply to certain Novotel hotels - we booked early, but under a no change, no cancellation promotion - and were able to get a great rate.

<Content>Mixed Feelings about the Novotel Montparnasse My wife and I, together with our 2 year old daughter, stayed at this hotel on two seperate occasions each of one night in late September and early October (on the way to and from a holiday in the south of France).I booked the hotel via their website and ordered a cot for our daughter. My booking this hotel was based on reading good reviews from other visitors.On arrival our impressions were mixed. The location is reasonable, but even though it is close to the departure end of Montparnasse SNCF station, the metro is a very lengthy 20 minute walk from the hotel through a packed station. Also, it is not on the RER line so travel across Paris to Gare du Nord can take about half an hour, not including the walk from hotel to metro.The receptionist was very much the pushy salesman, buttering us up by offering our daughter a cuddly toy and then giving her two (even though he gave two to every child!), then pushing their loyalty card on us with a big sales pitch about it all. It took ages to just check in and get to our room when we were all very tired.On both occasions there was no cot in the room and none forthcoming when asked, despite having booked this in advance.The website gave the impression that the hotel was very child friendly and that there was a play area in the hotel for young children, however, there was no such play area.The room was small with not that much storage space for clothes, but luckily we were only staying one night.We were told on the website that there was unlimited tea and coffee, but found in the room just one sachet of coffee and one very small sachet of milk, not even enough for one person to have one drink! Also, the cups were two of the most revolting plastic containers I've ever seen; I didn't even realise they were cups at first! Not what one expects from this class of hotel, especially as staying in a Mercure (supposedly a lower class of hotel) in Calais the night before we had a lot of coffee sachets and very nice real mugs.The Novotel also had no minibar, just a small bottle of water in the fridge.There was WIFI in the room but a payable service. There was a terminal in the lobby that was free to use for twenty minutes at a time.The one good thing about the hotel was the breakfast, which was varied, with cereals, fruit, cold meat, bacon, eggs and sausage etc., although no better than any other hotel we've stayed in. It did cost 16 euros each though!All in all we were not that impressed and won't stay there again, or in a Novotel. It just wasn't up to the standards one would expect from that class of hotel charging the high rate we paid for each night. There are also better located hotels nearer the RER lines as well as the metro if you want to enjoy Paris and get round quickly. The location was fine for us as we were travelling from Montparnasse SNCF station the next morning.All in all, mixed feelings and not as great for families as other reviews make out.

<Content>Great location, good family hotel I stayed at the Novotel Montparnasse in Paris with my family during a trip at the end of August 2008. First things first, great location, great location and great location. Right next to Montparnasse station which is one of the main hubs on the metro. Several routes on the METRO pass through Montparnasse enabling you to get to various places without changing trains. The Montparnasse area other wise is extremely nice with many cafes and restaurants dotting the area. The hotel staff especially the reception are friendly and helpful. Rooms are moderate sized and our rooms had a separate sofa cum bed for my 9 year old daugher. Bathrooms are somewhat small with the toilet being separated from the bathroom, a new one for me. A flat screen TV and a well stocked tea and coffee making service are nice touches. The hotel facilities look well maintained and new. A free internet facility in the lobby is a great additional facilities should you need an urgent dekko. The breakfast range is quite good and can be considered superior to what one is used to at many european hotels. Reasonable options for veggies including a comprehensive range of muesli, corn flakes, flavoured yoghurt and the like, besides breads, and croissants, fruits et al. For all Indians, several decent joints serving Indian veg and non veg food. Try the Etoile Kashmir on Boulevard Du Montparnasse about a 7-8 minute walk from the hotel.

<Content>A really nice hotel in paris, VERY pleased We had a really SUPER stay at this hotel recently whilst in paris, Booking in advance saved us money (if you pre pay then it gives you terms and conditions, if you don't like them then don't book in this way....another reviewer says not to do this but it's your choice at the end of the day, we had no problem), it is VERY clean and modern, the staff speak excellent english and even gave our kids complimentary cuddly toys which they were obviously pleased at, a really nice touch. The room was lovely and the kids fold out beds were ideal for them as they're just kids and that's what they're designed for, there was a mini fridge and safe and TV / internet etc. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment but it's location is a 20 min walk to the eiffel tower which can be seen from 50yds from the hotel, the GARE MONTPARNASSE (Main railway station)and metro is about 100 metres away unless you choose PASTEUR metro stop which is a 5 to 10 min stroll which is fine for kids too. We really had no complaint at all with this hotel. They even allowed late check out without any quibble and we'd definetly stay again if we needed to visit paris again.The only minor thing I could pick them up on is we gave them 3 bits of luggage and only received 1 tag which I questioned, when returning our luggage was all still there so no problems but i suppose it could of been had a bag disappeared, however, that said if that's all I can complain about then I'm happy !!!, this was a really nice find in paris. If you like modern hotels then you'll love it, if not then look for an old hotel, we'd definetly return.

<Content>Recommended - Applause! My wife and I stayed here for Christmas and New Years! We didn't come to realize until the second day that the location is in fact very close to one of the HUB train stations. Cool!The hotel alone has a modern ambiance to it. The lobby is a bit basic though functional. They even have luggage storage for those checking in way too early like we did. The room was really nice. It was very clean, equipped with all necessities any vacationer would ask for (i.e. TV, Refrigerator, Closet, etc..) . More than we expected really! My wife even loved it! The bathroom was awesome. We had a huge bed which was not expected considering we were in Paris...again, *applause*In comparisson to other hotels within the vicinity, this one is competitively priced. I give an A++ for cleanliness no doubt. The location puts you in a quiet area but yet easily accessible. It's in the mid-point of almost all spots you would want to see when you're in Paris. Like almost everything else there, you'll need to exercise your legs since you'll be walking alot. Familiarize yourself with the map and you'll see.There was one female staff member who was not as friendly as the others but I guess it was due to being in the night shift. Anywayz, I'm not letting this one turn me down since overall, we had a marvelous experience in Paris. Thank you!

<Content>Good location - not disappointed We (2 adults, 1 child) stayed at this hotel btw 14th and 19th July.Location is very good and easy to go to Metro with a 10 minute walk (either on the street or in the back end adjacent to hotel).Room is small (we knew about it after reading thru reviews here) as expected but is clean. It meets our budget  expectation.

<Content>Great stay! Had a great stay here. My husband and I arrived late afternoon and we were just about to ask if any rooms had a view of the Eiffel Tower when the receptionist said he was looking for a room with a view for us.We were given a room on the 7th floor and had not only a great view of the Eiffel Tower, but also our own private balcony (only available on 7th floor rooms). We'd also managed to arrive on Bastille Day so we enjoyed a wonderful firework display that night from the comfort of our own balcony.The room was appointed well - just enough storage space for 2. The bathroom had a walk in shower - no bath, but that wasn't a problem. The shower pressure was good with the usual toiletries (shampoo, body lotion, body wash).The bed was comfortable but as seems to be usual practice in some European hotels, the pillows were rubbish!!We managed to get a good early rate deal from Novotel's website for this trip which included breakfast. There was a selection of hot and cold self serve buffet food, but I don't think it warranted the individual breakfast price for those who wish to pay extra.The location was good - very quiet. After a couple of days we figured out which railway station exit to use - head for the Port Oceane exit followed by the signs for Vaugirard 3 - this exit brings you out 50 yards from the hotel. Alternatively, the elusive 'back way' from the railway station at Vaugirard opens directly onto the back door of the hotel - great if you can find it.Overall this hotel was very good - would definitely stay here again. Even more worth it if you can get a good deal!!

<Content>If confort and charm is what you desire, Keep looking! You can do better! The staff was VERY helpful and friendly. I give them an applause! The lobby was basic but nice enough. The family size rooms (rooms for 3 or 4 guests) left much to be desired (I give it only 2 stars by US standards). It had one large bed (probably queen size) that felt like a fold out bed mattress and it had a sofa that pulled out to either one or two twin size cot beds that were very thin in which one could feel the springs. The room was very plain and small. Nothing cute, charming or comfortable. Just a basic place to sleep and rest your weary body after long days touring Paris. If no frills, plain and basic, clean is what you desire, then this could be the place for you. It was clean. However, the carpets were spotted. Sheets were clean and shower was clean. If I had to do it all over again, I would not stay here. I beleive if you look hard and ask around, you could find a nice boutique hotel with some character for either the same rate or slightly more. You might have to forfeit breakfast included though. The breakfast that came with this room was quite nice - lots of rolls, jams, butter, coffee/tea/cocao. Another downfall in my opionon is that from this hotel, it always required a Metro ride to get to where you want/need to go. Not a long one, but still a ride. The immediate area around the hotel was very blah. As you head toward the Metro station, there are some decent restaurants and a better neighborhood. My questions is, why not stay someplace that you can walk out of your hotel and stroll immediately down quaint nice streets with the charming Paris feeling? It takes some shopping around to find it though, I guess. If I had to do it over again, knowing what I know, I would Google nice hotels in the MontMartre area. I saw some really cute ones while strolling the streets.if you do stay at this Novotel hotel and you have two people, ask for room 712. We had that for one of the 3 nights we stayed at the hotel and it was GREAT compared to the family size rooms. Had a nice and sizeable balcony that looked at the Eifel Tower. This night in this room redeemed the hotel from a great disappointment to something other than that. If we had that room the entire stay, it would have probably been worth staying there. I do think that this is the best room in the entire hotel. The room on either side of this one did not have a view of the Eifel tower as far as I could tell.One tip that I learned on this Europe Tour: DO NOT BE TEMPTED BY PREPAYING YOUR HOTEL TO GET A GOOD RATE. IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO CANCEL OR CHANGE YOUR RESERVATION. IT'S WORTH THE RISK TO TAKE A SLIGHTLY HIGHER RATE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CANCEL IF YOU ARE NOT THRILLED WITH YOUR CHOICE ONCE YOU GET THERE!

<Content>Ok Experience Is is a brand new hotel, very modern and clean. The room was very small for 2 adults and 2 children.We had some problems :1) The hotel is very far from the metro station. It takes about 15 minutes. My children (age 6 and 8) got really tired walking.2) Novotel is a family friendly hotel but the employee at the reception was very rude to my kids.3) The food was really bad, I had a chicken sandwich and felt sick, I could not sleep the whole night.4) The cleaning lady got very mad when we left the room late. She knocked at the door and started screaming.5) I asked for a taxi on the last day and the recepcionist made a mistake and I almost lost my flight to England. I went back to the recepcion for help and he was really unpolite.6) They charged us breakfast for the 7 days we spent there. I had to ask to remove it from the bill. I saw other guests complaining about that too.

<Content>Friendly staff- excellent location We booked our hotel through Eurostar.Excellent location, but Montparnasse station has many entrances so make sure you find the easiest one to exit aim for BD de Vaugirard or pasteur station. There is also an exit out the back of the station but i could never find it.The room was large with airconditioning, fridge, shower and bath. The staff were friendly and very helpful. There is also a baggage store if you need it. The Hotel is located next to Tour Montparnasse which is a must do!!! especially at night. last admission around 11pm. overall: An excellent place to stay.

<Content>Nice, clean. The hotel was near Gare Montparnasse. There were 60 kids in a school band and they were in and out of the elevators all day. A few times, the elevator was blocked and they would ride up and down. While they were reasonably quiet, their last night, they knocked on doors and called rooms to say goodbye. Nice idea but not after midnight.Food was expensive.Most important, the hotel was clean.We would go back.

<Content>Excellent value in the Montparnasse area This is one of the brand new Novotel properties, with excellent accomodation (queen bed + a sofa bed which converts to 2 single beds, very clever!), separate shower and bathtub. We had 2 rooms, largely comfortable for 2 parents + 3 kids but we could have accomodated 8 in total!A little skimpy on the storage, but excellent desk with internet access, nice size flat screen TV, and a mini-fridge tea-coffee making facilities. Very rare: the fridge is actually intended for guests to keep their own food/drink!! (there is a snack shop downstairs, also a mac with free internet)We asked for connecting rooms (which we got).Excellent full breakfast buffet included in our rate (129EUR/room per night), and because children eat free when sharing parents room, it's a very very good deal for families.The only drawback is that the hotel is in the rear side of the Montparnasse train station, but that makes it quieter too. Several restaurants and supermarkets within walking distance, bus/metro as well.We were leaving on the Sunday and were able to get a late checkout (3 pm ) without any problems.

<Content>Security Issue. My husband and I recently stayed four nights at Novotel Paris Gare Montparnasse. We arrived in from CDG and were advised by the hotel to take the Air France shuttle which cost 15Euro per person single journey to Montparnasse Gare. The walk from the bus stop to the hotel was an easy stroll of 10 minutes.We arrived at the hotel at 11am and the receptionist was very helpful and we were checked into our room straight away. The hotel is modern but basic and we were pleasantly surprised with the size of our room and bathroom, although there was very little wardrope space, it was prefectly exceptable. We did not hear any noise from our neighbours and the airconditioning was adequate as were the tea and coffee making facitlies and small fridge. Our only compaint was that on our last day we returned to our hotel room to discover that our room had been searched, although nothing had been taken. We reported this to the hotel manger who informed us that it was hotel policy to do random searches by the security officer. This did spoil our stay and we wouldnt stay at the Novotel again only because of this reason.

<Content>Safe and modern We stayed 4 nights at this hotel (2 adults 1 child). It is quite modern (opened in 2006), very clean, rooms are the usual novotel style, located a 100 meters away from the Gare du Montparnasse, where you get the Subway, buses, taxis ... Breackfast is a bit crowdy, but if you get there around 8 am you will have no problem at all. There's a small but friendly fitness room with 4 machines at the 7th floor. The hotel is really safe, they have permanent staff around just to assure everything is fine. Staff very friendly and efficient.If you book through accor.com 4 or 5 monthes in advance, you get a 99 Euro rate with breackfast included.

<Content>great value great location My family (husband/2 children 12  13) have just returned from Paris where we had a very enjoyable time.I booked this hotel two months ago and got a great deal which was non refundable,The hotel was very clean and the staff very helpfull.Our room and bathroom were spotless and the fridge and safe were a bonus. The bed and bed settee were comfortable but the pillows were more like cushions and not good if you a neck problem as my husband does. The only real downside of the room was the size and we had to keep it very tidy or risk falling over bags etc.We found the hotel very central to all the major sights and we were able to walk to all of them but bring a map or even a sat nav which is what we will do the next time we visit.If you are going to Eurodisney you get the Metro at Pasteur which is a 5 to 10 min walk get off at Nation where you get the RER to Marne la Vallee where Disney is,We paid E140.00 for a return taxi from Charles de Gaulle and E100.00 for the return tkts to Disney but Im sure there is a cheaper way to travel we just went for convienence.

<Content>Brilliant My friend and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in February 2008. This hotel is modern, comfortable and clean. I am the sort of person who is extremely fussy about having things clean and hygenic and I was amazed that I was really happy with our hotel room. The room was a very good size - lots of room to walk around. The bathroom had a bath and separate shower - both of which worked very well and were clean. The maids that tidied the rooms did their job brilliantly. The hotel is about 3 minutes walk away from Pasteur metro station.The only bad thing about this restaurant was the hotel restaurant. I would have to say that I have never eaten anything so disgusting in my life. I would never eat there again. For food, we found it better to eat a lot a lunchtime and just buy baguettes and pastries for dinner - but that's just me. I would recommend a cafe called 'Le 234 Tuilleries' near Tuilleries metro. The service and food was excellent.One thing to bear in mind ... the rooms use the two-pin plugs (but not the standard ones that you can buy in the UK - the plug sockets have holes for two pins and a bit that sticks out and locks into the plug itself). You can borrow a plug from reception but they charge you 20 euros for every use.All in all, a brilliant place to stay, and I hope other hotels can live up to this standard.

<Content>Very Slick Coviniently located next to the Monparnasse tube station, the hotel has very slick and mordern rooms equipped with a TV through which you can surf the net and see pay per view ... nice comfortable beds and a nice bathroom with lots of stuff ... Slightly on the expensive side though. If u walk down a few steps from the hotel towards the main street, u can see the eiffel tower on your left :)

<Content>Good Choice for Families Nice hotel that is close to two Metro stations and its only 4-5 stops to most of the major tourist spots. Our two little kids were able to tolerate the walk to the stations no problem. While the Pasteur station seemed closer, there is a good breakfast spot along the walk to the Montparnasse stop. It is called Toast and Pasta and is at 48 Blvd de Vanguard. There are green tables out front and it is open from 10am-7pm. The couple that own the resturant are very nice, the food is good, and the prices are resonable. The hotel is clean. The staff is friendly. It is not a fancy hotel by any means, but it is safe, clean, and family freindly. Very good value. We got back to the hotel late one night and the neighborhood seemed very safe even late at night.

<Content>Good novotel Good hotel, pretty standard novotel property (which in my experience are usually good). The location is good for getting around with a couple of metro stops nearby. We booked directly through the novotel website where they have good deals if you book in advance.We flew into Charles de Gaulle and caught the air france bus to nearby montparnasse train station which saved a bundle of csh compred to getting a taxi and was much less hassle than going on the metro with suitcases!! There's info on this in the forums on this site.For a special meal I'd recommend a visiting ciel de paris which is on the 56th floor of the montparnasse tower, and provides spectacular views of the city, particularly the eiffel tower. Not a cheap meal by any means but a great experience! This is in walking distance of the hotel. Alternativel you can just go to the bar in the restaurant for a cocktail.

<Content>Familly weekend My husband, step-daughter and I just came back from a 2 night stay at the Novotel Montparnasse. We stayed at a superior room, booked directly through the hotel website. We had a very enjoyable stay. The hotel is well located, close to metro and train station and walking distance to main attractions. The room is big enough one king size bed and 1 sofa bed that has room for two. Small bathroom with shower and bath, and separate toilet. All you need is there. Breakfast was included, very varied, everything for everyione. Staff at reception very helpful, good tips for eating out. Just a nice, clean and well located hotel at a very good price. Eating in for dinner is actually expensive for what you get, but it's ok.

<Content>Superbe!!! My daughter, my wife and I stayed at Novotel for 6 nights and I could not wait to writte my comments on the web.Location: Near La Gare montparnasse which is a main train station and in a quiet street (very peacefull).Accomodation: Very clean, with a new design and spacious. Personnel: Friendly. I even called one of them ''Man of solution'' since was there every time I needed some helps or information.Facilities: Parking very well protected with a good rate for a long stay.Restaurant: We went to the restaurant once and were suprised that it was cheaper (main course + desert) than some restaurants in the area.Rate: I booked the reservation via the web and for all the pleasure I had to stay there, I would say that the price was reasonnable. However it was christmas Period and Paris is empty (people go to la ''Campagne'') and hotel prices are decreased.

<Content>Lovely hotel My wife and I spent three nights in this excellent hotel on a recent trip to the city and I have nothing but compliments for the modern, well appointed accomodation, friendly staff and the area in which the establishment is situated.It sits in a quiet street and is an easy 5 minutes walk from the Gare Montparnasse and from the adjacent Air France shuttle bus arrival point from GDG and Orly airports. Montparnasse is a safe area with an abundance of shops, restaurants, cinemas, bars etc and the nearby Metro stations allow fast access to all the sights in Paris.Paris is a beautiful city to visit at any time (especially when lit up at night in the run up to Christmas) and this hotel provides a great base to experience a great city.

<Content>Good, but overhyped This is a good hotel, but a lot of the reviews here are over the top. Aside from the bathroom, I could see little reason for the extreme excitement in some of the posts. There are definitely better located hotels in Paris for around the same price. Most things were good - staff efficient, if a little bit unenthusiastic. Room service meal was ok. Cleanliness was good, but walls in my room were a bit scuffed. Generally a hassle free stay, if not quite the Nirvana suggested by some reviewers.

<Content>Modern  This hotel exceeded our expectations as it was new, friendly, and comfortable. It was the best value we got while we were in Europe. It is also walking distance to the main station- Montparnasse which has trains that go to all of Paris and also to Versailles. The Pasteur stop is also close by and about a 5 min stroll.

<Content>Excelllent location for visiting the sights We stayed for 3 nights at this Novotel. We drove to Paris from the UK and chose this hotel for its underground parking and proximity to the metro station. Parking was charged at 15 euros per day but gave us complete peace of mind and the cark park had a lift directly to the hotel reception. We are a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 children aged 6  9. The man at reception who checked us in was most helpful. His English was great but he took the time to help us along with our very basic French which the kids enjoyed.We had booked a family room which had a large king size bed and a double sofa bed. The rooms were very spacious and looked like they had been recently refurbed. Breakfast was included in our rate. It consisted of the usual continental bits as well as bacon, sausages and some rather runny eggs. I wouldn't recommend the breakfast hot stuff but the continental was pretty good. The hotel has room service which we used on our first night. Service was fast and the food of a good standard although a little pricey. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the Pasteur metro station. Pasteur is only 5 stops from the Eiffel Tower. We used the metro to get around to all the Paris attractions. I would recommend buying a carnet (10 tickets). Each ticket is a one way journey to wherever you want to go and do not have to be used up in one day. The cost was 11 euros for 10 adult tickets and half of that for the kids carnet. All in all, we couldn't fault this place. For the price you are getting a very good hotel, close to the tube with a very good car park. Would definitely visit again.

<Content>Clean and modern No problems with room at all - nice, new, modern and clean. Location handy to train station/metro. Stayed for 3 nights and were booked into disabled room for first night but advised we could move the next day if we wished, but we didn't bother. Note though that this means there is no shower door and whole bathroom floor floods.We were lucky with our tarrif as booked months in advance and essentually paid 80 odd Euro a night.Service patchy - not sure if something gets 'lost in translation' as was snapped at by reception lady to hurry up as she was busy! Sorry - I guess I was only the customer!A tip for breakfast to opt for the croissants, fruit and juice etc at the bar for around 6 Euros instead of the more expensive buffet breakfast if money an issue. Dinner was very much on the expensive side but OK.

<Content>Great Hotel, Location, Price and Value We arrived at Orly Airport went to the Information Booth and asked for transport to Montparnasse. Clear instructions were given to the Air France Bus. It cost 14 euros return and took about 30 minutes.The Bus dropped us at the Montparnasse bus station. Asked for directions to the hotel which was about 1/2 a mile away up a slight hill. We found it right away and dropped our bags off and went back into the main town for breakfast for 7 euros each.We were able to gain access to the room at noon. We were on the 7th floor. The room was fantastic, quiet, and the fridge was useful for cool drinks. The Hotel is on the edge of Paris but the cost is a lot less than paying for city-centre hotels. It is only 4 stops or so from the Eff Tower.We actually walked into Paris and back on the first day. It is about 2 to 3 miles but flat and almost one continuous road to the the Tower.We bought at 3-day metro pass which cost 55 euros for 3 of us.We also went on the red hop-on/hop off tour bus for a 2 day pass and cruise on the river for 79 euros for the 3 of us. We went up the tower which was 4 euros each to walk up the stairs. I am not that healthy, overweight and nearly 50 but I made it up the almost 700 steps with a feeling of achievement. You can then get the lift to the 3rd floor but the queues were excessive. Of course you can take the lift up to all 3 floors for 12 euros eachWith the Metro ticket you can get a 35% discount off the price of the Montparnasse Tower. This reduced it to 6 euros. This is well worth it to get a different perspective on Paris. Be sure to go on the 59th Floor Terrace for open views across the city.Eating out can be expensive but part of the challenge is to find value for money restaurants. Ask the Parisans, I found them very polite and most helpful. I speak no french at all but an appealing/lost puppy look gets you a lot of help.Overall, our first time in Paris was super.

<Content>Great hotel Great hotel. Good location - about 5-10 minute walk to the mainline station Gare Montparnase and Metro station. Hotel was clean and comfortable. Lots of space and the staff were helpful. Lots of brasseries and cafes nearby so we opted not to eat breakfast at the hotel which was pretty expensive. Worth going up the Tour Montparnasse while you're staying in ths area to get some great views of the City - better than going up the Eiffel Tower - as you can get a view of the Eiffel Tower from the Montparnasse building.

<Content>great hotel great location to gare montparnasse--we had to catch a train from paris to bordeaux at gare montparnasse which was only a 10min walk to hotel with luggage..no subway needed.hotel is very new and clean..our room had 1 double bed and a double sofa bed for our son..great sized beds for europe.washroom is a little small but everything is new and modern so no complaints...the duvet for the bed is wonderfully comfortable but the sofa bed had just a regular blanket...we asked for a duvet for the sofa bed but they said they only have enough for beds so we couldn't get one.little fridge in room was great for buying our own beer and pop..they even gave us 1 bottle of free h20 everyday. there was also a coffee machine with coffee and tea complimentary.safe in our room was handy as well.there are 2 metro stops nearby--pasteur and montparnasse bienvenue...both need a 5 to 10min walk --not bad at all...there is even a small supermarche--leaderprice--5 mins away from hotel and a few little restaurants nearby...quite neighborhood which we liked..felt safe...my son rented their electric bike for half a day for 15 euros because the 1 euro paris city bikes take only international visa cards and cards from canada didn't work in the machine.we didn't have breakfast at the hotel because 16euros is expensive...we walked over to the train station--gare montp, andfound ourselves coffee shops and q quick (like a mcdonalds).if you like new and modern hotel, then this one is for you...we enjoyed our stay at the novotel even more than at sofitel bordeaux which was a high calibre hotel...we will definitely return to the novotel gare montparnasse....

<Content>An Affordable Hotel with the City Breaks option My wife and I are in our 40s, middle class, live in Canada and most often are used to staying in a North American Best Western motel. This is our third time in Paris. We booked this hotel months in advance for five nights and selected the City Breaks Rate which required payment up front (no refunds) and also included breakfast. This rate provided significant savings over other pricing options and made this hotel more affordable.The hotel appears to be relatively new, and next to railway tracks. However, we never heard any noise from the trains nor much road traffic since the hotel is on a quiet street. Grocery stores and restaurants are in the neighborhood, and catching the train to Chartres for a day trip was easy.The rooms were clean and air conditioned. We liked the separation of the toilet from the rest of the bathroom, and appreciated the shower and full bath. The queen-sized bed was firm but not hard. The room also included a small fridge, which is rare in many European hotel in this price range. Breakfast included a hot option: bacon, scrambled eggs, and sausages, plus an assortment of breads, cheeses, fruits, yogurts, juices, and cereals. Service was polite and efficient. Speaking English was not a problem.I agree with other reviewers that the hotel does require a fairly long walk to the nearest Metro stations. Furthermore, it requires a short but not steep uphill climb, but nothing like the steps of Montmarte.The hotel lacks the charme and the atmosphere of the older hotels (and their neighborhoods) that we have stayed in, but makes up for it with its cleanliness, breakfast, and quiet location. If walking is a problem you'll want to consider a more central location nearer the river and major sites. We recommend this hotel and, if available, would encourage you to investigate the City Breaks option.

<Content>Good, clean modern hotel Stayed here 27-30 Jul 07. Booked via Eurostar. Very nice clean modern hotel. Nice rooms and bathroom, bedding changed daily. Helpful staff. We were on 8th floor. As mentioned by previous reviewer, the huge window opened wide into the room with no security for children, we felt you could easily fall out! Room key needed to operate lift from ground floor, good security measure, but would of been helpful if reception had told us this was needed to operate the lift!Location a little bit out of town for sights and a little walk from the metro. Would stay here again, but maybe another novotel a little nearer main attractions. Didnt try the restaurant due to previous reviews, although it looked very nice. Some very good places to eat and drink nearby.

<Content>Nice hotel, not the easiest location Our room was very comfortable, clean and bright. It was bright because of the very large window which opened fully which we thought was very dangerous especially for young children and that we were on the 7th floor!!It is a very long way from the station which has no escalators!! We later found that you can get 2 buses from Gare de Nord and the change is at The Louvre.We thought the price of breakfast was excessive at éˆ§?6 so ate a a cafe nearby for only éˆ§? each.Overall we would stay at another Novotel but not this one only because of the location.

<Content>Bureaucracy gone crazy Because of an oversight, using the Novotel website, I accidently booked my room for the WRONG NIGHT, and the hotel refused to refund my money, because the room I had booked was the cheapest (non-changes or refunds) rate!This shows that this hotel has no respect for its customers! Because of a simple technicality, I am penalized about 160.00 Canadian dollars!Therefore, I urge everyone not to use this hotel. They do not respect their customers, and they have lost my business for good. A hotel of this one's standing would have simply made an exception in my case and would have refunded my money.To be fair, however, I have no doubt that this hotel, had I actually stayed at it, would have been of first-rate quality, but does not what they have done to me, a poor student student hoping for just a little indulgence, mean that they deservedly ought to lose a few customers? I should think so!There are plenty of other fine-quality hotels in Paris; in the future, they will get my business.

<Content>Average with a Bad Smell We stayed at this Novotel at the start of July 2007 with friends. We chose this hotel as we figured that it was new so how bad could it be?We stayed on the 6th floor which I DO NOT recommend. There is a very weird and musty smell on that floor, like it was flooded at some point and is now growing a kind of mould. They tried to cover up the smell with a strong smelling cleaner and I think that makes it worse.Also, the gym is on the 7th floor so in the morning you can hear constant banging noises from people running on the treadmill.Our room was small, but larger than other European hotels we've stayed in. The room was designed very well to maximize space. Even though the hotel is only a year old, our room seemed about 5 years old, with our picture ripped from the wall and our curtains dirty and damaged. Some days the cleaning staff did a better job than previous days, and some days the only thing they did was make the bed.I found the bed to be average, but that the sheets were cheap and rough on the skin. They also did not use top sheets, so all you had was the duvet cover.This place is good if you're looking for a no frills kind of place.Breakfast is NOT included, and is 16 Euros, so we opted for faboulouscrepes from street vendors for 3 Euros.We likely would not stay here again.

<Content>Ok, but learn some French Nice Hotel, close to stations Pasteur  Montparnasse. Not very close to any good shops though, you'll have to walk back up to montparnasse for shops.It's also very hilly, so if you have walking problems or asthma, you may struggle.Staff were generally OK, but seemed to have limited English, so have a phrasebook ready. We were expected to speak French.Dinner in the restaurant was good, but not cheap  served quickly. Portions were average.Breakfast was 16 euros  very sparse - a roll, a croissant  a pain au chocolat each  some coffee  a small glass of juice.Rooms were clean, well sized  comfortable  also air conditioned  also had a good sized, well furnished, bathroom

<Content>Exceptionally helpful staff My husband and I took his sister to Paris for a few days to celebrate her fiftieth birthday. She is a person with a number of medical problems. On checking in her difficulties were explained to the staff at the reception desk. They provided her with a wonderful room with a balcony with a table two chairs and a lounger which had a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower. The modern decor, spacious bathroom, light quiet atmosphere were very relaxing. When she was quite seriously ill during the night before we were due to leave. The staff could not have been more helpful, kind and efficient. The following day they extended our time of departure to two p.m. and provided advice to get us to Gare du Nord promptly. Their service could not have been improved upon and was a considerable help.

<Content>Great stay at the Novotel I stayed at the Novotel Paris Gare Montparnasse in early April of 2007. The main reason I chose this hotel was because it's right next to the Gare Montparnasse train station. This trip was for work and I took the train to the suburbs each day. This hotel is a new hotel with a very modern design to it. Sometimes the design works other times it looked a little cheap. Very streamline and Euro looking. But I did like it. The hotel was extremely clean and very quiet. It had a small refrigerator, hair dryer, internet access (for a cost). What it didn't have was a clock or an iron. I never asked the front desk to see if I could get one. The bathroom was nicely done with a separate shower and large, deep tub. It had a small storage/closet place for your clothes. I booked this room with only 2 day notice and paid $220 a night. Seemed a little high but it is Paris. The lobby was nice and it had a cool bar area with a little restaurant off the lobby. The hotel is in a good area, about 1 mile east of the Eiffel Tower and a mile south of Notre Dame. With the train/subway all sites are easy to get to. This place is not your old charming Paris hotel like some picture but it is nice. I would definitely stay here again but would also entertain other options based on price.

<Content>Very impressed!! We have just returned from an excellent trip to Paris, really enjoyable! This hotel was superb - all the staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful and polite. The hotel itself is only a year old and so is very modern looking and fresh and clean. The rooms are a good size, with flat screen TV, internet access (wireless and on the TV - charged in 24 hour sessions), fridge, safe and tea and coffee making facilities. Air-con is a bonus too! It's also only a 5 minute walk from the metro station Pasteur, on line 6 and 12 - which is only 5 stops from the Eiffel Tower.We didn't eat at the hotel as we thought it was too expensive (16 euros for breakfast!) and tended to buy croissants etc from the local supermarkets.We followed the advise on this site and bought an orange carte, rather than the paris visite which is a lot cheaper if you're going for a few days (don't forget your passport photo). We spent a day at Disneyland which was great. There were queues for many of the rides, but the fastpass service is really good - and free! So try it if you're going! Also don't miss the Tarzan show!We booked about 3 months in advance, and got a 3 nights for the price of 2 deal, through expedia, which was a lot cheaper than the hotels website. Overall a great hotel, especially considering what we paid for it (around æ‹¢140 for 3 nights!)

<Content>Fantastic hotel Stayed at this hotel 8 April 2007 for 4 nights. Booked a double room for my parents (late sixties) and a triple room for my husband, me and our teenage daughter. My parents stayed in room 817 which gave them an uninterrupted view of the Eiffel Tower, which was an added bonus. The double rooms are massive by Paris standards and our triple room had a bathroom with a separate toilet. The beds are super king size and the most comfortable I've ever slept in away from home. The hotel is very modern and exceptionally clean. Toiletries were replenished every day and unless you left a leaflet on your bed each morning to say that you were happy to have the bed linen left on your bed from the night before the staff would change your bed each day!Breakfast was a delight and although we were told that it can get busy we never had to wait for a table. Perhaps this is because we ate at 8.00 am each day!The hotel isn't in the centre of Paris and you will need to walk for approx. 5-7 mins to the nearest Metro station (Pasteur) but the journey into the city centre is only about 10 mins. The hotel is based in a business district but is very quiet. The rooms are very well insulated and therefore noise was kept to a minimum.Overall, I would totally recommend a stay at this hotel. Book early to get yourself a good deal which includes breakfast.

<Content>Wonderful!! My husband and I stayed at this hotel and couldn't be more pleased. It can be quite intimidating not knowing how to speak french but the staff put our minds at ease and were extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and very roomy. Everyday we came back to a room that was cozy and clean. I would definitely stay here again. It's about 3 blocks away from the Metro (Pasteur stop-green line), within walking distance to the Eiffel Tower, and wonderful restaurants. WONDERFUL STAY!!

<Content>Worth another visit Stayed here for 3 nights and was impressed by the helpfulness of staff, the large pleasant room and high standards of cleanliness. Breakfast was more than adequate and not too crowded while Dinner was good on the 2 nights we ate in the restaurant. The service could have been better and the menu was a little uninspiring for Paris. The hotel is well placed for travel into the centre of Paris (best Metro is Pasteur) and there are several restaurants nearby. The best that we found was the Pot au Feu in Rue Pasteur, 300 yards away. A taxi back to Charles de Gaulle airport was 62 euros although this is better than travel via metro and RER, with luggage. All in all, a very pleasant hotel with a good rate of 98 euros per night, inc breakfast but no cancellation.

<Content>great room, convenient location We stayed at the novotel gare montparnasse over christmas. Loctaion wise the hotel was convenient. Though not near the main attractions, it has two metro stations within a 10 min walk so was easy to get around. The room was very good - lots of space good bathroom with separate shower and bath and also coffee tea making facilities. There is a sofa bed in the room so a double room can actually accomodate a family of 4. But the hotel restaurant is no good. We had dinner there the first night when we arrvived and it was tastelss.The reception staff were okay and spoke english. There were sevaral restaurants around but most were either closed over the holiday period or closed early in the evening. But one evening we walked further down about 15 minutes walking and came to the cinema. There are more cafes around there and also an excellent grill  bar. I think it was called Hippopotamus.The hotel itself is in a quite street but its safe to walk around and its 5 minutes away from the montparnasse station. There is also a shopping mall nearby.
