<Content>Nice little hotel Very small (think 1/2 the size of your average US hotel rooms) but clean. The best part of the hotel is its location. The hotel doesn't have a gym, but we were able to run to the Imperial Palace in under 5mins to do our morning loops around the Palace. Bed is comfortable (sheets are a little on the rough side, but after a day of walking around the city, you'll be too tired to notice it).

<Content>Ginza Fabulous! I booked 2 doubles for my husband and I/sister and boyfriend and 1 single for my Mom during our 3 days in Tokyo as part of our family vacation in late October 2008. We all LOVED the Hotel Monterey Ginza! First, location couldn't be beat, it was great to be in the heart of Ginza with all the wonderful high-end shopping and so close to the train and subway stations. The hotel itself was very modern and definitely had a boutique atmosphere. The dark wood combined with French pictures and the French music as soon as I opened the door into the hallway made me feel transported to a French boulevard! The staff was very helpful and had pre-made maps to show us where to exchange money and even good restaurants to try. The room itself was VERY comfortable and a good size, with more toiletry options than I've ever seen (including hair clips!) and the air system, toilet, TV, everything was so modern! It also had a great Wi-fi internet connection that was very convenient for us. Best of all, the price was definitely right! It was a GREAT base for Tokyo and I will stay there again!

<Content>Good value, clean and nice. Very very small room but very clean and an excellent location for a trip to Tokyo. We didn't want to spend more than $200 per night and, if you're in the same boat, stay here. Nice english-speaking staff was very helpful.

<Content>Great value. Unique Style I booked this room on Rooomstogo.com, so I got a great price. Even paying the normal tarif, I will still stay here. The boutique-style, Japanese hotel is in a faux-Deco style building in the Ginza. Very near to several main subway stops, with the closest entry a block away.Good area restaurants and, of course, shopping.I checked OUT of the nearby, and soul less, Marriott in favor of a more local experience. The hotel staff here were courteous, English was fine, and I was able to get all of my business requirements met here. Good internet (and free, unlike the Marriott), good food, phone.Room was small, but this IS Tokyo. Stylishly decorated, with a flat-screen, HD TV, ensuite bath (with a cool heated and plumbed toilet seat).Great value in a lovely hotel.

<Content>Great Value! This hotel is right in the heart of Ginza area. II took the JR line to Tokyo station and then took a taxi to the hotel. If you are travelling to this hotel for the first time and not familier with the Japan Subway system, then I would recommend the same. Once I got to the hotel and got a feel for the place, it was a breeze for me to take the subway. The closest subway entrance is about 1 minute by walk from the hotel. The hotel was very clean and the staff were extremly efficient. The check in and check out were fast. The staff all spoke English and were helpful in giving directions, tips on using the subway, shopping recommendations, etc. I booked the hotel room with the breakfast package which I recommend. The breakfast was fantastic and had both Japanese and European breakfast. The room came with hi-speed internet access and it was included in my room rate. The rooms were small compared to American standards, but it was plenty for a me. The bathroom was nice with heated toilet seat and was very clean. The hotel did not have any safes in the room, but they do have a service which allows you to leave your valuables with the hotel. Overall, I will say this is an excellent hotel for the value.

<Content>Amazing experience I booked a double room at the Monterey Ginza because it was included in a vacation deal, without really knowing what I was going to find. Me and my husband enjoyed an amazing time there from the moment we arrived. The service was great, with a very polite and helpful staff, although a little Japanese knowledge is useful since their English-speaking skills are not that great. They can say good morning and enjoy your stay, but when I asked them to recharge my MP3 at their computer's USB, they were kind of lost, just like the time when I tried to ask them to call me a cab: I ended up doing that in Japanese. As far as location is concerned, it just couldn't be better. You are minutes away from the main hubs in the terrible hell of the Tokyo subway, so it's really easy to travel with as less connections as possible, and the streets around the place are crowded not only with shops but with great cozy, Japanese, low-priced restaurants, as well as the best of all: two convenience stores opened 24 hours a day right in front of the hotel doors, so you can buy a banana, a face mask or a bottle of water whenever you need to.We had a double room and it was fully equipped with anything from a big kettle to a proper hairdryer, and a flat-screen TV, although the closet was kind of small for our 10-days stay. The bed was great, and the bathroom had anything you could ask for, from hair clips to a warm WC seat!! We didn't have breakfast or any meal included so I can't provide an opinion on that, but my guess is the restaurant was good from what I heard from other guests.There are internet facilities free of charge in the reception area, which was great for us since our cell phones didn't work while we were there.We spent a night away at the Hakone National Park and we couldn't wait to go back to the Monterey Ginza, we ended up calling it home, because that is exactly what it felt like.All in all, it was a great experience and very affordable, I would truly recommend it to anyone.Virginia

<Content>Other Monterey Hotels Much Better Monterey Hotels in Japan are known for European style and reasonable cost. I've stayed at the Monterey in Sapporo and in Sendai (both great experiences) and the Ginza Monterey simple doesn't compare. Rooms are small and business-hotel-like (in the cramped Japanese sense) and I had a double. Dull best describes the room. I reserved non-smoking and got a smoking room. The TV had BBC World but every time I hit the sub button for English it reverted to Japanese within a minute. And I was requested to pay the equivalent of $500 U.S. upfront (without even seeing my room) as 'policy of the hotel', despite the fact that I have both a permanent Japanese address and solid Japanese ability. A credit card imprint was not enough, I was billed the moment I signed in. This is the only hotel to ever request that of me in Japan and I've lived here for 11 years. Basically, the hotel needs to be renovated. It was probably a much nicer place in the 1970s. The hotel is convenient for Ginza shopping, but there are much better hotels available at roughly the same cost.

<Content>Great Value in Tokyo I would recommend this hotel to family and friends. It's central location makes it a gem, not to mention the reasonable price. From the Ginza Itchome metro, take exit 11 and turn right. It's just two short blocks from there (1 minute walk). Hotel staff were hospitable and helpful. As per other reviews, don't take the breakfast; it's not worth $20. Try the McDonald's or Starbuck's, both a minute or two away by foot.The room itself is simple yet comfortable and ultraclean. I asked for a quiet room and found myself on the 12th floor, far above any of the minor traffic noise below; it's a very quiet area in any event. But a mere five minutes away and you are on Ginza Dori, the Oxford Street or Park Aveneue of Tokyo. Connections from the nearby Ginza metro (exit 13 is most convenient to hotel) are excellent. Overall, I would stay here again without hesitation. A very comfortable, clean and quiet hotel.

<Content>Great Value  The great value and location were what made this hotel. In a quiet street just off the Ginza and literally meters to the subway or within a five minute walk to a major station (saves more time-consuming changing), this hotel had good local shops nearby and it was very easy to get taxis. It's not flash, but neither is it basic - it is a tourist class hotel. The bathroom was good for a hotel of this class. The internet access is very good, but if you bring your own LAN cable you'll get connected a lot faster (they loan them from reception). Our only complaints were that the breakfast wasn't good (Monterey breakfasts are very average), and there was only one light at one side for our double bed (which had to be pulled out from the wall). There was limited English spoken, so patience was needed. I'd highly recommend this hotel as a base for Tokyo.

<Content>Well located but a little gloomy The Hotel Monterey has a great location, right in the middle of Ginza. It is very reasonably priced, and has free in-room internet access. The rooms are rather small and pokey.The staff were nice and friendly, and I had no problems during the week of my stay.However, I didn't really like the place, and was glad to leave. You get what you pay for, and if there is ever a next time, I'll pay a little more to stay in a lighter, less gloomy building. But if you want to stay in the heart of Ginza, in a perfectly OK place at a bargain price, then the Monterey would be fine.

<Content>Cool but not exactly comfortable I'm VERY particular about cleanliness, and I have to say that this hotel was superb in terms of that. The bathroom (replete with a bidet--which you could choose to utilize or not) was immaculate, and I really appreciated that the comforter was zipped into this removable sheet that could be washed with every new guest (no more fear of touching the comforter). I guess I wasn't too crazy about just two things: The overlight was a bit too fluorescent for my taste, and the room had a lot of hard, uncomfortable furniture that didn't exactly invite you to just lounge after a tiring day shopping in Ginza. Please be advised that this hotel does not offer room service, which you probably won't need anyway, considering all the great eats around the area. The location is great. With one subway line, the Ginza It-chome, just a minute's walk away, and the main Ginza line about a 7-9 minute walk away, it was very convenient. I found that walking to the Ginza line directly allowed you to link up to the other arteries of the subway system easier, not to mention save you a bit of cash by avoiding numerous transfers. Overall, a good modern hotel.

<Content>Well located, pleasant experience. Will return! Overall - a well located hotel at the heart of Ginza; near shops, subways and large range of restaurants from cheap eat to most expensive. Strong retro styled building that gives a business 鈥榖outique hotel鈥?feel (the lifts have sliding block indicator that actually click over each floor with a sound). Compact room size that offer adequate floor area for bags. Good size bath room for Japanese standards. No problem in returning for my next stay. Breakfast is expensive at the hotel, as expected in all Japanese hotels. More reasonable if you go for the local coffee shop - big mug of blended coffee at Y160. Service is attentive and staff spoke reasonable English. Check in / out time 鈥?disappointingly restrictive! Earliest check in time 3 PM and latest check out time by 11 AM with extra hour charge at Y1000. This is a 鈥榟ard rule鈥?and typical of Japan hotels, even though there may be rooms available. Pretty stupid rules; Japan Travel Bureau please take note.Facilities - a compact hotel with few extra services. There is a large TV in the room with just one English Channel (BBC); access via a language selection that did not work well as the selected language kept reverting back to Japanese after some minutes. Internet access was free but you need to obtain a cable from the Reception (this practice is common in most Japan hotels). Coffee and tea are also supplied free of charge but the facilities are hidden away that you need to play hide and seek in finding them.Shakesp380, Sydney Australia

<Content>Decent, but beware of the small print I booked a room for 3 people at the Monterey Ginza, the room rate was with Travelocity, clearly stating 3 ppl on the room criteria, I noticed other Tokyo establishments through Travelocity stated clearly *2 ppl per room only*. At my dismay when checking in, the poor English speaking receptionist said the rooms were 2 people only, therefore I had to shell out for a single room for the 3rd person.The hotel welcoming area was cramped, crowded, although clearly well furnished given its 'new hotel' status. The restaurant was strictly of the businessman clientel, with prices to match. The rooms were small and snuggly (if you like that sort of thing), at least half the size of the average American hotel room. The bathroom included a nifty electronic 'spa' toilet and bidet, shame it didn't work properly, thankfully the manual chain did. Even the Lipton tea in the room is only 'accessible' via a fee.Clean hotel, pricey, well furnished, glossy, small, boutique style in a good location for the '$10 for a coffee' brigade in Ginza, Kanto. Watch out for the hidden extras and read the small print.
