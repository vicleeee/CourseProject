<Content>Loved this place!! A group of friends and I traveled to New Orleans for an NBA game, just before Christmas '08. I have been to New Orleans several times and now know that even though you can find a hotel with a decent rate and location, you can get killed on parking fees (which aren't always mentioned ahead of time). My previous stay cost $64 for two nights parking, minus any valet tips. Hotel La Provincial had an on-line special the waived the parking fee, had a great rate, and is located in the heart of French Quarter, minutes from Bourbon Street. The check-in went extremely smooth and the room was great. It held the French Quarter charm, nicely appointed, and what can be an issue in even the larger hotels, was clean. It wasn't a huge suite like you may find in the high end hotels, but it was adequate sized and provided everything you would need for a stay in New Orleans. I had a room just off the pool (not that it was swimming weather) and it made for a great sitting area. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to New Orleans and wanting to stay in the French Quarters.

<Content>A Great Stay We stayed at the Hotel Provincial Christmas Eve  Christmas nite. The staff could not have been more helpful  friendlier. The rooms are small but this is expected in a French Quarter hotel. We stayed in room 521 which had a terrance sized balcony overlooking Decatur Street which was shared with 3 other rooms. Rarely were the other guests out when we were so it felt more like our own private balcony. The balcony overlooks the park of the French Quarter Market. It was a perfect location for walking to all the sites in the Quarter. We felt very safe when walking in the area. We're already talking about staying there for our next trip to NO.

<Content>Quaint hotel with great location We went to New Orleans in December because of the low hotel rates (and just because!), and the Hotel Provincial turned out to be a very good value for the money. The location is perfect - only a couple of blocks to Cafe DuMonde and Jackson Square, only a few blocks to the Bourbon Street madness, yet on a quiet street. Our room was the one over the driveway (the one I read complaints about in other reviews here), but we had no trouble with noise. The room was small - typical of a European hotel room or any room in an old hotel in a city center like this. The bathroom wasn't fancy, but it was fine. The bed was a queen size, which is good for us because we normally sleep in a queen, and king size beds always feel too gigantic!The hotel is reportedly haunted, but we didn't see any ghosts. Darn! The only complaint was the continental breakfast, which was very limited. Oh, and the transom window over the door let in light from the hall even when all the lights were out in the room.

<Content>Decent place to stay, great value My wife and I stayed there about a year ago when the Ramada on Bourbon was full. The price for this hotel was right, and I left fairly pleased.The rooms were a little small and a bit outdated, but they were clean and functional. The staff was helpful enough, if unexceptional, and there were no major issues during our stay.Location - for many people going to New Orleans, location can make or break the trip. Even though the French Quarter is not geographically large, there is quite a difference in the areas you can visit. I would recommend this hotel for families who want to visit New Orleans and get a clean room for a great price in a fairly quiet location. The area is perfectly safe, and it is fairly removed from the Bourbon St scene. However, if you are looking for a quick walk back to your hotel after a night on Bourbon, you may want to look somewhere else. It is a bit of a hike, but not too far as long as you aren't falling over inebriated.All in all, it was a suitable replacement for my normal New Orleans hotel. Price was great, hotel was clean, and I was happy. Families should definitely check this place out.

<Content>Convenient location! Great staff! I booked this room through Continental Airlines' website for $72 and it was a steal! The location was awesome, just a few blocks from Jackson Square, Bourbon Street, and French Market. The bellhop was awesome and even let my friend park his car there for free when he met me for dinner! They have a nice courtyard and pool and it's a very quiet area. The only downside to my visit was that, after partying the night before and wanting to take an early afternoon nap, all I could hear was the maid's vacuum running and carts being pushed around. I felt very safe in the area, however, some people who live in NOLA told me that you need to be real careful around there, and not to walk alone at night. I left Bourbon St around 12:30 and walked back to the hotel alone and didn't really see anyone...maybe that was a mistake. Thank God for the drinks!

<Content>Definitely Recommend My sister got married in New Orleans over Thanksgiving, and both families stayed at Hotel Provincial for the long holiday weekend. We were very warmly received, and the staff went out of their way to accommodate us.I honestly do not have any complaints about this hotel. It has nice clean rooms, is conveniently located, and exudes French Quarter charm--all at a great price. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here during my next visit to New Orleans.

<Content>Very disappointing If the staff lead you to the white building at the back of the hotel complex parking lot, get ready to be disappointed: your room will not even vaguely resemble the bright, attractive rooms shown on the website.The building is tired and run-down, and so are the rooms. Ours was small and dingy, and right on the street.The reception staff explained that although some courtyard rooms were free when we arrived, they were being held for arriving guests who had prepaid their entire stay. No one seemed to be particularly concerned that we were disappointed, nor that we checked out three days early. The room rate ($250 during a convention) was way out of line.Stella!, the restaurant next door (but not a part of the hotel) is spectacular, though.

<Content>Good staff. From the moment the four of us arrived, the staff was very friendly and helpful. We stayed in the room over the driveway, the other couple stayed in the court yard area. It was a little noisy two nights out of our eight nights there, but we chaulked it up to selfish rude people. But it is the French Quarter.The breakfast is nice, nothing spectacular. Sadly, the rooms need some attention, while the rooms were nice, the furniture was falling apart. Special thanks to Trudy, who everyday made sure our stay was good !

<Content>Gracious and Helpful Staff to the Rescue After becoming stranded for the night by a reservation snafu at another hotel, Bruce at the front desk of Hotel Provincial came to our rescue. He was patient, gracious and understanding and he gave us a wonderful king room at a great price. The room itself was lovely, with those pretty plantation shuttered french doors and antique and reproduction furnishings. It was very clean too.Our only complaint was something the hotel could not control. The second floor room was located directly over the driveway entry to the parking lot near the front of the hotel, which in the wee hours was apparently an attractive location for some pretty loud and inconsiderate folks to gather. This did not in any way sour us on the hotel, however. We would not hesitate to stay again but would try to request a room closer to the back or on the courtyard.While the hotel and room were both very lovely, and in a convenient location, it was truly the fantastic staff (including our porter Terry and the morning manager, whose name I unfortunately neglected to get) who made our stay special.

<Content>Great Value, Great Location I don't have anything bad to say about the Hotel Provincial. All of the staff was so friendly and helpful. The room was very clean with flat screen TV. The restaurant next door, Stella!, was delicious, somewhat pricey, but still a good value. Beware though, if you are superstitious, this hotel is listed as one of the most haunted places in New Orleans. I found this out the 2nd day of my trip while on a Ghost Tour of the city.

<Content>Provincial is Old New Orleans The Hotel Provincial exudes old New Orleans charm. We stayed in room 215, which overlooks the courtyard. The room featured antique furnishings and french doors. The ac worked well, the room was very clean, and there was plenty of closet space. The bathroom was dated, but clean and fully functional. The courtyard has a fountain and is a great place to enjoy morning coffee or an afternoon cocktail, although there is no bar on the premises. The nearby pool was enjoyable as well, but the number of deck chairs is limited. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Coffee and a continental breakfast (muffins, croissants, etc.) are in the lobby for guests each morning. The location of this hotel is very convenient to Jackson Square. I would not hesitate to stay here again, however, there is a downside to staying here. The hotel is made up of several buildings, and I would not have been as pleased if I had been located in the one across the parking lot from the pool area. Also, persons who are looking for a very modern and up to date hotel with all the big hotel conveniences (concierge, coffee in the room, room safes, room service etc.) would probably not be happy staying here. I knew up front what to expect, and I was completely happy staying here. The more modern hotels lack the charm of the Provincial. We were evacuated during our stay due to Hurricane Gustav. I was very impressed with the professional and orderly way this was handled by the city. The Provincial remained open as long as possible to accommodate their guests, while some of the big, modern hotels required their guests to vacate much earlier, and with no notice.

<Content>Good Hotel for the $$$$ My wife, 18 year old daughter, and I stayed for 3 days at this hotel and enjoyed it. It was clean and well kept, the location was convenient and safe, the air conditioning was great ( a much needed item in New Orleans in the summer), the management hospitable, and the price was right ($62 dollars a night and that was tax included.) Now we used a $50 off deal from New Orleansonline.com, but even without it, the price was reasonable. I'm told that rates are good this time of year. Many travelers don't want to deal with the New Orleans heat and humidity. Downside was the free Continental breakfast (good coffee, but you're better off going down the street for beignets at the Cafe DuMonde.) Also, the maid service could have been a little better if you are the type of person who is a stickler for service. One day they neglected to tidy up our room, provide fresh towels, soap, etc. even though our sign on the door was clearly requesting maid service. We called the front desk and they quickly sent up some fresh towels and washclothes, but even then, they shorted us on washclothes. But maybe the maid was just having a bad day; it DOES happen some time. So this is a very minor complaint. It's a good place. Stay there.

<Content>Wonderful Stay Hotel Provincial was wonderful. Check in was fast and easy, although one of the employees could have been friendlier. The hotel offers valet parking in a secured lot but it is $18 a night. The room was nice, we had one king bed overlooking the pool. I have no complaints about the room except it always seemed dark, even with all the lights on. The location of this hotel is excellent! We could easily walk to everything in the French Quarter. The price was great too, I think we paid $89. They offer free continental breakfast and a computer with internet access for guest use. I will definitely stay here when I come back to New Orleans!

<Content>Exactly what we were looking for My husband, daughter and I were looking for a hotel with a pool since we would be in New Orleans in the heat. We also wanted a room which offered more than the average 2 double bed size since we would be there almost a week and have different sleeping and waking up patterns ( I hate spending all my time in a hotel room sitting on the beds). We wanted to be in the quarter at a reasonable price. Not too much to ask, right? This hotel delivered all we wanted, and was in a lovely, quaint setting to boot. I called the hotel directly to ask a question about the suites listed online and was able to get a petite suite with 2 queen size beds and a small sofa/sitting area. It was very quiet and we had a lovely courtyard, often to ourselves. The pool was close to us and nice, not very busy when we were there. There is a smaller pool through the back courtyard of Restaurant Stella!, be sure to look for it.The hotel is made up of 5 separate buildings, the 500 building was a civil war hospital and is reputed to be haunted. If you go on a haunted history tour, they may stop at your hotel! Freaked my daughter out even though we had read about the haunting, but also gave her a cool story to tell her friends. The only problem we had was the air conditioner was not super efficient and the room was more damp when it was on. But, we would definitely stay here again on our next trip to New Orleans.

<Content>Great value, great location, sweet pools! A great little hotel in NOLA. Loved the smaller of the 2 pools-no one ever bothered my husband and I-it was like no one else knew about it! WONDERFUL A/C-if you've been to NO in August you understand that need! Will go back.

<Content>Great value! The staff members at the Hotel Provincial were all very nice and helpful. The location is great--it's in the French Quarter, but it's far enough from Bourbon St so that you don't hear the noise! Our room had windows that opened inward and had an iron gate, so that it was a sort of balcony. The room was small, but very clean and in good condition. The bathroom had two small problems. First, the soap dish area in the shower was broken, which isn't problematic except that there were rough edges and I scraped my leg on it in the shower. Second, the sink stopper was stuck in the closed position when we arrived. We called the front desk to tell them that it was stuck, and they said they'd send someone to look at it right away. Oh sure we thought, but they really did! Someone came within 5 minutes to fix it.The hotel has two pools. One is a normal sized hotel pool, toward the middle of the property, and the other is very small and secluded. They were both lovely! The continental breakfast was average in terms of variety. There were danishes, muffins, and apples to eat. Everything tasted fine--just what you'd expect--not great but not bad. There was also orange juice. Coffee and tea are provided 24-hours a day. One bad thing is that we were in a room right at the street and had to hear the noise from the mule drawn carriage tours until very late in the night. We could also clearly hear other guests talking as they walked outside the rooms. There are nicer hotels in the French Quarter, but for the price, this one is great! We had a wonderful time.

<Content>Perhaps a bit faded but still charming, convenient and a good value! To be honest, the Provincial has gotten a bit worn since I last stayed here three years ago but they've also been hosting a lot of government workers since Katrina and these folks still do their very best for you. The staff is great - I enjoy supporting them. If you want sparkling new, go to the Omni or Ritz. At Provincial, weather and time may have worn things but the rooms are spacious, a good value and being at the intersection of Chartres and Ursulines, an easy walk from everything in the Quarter. I just got a double bed in a very large room overlooking the pool for $89, last minute on Memorial Day weekend, which I think is a very good deal. The whole place is just classic old New Orleans. The courtyard with fountain is extremely picturesque and charming. (I can't believe people complaining about the the lobby coffee service - Community Coffee is literally around the corner, one block away on Royal; go get a cup and pastry for $5 and bring it back to the courtyard!) A lot of non-guests come here for the restaurant Stella which you should try if you have the money. Otherwise, my best recommendation is Red Fish Grill, a Brennan's property at the other end of Bourbon, or Acme. I'm glad I came back to New Orleans to eat, drink and spend money at local businesses! It's still one of the greatest cities in the world.

<Content>Nice hotel; will go back again. I originally booked through Expedia.com, but in checking the hotel website a few days before we left, I noted that an upgraded room with almost $200 less than Expedia. So I rebooked. The hotel is in a great area. The rooms were clean; the beds were comfortable. The only real negative was a less than generous continental breakfeast of coffee and danish so we walked over to the Cafe du Monde for beignets and coffee which was only a block or two away. We also heard through a tour guide that the hotel has a haunted building even though none of the brochures noted this.

<Author>NewburghNY
<Content>very nice stay Having lived and worked in the surrounding New Orleans area for years pre-Katrina, I had the pleasure to stay in many of the hotels. Having relocated to NY, I was recently back in NO, visiting family and friends I decided to stay at the Hotel Provincial. The rate I got online via the website was an excellent deal and I booked two rooms as I was traveling with family from out side the US. (their first trip to NO) This was my first time in building 5. Second floor (521/2?) We had rooms that opened out onto the balcony so we were able to sit out there and see the riverboats, hear the jazz from the restaurant in the French Market and observe the goings on up and down Decatur. I have stayed in this hotel before but in other wings, and like all the rooms these were nice clean and well appointed. There is no mini-bar, or room service, or those other things you get if you were to stay at the national chain like Marriott, Hilton or Sheraton. I've stayed at these hotels as well as the Radisson on Bourbon St., Omni, Doubletree  the Intercontinel. As with any hotel if there is a problem bring it to their attention but do so nicely. In most cases they will do what they can to fix the situation. No hotel is 100% perfect all the time. This is not a hotel for kids, as the pools (they have two) are small. I have found that many of the guests that stay here are return customers who drive in for weekend visits, football games or girls night out. The staff is friendly and accomodating. Our request for extra pillow, towels handled promptly within reason. This hotel is located in the quieter part of the quarter. At night they lock the gates for guest security and you need to show your key to guard to get in. There are good restaurants close by, as well as one in the hotel, and there is a CC coffee shop a short walk away. The hotel does provide parking for hotel guests. No need for a car in NO, as the Airport shuttle is very handy.

<Content>lovely boutique-style hotel; wonderful views I chose this hotel based on its proximity to the French Market, Fiorella's, and Jackson Square; its status as a quaint historic property; and its views. In all of these areas I was completely satisfied with my stay, especially for the cost ($145 per night).By booking directly by phone, my parents and I were able to get a room with a balcony; we wound up in building five with a lovely shared balcony looking out onto Decatur. The balcony, which one has to climb out the window to access, was the best part of the room. In the lovely May weather we were able to sit outside and people-watch while we chatted and drank margaritas. The room itself was not new, which is to be expected based on the descriptions of the property--it was clean, however, and filled with antiques and furniture that was somewhat scuffed. We laughed that nothing in the room--from the prints on the walls to the large mirror on the wall to the actual air conditioner vent--hung straight. For us this was not a problem. We considered these aspects part of the hotel's charms, yet for others this may not be ideal. The staff on hand was very helpful and polite, and parking, I felt, was a steal: valet parking for $18 per night. That's good for the French Quarter.I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for those looking for a quaint, affordable stay on this end of the French Quarter. With those criteria in mind, I have absolutely no complaints!

<Content>Disappointing - Couldn't Recommend It Anymore Having enjoyed a charming stay at this hotel several years ago I was hoping that its slightly off the beaten track French Quarter location and quaint courtyard layout - with rooms arranged around pools and fountains - would provide a pleasant respite during a recent business trip.Unfortunately it seemed that the rooms had not been maintained, or possibly even cleaned, since I was last there. Knowing the hotel, I asked for an interior (off-street) room when booking but was given a room on the main street when I checked in. Staff accommodated my request for a room change, but it took 6+ hours, and a quizzical attitude regarding one's ability to ignore bizarre or illegal behavior on account of this being the Quarter, honey.I finally ended up in a room with a slow drain (5 minutes+ to empty, making for a logistics challenge) in the bathrooom sink, a mysterious pipe opening in the ceiling which leaked liquids onto the vanity area (and me) at all times, and which actually faced onto a different street. I decided that you pick your battles....

<Content>Jazz Fest I've been to the New Orleans Jazz Fest several years in a row and the Provencal was the best hotel I've tried yet. The hotel isn't in the center of the French Quater, but it's only a short walk. The room was quite nice with upgraded furniture and amenities. It has the New Orleans atmosphere and is a great value. I'd stay there again!

<Content>We Love the Hotel Provencial We called the Hotel Provincial from the visitor center comming in on Hwy 59. The Ladies and the material there were fantastic. We took a room with a balcony over-looking the street. We got the room for 3 days and decided to stay 2 more days. We could'nt stay in the room we were in as it was already booked. The people at the desk were very nice and managed to get us two days in the room next door.The rooms were nice, they were both clean and the beds were excellent. The Hotel Provincial has the feel of the French Quarter and it's in a good centeral area for walking to anything you want to see. Everyone from the staff at the front-desk to the valet were very nice.We would defitently recommend the Hotel Provincial and would stay there if we go back.

<Content>Problematic First, the good stuf.Nice historic hotel. In good walking distance from most everything in the French Quarter, and just far enough away from the craziness of Bourbon Street. And now the rest...We booked directly through the hotel website a week prior to our stay. We brought our email with our confirmation number along with us. Upon arrival, the woman at the desk said there was no reservation for us. She looked at our confirmation email as though it were written in Chinese. They managed to put us in a room, however, we would have to switch rooms the next day. This was rather inconvenient as we didn't feel like we could settle in at all the first night. We also had to work our room switch around lunch reservations. The woman working the desk that night we arrived did not seem competent to handle the problem, nor horribly apologetic about our hassle. The room was nice, but the bathroom left plenty to be desired. The toilet was rocky, the shower was dingy. There was a big wet spot on the carpet next to one of the beds (I don't even want to know...) The doors to the outside were difficult to close and took slamming to get them shut. This makes for a very noisy place. Also, given that the doors did not seal properly, as people sat outside in the courtyard below to smoke in the morning, the smell permeated our room. It was rather awful.We got back from a long day and found that our keys had been reset and neither of them worked. I've spent far more time dealing with the front desk than I would ever plan to during a hotel stay. I guess the gentleman waiting to make complaints the night that we arrived should have been a clue....Regardless, the location is great. Just CALL to place/confirm your reservation, and request a room away from the courtyard if you want to stay away from smokers.

<Content>Just as expected the second time around. We stayed at the Provincial back in 2001 and found it to have a great location and offered a flavour of New Orleans that one of the luxurious high rises could never do.This time we had the same room in the 500 block but one floor down. The room was a little tired but the bed comfortable and the linens clean. There was an elevator in the building and the best thing about the room if you are there on the weekend is that the window opens to a balcony where you can sit out and listen to the bands in the French Market from your own room. The only thing about this door is that it was a large window that had to be propped up by the ironing board so really there should have been some way of keeping it open. This room was close to everything, but not too noisy except for the sirens on Dekatur St at night...not the hotel's fault. The plumbing in the particular room is due for updating..but as many have said this hotel has charm. It is too bad that they did not offer any kind of early morning coffee or continential breakfast. They did offer this on Sunday, but as we had to go to the conference centre it was hard to find a place to have breakfast in the quarter..in fact last time they had a little coffee shop which was now closed.We have stayed at the Best Western off Bourbon and the Monteleone and find the location of this hotel better for the price.All in all it was a very pleasurable stay at this hotel and we found all of the staff to be pleasant and courteous. To all travellers..it really helps when you are pleasant and professional to the staff when you have a problem..it makes a difference on how you are treated.

<Content>Loved it again (2nd time there) My fiance and I stayed there about 5 years ago and came back and stayed in the same room! it was just as quaint and romantic as we'd remembered. It is a historic property, so there are bound to be some quirks you wouldn't find at a brand new hotel. Our room was quite cold, we were supplied with extra blankets and mattress pads (?) which we used as additional layers of blankets on the bed. The staff was friendly, they allowed late checkout, called our cab, etc. I called to make the reservation, (because I wanted to describe our last room and reserve it again) and received a rate lower than those advertised on the website.The location is excellent, close to the action, but yet not chaotic feeling.Maybe it is the sentimental feelings, but this is one of our favorite hotels that we've stayed at!

<Content>Nice, but a little loud and off by itself My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Provincial January 4-8, we were in New Orleans for the BCS Championship game. The staff is very nice, very helpful, very courteous. The rooms were tastefully appointed in antiques, very clean and comfy, well maintained. As other reviews have noted, its an older place and if you want all the creature comforts then go somewhere else. But we really liked the decor, and our room had French doors that opened into a very quaint courtyard, you could have coffee and breakfast there, again, very nice. About our only complaint was the location - its at one end of the Quarter, which means that to walk anywhere will take you several extra minutes. Not a big hassle though. Its also a little on the loud side, it just seemed like every little noise was magnified and made sleeping/napping difficult. But, in fairness, it was full of college football fans so that probably made a difference. All in all, though, a nice place.

<Content>Nice hotel This is a nice place, in a fantastic location. Close to Bourbon St, but far enough to get some sleep. Very comfy beds, nice antiques in the room, pretty courtyard, helpful staff. The only minuses where the small bathroom(with a sloooow drain), and the outdoor motel-style entrances to the rooms.

<Content>Pleasant and pretty The Provincial is a pretty hotel, in a un-touristy part of the French Quarter. The beds are very comfortable, which to me is the most important factor in a hotel. The rooms are pleasant, though our bathroom (in a standard room) was small. The staff were all lovely, and helpful. Valet parking was made easy by the energetic attendant, who also called taxis when needed. There is no coffee in the rooms, and the coffee in the lobby is a minimalist experience, without milk or cream (just little packets of fake stuff) and styrofoam cups. There is only a tiny sitting area in the lobby (like two chairs.) (It would be easy for the hotel to offer real milk or cream, and put out another chair or two.)We were staying at the Provincial with a group of 20 year old kids, and they loved the beauty of the patio, and the old feeling of the hotel. They were happy and satisfied with their rooms (Petite Suites). The Provincial is around the corner from the Croissant D'Or, which is a wonderful coffee and pastry shop. After surveying what is available in the French Quarter, I've booked another room here for next week, because of the comfortable beds, quiet location, helpful staff and beauty of the patio.

<Content>Very disappointed First time in New Orleans. Paid 198 the first night, 229 the second night and 329 for Friday night. Very unfriendly hotel. No coffee made in lobby. Toilet rocked from side to side when you sat down. Was not worth the cost of a suite. The lady at the desk upon check out didn't even bother to ask if we enjoyed our stay. Would never stay at this Hotel again

<Content>Like a home away from home Hotel Provincial has become our home away from home. We first experienced them right after Katrina, and fell in love. Its the only place we stay now. The staff always remember us, and make us feel like we never left. The rooms are meticulous, we usually go in the summer and the rooms are delightfully chilly. The pool is so clean, the kids throw quarters and swim down to fetch them. There is a snack machine, close proximity to the finest food in the world, far enough away from Bourbon to not be overwhelmed by the crowds, but close enough to enjoy the overflow from the balcony. There is nothing more incredible that waking up in this hotel to the gentle clopping sound of the horse carriages going by, then heading down the street for a beignet and coffee. The entire staff down to the room maintenance crew are unbelievably friendly, we would never stay anywhere else in New Orleans!!!!!

<Content>Loved the location We stayed here recently and loved the hotel. The location was perfect...close to everything we wanted to see. The price was only $79/night plus $18/night for parking. The floor of our room seemed to be at a slight angle, but besides that the room was very comfortable. The bathroom did not have much counter space. The air conditioning worked great (good thing because it was HOT outside!). The front staff was very helpful and courteous. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Hotel Provincial ok We had planned to stay two nights at the Hotel Provincial but one was enough. The room was clean but the room was hot. When we tried to change the thermostat the cover fell off and we did increase the air conditioning but the room never really got cool enough. Fortunately, I had packed a small fan. My sister was staying in a different building and said their room smelled mildewey. Bathrooms in both rooms were extremely small. The hotel pool looked okay. I couldn't really tell if it was dirty or just old. The cover to the pool drain was off of it and laying loose in the deepest section of the pool. This is very dangerous as we have all heard in recent news events. The hotel staff was courteous and the valet parking had very good service. The courtyards were pretty and the hotel was in a good location, walking distance to most places we wanted to go to. Probably wouldn't stay here again. When I am paying $200 per night for a room, I want it to be cool enough - especially in July.

<Content>Great Times In The Big Easy I took my boyfriend on a trip to NOLA for his birthday since it is my favourite US destination and I felt he needed to experience it. Unfortunately during our Stay hurricane Dennis was on on the prowl. Luckily dennis did nothing to Nola.I had booked the Provincial -mistakingly thinking it was a hotel I had stayed at during one of my other visits - but it wasnt.The hotel was very nice. Clean and well maintained. The staff were amazing. They bent over backward for us, and during the little bit of a skirmish that Dennis did cause - they constantly checked on us to make sure we were okay, or if we needed them to do anything for us. This was very sweet - and thoughtful - especially since Dennis was nothing in comparison to what was about to come :-(  The pool was nice - the courtyard was cute - parking on site (which we didnt need - but a friend of ours who lives in Mandeville used to visit us). staff were knowledgable of all the spots to go. We had a great time and i would definitely go back and support the Provincial.

<Content>wonderful weekend On a whim, my kids and I decided to stay a weekend in New Orleans. We saw a flyer at the Louisanna Welcome Center advertising Hotel Provential, it was a great rate. They were very nce about giving me the rate, the hotel was not the fanciest I've ever stayed at, but it was really nice. Very very clean. And it smelled good, a little old but good. Lots and lots of character. Loved the pool and courtyard. Employees were nice and helpful. I felt safe at night in the hotel without my husband. It all felt personal, not like a big chain hotel, more like a visit at Grandma's when all the cousins are there too.The perfect location was great. We didn't wear ourselves out getting to the places we wanted to explore, or the tours we went on. New Orleans will never recover from the hurricane, but they will survive and flourish. Despite the damages still showing in so many places there is a great deal of life left in the city. And it is wonderful to see it making a come back.

<Content>great experience in the FQ My wife and I needed a quick get away during a stressful time. We also love the French Quarter in New Orleans. Hotel Provincial was a wonderful overnight stay. The staff was courteous and helpful without being overbearing. The room was clean and comfortable and nicely decorated. The balcony overlooking the street was a nice amenity....was great to spend the evening watching the sun set behind the surrounding buildings and to drink coffee early in the morning. The only draw back was that it overlooked the street...and it is New Orleans afterall...where the party never ends and the noise only stops at sun up. But it was a minor inconvenience. If you are looking for a large bathroom suite...this is not your place. If you are looking for a great location within walking distance to the French Market, Bourbon Street, Jackson Square, Royal Street, etc. This is a great inexpensive place to stay. If you are there for dinner, walk a few blocks to Mona Lisa's restaurant. Delicious italian in a quaint New Orleans atmosphere. For breakfast, try the Clover Grill. It's a hole in the wall greasy spoon, but they cook it up right in front of you. Ask at the Hotel Provincial desk, the bell man can give you directions.Enjoy and laissez les bon-temps roulez.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised about the Hotel Provincial After two full Jazzfest weekends, staying at a friend's in Slidell, we decided we needed one night in the Quarter and luckily the rates had come down after the fest, so there were quite a few good deals out there. I checked TripAdvisor's reviews carefully (as I always do!) before making my selection, and even then was a little apprehensive, having had less than desirable experiences in French Quarter hotels in the past . . . but we were very, very pleased with this cozy little place. I think so far it is the all around best yet, actually. This is the 6th hotel in the Quarter we've stayed at over the past 5 years, and though a few of the others have been nice to lovely, this one pretty much scored good to excellent in all of our personal requirements in a hotel, i.e. cleanliness, parking ($18 for close in valet parking on the premises is NOT a bad deal in this area), proximity to favorite attractions, location (not in one of those dark, alley-size streets in the Quarter), and a pleasant, accomdating staff -- not to mention bargain room rates. Who cares about coffee/breakfast? I am always happy for an excuse to trek down to Cafe du Monde, or one of the nearby cafes for breakfast -- there are many of them, within short walking distance - with great southern breakfasts, New Orleans style. This is one city I don't want bagels  weak coffee provided; I don't want to waste my time on such fare, only to kick myself when I get home. Anyhow, try this hotel, if you want clean, cozy, and truly historical -- at bargain rates!

<Content>Great location I can't say too much about the hotel services but I can say the location was great if you want to stay in the French Quarter area. Everything that we wanted to do was within walking distance. Request room number 100. We didn't realize it at the time but it seems to be the biggest room. That is probably why I liked it so much. This hotel is a small boutique. It is so cute. There was a small courtyard with a fountain on one side of our room and then the swimming pool on the other side. We weren't told ahead of time but the Sat afternoon a wedding took place in the courtyard. We felt a little intrusive but we watched part of it through our window. Very sweet. If planning on staying only in the quarter I would recommend this hotel. I think our rate was around 150 a night and we were splitting it between 4 people. During the summer you might be able to get a better rate because of the heat.

<Content>OK but nothing Special. We stayed here for the New Orleans Jazz Heritage Festival 2007. The Pros:The room was nice and the location is great.There are a few courtyards that are nice. The maid service was good, the room was clean when we arrived and they kept it that way during our stay.The Cons:There is a restaurant right next door that appears to be part of the property, but it is not. There is no room service. It would have been great to have breakfast in bed a time or two after several days of partying at the festival. The restaraunt next door is not even open for breakfast. So be prepared to trek out in the morning for coffee and breakfast.They advertise coffee in the lobby til 10:00AM. That proved to not be true during our stay. Coffee was gone by 9. The thing that bothered us the most was that the staff was completely non responsive to rectifying that issue. They would send you around the corner to a local coffee shop and there you would find a line wrapped around the corner to get in. There should be coffee service at the hotel 24 hours a day or they should put coffee pots in each room.

Wonderful floor-to-ceiling doors/windowsoverlooking the street; I kept them open all night long Because we overlooked the street, we heard the clip-clopping of the occasional horse going by. Great breakfast place 1/2 block away.

<Content>Not impressed - wouldn't recommend it! I have stayed in many hotel rooms in New Orleans and this was my least favorite experience, thus far! The room was quaint (small) and the beds were average (at best), but it was clean - which was a plus!!!!The service left quite a bit to be desired, though. The gentleman told me the parking would cost $5, but on the day of checkout, they charged $18/car/day...OUTRAGEOUS FOR A HOTEL GUEST!!The hotel is only two blocks from bourbon, but it's at the wrong end - quite a long way from Pat O's, most of the good dance clubs/bars, Jackson Square, etc. Finally, it took about 20 minutes to get our car the day of check out! It was only about 25 yards away...and not blocked in...they just neglected to help us!! All in all, it wasn't horrible - if all the other hotels are booked solid - but I would suggest staying at Hotel Provencial as a last resort, not as a first choice!!

<Content>Perfect Location  We stayed here for two days both before and after a cruise in December and we absolutely loved it. We've stayed at other hotels in NOLA both in the French Quarter and on St. Charles and prefer this one to all of them. The staff were very courteous, friendly and helpful, and the room we stayed in (a petite suite, I think it was called) was pretty large. We were terribly awed by the bathroom - it was HUGE and had an armoire and a chaise lounge in it with plenty of room left over! Very glamorous! The location is perfect if your main points of interest are in the Quarter - you can walk to just about everywhere most tourists go in the area.

<Content>Wonderful place We have stayed at this hotel for 25 years--daughter was 5 on her first visit, she is now 30. It is a wonderful, quiet place to stay near everything you want to see! The staff is always polite. Help New Orleans by visiting and spending money to help rebuild! This is one of the last best places in the world and Hotel Provencial is a great part of it.

<Content>Please visit NOLA and stay here We booked Hotel Provincial for our party of ten. We reserved five rooms for the weekend of Dec 1. News of an impending snowstorm which likely would have canceled our weekend compelled us to rearrange our air travel to the day before our planned arrival . The Hotel Provincial was able to adjust their reservations and accomodate us with only a few hours notice.My wife and I were charged with the responsibility of choosing the right hotel and were nervous about our ultimate choice. As it turned out , we were very pleased with the result. We are not hotel snobs, but have an expectation that rooms should be comfortable and clean and that the property is well cared for. The rooms were clean, well furnished, with a good bed and shower. The common areas were beautiful and charming.The area is quiet and safe. An easy stroll to both Bourbon St and the Fauburg Marigny (sp) area which is up and coming for good dining and music.We were prepared for service to be compromised , but it was really quite good.I plan to visit New Orleans again this spring and will choose Hotel Provincial for future stays.There are no food services for breakfast on the property, but a very nice cafe is a one minute walk and it is better than having a hotel continental breakfast.We found New Orleans to be less busy than pre-Katrina but ready to get back into gear. All it will take is for people to get back down there and visit. I highly recommend that anyone who has desired to visit New Orleans or who has decided against it should by all means go there. It is up and running and needs your support.

<Content>Could have been better Our stay here was mixed. We felt ripped off at the compulsory $18/day valet parking (to drive the car about 20m up the driveway), we had to complain when our room wasn't serviced and our original room was right by the very noisy air conditioning unit by the carpark. Location is pretty good (although we were warned by a local to be vigilant after dark as there has been some muggings in that area) and the rooms were quite nice although the bathroom was somewhat small and dingey.

<Content>True New Orleans Charm!! I love this hotel. I feel that it has the BEST location. I have stayed in several other (more expensive) French Quarter properties, but have opted our last few trips to stay at the Hotel Provincial. The concierge is fantastic and helpful, not to mention, he has been there forever... I enjoy seeing a familiar face, who always recognizes us and makes us feel welcome. I love the quaint hotel bar, where my husband and I like to hang out and people watch. I love the convenience of Hotel Provincial most of all.. Close to the Cafe du Monde, The French Market, and Jackson Square.Some of the rooms are small, but very clean and nice. (We don't spend much time in our room, except to sleep anyway!) We always enjoy the fabulous courtyards and pool. True New Orleans charm!! A great hotel! I have always been very happy with this choice, we always recommend and always return....

<Content>Loved the Hotel Provincial, will return Although the Hotel Provincial takes up almost an entire city block the seperate buildings, intimate courtyards with fountains and two quite private small pools surrounded by tropical folliage make you feel like you're in you have stepped into another time.It is very relaxing after a few hours of hard shopping in the French Quarter.The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. The antique furnishings made you feel as if you were a guest in someone's home. The staff was over the top and there is valet parking.Two excellent restaurants make Breakfast, lunch and fine dining just steps away. We slept quite well although a little noise in the mornings is unavoidable.What more could you ask for a weekend getaway.It was just what we needed!The French Quarter is like you've never seen it.Not crowded yet, even on the weekend, most everything is open and just waiting for our business. All the negativity you see on the news does NOT apply in the Quarter.

<Content>Post-K Provincial I've stayed at the Provincial many times over the course of 15+ years. My recent stay, June 18-20, found the hotel to be in good operating condition. I had first booked a room at one of the large corporate chains, mainly because they offer high speed Internet connections. As time drew closer to my date of departure, I decided to support a local business. The staff at Provincial was pleasant and accommodating. My room was cleaned every day. I had a deluxe room which appeared to have been freshly paintied. The door of my room opened onto a lovely courtyard. As one reviewer noted, there is no in-room/lobby coffee service. However, Stanley, the restaurant accessable through the townhouses, is open for breakfast and lunch. Stanley makes a good cup of dark, New Orleans coffee. I recommend the Provincial as a Quarter location. Given the circumstances, I'm tempted to give the hotel and excellent rating. Very good is a more applicable rating.

<Content>Not too shabby I had read alot of reviews on this hotel, and since I'm a bit picky, it looked like a good bet. We arrived after dusk and were somewhat disappointed with the room. I had booked a petite suite and spoke w/the front desk on several occasions. The photo on their web site was just what I was looking for and was assured of this on the phone. Upon arrival our suite was located in Building 300 and was not at all similar. Also, I know NOLA can be stinky, but our room on the first level was quite musky (a term not familiar w/the staff or perhaps the South in general). However...upon a visit to the front desk I was informed they were sold out and that the room I had originally described may or not be available tomorrow (not). I asked for a 2nd level location hoping for perhaps an improvement on the moisture situation. Sure enough, the suite above was available and much better. My thinking is many of the tight/dark areas in the quarter really do not catch much of a breeze and very little sunlight, especially on the lower levels. This would be hint to all, especially Bldg. 300. The handsome and apt night manager was most helpful, as well as all the staff. And, other than a disabled remote (later replaced) I have NO complaints and would stay here again. Also, around the corner is our new, most very favorite restaurant in NOLA- Irene's. It is quaint and truly fabulous!  ps- Redfish was a big dissapointment but this is the Provincinal review!

<Content>Loved The Hotel Provincial! Stayed at the Hotel Provincial the first week in April for our honeymoon. Our room was beautifully furnished in antiques and overlooked a lovely courtyard with a fountain. The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly. Right after checking in we discovered the lightbulb was out in the bathroom and we did not have a remote to the television. A call to the desk brought someone up immedialtely with both! They were also very helpful with tour information and restaurant suggestions. The hotel location is fantastic...very close to Cafe Du Monde, as well as two of our favorites, Cafe d'Orr and Irene's. It sits in the quieter side of the Quarter but is within walking distance of just about everything! Did not use the pool but it looked sparkling clean. The many courtyards were a wonderful place to read or relax. Several times we picked up a muffaletta at Central Grocery and ate lunch in one of the fountain courtyards...heaven!We would highly recommend this hotel and will certainly stay here again. We originally had reservations at the Le Richelieu, but they did not re-open in time for our trip. Carrie Jo at Le Richelieu recommended the Provincial and we are so glad that we took her advice!!!

<Content>Southern Hospitality Just a quick lil review to let everyone know that if your thinking of staying here your making a wise choice. The rooms are nice, it's in a quiet part of town, and the staff is great! Especially the Bell Hop, David...he goes above and beyond!

<Content>Excellent place, excellent staff My fiancee and I stayed at the Hotel Provincial for the first Mardi Grais after Katrina and it was GREAT!!! We were there from 2/24/06 to 3/1/06 and were very pleased with everything. From the moment we pulled in, a friendly valet/belhop unloaded our car and carried our bags up to our room. The front desk was very helpful in locating some local attractions and gave us a map of the area. the room was great, French doors entering into a tastefully decorated room which overlooked a large courtyard with a fountain and a pool. The bathroom was perhaps the onlyh gripe as some of the tile along the tub was cracked, however that was the ONLY thing we could find with the place. Our car was always brought promptly when asked and the maid service was great without being introusive. You're two blocks from Bourbon St. and likewise to the Mississippi River. Plenty of good resturants within walking distance. Definately would stay there again if we return to New Orleans.

<Content>French Quarter hotel with charm I stayed at the Provincial for two nights based on the trip advisor reviews. I was on business travel and needed to be in the French Quarter. The location is great (you are about less than a 5 minute walk to the famous Cafe Du Monde). The hotel itself has a lot of charm and from what I gathered, did not sustain much damage from Katrina. My room was a cozy queen bed and clean. It clearly showed its age (chipped plastering in some places, traditional brown decor) but I guess that goes with the charm. The only thing I would say is that if you are a serious business traveler and in need of business amenities--you won't find it here. The only thing the Provincial had was a fax machine (no business center, so I had to use efax to fax myself documents). I would suggest the Omni Royal if you are looking for a more business-traveler friendly hotel. The staff was very sweet and accomodating and everyone said 'hi' to you when they saw you. One thing I thought was a little weird was that I did not get daily maid-service--I am not sure if it's because of reduced staff with Katrina or not--but if you call the front desk they are pretty quick in getting whatever you need. Oh...and the Provincial is on the list of officially haunted New Orleans Hotels. I didn't know before I got there. It's pretty cool. I experienced some phenomenon, but nothing scary. The window doors opened by themselves--could easily attribute to the wind (for those skeptics out there). All in all, a good stay. No problems.

<Content>Very nice The employees are very helpful, the two pools are wonderful - don't overlook the small courtyard pool tucked away in the corner by the restaurant. Beautiful! The kids were in love with the hidden doorway in our section of the hotel. It's location is great. I highly recommend it for going back to New Orleans, as I will - and I hope everyone else does, too. Viva New Orleans!

<Content>Oncores to the Provincial I have often wondered due to katrina what has happened to the staff and the lives of the people who have made our family lives a part of New Orleans when we visit New Orleans. Service, kindness credibility with honesty, all rolled into one it does'nt matter which aspect of this hotel you are mentioning. To The Provincial; from Meridian, Ms. WE LOVE YOU!!!!!!

<Content>Great Hotel !!! If you're looking for luxury 5 star rooms w/ no character don't stay here.Location is outstanding! Nothing is out of walking distance. Bourbon St. far enough away- but not too far. Neighborhood was quiet and safe - as we were 2 women this was important. We stayed in the infamous building #5 and had no problems w/ room. Having stayed numerous times in New York City hotels our room felt cavernous in comparison. Room was clean, bathroom was spotless w/ instant hot water, and the air conditioner worked so well we had to turn it lower (we were freezing!). Both the bar and the cafe were closed, while inconvenient not a big deal. I intend to go back to NOLA as often as I can and the Provincial is where I'll stay as long as the price stays cheap !!!!

<Content>Needs Work I stayed at the Provincial August 21st and enjoyed the location, but the hotel needs some work on guest services. There was a dirty rag left right outside our door and there was no top sheet on the bed. The night manager brought us a sheet that we put on, but left the dirty rag outside the door.The outside doors have a visible gap to the outside, which explains the entry point of the mosquito that bit me all night long. The air conditioning was noisy and very musty. I turned it off in the middle of the night and used the ceiling fan only, until the noise became too much.The location is great, but the place is not a bargain for what you get. We stayed three night at the Hotel Pavillion the week before and loved it, with only a $20 per night room charge difference.The night male managers were very curteous; the two female desk folks couldn't give us the time of day. The valets were terrific and most helpful.I have to say I was disapointed by the glowing reviews others gave this place as I often make a decision based on the reviews.

<Content>Location  My wife and I stayed in the Hotel Provincial from july 22 to july 26. The hotel have charm (an old fashion style that we loved) and an excellent location (near the Franch Marquet, Bourbon Street, Laffite's Bar). Is not luxury or fancy but the price-quality relation is great.Our room (217) was pretty nice, fresh, not noisy and with old fashion style furnitures. The only complain we have was the carpet (seemed dirty). The hotal have a little nacio patio with chairs anbd tables and you can go there to eat the continental breaksfast or to spend some time reading a book. The staff is great but I must say that the male staff were more gentle with us that the female.If we go agin to New Orleans, we will stay here again for sure.

<Content>Good location We stayed here July of 2004 and found it to be somewhat expensive, but so was everything else in the French Quarter. The best thing about this place is that it is away from the noise of Bourbon Street, yet close to many of the things you will want to do in the French Quarter. We stayed three nights and only took our car out of parking one time. Our room off of the pool area had more charm than your typical hotel chain room, even if it was a little dark. We did have an issue one night with people swimming in the pool past midnight--the rooms off the pool are quite close to the pool, so you will hear people splashing around. And we did have the maid come by before 10am one morning when we were still in bed ... there are also bricks outside the first floor courtyard/pool rooms, so you will be able to hear the maid rolling the housekeeping cart past your door if you sleep in (and this is New Orleans, so you will be sleeping in!). Rates were cheaper Sunday through Wednesday, going up ten dollars a night after that. I thought July would be a time to get a cheaper rate (cuz it IS hot), but we still paid $149-$159, and that was booking through the hotel so we didn't get any of those bad rooms people keep talking about on this site! All in all, I would probably try another hotel next time, just so I could experience another place, but I would recommend it to others staying in the FQ, and I would be willing to stay here myself. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel had a more authentic feel to it. If you are going to the FQ, stay in a non-chain hotel, but make sure you have done your research.

<Content>Location, location , location !!!! This is now our favorite place to stay, after many visits to N.O.!! For us, practically walking out our door to the French Market, Central Grocery Store and Cafe DuMonde etc. was great - best location in the quarter - convenient, but away from the noise of the Quarter. Our room, although somewhat dark, was lovely and opened onto a small secluded courtyard. Unfortunately, Cafe Beignet was closed, but the Honfleur Bar serves great Bloody Marys to start your day! The staff was helpful and friendly, especially Terry, although the desk clerks seemed a little stiff. Can't wait to go back and hopefully have better weather so we can take advantage of the many courtyards. For Hotel Bargain Shoppers, this was a great deal !!!

<Content>Great Location The hotel is in the 'quiet' area of the quarter which we felt was definately a positive! All one needs to do to be in the middle of the activity is walk a block or two. The location allows you to experience the hustle bustle and ecentricities of the noisy area and then make a quick escape to the hotel or Cafe du Monde to wind down. A real positive with visitors with children! The rooms are beautifully decorated with antiques, but not so much to create a paranoid feeling with kids in the room. The courtyard was also charming and allowed for a good morning area for the early risers in the room; also, it is just a short walk to the French Market which is another good activity for the morning crew. I will book this hotel again on my next visit!

<Content>pleasant oasis in the Quarter This location is close to the bustle of Decatur St. and far enough away from Bourbon St. to be restful. It has a pleasant courtyard and decent-size pool. It is a reasonable value, and we were comfortable. Some AC noise and bathroom mildew (that may be ubiquitous in the Quarter).

<Content>Pleasant Hotel and Charming Our stay at your hotel was very pleasant and the workers were very helpful , the airlines had lost our luggage and they were very undersanding with the sitution and asked if there was anything they could do for us and that as soon as our luggage arrived they would call our room, if we wished, and have someone bring it to our room. When we asked for directions for places they helped us and in a way that we understood them. I would recomnd this hotel anyone that wanted a hotel that is also in the center of the activities, and wanted a clean and relaxed place to stay. Thank you again for making our stay with you an enjoyable one! The Reed`s

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Location We stayed at Hotel Provincial 5/11 - 5/15/05 and were very happy with everything. We had a group of 5 couples and everyone was completely happy with the hotel. We were given great rooms - right at the pool/courtyard. The hotel truly has a New Orleans atmosphere - full of character and charm, and in an absolutely Perfect Location!!! I found the staff to be friendly also. I am assuming the rooms other people have stayed in who have written the bad reviews for this hotel might be in one of the buildings behind the pool area, although they were renovating a building back there when we were there. I was in room 112, and our friends were right around us, on first or second floor, so requesting a specific room might be not be a bad idea.

<Content>We'll definately be back! My husband and I loved Hotel Provincial. There are a number of beautiful courtyards and a large pool. We stayed in room 422 which had a balcony overlooking a quiet residential street, perfect for us to wind down in peace after long days of sightseeing. The room was decorated with beautiful antiques, was quite spacious and very clean. Every member of the staff we encountered was very friendly. This was our first visit to New Orleans and I believe the experience wouldn't have been the same had we stayed in a cookie cutter chain hotel. When, (not if), but when we return to NO, we will definately stay at Hotel Provincial!

<Content>Will stay here again! After reading many different reviews about NO hotels, we decided that this one looked like the best hotel for us. We were not disappointed! When we arrived, Lee the valet was very informative and friendly.We were in building #5 in a king room with a balcony overlooking Decatur St. and the French Market. The room was nice and the A/C was working well which was a must as the summer heat of NO had just begun. Other reviewers have complained about the mustiness and aged appearance of this hotel, but one must remember that you are in an old hotel with antique furnishings. This is what makes this hotel as well as the French Quarter what it is, which in our opinion, was a GREAT experience.Our only complaints were that one day housekeeping missed cleaning our room and the shower temp/pressure was inconsistent. But I certainly expect shower inconsistency in a hotel.All in all we had a nice stay at the Hotel Provincial and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>stay away from this hotel! My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon. It was NOT as nice as it looked on the internet -- the rooms are old and dusty and worn -- but we were determined to stick it out. Our first day in the hotel, someone took money from our room. When the front desk came to check and see who had accessed our room by reading the magnetic key lock it turned out that no fewer than 5 people from the hotel staff (not us) had been in our room while we were out walking around that day. The hotel manager acted as if it were our fault all these people were in our room and was not very helpful. After I insisted the hotel move us to another room, they moved us to a room which stank of smoke, so much for a non-smoking room. Our friends paid for the hotel to send us a bottle of wine to celebrate our honeymoon that was never delivered to us -- who knows, maybe the staff drank it. Another couple tried to have a gift certificate to the Jazz Brunch at the Court of the Two Sisters delivered to us, but the hotel insisted we were not registered there, so no free brunch for us. After four days of horror at this hotel, we packed our car to go home and realized they had hit my car while they were shuffling cars in and out of valet parking. There are so many other nice hotels in New Orleans both in and out of the French Quarter, that you'd be better off spending your money elsewhere. The Maison Dupuy was decent, if a little pricey.

<Content>Relaxing Stayed in a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the courtyard with the large fountain. The courtyard has tables and chairs and two gas lamps and is nicely landscaped. Great for reading, and drinking coffee and eating beignets. Our room was large, with a big brass bed, two stuffed chairs, a smaller chair, a dresser and a large round table. The bathroom had a sink with a large marble counter, in a separate room from the shower and toilet. There's a small closet, too. Plenty of room for our things. The furniture is not new, and the carpets may have had some spots, but it was clean and comfortable. The A/C worked perfectly when the humidity became unbearable (in March). The location is convenient to everything. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>Full of character like the French Quarter We enjoyed the Hotel Provincial during French Quarter Fest. The location was great; we even stopped by the room as we walked back and forth thru the Quarter to different Festival events. We enjoyed the antiques. Our room was in the main building overlooking the pool. We kept the transom window above the doors open and the ceiling fan on low - great for atmosphere and we didn't need the air conditioning. There was a slight musty smell in the room, maybe because of a leak in the sink faucet. The furnishings could use some renovation to make them top notch, but they're nice and old like the French Quarter. The staff, especially the bellmen, were really helpful. They were one of the best parts.

<Content>I would pass Staff was very indifferent, location is good, room smelled really bad and staying in room 310 I'm guessing is the worst at this location. Right on a side street street and sounds like everyone walking by is in the room with you. I stayed here 22 years ago and the place was great. Time and staff have not been kind to this hotel.

<Content>Would Pass on This One I would definately not recommend this hotel to anyone. I called before to inquire about what room I would be in and the gentleman told me I'd have a lovely room overlooking the water. When we arrrived we were put in a ground floor room next to the parking lot and we were pretty much out of luck because the place was booked solid. The room appeared  smelled stale, the carpeting old, the bathrooms tiny, the towels rags. Then they had a sign on the bed telling you how much water is used when they wash your bedding and they want to conserve water. This hotel makes you want them to wash the sheets every night no matter what conservation line they try to pull on you--cheapy place.I came all the way from NYC and wished I stayed home or in another hotel. I did enjoy New Orleans a great deal...thank goodness the City was fun and inviting... but I would not stay at this hotel again. Find another place if you can... and I paid a pretty high price just the bad luck of the draw...next time I'll do better research.

<Content>great location Great location! By staying at the Provincial we didn't need to rent a car. Easy walking to sites or the streetcar. The room was a little older but clean. We didn't hear alot of noise outside. Water pressure and temp in the shower was the only real problem.

<Content>Enjoyed the Provincial I spent last weekend at the Provincial with former college roommates. We had two rooms in Building Two, each with two double beds. The room was perfectly nice, if a little dark. The bathroom actually had some counter space, which isn't always true in places I've stayed in the Quarter. The room was clean, although the carpet had some spots. All in all, we were quite happy with the place and I'd certainly return again if the price was right. The courtyards were pleasant, the pool looked clean, but it wasn't warm enough to want to swim.

<Content>Not quite what you expect One thing do not go by the picture featured on the web site. The rooms are nice if you like the older charm of New Orleans. But if your looking for a 4 star hotel this is not the one. The rooms are quite drafty and stale smeeling. The carpet looks like the homeless from New Orleans had spent a few nights there. The tub and shower would be nice if you were born in the 1800s because weve heared that the average height of a person was 5 foot which is what you would have to be to take a shower or a bath. When we first arrived at the hotel the bellman took us to room 520 which was quite nice except that it was already occupied. Come to find out we were supposed to be in room 320 instead. All in all the location was excellent and if you dont plan to spend anytime in the room and dont want to take a shower its for you. As for us we would not recomend this hotel unless your in a bind and just need some place to stay.

<Content>Pretty much perfect Husband and I spent 4 nights here in December 2004 for our anniversary...I researched online w/ tripadvisor, and decided we'd give this one a try, as previous trips to NO we'd stayed in private condos of friends. I'll try to be objective...but we've traveled quite a bit, and this was, overall, one of the most pleasant hotel experiences we've had!  LOCATION - A++ - Could not have been better! Easy and immediate access to shopping areas on Decatur, French Market, waterfront trolly (to casino and connections to other lines) through the back entrance. Close enough to Bourbon/Royal for easy access when you want 'party' or people-watch...yet FAR ENOUGH away that it was peaceful and quiet. We had pleasant evening strolls back to the hotel each night, lamplit sidewalks and beautiful verandas overlooking quiet residential streets. In the late evenings, the gate was shut partway and hotel staff was always hanging about in the courtyard or parking area - that was nice.   STAFF - A- - Check in was easy. Room wasn't ready, but they allowed us to check our luggage w/ the bellman and told us to return in about an hour - we strolled a bit, and room was ready right when we got back. Bellman was friendly, staff always greeted us pleasantly whether we were coming or going, we asked for extra pillows and they were delivered promptly, housekeeping was satisfactory, there was always fresh coffee in the lobby, they called cabs for us when needed - really, I'd have to say nothing overtly spectacular...but since we didn't really have any problems, we have no complaints either!   We received voucher for 'free cocktail' at hotel bar at check in...free cocktail meaning your choice of house wine, draft beer, or well drink, and hotel bar being a generous term for a small room w/ three barstools and spacey bartendar who spent a lot of time on the phone arguing w/ his mom...but really, what's NO *without* a spaced out bartendar on the phone w/ his mom while he's mixing your drink?! :P  ROOM - A - having read reviews here, we made sure we had a room in the MAIN building, overlooking the pool/courtyard. Quiet, quaint, pleasant. Roomy w/ nice furnishings, a bit worn around the edges (but to be expected w/ antiques). Bathroom was also roomy, layout of room was nice. No trouble w/ temperature, water pressure. Ice, soda, snack machines all just a few feet away downstairs (there is no elevator, but it's only 2 stories). We felt comfortable enough that we spent a lot of time w/ our door to the courtyard open.  All in all, I'd say this - there are *certainly* fancier and more modern and luxurious hotels in NO...but if you're looking for a place in the Quarter w/ some true 'old world' charm, don't mind a few nicks in the furniture or getting your own ice, and would prefer someplace away from the 'roar of the party crowd' in the evenings...then the Hotel Provencial is just the ticket.   We wanted a nice, ROMANTIC getaway, and this was a resounding success. We will ABSOLUTELY stay here again...and again!

<Content>Friendly staff! Nice rooms, good location I rented two rooms at the Hotel Provincial Jan. 10 for 4 nights, was pleased with the friendly and helpful staff. The first room I was in was too small so I requested another room, which they did so immediately. I upgraded my son's room to a two room suite for an extra $20, it was very nice and roomy, the decor in both rooms was very nice. My son was in room 324...I would definitely recommend it! I was in room 515, which is quite roomy..there is renovation going on in building 5, which 515 is in, but no big deal! I saw room 314 I believe it is, was really nice with 2 double beds, a couch and sitting area, each room is different, some large, some small, but all decorated in antiques. No cookie cutter rooms here....good prices found thru the internet, would definitely recommend the Hotel Provincial. One last thing, there is a nice courtyard with a fountain off from the hotel lobby, the rooms there would be good with your entrance to your room in the courtyard.

<Content>A decent value... This is fair value for the price ($75.00 on hotels.com).... We were here for five nights the first week in January and initially, things were not so great. I had read all the negative comments in regards to building number five, and attempted to call and verify that we were not pre-blocked into this building. We were not and I asked for any building but five. We checked-in and were given 526.... Yikes. I was nervous, and bit upset as because one, it was in building number 5, and two, it was for my fiancee and I, it had two double beds. I was assured that the room had just been renovated, and that they would get me into a queen or a king the next day. It took until the third day to get us out of that room, and the worse part, for those two mornings, it appears they had neglected to tell us that the renovation/construction was on-going... BEGINNING AT 7:00 AM (no exaggeration) each morning.... On both a Friday and Saturday mornings.... Not a way to build repeat business. 7:00 AM? Both days I phoned down, and although Tanya, Joseph, and Erica are really nice folks, the last thing I wanted to hear was, we asked them to stop, but they won't... Okay, now, that was the bad part of our stay. The great part our stay... When they did move us (to room 422)... It was a very nice room. With great motif, great bedding, great facilities in general. And again, the staff, from the three mentioned above, to the bellmen (Terry and David)... All appeared to genuinely care. So, if you're debating on whether to choose this hotel... The positives are all there... Great location, great staff, great accommodations (if you can get the right room)....

<Content>Two thumbs up It was my first time in the Big Eazy and I was nervous about finding an appropriate place for me and my girlfriends. I stayed at Hotel Provincial for the Essence Festival 2004 weekend. Everything was old and antique but very charming. This site was very helpful in making my decision. I had a king size room overlooking the street. It was very romantic and beautiful. My girlfriends stayed in the same building as I did, but they had a double room. Their room was a bit cramped but clean and comfortable. The trick to this hotel is what building you stay in. Each room/building is different. The location in the french quarters is just perfect. I would definitley stay there again.

<Content>Great, but choose your room carefully... We just got back from NO and the Provincial was an awesome place--great location, good price, lots of charm, good service. When we arrived (Tuesday night), the manager offered to upgrade us to a premium room from the standard room we had booked on the internet. We haggled the price and ended up accepting it. The room was great and we were very happy with it. It was room 423--a second floor with french doors that opened onto the courtyard. We were so happy that we decided to stay an extra night, but to do so we had to switch rooms. We got room 410, which was down a dark alley, on the first floor, under a loud staircase, and the only window was blocked off by outdoor shutters that we couldn't open. It was also right on the street and it was like New Orleans nightlife was in the room with us. I was very glad that we only had to stay in that room for one night. A woman that we ran into had similar complaints about her first floor room. So although I recommend this place as a charming French Quarter hotel, be very careful about which room you get and pay to switch if you get a bad one.

<Content>Don't accept room 311! Great hotel, real charm. Good if weird service. Only, if they give you room 311 refuse it, it's in an alley with no natural light and even worse, beside the creaky staircase to the upper level with drunk people going up and down all night. They may as well be in your room. Also, don't even think of cashing in the complimentary coctaills at the bar, unless you like drinking in a hole with clouds of smoke.

<Content>Great value in the Quarter This property is incredible for its New Orleans charm, location, service, pool and even the Resturant. The rooms are a variety of types and locations. My favorites are toward the front and open into a small courtyard.The Provincial is close to the French Market and the streetcar which make it excellent for both tourist and convention goers.The prices are up and down but if you catch a good internet special you can get a $50 weekday rate without a lot of hassle.The parking is great also - enjoy!

<Content>Hotel Provincial Great Place November 10 - 14 was our fun trip. The Hotel Provincial making it almost perfect. It was a great adorable place to stay, Courtyard, pool, small cafe and bar. The staff was friendly and helpful. The location could not have been much better. Walking distance to almost everything, and if not close enough to walk ride the need to experience street cars. French Market is a glance away, Jackson Square a few blocks as is Bourbon Street. It was great staying here in the French Quarter, but far enough from the noise and action for a family! Hotel Provincial made our trip wonderful!

<Content>French Quarter Getaway We stayed at the Provincial the 1st week of October, 2004. We had made our reservations several months before that. After reading several reviews, we called and requested not to be in building 5. We had a room in building 2. It was nicely decorated with antiques, and clean. We had no problems with our stay there. The hotel cafe was a little pricely for the quality of the food. The location was nice. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only thing we would have liked was a small fridge and microwave in the room. But we had a wonderful trip.

<Content>Very pleased with the Provincial My husband and I just returned from a week in NO and were extremely happy withour choice of the Hotel Provincial. After reading some negative comments about building #5, we requested a room in any other bldg when booking through Expedia. We were apprehensive when we arrived to find our room was in #5, but it turned out to be just fine with us. We had a window overlooking the French Mkt, and a view of the river off in the distance. The building is old, but the room and bathroom were good sized and clean. We thought it was charming with its chandelier, old style furniture and decor, beautiful courtyard, and the sounds of the ships coming into the harbor. Very New Orleans. We have stayed in 3 other hotels in NO in the past, and the Provincial has absolutely the best location if you want to be in the French Quarter. Our only complaint was the bed was pretty hard, and our non-smoking room smelled like cigarette smoke a few nights when the people across the hall were smoking, but that can happen in many hotels. We got a great rate and will definitely stay in this hotel when we come back.

<Content>Hotel Provincial was the perfect choice We always wanted to see New Orleans so decided to make it our 25th Anniversary destination. We certainly weren't disappointed. I researched several French Quarter Hotels on the Trip Advisor Web Site and picked the Hotel Provincial based on the number of positive reviews. The Hotel Provincial was certainly an excellent choice. The staff were friendly and exceptionally helpful from advising what make of Creole and Jambalya mixes were the best, to arranging tours and even calling a taxi to arrive within minutes when our prepaid Airport Shuttle service did not pick us up as pre-arranged for our return flight. The pools and courtyard are beautiful. The place is spotless. The location was excellent - only a block from Decateur Street and the River. We absolutely recommend this hotel. Our stay was perfect in all ways.

<Content>RIP-OFF!! Looking for a unique hotel experience in the New Orleans French quarter? The 90-room Hotel Provincial will give you an unforgettable experience to which only two words can apply: RIP OFF! Advertised as a 鈥渃harming court-yard getaway鈥?deep within the French Quarter in a 鈥渂eautifully restored鈥?200 year old building, the Provincial offers a number of egregious features designed to outrage the sensibilities of even the most experienced flop house residents. These include 鈥渟uites鈥?consisting of bizarre loft and windowless lower room combinations, replete with dirt and careworn d茅cor; bathroom mirrors so low you need to kneel to see your reflection; desk clerks who have obviously fired the sunset gun in the early afternoon; grisly legends of leather-clad physician ghosts wielding saws; and a general air of decay and neglect. The prices at the Provincial are higher than 5 star hotels in the same neighborhood 鈥?they obviously want to sting you for a rate that would equal 5 nights rent at a fair market rate, because nobody will stay a 2nd night in this place. The best indicator of neglect was on a small plaque outside the building 鈥?barely noticeable, indicating that the Provincial had been awarded a local prize for tasteful renovation in 1961!

<Content>Hotel Provincial is a great deal We booked through Expedia and got a wonderful room facing Chartres St. Friends of ours also booked through Expedia and got a room in Building 5, which was lovely but extremely musty. They were moved to the main building on the second day. NO had just experienced a hurricane which might explain the musty smell in a room facing the river. I would definitely stay at this hotel again, requesting any building but No. 5.

<Content>Character is good. personally, i loved the hotel provincial. we did stay in the back building, #5 and though it had it's faults, i found it charming. my spouse on the other hand, found it dingy and stale. i think he's a snob. ok, when the toilet flushed in the next room, the shower went freezing. that was wierd. -but with 15-foot ceilings, chandeliers and an enormous balcony overlooking the french market, i can deal with a few faults. i like to call it character. it sure beats your usual cookie-cutter McHotels!

<Content>Great location, especially for Cafe du Monde Wife and I just returned from NO, a little trip to celebrate our 40th anniversary. Stayed two nights in the Provincial, building 5. Contrary to some postings we were very pleased with the hotel and the assigned room. We like to stay in the older, historic hotels with the 12 foot ceilings, mismatched, but almost antique furniture, oak doors and trim, and the creakiness of the stairways. The room  bath were clean and the ac was running full blast on 70 when we checked in. Walking out the front door through the bar put us in the middle of the French market on Decatur St and just a short walk through the market to the Moon Walk, the levy walk on the Mississippi. Leave by the front door of the hotel on Chartres, turn left and it's just two blocks to Jackson Square. We'll stay here next time!!

<Content>Very good experience I spent five nights at the Hotel Provincial in February 2004. It was a positive experience and I'd stay there again. The location is very good: close to everything, but on a quiet street. My experience was enhanced by being assigned to perhaps the best room in the place: one of the rooms overlooking the street with its own private balcony. I was put there after my assigned room turned up dirty when I arrived. It isn't the most modern hotel, so it's not good for travelers who expect all the modern conveniences (convenient internet connections, honor bar, business center, etc.) It has off-street parking, which is big plus if you have a car.

<Content>Delightful and full of character If you are looking for a sterile, cookie-cutter hotel, this one is not for you. However, if you're looking for some real French Quarter character, this is a great place. It is in a quiet area of the French Quarter, but still just steps away from everything, including the Ursulines stop on the riverfront trolley.I agree with some earlier comments about building 5 - definitely shabby with views overlooking the parking lot - though I believe it is the only one with an elevator. We made a point of requesting anything but 5 and we got a charming room overlooking the Old Ursuline Convent. The hotel has two small pools and several charming courtyards - delightful respites from the pounding summer heat. I will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good hotel, shame about the bar! Excellent hotel. Very helpful at reception, but they need to get a new barman in the Honfleur Bar. He was ignorant and too busy flirting with two young ladies to bother serving us. Rooms clean, service great, fantastic location in the heart of the French Quarter, with a feeling of security.

<Content>Room Assignment Makes All the Difference We stayed at the Provinical in late March 2004. We booked via Hotels.com for a total of $149 including taxes. Our initial room was horrible--it was dank, claustrophic and stained--it's in the multi-story building overlooking the parking lot.After repeated requests, we were moved to a lovely, albeit smoking, room overlooking the pool. We greatly enjoyed the nearby courtyard and spent most of our time there. Management informed us that booking via the web will always land you in the multi-story building so bear that in mind.

<Content>great location, nice stay A hidden secret, great location just a block from the French Market, another blk to Cafe du Monde and in the quiet part of the Quarter, safe neighborhood but a few minutes walk to the wilder side. Pool a huge bonus (esp. for kids), very helpful staff, nice room/bargain price, secure property. Have bfast at French Mkt Cafe 2 blks away with live band (skip Cafe Beignet). No refrig in room but a/c is strong, they do room service when not too busy at affiliated restaurant but better places just blocks away. Do avoid Bldg #5 though for best experience. Will stay here anytime!

<Content>Wow! Charming, Friendly, Grear deal, Great location! We have stayed here twice, once in November for an academic conference, and once during the Christmas holiday season and have stayed in 3 different rooms in three different buildings. Both trips we received an unbelievably low rate ($69/$59) per night!!!! and were treated like welcomed friends! The staff was amazing, courteous, efficient, and friendly. This was consistent on both trips! The hotel is comprised of several buildings surrounding a center parking lot (great if you're driving to New Orleans where it is impossible to park) each building is charming in it's own right, unique --- with twists and turns and hidden courtyards! At night the place is especially magical with illuminated pools (2) several fountains and gas lamps! This is the true New Orleans, and the property has an authentic, old style charm and so you will not find it to be disney-esque (it really is old, not just made to feel old) or sterile. Yes, there is moss growing on the brick here and there, and it's utterly charming! You won't find the sterile immaculate opulance of an expensive, overpriced and (frankly --boring (yawn!) upscale hotel that could be literally ANY city or any country in the world. If you like cookie cutter upscale properties -- that no matter how grand all seem exactly the same --- those ubiquitous pianos in the lobby--- and polished elevator doors, this is not for you. In fact, there are no elevators. If you stay at the Provincial, you will KNOW you are traveling in New Orleans and no place else! It's truly charming. Entrances on both Chartres street (front entrance) and Decatur (back entrance) -- this is a PERFECT location in the French Quarter. It is in a very quiet section, yet just blocks from all the action and nearby attractions. The quiet is all the more appreciated because you can hear quite regularly the clip clop of the tourist buggies and horse (mule) drawn carriages. While the entire property is quiet once inside, the Decatur street entrance is busier and bustling at night, ever so slightly in an 'off-beat' way...and the front entrance is very quiet and residential. Both have security past 10/11 pm and require a room key to pass security guards and/or locked doors/gates. The small and very friendly Honfluer Bar is part of the property, and looks out on busy Decatur Street -- was recently remodeled in December 04. We did not eat at Stella (onsite restaurant) but it is classy and elegant and gets rave reviews in a very foodie town! Will make a third trip for sure!

<Content>Perfect for a single woman traveller I stayed in this hotel for a week as a lone female traveller and it was wonderful. The location is extremely central and it is possible to walk everywhere in the French Quarter - night and day - and feel safe when doing so. My room was great and looked out onto a courtyard overlooking the fountain. The staff were really friendly. I really liked this hotel and would definitely return.

<Content>Rude Staff, Shabby Accommodations What a huge disappointment this place was. The check in staff was embarrassingly rude, arguing with us over our reservations (for 2 rooms) while refusing to make eye contact or even look up from their (her) computer. Services were minimal; thankfully the Cafe Beignet and adjacent bar were bearable. The same staff member reneged on our late check-out agreement leaving us stranded for half a day. The savings did not make up for this treatment; we'd rather pay full price than face this dump again. (As with most New Orleans hotels, don't even think the website resembles the reality!)

<Content>Great value We've stayed at several French Quarter hotels (one of them was on Esplanade and really awful). The Provincial was by far the best: the room was attractive and nicely kept, the staff was pleasant and helpful, the location was excellent (in the best part of the Quarter). In addition, there's a wonderful in-house restaurant (Stella) and Cafe Beignet just adjacent. It couldn't be more convenient. Best of all, our room overlooked a beautiful interior courtyard filled with trees and a fountain. We would definitely stay at the Provincial again.

<Content>Stay away from building 5! Hotel Provincial is actually made up of 5 different buildings. We stayed in room 532, which stands for building 5 room 32. Building 5 is quite run down compared to the rest of the hotel. If, while you're checking in, you are informed you will be in building 5, I would recommend that you ask to be moved to another building or find another hotel.The staff are very courtious and friendly. The location is excellent if you are planning on staying in the French Quarter.Their cafe (Cafe Beignet) served mediocre food for breakfast. We only ate there 1 time.

<Content>This is a great place to stay in the French Quarter! This Hotel was great! We stayed here for two nights and were so pleased with the rooms for size, cleanliness, and ambiance. Very New Orleans charming. The staff at the front desk were very cordial and customer service oriented. It is very close to everything in the French Quarter and I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Hit or Miss It was our first time to New Orleans, and this hotel was a huge disappointment. Our first room had a huge dead cockroach, our second room hadn't been cleaned, and our third room was pretty dingy. But the hotel staff was very helpful and conciliatory. We ended up switching hotels but the staff was extremely apologetic and definitely tried to make up for it. Based on what others have written, I think you can have a lot of luck here, but we just didn't. If you are staying in the French Quarter, you have to expect that there is character that you wouldn't find at bigger chain hotels. And character isn't always positive.

<Content>Great 4 her first time in NO. My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary, May 2003. It was my wife's first time in The BIG EASY. This hotel has charm and romance in all it's courtyards and pool areas. Walk around the grounds and explore this place. The location is great. It is less then 4 blocks from Bourbon St. and basically next door to the French Market. The only thing about this place, is that all the rooms vary significantly. Ask about the rooms when booking. Other than that, grab a drink nearby and relax. Hotel Provincial we will see you next year!

<Content>Beware Please read this review before you make a reservation. I stayed at the Provincial both for Jazz Fest and Halloween weekend. Though I paid the same price for each of my two stays in a one bedroom suite, the difference in the accomodations was shocking. The first visit landed us in a beautiful modern townhouse style suite, followed by a musty, damp and windowless interior unit on the second visit. I was horrified to realize that a hotel would advertise and charge the same for such different rooms. The mirror in the bathroom was positioned so low I had to kneel to comb my hair, and the tub and toilet area reminded me of something only a college student would accept. If you must stay at this hotel, ask to see your room before finalyzing the stay. If not, you may have your whole N.O. experience clouded by disappointment.

<Content>Fantastic Place to stay! I took my mother here for her 70th birthday and the hotel was wonderful. We got great out of season rates in June/July and felt safe because they lock the main gate after 11pm. All arrivals must enter through the lobby. This hotel also has Several courtyards with great New Orleans atmosphere! Would stay here everytime I go to New Orleans!!!

<Content>Great Loocation Check-in was fast, freindly and efficient. Got a good deal on this hotel, and since I was by myself I did not mind getting a single room. I was in the back (500) building facing the French Market. Next time I would pay the extra for the courtyard room though. The room was clean, except for a few stains on the carpet and had nice old furniture and a great bed. I loved the lighting and the wall-paper. Makes you feel like you really are in 1890. Unfortunately the view consisted mainly of a 600 foot power line tower, which was the only real down side of this room. The hotel is in a perfect location. About a 7-8 min walk to all the action. Walking around at 3am in the morning seemed pretty safe to me as well. I had a little greater expectation of the hotel from reading the reviews here, but I was not let down either. I would stay again for sure.

<Content>Historical Provincial, A true New Orleans experience My wife and I wanted to experience the Holiday Season in New Orleans. New Orleans is right up there with San Francisco and New York City as the 3 top destinations for the Holidays.  I booked the Provincial months ago after reading the reviews on this hotel. Out of all the reviews I read only two were not favorable. Why, I am not sure. The Provincial Hotel is what New Orleans is all about. It is an historical hotel with all the charm we expected. Right in the French Quarters, yet off the beaten path, we were able to walk to every site we wanted to visit. We chose not to rent a car. Something I think everyone visiting New Orleans should do. We loved the history, the charm, and the beautiful courtyard located right outside our door. The room was as historical and charming as the hotel, with the right mix of antiques and modern amenities. Every night we looked forward to going back to the hotel for rest and relaxation. Our hotel faced Chartres Street but we had no problem with that at all. It was nice to hear the horse (mule) and buggy rides come down the street. If you don't want to experience the true history of New Orleans stay at one of those modern, highrise hotels outside of the French Quarter. If you truly want to experience the true history and charm of New Orleans, stay at the Provincial.

<Content>Good choice for a single female traveler I stayed here for 5 nights and loved every minute. The hotel has a charm - ask for a room overlooking the courtyard if you can! The location of the hotel is fantastic - right in the heart of the French Quarter. I felt completely safe here - it was great to be able to walk to Bourbon St just a few blocks away!! Another great thing about this hotel is the valet parking - worth every penny as parking is otherwise a nightmare. Fab, fab, fab - if I ever return to New Orleans I shall be staying here!

<Content>Loved this place! This hotel was wonderful! Our daughter was married in the courtyard and it was absolutely beautiful. It was like stepping into a time warp or a page from a book. The staff (with the exception of one) was very nice. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>What's not to like? Arrived at the Provincial after a week in New York and my, what a difference - the hotel and the top end of Chartres St was so quiet!!! We were right at the front of the hotel facing onto Chartres St and the only time we were disturbed was by some roadworks one morning. It's hard to believe the hotel's just two blocks from Bourbon St.The hotel was fine - the room was clean, and despite it's olde worlde style the furniture was well kept. Met a guy in 'Nawlins' who described the Provincial as being the best night's sleep in the quarter and he's not wrong - the beds were probably the most comfortable hotel beds I've stayed in. The staff were polite and very helpful - no complaints.

<Content>Not what I expected After reading the review on this site, I expected the hotel to be charming. We were given a room in the 500 building, on a main street across from the French Market (room 521) it was noisy and it was in pretty sad condition - stained bedspread, beat up furniture. Since our friends were in the room next door I decided to try it. The next morning I asked to move, and to its credit the hotel was very accommodating. I was given a small apartment-like room in the 100 building. It was behind the restaurant, clean but not stunning, and much quieter. A definite improvement. Later in the day our friends were moved to a room in the 400 building that had just been redone with new carpet and furniture. They said it was a little noisy which we agree is only due to being in the French Quarter (which never sleeps). While I liked the location, I won't try this hotel again.

<Content>Hotel Provincial is Excellent  This was my 3rd stay at Hotel Provincial and I recommend it highly to anyone who is looking for a reasonably priced hotel with excellent location and friendly staff. The rooms in the back portion are particularly nice and quiet (seperate building from the main part of hotel) and very roomy.

<Content>Really enjoyed Hotel Provincial! A group of 9 recently stayed at the Hotel Provincial . Staff was very friendly and answered our questions with a smile. Rooms were comfortable and quiet. We enjoyed the courtyard each evening before and after supper. Please be aware, there are no elevators at the hotel, if this is a problem, as for a room on the ground floor.

<Content>just wonderful My husband and I booked the Provincial after reading reviews on this website. We were not disappointed with a thing! You are greeted warmly upon your arrival; the staff is always helpful with directions, suggestions, and reservations. Our room was charming (and right by the courtyard...each morning i thought it was raining...it was the fountain!); the location of the hotel is perfect. The Provincial is close enough to walk absolutely anywhere, and nestled away enough to be quiet and relaxing. This hotel is worth every penny, and frankly, a great value for the French Quarter. We look forward to going to New Orleans, and the Provincial, again!

<Content>Great weekend in New Orleans This was our 3rd year to come to NO for a Saints game and it may have been our best. My husband and I came with 3 other couples. All of our rooms were unique and different but were all beautiful. Ours had a balcony overlooking Conti St(i think) and the others each had their own courtyards outside their rooms. The New Orleans charm was wonderful!!! It was the perfect location and staff was informative on where to go. Very romantic hotel and will definately try to stay here again.

<Content>Great location, very quiet. We were greeted warmly upon our arrival, the concierge gave us good information about the French Quarter and the surrounding areas. The staff was freindly and helpful with all of our inquires. The hotel has 2 nice pools and an inviting spacious courtyard but their restaurant and bar did not serve alcohol. Also we were supposed to have a refrigerator in our room but did not, forcing us to make a number of trips to the corner grocery store for beer and ice and having to use the bathroom sink as a makeshift cooler. The location of the Provincial was ideal. Far enough away from all the craziness of Bourbon Street but close enough to walk to for everything we needed. We received a great price for our room, when we come back to New Orleans we would not hesitate to come back to the Provincial!

<Content>Great stay at Provincial This hotel really added to our anniversary visit and my wife's 1st trip to NO. I asked for a nice room and ended up w/ a Queen suite, for no extra chg. This had 12 ft ceilings, large chandelier over the bed, recentlyrenovated room plus a sitting room, and fluffy feather pillows. The staff was very nice and the location is terrific; on the quieter side of the Quarter but near Jackson Square and 1 blk from French Market. Booked online for $110 or 120. This place felt more like an apartment which is what you want from a boutique hotel in the quarter. Enjoyed NO and my wife will take great memories from both the city and the hotel.

<Content>great place We stayed here 25 years ago and wanted to see it again. The rooms are old, but the charm is there. We had a room that opened up right to a lovely courtyard. The attendants were very polite and helpful. They actually told me that if I could, get a coupon at the rest stop in Louisianna for a coupon. This saved us more than half the rate! We were there mid week and the location is perfect for walking everywhere...I even felt safe there.

<Content>Beautful Hotel in the Quarter We stayed at the Provincial for Southern Decadence. The hotel is perfectly situated, just two blocks off Bourbon Street and one block from the French Market. The room overlooked the pool and was clean and spacious. The staff were friendly and helpful. We will defintely stay here again.

<Content>Hotel Provincial is a treasure My boyfriend and I just returned from a trip to New Orleans to celebrate my 40th B-Day. I chose the Hotel Provincial after a lot of research, including the reviews from this website. We were not disappointed. The location is wonderful, close to the French Market, Cafe DuMonde and the path to Riverwalk right on the Mississippi. It was a great place to come to back to after a day of sightseeing or an evening listening to music (Kermit Ruffins plays at Vaughns Thursday nights and is not to be missed). The large pool and courtyard were beautiful and well maintained, our room was charming and we found the staff to be friendly yet unobtrusive. We would stay here again.
