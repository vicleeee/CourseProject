<Content>Bring earplugs! Stayed at this hotel for one night before driving north to Oviedo. The hotel is very well located, within easy walking distance to the Plaza Mayor and close to a lot of shopping/dining. Good locale for older individuals- I travelled with my parents (in their 70's), and they got around easily. The street where the hotel is located can be very noisy at night (welcome to Madrid), so I recommend either bringing earplugs or asking for a room not facing the street- don't know if that's possible. Like mentioned before, the staff is friendly and unintrusive. Breakfast is fine, but you can probably also find some goodies if you venture out into the streets. We rented a car from Hertz, and their location was a short cab ride away from the hotel, which was great. I'd stay here again, especially if I want to be out and about in the center of Madrid's action, and/or want to get some shopping done at the Corte Ingles or FNAC.

<Content>Staff less than helpful Fairly basic hotel, but well located in the centre of Madrid. Free tea  coffee facilities brought up to room on request, but if they're going to offer this facility, why not have tea and coffee in the room as standard? Breakfasts very ordinary.We had a poor experience when shortly after we had checked out and were waiting in the foyer for the coach to the airport my wife went out for a bottle of water and had about æ‹¢200 stolen from her purse in a street near to the hotel. As we were about to leave for England there was no time to report the matter to the police (when we got home the Madrid police wouldn't accept the report by phone or email). However, we told the hotel receptionist.The hotel now refuse to acknowledge that anybody remembers the matter and as a result, we can't get written confirmation of the crime, so our travel insurance won't pay out. Thanks, Carlos V!

<Content>Great value, in the heart of madrid, felt safe Stayed for 5 days in June while on a business trip. Location is fantastic, right in the heart of madrid's busy shopping district and within easy walk of plaza mayor and the palacio royale. I felt very safe here, the staff were friendly and helpful without being intrusive. Breakfast was good, transfer back to airport was much better than the cab we took on our way to the hotel - I'd recomment the hotels transfer, its a large cab you get anyway (5 seater). Room was a triple with no view but was clean, fairly roomy, pleasant decor, good bathroom. Shame about no tea and coffee in room but there is a very cheap mini-bar stocked with a good variety of drinks and nibbles (water was cheaper from there than form shops on the street!)Thoroughly enjoyed our visit, will definitely be going back, mainly for the location and ease of access to whatever you want.

<Content>Great Location I just returned from my trip to Spain and I had spent 5 days in Madrid at this hotel. I found the room to be small, but clean. I was traveling alone, so a lot of room for just me was not required. I was on the 3rd floor, facing the street, so I had a little balcony, which was nice. I do have to say that it was fairly noisy at night though. Given that I was there in October, I did not need the air conditioning and tried to keep the balcony doors open for the fresh air. One night I had to get up and shut them due to noise.Aside from that, the hotel itself is in a wonderful location, very central to sights, shopping, the metro. I did not eat at the hotel, but the dining area looked nice. The one feature I did enjoy was the access to the internet in the lounge area. As a single traveler, it was nice to be able to access my email abroad, to keep my family updated on my status.I found the staff to be very nice and accomodating. I did make use of their shuttle service back to the airport for 10 Euro, which I thought was a great deal. I would stay here again!

<Content>Great The Carlos V has a great location, right in the heart of Madrid, very close to all the main sights, attractions and nightlife. Despite this it was quiet. On entering the room, got a surprise that the 5th floor odd number rooms have double doors leading to a lovely roof terrace.The room was comfortable, nothing flashy but clean. The staff were all friendly, the continental breakfast was good quality. There was free internet and the hotel will arrange airport transport for a modest fee - 10 euros each.Definately recommend this hotel for a short break in Madrid. Very good.

<Content>Good value and terrific location We stayed at the Carlos V for four nights and found it a very good value. The rooms are small, but very clean and quite adequate. I had read reviews on this site about noise from the street so we asked for a room away from Preciados (the busy pedestrian street at the front of the hotel. We had no noise problems whatsoever.Some tips: the hotel has a beautiful dining room but we only used it for happy hour (two drinks for the price of one) as you can get a less expensive breakfast within a block or two of the hotel (try Pans). The only small thing that bothered me about the stay was that the hotel literature in the room said you could get complimentry coffee by calling the front desk. The front desk told us to call room service to ask for the coffee, but when the coffee came we had to pay a service charge. It was not a lot of money, but just sort of cheesy for them to give you free coffee while you still had to pay a fee for getting it. Other than that very small thing we enjoyed the hotel and highly recommend it.

<Content>Very noisy at the front Standard business hotel with no frills and in a reasonable position fairly near metro stations and a long walk from the Prado. The info pack says that complimentary coffee and tea will be served in rooms 24hrs a day, but that is not as convenient as having tea making facilities in the room. There is a charge for a safe key. If you are in a room at the front of the hotel you are guaranteed a sleepless night. Pedestrians, emergency vehicles and dustcarts kept us awake throughout The reception staff responded promptly and courteously to our request for rooms on the other side of the hotel, but someone has to have the noisy rooms.

<Content>Great location It was a comfortable room, but no view. Nice hardwood floors and flat screen TV. The staff was accomodating and it was one of the best hotel showers i've ever had. The location was the best part. All of the great attractions were within walking distance or a very short metro ride. The Palace, Plaza Mayor, the Prado and lots of shopping.

<Content>Quality Central Hotel We arrived at madrid airport and were picked up by aerocity. Aerocity dropped up off right outside the hotel door, checked in no problems. Hotel is in an excellent position and 5 mins to sol. Room was big for 3 people and a very nice bathroom. No view in the room but wasnt bothered as we were only in the room to sleep. No coffee or tea facilities in the room but we asked at reception and they brought the tray to the room with a kettle and cups and all different flavoured teas and coffee. Minibar was very good value and stocked with water incase you forget to pick up a bottle before you go back to your room. Safe is just under éˆ§? a day. Checked out no problems and they held our cases whilst we went for our last walk around madrid before returning and being picked up right outside the door by aerocity. Book this hotel if you are having a sightseeing trip. Will be returning.

<Content>An Average European Hotel My wife and I stayed recently and the hotel was ok. We were greeted by a friendly staff from the moment we checked in. The room was okay, a little small but it was clean. The TV in the room had a 15 screen and our window overlooked an interior courtyard. It was quiet at least. The bathroom was also small but clean. We had a couple of drinks at the bar but the bartender had to be tracked whenever anything was needed. Overall it was just an average location. It was clean and functional. The prices were good, and it's location was excellent. It was a 5 minute walk to Plaza Mayor and shopping every direction once you walk out the door. The only knock I have on it was it lacked any character.

<Content>Noisy and overrated I was there with a friend. We were combining a work conference with a short city break. We booked early bird specials online and had email confirmation. When we checked in they refused to accept this and charged me a higher rate for a worse room. The hotel is in the centre which is fine, but a word of warning, it is in an extremely noisy location and I hardly slept. I know some would say that its expected in a city centre location but the windows do not reduce any noise. I have stayed in city centres such as Barcelona and Prague but the hotels had much better noise proofing. The airconditioning was also very noisy. Rooms are gloomy and outdated. Best Western needs to spend some money on giving it a face lift!The staff weren't very helpful. The inservice brochure states complimentary tea and coffee as there are no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms. Unfortunately we had to wrangle with the staff who charged us for it on our final bill.Disappointing. I will not be returning.

<Content>Love the Convenience We stayed in Best Western Carlos V for 3 nights. This small but classic hotel gives no sign of poor maintenance apart from its old air conditioning system (window type), which could be a little noisy in the quite night. One minor advise, try to avoid room that is facing the lift as it could be very noisy when someone shuts the lift door.The hotel is strategically located right in the middle of the city where Royal Palace, Plaza Mayor, Gran Via Station, Sol Station and Callao station are all within walking distance. more so, El Corte Ingles Department store is just right opposite of our hotel. Apart from the good location and price, the hotel staffs were friendly and helpful. Overall, I would say this is a clean and cozy hotel with friendly and helpful staff. I would certainly recommend to anyone.

<Content>Great base for a visit to madrid Had a really good time in Madrid as usual - we chose this hotel for it's central location and weren't disapponted in the slightest.The room was spacious, clean and had recently been modernised - great shower and loads of hot water was always available - the only slight complaint / fault I would highlight was the bathroom was very compact - lots of things in a very small space. The shower screen / overbath shower may prove difficult for older guest or those with mobility problems.Breakfast was fine with a large selection of buffet items as well as cooked if you prefer.A couple of minutes walk from Sol and Gran Via so you can't really be any more central.Thoroughly recommended

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel was great! My husband and I stayed here for just one night mid-June, but it was wonderful. It was updated, nice sized room, and a large bathroom. We had a room on the top floor and it had a large balcony with table and chairs. We were just sorry we could not stay here longer! We took the high speed AVE train from Barcelona (which was top notch) and got to the hotel around 11a.m. Our room was ready so we dropped our luggage and headed out for the sights (we had to cram as much in as possible because we had to get up and leave for the airport by 3:30a.m. The hotel was great in booking a taxi for us for the airport, we have no complaints about the hotel, it was great (even though we weren't there 24 hours.)

<Content>Location doesn't get any better We absolutely loved our stay here. After sharing a few jokes with the front desk about how likely it is that only Americans stay here b/c it is a Best Western, we were assured that wasn't the case. It really is a very pleasant hotel. The centrality of its location is unsurpassed-- just between Calloa and Plaza del Sol, adjacent to the shopping street Preciados and a short block to Gran Via, it just doesn't get any better. Don't miss out on the local restaurants-- the night staff did us well with fantastic recommendations. I thoroughly recommend staying here. Don't be concerned about street noise-- go ahead and take an exterior hotel b/c the balconies allow for pleasant fresh air and a nice view into the street activity. It's not a loud area. Use the metro to get back to the airport-- at only 2 euro per person, it significantly beats out the airport shuttle and/or a taxi for the price. Enjoy Madrid!

<Content>Good Location, Clean Hotel This hotel was in an excellent location. Rooms were clean and bathrooms modern with a good shower and plenty of piping hot water. We booked 3 rooms for 7 people. 2 doubles and 1 triple. The 2 double rooms were on the top floor with a terrace. Very quiet in both of these and the terrace was nice to sit out in the morning, although we didn't go to Madrid to stay in our hotel room.Triple room faced the street so they had all the nightime entertainment!! We booked an aerocity minibus from the airport which dropped us at the top of the street. This was no problem as our cases had wheels. The return minibus picked us up from the door.I would stay at this hotel again due to location and cleanliness. Only downside were the uncomfortable pillows, but after consuming several glasses of a good red Rioja each night, it did not affect my sleep!  Madrid is very easy to get around on foot, it is a fabulous city. I recommend Casa Alberto located on Calle de las Huertas, just near Plaza de Santa Ana. Fantastic food and wine with a great service. Really reasonably priced too. One area to avoid, especially at night is Calle de la Montera off the Gran Via. We stumbled upon this street late one night and it was very seedy. The police even pulled up next to us and told us to be very careful. This is the only downside to the city and should not put anyone off. Every city has seedy areas and as long as you know where they are you'll be fine. Felt very safe day and night.

<Content>Overated Hotel We stayed for three nights and were not impressed. Located close to Discos, Friday and Saturday nights impossible to sleep. Also, there is no free shuttle to airport as we were lead to believe. It cost us 57 Euros to and from airport. Good location but not worth the price. Would not stay there again. Another hotel we stayed at was cheaper and superb quality and provided free shuttle service to hotel.

<Content>Great hotel in a great location! We've now stayed at this hotel four times and are still very pleased with it. This time we had a room on the 5th floor with a spacious balcony, which was perfect in the warm weather. The rooms are modern and spacious, with all the amenities. The first floor lounge area is very inviting, and there is free internet access. Staff (all but one) are great: very helpful and welcoming. The hotel is situated in a pedestrian only area near the Puerta del Sol - perfect location! We stayed at the hotel for a few nights, checked out to visit some other cities, then checked back in for a few more nights. My only negative comment: don't stay in a room near the elevator. We were in Room 505 on our last stay and hearing the elevator noises all night was quite disturbing.

<Content>Good location, basic clean, but room was unappealing This hotel was in a fine location in the Centro, but the room we had was a dark cell on the interior of the hotel. One small window overlooking the alley. The beds and pillows were basic. Everything was clean, but it was pretty much a motel room for a price that was not much less than the Hotel Velazquez which gave us a true 4 star room and was two steps up in quality. We paid $120 Euro and did not consider this a bargain and would not book again

<Content>Great location- rubbish Pillows The location of the Carlos V is very good. It is a side street off the main square Peuto del Sol. The staff were very helpful and there is free internet access behind the dining room- which helped us alot to get around the city. As we had managed to get a deal for flights and 2 nights at this hotel for around æ‹¢150- which given how clean the hotel and the fantastic weather- we considered this a bargin! We expected it to be noisy so I wouldn't recomend staying there if you have to get up early- but I think you would be pushed to find somewhere in Madrid that would be quiet and easily accessible. The only complaint that I have is that the pillows where really lumpy- which aggrivated a neck complaint slightly - but we spent a lovely morning at the Medina spa which help to sort it out ;-)

<Content>Balcony Entertainment! On our first trip to Spain this was the hotel we stayed at while in Madrid. I loved the location but it was hard for the taxi driver to find..after running the meter up, he finally decided we needed to walk to the door because he couldn't drive the taxi to the front door...The desk staff was friendly enough...helpful when needed..they carried our luggage to the room (nice). The room was very clean. Stocked mini bar was helpful since we forgot to buy water while out...One thing I was not prepared for was the ALL night entertainment right outside our window! It didn't bother us as we were so tired..bring earplugs if your a light sleeper.The breakfast was a good way to start our day..plenty of good choices..the cafe con leche is the way to go!All in all we enjoyed our stay there.

<Content>Loved the Carlos V An excellent hotel for a quick trip to Madrid. Rooms are small but adequate. Very clean. Same goes for the bathroom.Staff were very friendly and it was an excellent buffet breakfast.The key factor above all had to be the location - it was perfect. Very central, could walk everywhere if you wanted and the metro was less than 5 minutes away if you wanted to go further afield.I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Location I have stayed at this hotel on three different occasions. I love the location. The rooms can be variable, but still quite decent. The last time we were there the bathroom was quite small, but the great service of staff and location make up for that. I guess the fact that I have stayed at this hotel on three different occasions speaks for itself.

<Content>Great for a city break This is a great hotel for a short city break and is an ideal base for exploring Madrid.Due to the central location, we managed to avoid all public transport (a welcome relief!) and were able to get to all the main sites on foot.The hotel is undergoing renovation work (it's not at all intrusive) and so, some rooms are more modern than others. Upon arrival we were allocated a room at the back of the hotel (420) and were really disappointed.. views of a brick wall, shabby carpets and bed linen and the world's smallest shower.We asked to be moved and were given the next available room the following morning. Room 207 was in the freshly renovated part of the hotel and was lovely- all wooden floors, voile curtains, proper views of the street and a decent sized bathroom to boot!(It has to be said that the showers in both of the rooms were excellent... very powerful! ... And that the beds were rubbish! No plush pillows  mattresses here!)Despite having a room that overlooked the street, we weren't really bothered by the noise outside... we heard the rubbish being collected and the odd noisy person but it wasn't intrusive... I'm sure that if staying in summer, sleeping with the windows open would be dreadful.Tea  coffee making facilities aren't immediately available in the room but ask for a coffee kit and you'll be provided with a kettle and all you need. (We went to the bar and asked for fresh milk too...)The communal areas of the hotel are quite charming and well appointed. Breakfast is good - standard cold buffet European fayre on offer. The hotel has a bar but we didn't make use of it; there are lots of fantastic bars and restaurants nearby... Internet access is free (the computer is in the bar/lounge/breakfast area). This is a great touch as it makes online check-in possible.. you don't have to pay for the printer and there are no restrictions regarding usage.The staff were friendly and efficient and we were really happy with the service we received. You can book an airport transfer from the hotel for éˆ§?0 but they only come on the hour with the minibus doing pick-ups from the other Best Western hotels in Madrid... we decided not to bother and booked a taxi.We looked at lots of hotels before plumping for this one and, after wandering around and seeing most of them, were really glad with our choice.We're going back to Madrid later this year and we'll be making a beeline for this hotel... it's great!

<Content>Location, Location, Location If you want to be in the center of it all in Madrid, the Best Western Carlos V is a great place to stay. We were able to step out of our room at 11:50 p.m. on New Year's Eve, enjoy the Puerta del Sol celebrations at midnight and be back in our room at 12:15 a.m. Subway stops for two different lines are located within a five minute walk of the hotel, and it is easy to walk to many of the major sites. Also, you can find anything you need, including groceries, at the El Corte Ingles department store just across the street. The hotel is only five stories; we had two rooms on the fifth floor, facing the back of the hotel, so our rooms were very quiet, even on New Year's Eve. (We preferred peace and quiet to a view of the street.) Rooms are small by American standards but quite comfortable by European standards. One thing to note--the beds are very firm, and that bothered a few members of our family. Bathrooms were spotless and actually had a tub as well as a shower! You don't always find that in Europe. The room decor was simple but tasteful. The lobby is small but lovely, and the breakfast room was a great place for morning coffee while glancing at the International Herald Tribune or enjoying great Spanish red wines after a hard day of sightseeing. The front desk staff was wonderful, with a special shout-out to Raphael, who staffed the front desk late afternoons and evenings. His English was excellent, and he booked us a flamenco performance at a place just a five minute walk from the hotel. All in all, we felt the Carlos V was great value (approx. 100 euro for a double room), considering the location and amenities. We'd definitely stay there again on a return trip to Madrid.

<Content>Great Value with a Great Location! LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! Hotel Carlos V is in the heart of Madrid! We had a nice size room for three people - two twin beds placed next to each other and a small bed/ sofa for the third person. Bathroom is large for a European Hotel, nice shower with lot's of water pressure and hot, hot water. Staff was wonderful. Our room was noisy due to the late night parties, people walking the streets, and there is construction next door, adjacent to our room. El Corte Ingleshas a wonderful Christmas display and the singing went off every hour.It was noisy but it was so festive that it was a part of the delight. We stayed for 7 nights and got a great rate though a Travelocity- hotel and airfare package. At El Corte Ingles, the department store across the street, you can go to the basement floor and there is a supermarket. You can purchase jamon ham, cheese, bread, fruit, chocolate, snacks, drinks etc. There is small refrigerator in the room stacked with mini bar stuff, we removed some of these items(with permission from the staff) and placed our items in it. The hoteloffers a coffee pot with coffee and tea but you must ask for it.Although they advertise satellite TV, the only English speaking station is international CNN which repeats their programming very often. There is a community computer that you can use with access to the Internet. I would highly recommend going to price fix restaurants offered usually in the afternoon. For a price fix of about 10 Euro youhave a choice of beverage)(wine, coffee, soda, etc) 2 course entrees and a choice of dessert. Great Value! Madridians rarely go to sleep early, so there are always someone walking by the hotel at any time of night. No Auto traffic on the street where the hotel is located so you do not hear any motor traffic except delivery trucks at night, butpeople talking and celebrating all night long! I would recommend a twoday Madrid Vision pass. There are two routes which you can hop off andon the bus. They give you head sets and speak in at least 6 different languages. The Airport shuttle was fine but if you do not have much luggage you can easily take the Metro and save a little money. Enjoy Madrid!

<Content>Gross! I must have been missing something, but I did not share the positive experience shared by many reviewers or this hotel. We had an interior room - which may have been our mistake. The room was small and dirty, with one window that opened to a ventilation shaft. The bathroom was even smaller - I could barely stand in the shower. The hotel guests and maid staff were noisy. All of this, for a not so cheap price tag.The one positive is that the hotel was convenient to the Metro and the Royal Palace/Opera area. But, for the convenient location, I think that are better hotels for the same price if not cheaper.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel Stayed at the Carlos V for 5 nights in early November. Our room was spacious,spotlessly clean and had all the usual facilities.The location is ideal...between Gran via and Puerta Del Sol...smack in the middle of Madrid and within walking distance of all the tourist sites.The staff couldn't have been more attentive,courteous and helpful...this includes reception, dining room and housekeeping.Nothing was ever a bother to them.Always ready to help!!!Cold buffet breakfast is of a very high quality and served in a large, beautifully appointed dining-room.The airport shuttle service is both reliable and cheap( 9Euro per person)Internal rooms are very quiet. If you're a light sleeper call the hotel a few days in advance of your arrival and request Una habitacion interna. These rooms face an internal courtyard,DON'T have a balcony but are very quiet. Rooms with balcony face a popular street which can be very noisy until early morning.I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anybody.

<Content>great location What a great location to discover all the sites in madrid and the culture of the people! The Prado, Renia Sofia, Puerto del Sol, Chueca, etc. are all within walking distance. The hotel staff spoke english, were patient and very accommodating. While not the same standards found in the USA, the rooms were good (make sure to request an inside room to avoid the noise on the street.) Finally, they do offer a hotel shuttle to and from the airport which is very convenient and costs less than a cab and makes less stops than if you reserved the shuttle directly through Aerocity. Just know that if they say 20 minutes, it may mean longer.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at The Carlos V in February for 5 days. The choice of City was decided by our teenage daughter , the hotel by both parents having reviewed comments on this site and the fact that we had used this Hotel chain before.The staff were always helpful and welcoming - I liased with them beforehand and booked a pick up from the Airport. We tended to use the Hotel for breakfast , as most guests did. The breakfast was extra - but good value. The eating area also had free internet access as well.We were a bit worried beforehand having read comments about the noise - but we never felt it was a problem. We requested a quiet room when we booked the room and that is what we were given. The room was a bit cramped for 3 people but it was never a problem. I did have to request extra pillows on our arrival and they were rapidly provided.Madrid is a busy, vibrant and welcoming city - The hotel is on the doorstep of Sol so you get a sample of the atmosphere straight away. The hotel is within walking distance of many tourist attractions but if you need to use the Madrid underground it compares very favourably to other Capital Cities.There are plenty of eateries - we found a Spanish chain called VIP good value for a family of 3. There are several within a 10 minute walk of the hotel.We intend to return to Madrid and would have no hesitation in using the Carlos V again.

<Content>It was fine... Stayed here for 3 days in October. It was a nice hotel - nothing amazing. In a great location if you like the hustle and bustle of Madrid. Room and bathroom were clean and the Wi-Fi worked well. The only thing is make sure you ask for a room in the front of the hotel. We were in the back and our window opened to a view of the air conditioners, the building and the other interior rooms.

<Content>Fab! I love Madrid- my 4th time there and definately not the last.Sateyd at the BW Arosa Last year which was quite a dissapointment.Carlos V- perfectly located right between Puerta del Sol and Gran Via- just in front Corte Ingles- supermarket. Easy acces to everything. The hotel is located in a narrow street- rooms on lower floors might experience noise- but hey you are in the centre of the city. The hoteltransfer actually works- just call the hotel upon arrival in Barajas. Staff was very friendly, helpful and attentive. Stayed in top floor room (does not get any better), roof terrace with wonderful view of Madrid. Small room (usual european standard). I could go on- will be the place I will stay in the future on my annual visit to Madrid.Take a walk in Chueca area - wonderful place.Outside Madrid: Toledo is a must, El Escorial and vally of the fallen- highly recommended.Madrid is definately one of my favorite cities, and i havent even tried any of the museums.

<Content>Great Location, Nice Hotel, Good Price This hotel is conveniently located on a pedestrian street (which made it somewhat quieter) but was somewhat difficult for our taxi driver to figure out to get to itéˆ¥î›’uckily it was early in the morning so he just drove down the pedestrian street! Room was a typical euro style (small) room but was nice. The staff was really helpful and spoke good English. Only stayed a night but was an easy walk to almost everything in downtown Madrid or the Puerto Del Sol Metro stop.

<Content>Great location, nice hotel, value for money Just returnered from 3 nights in the Best Western Carlos V in Madrid. Hotel is very central - 5 mins from Puerto Del Sol the central area and just off the main pedestrian area. Appx 5 mins from Grand Via and all the theatres. Walking distance to all major attractions. Metro station just down the road.Hotel was clean, tidy, friendly and well located. Room (115) was larger than we expected with 1 double and 1 single bed plus sofa. Small balcony to front (not large enough to sit on)over looks street and buildings opposite. Room had air con and bath/shower. As you would expect for a capitol city it is busy and noisey, however once we shut double glazed doors to balcony we were not distured by any on street noise (we were there Weds to Sat). Breakfast buffet was fine - usual cold meats, cheese, pastries plus cereal and fruit. Highly recommend Madrid Vision bus trip (No 1) to take in all the sights and get an idea of where everything is. Botanical gardens are nice, Palace is amazing and not to be missed along with Prado museum. Good places to eat apart from all the local tapas bars are VIPS and The Wok and are marked on the Madrid Vision free maps. Great hotel, great location - would stay there again.

<Content>Good location, clean  I stayed at this hotel for one night only as I was in Madrid for a business trip. The staff was helpful, the room was clean and comfortable as well as the bathroom. The only negative point was that there was nothing to see from my window as it was showing inside the building (people knowing Spanish buildings know what I mean) and there was no daylight either. The location was good and really central: close to shops, metro station, etc... a few minutes walk from Puerta del Sol. It was definitely good for value and I would stay there again.

<Content>Could have been better the first impression was depressing. The bed cover, carpets and curtains looked really old. But as we saw it more, it wasn't that bad and the rooms and the hotel in general was quite clean. The air con looks dated again and I was worried about catching Legionella pneumonia. They could have redone the carpets and curtains to show that they have looked after it well.Breakfast was depressing too.The only positive point was the location.

<Content>Nice location, great airconditioning, airport shuttle I was very pleased with this hotel - it was an abnormally hot May (temperatures in the high 30's) and the effective airconditioning was most appreciated. The room was very pleasant with everything (including combs provided). There is a van to take you to the airport for under 10 Euros, which is good to know. Breakfast was excellent, and the public computer was free.The street is a pedestrian area, which keeps the noise out (though the effective airconditioning takes care of that anyway!), but elderly people, as well as those with a lot of luggage might find the uphill walk a bit daunting if they take a cab. Try to get the cab to drop you to the UPPER end of the street.I have to admit that one reason I was extremely pleased with this hotel was the price - I had an excellent deal through Expedia and was only charged $75 a day (including breakfast). When I tried to extend my stay I was told the price would be $150 a day (perfectly legitimate - I understand this was the regular price). So for $75 it was an absolute steal. For $150 it was nice.

<Content>Excellent hotel and location This is an excellent choice for tourists. Location in pedestrian area next to Puerta del Sol. Staff was helpful, spoke English. Our room was on the 2nd floor and faced the street. Air con worked GREAT - it was 100 oF outside, but our room was nice and cool. Breakfast was nice, but a bit spendy, proabaly wouldn't do that again. But we will definately stay here again if we're in Madrid. We (me, husband, and 12 yo son) had a triple room, and it was spacious enough. Also, taking the metro here from Barajas airport was relatively easy w/out tons of luggage. If we'd had lots of luggage, it would have been more of a challenge. You have to change twice, but the metro is extremely easy to use.

<Content>Carlos V - Great Location, Better Price The Carlos V certainly is in a great location, within a very short walk to a ton of shopping (to include the huge Corte Ingles right around the corner) and other main avenues; also very quick access to the Metro.Room was of typical Eurpoean size (ie. fairly small), but exactly what we were looking for as a place to rest between our other activities. I booked directly through the Best Western website and was early enough to get their 'Early Bird' special, which meant a rate of about $80 per night. Awfully good for downtown Madrid in July. They also had a convenient shuttle service to the airport that picks up right in front of the hotel (not free, but significantly less than a taxi fare).Will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Great location; pitiful air conditioning We spent 4 nights at the Carlos V during our recent summer trip to Madrid. Our room at this hotel was perfectly adequate and the breakfast, though at little expensive at 11 euros, was tasty. The main issue was the air conditioner in our room. It put out just a trickle of cool air and only worked away while were were in the room. This was because the electricity to the room is turned on and off by putting the room key into a holder by the door. Otherwise we found the location convenient. The hotel is located in a pedestrian shopping street, less than 2 blocks from the Metro.

<Content>comfortable small hotel in the heart of the centre I stayed here last January for 3 nights. Location of the hotel is great. In a small street next to a big shopping street and close to the subway. Room was quite small but very comfortable. Small but goodbathroom and with a french balcony. I only paid like éˆ§?5 a night which I believe is very cheap for what you get. Breakfast is not included but it only costs you éˆ§? per person. I had breakfast in the hotel once and it was pretty good. Had a pleasant stay here and wouldcertainly recommend it.

<Content>Pretty good I go to Madrid very often and it is the first time I have been in this hotel. The hotel is quite basic but clean and, if you like the city center, in a perfect location. The room is not big but for 3 or 4 nights is more than enough. I paid 77 Euros and I am totally sure that you can not get a better hotel in a better location for this price.

<Content>Great hotel - beware of renovation noise. We stayed in the Carlos V for a long weekend after reading the reviews on this website, and we would agree with all the positive comments made about the hotel.We stayed in room 216, which was a large room which had obviously been recently renovated - laminate floors, tasteful decor and a pristine bathroom. Staff were very friendly, from the front-desk man who rushed out to get our bags as soon as the taxi drew up outside the hotel, to the cheerful and attentive waiters in the lovely breakfast room.The only problem I can see with the Carlos V in the near future is the renovation work being carried out in the building next door. On our last morning we were wakened up at 7am by the noise of lorries delivering air-conditioning units, followed by VERY loud drilling in the wall behind our head. This went on all morning - if it had not been our last day, we would have had to move as we could barely hear each other speak. However, when we went to breakfast, there was no noise disturbance in the breakfast room, which is in the middle of the building. So I would say, go to the Carlos V - it really is as good as the reviews say - but specify that you do not wish to be anywhere near the renovation noise. I'd say, any room with -16 in the number would be a definite 'no'.We'd be happy to visit this hotel again, in a quieter room.

<Content>Great location but a few problems Recently stayed for 5 nights with 2 friends for my husband's 60th. We had stayed before a few years ago so knew the location was great, walking distance to most things we wanted to see and taxis nearby when legs gave out. However it was important to us that we had a king size bed and that Casa Patas (a flamenco house) had been booked for a meal and the show at midnight as a birthday celebration.This was all confirmed by email, so we felt quite relaxed about everything. However, the bed was definitely not a king but standard size. The usually silent older gentleman on reception explained that it was a Spanish King size, yeah right! Strange that the king size bed we had in Barcelona was huge! Just something to be aware of , we ended up changing to a twin room so that we would both get some sleep. Also the booking had not been made but we went there the next day and the nicest waiter organised it all for us, even reserving us a table right by the stage. So it was fine in the end. In fact it was an excellent night aided by several bottles of cava. To be fair, the hotel had also been in touch to book for us but we wanted to be sure.Staff a mixture of very friendly and super-surly. We didnéˆ¥æª› want to make lifelong friendships but it is nice just to be acknowledged when you pass through reception. Best staff were at breakfast which was good with very nice tortilla and good selection. Rooms fine, clean and not too small for a central hotel.Overall would recommend and stay there again as it is just so well positioned and good value. We booked through Venere so nothing to pay until we left.

<Content>Fantastic Location  I stayed one all-too-short night at this hotel in March 2007. I will definitely stay there again on my next trip to Madrid. The hotel is fantastically situated just a 3-minute walk from Sol on a largely pedestrian side street right in the thick of things. Bargain pricing makes this an outstanding value. I booked a room directly through Best Western for a great rate; around 100 Euro/night. Although the room was somewhat small, it was typical of any old world European hotel. My room had a nice set of french doors opening to a small balcony overlooking the busy street below, which was utterly charming and made me feel intimately part of the city. Wireless internet access was fantastic - the connection was secure and the access was *free.* I still can't believe it. The bathroom was pretty tight, but perfectly useable.The staff was very friendly; the hotel had a family-run feel to it, although I can't say if it really was or not. Front desk employees would open the door for me, and the bellhop consistently went out of his way to be helpful.If you're looking to have all of Madrid's history, culture, food, and drink at your fingertips, you could not pick a better place than the Carlos V. Charm, comfort, cleanliness, and outstanding value, in a perfect location. Highly recommended.

<Content>Superb hotel - ideal location We stayed in this hotel on the weekend of 17 March for 3 nights and the location was just ideal. We used the metro from the airport and it took around 50 minutes all for the measly price of 1 euro each!!! We asked for a room at the back of the hotel to be away from the noise of the street and the hotel were only too happy to oblige. Rooms were clean, mini bar well stocked and shower was great. Breakfast is buffet style from around 7.30 to 11am and was good too. If I ever return to Madrid I will stay here again, you can't fault the location and if you book in advance you can get a really good a good rate.

<Content>Carlos V every time we visit Madrid. Location is perfect. Easy to walk to pretty much anything you'll want to see in Madrid, and 2-minute walk to the metro if you need it. Rooms are clean and pleasant. Ask for a balcony, several of the rooms have them. The people are extremely pleasant, but they'll leave you alone if that's what you want. Amazingly, they remembered our room number every time we walked in, and the place was totally booked. We left a 2-E tip on the pillow every morning for the maid, as usual, but we got a thank-you note back from her every day -- something that's definitely not usual! We didn't have the breakfast this time, but we have in the past, and it's pretty good. More fun to go find your own though.

<Content>Excellent Location with friendly staff We booked this hotel for a long weekend. It is centrally located to all the main attractions in Madrid. It is walking distance to the Plaza Mayor, Shops, Restaurants,Bars, Real Palace, Retiro Park and Art Galleries. Take good walking shoes!!! The room was very comfortable and included a fantastic shower, wonderful balcony (we were lucky enough to have a 5 piece string orchestra outside each night) and a well stocked mini bar. The buffet breakfast was tasty. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We realised that you will need to know the basics in Spanish as most people did not speak much english but this made it more enjoyable trying to 'get by' in Spanish. Overall really enjoyed our trip.

<Content>A bit noisy, but excellent Hotel and Staff Stayed here for a 3 night break, were given rooms at the front of the hotel which had a balcony, room/bathroom/beds etc were really clean. Mini bar was well stocked, plenty of towels in the bathroom which was lovely and warm. Bathroom also had a hairdryer. The staff were excellent they could not do enough for you.The breakfast room/bar was in a really lovely room and the breakfast buffet was good.At night there was a lot of noise from the street but it did not bother us enough to want to move, though we did hear other people ask at reception to be moved.The location of this hotel is great, there are plenty of shops all within walking distance. I can't rate this hotel and its staff highly enough. We had a fantastic stay here.

<Content>excellent location for shopaholic! My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in January 2007.Thelocation was great,step out of the hotel and you are in shopping heaven!-all pedestrianised. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the Palacio Real which is well worth a visit. The hotel is very clean and comfortable-nothing flash but perfectly adequate.

<Content>fantastic hotel My boyfriend and I stayed in the best western carlos V hotel for 3 nights at the end of Jan 07. What a hotel! I was told about this hotel by friend and looked on trip advisor and read all the positive reviews so I looked around online and got a good deal with ---.com for double room, 3 nights for 210EUR. We have stayed in many hotels across Europe and this was without doubt the nicest one we have ever stayed in. FANTASTIC central location, big spacious immaculately clean room with lovely bathroom. Fully stocked minibar. Hotel is right beside the metro (which also gets you to the airport in 35 mins,with only 2 changes), main shopping area, pubs, restaurants and gran via/plaza mayor and sol metro stop. There is a shuttle taxi/bus which you can call when you get to the airport and they will pick you up and bring you straight to the hotel for 9EUR each. I cant talk highly enough of this wonderful hotel...I will be recommending this place to all my friends and family. If you are going to madrid- book teh Carlos V, I promise you wont be disappointed!!

<Content>Good Location My wife and I stayed for 5 days in January 2007.We were happy with reception staff who were helpful. The 2nd floor room faced out to the street and was very noisy during the night due to loud revellers otherwise the room was very satisfactory.The bar/ dining room/ sitting room/ computer work station was very pleasant - the breakfast was good and the waiters attentive.The location was ideal as we could walk to all the tourist attractions and restaurants.We travelled from the airport by Metro and the hotel is close to the Callao Station. We travelled to the airport by mini bus booked at reception.

<Content>Perfect Locations! The hotel is perfectly located right in the heart of Puerta de Sol on a side street (not so much noise). It's steps away from the Metro and all the shops, bars and restaurants! El Corte Ingles is just steps away which is nice. There's nothing you can't find there! The room was a good size with a normal hairdryer (hate those dated box kind!), safe, clean linens, LCD tv, balcony, minibar and clean laminate flooring (hate the carpeted kind and tiles are cold!). Bath was clean with a 6' long bathtub! The staff was very friendly and they had free internet in the back of the restaurant (we paid 7 euros for 30 min in one hotel in Paris!). So definitely nice pluses! If we ever go back to Madrid, I would definitely stay there. One minus, the beds aren't the best but in all the places we stayed this was the most comfortable one. Enjoy!

<Content>Good Choice Stayed here on a mid-week break and chose the hotel because of it's central location.The hotel is a bit dated but perfectly adequate with a better than average bathroom for a budget hotel.We did not try the food here as being in the middle of Madrid, why bother?If you are intereested in the Art Galleries, they are about a 30 minute walk or Atocha is the nearest metro stop and just two stops from Sol where the hotel is.Located on a side street it can be a bit noisy but the position is very convenient.I would stay here again.

<Content>Centrally located, good value for money Stayed at this hotel in Oct 2006, very happy with the choice. Location could hardly be more central. Prado, Royal Palace, Retiro Park all within walking distance. Reasonable sized room, bathroom very clean. Be careful with your booking - we found that breakfast wasn't included so that was quite a costly extra. However, the dining room is very nice, just been redecorated by the looks of it  the waiters are very friendly, especially Domingo. There is a PC at the end of the dining room with free internet usage which was a bonus. To get to the hotel we did the following:-Walked ( a long way ) through the airport ( all indoors ) to the Metro station. Bought single-journey tickets ( just 1 euro each ). Had to change lines twice so a Metro map is essential. Got off at Sol. Hotel is about 400 yards from station so walked it from there.

<Content>Good location / surly staff My partner and I stayed in the Carlos V for three nights at the beginning of November 2006. The location was excellent in that the hotel is situated within walking distance of the main shopping area and landmark sights such as the Plaza Mayor and Palacio Real. The metro station Sol is only a few minutes away as are numerous bars and restaurants. Initally I found the staff to be competent but surly however on the morning of our departure, when the airport bus which we had booked the previous day failed to show up at 9am as arrranged, my opinion changed. Despite assurances from the desk staff that the bus was on it's way it failed to arrive. We were eventually informed at 9.20 am that the bus was not coming and that a taxi had been called. The taxi eventually arrived at 09.35am and when I complained about the service to the desk staff my complaint was greeted with an indiffernet shrug and I was told I was lucky to be getting a taxi and that I was only being charged the bus rate.............While I appreciate that the desk staff were communicating in broken English and certain misunderstandings can occur I frimly believe that their attitude bordered on rude and they certainly made a tense situation worse. I would definitely advise anyone booking the airport bus service to allow themselves at least 1 hour transit time to the airport.

<Content>Great if you don't need sleep We just returned a week ago from Madrid. We think this hotel is just fine for it's price - nice room, dining room, etc. but must warn people away from a room on the street. The small window was not noise proof and we heard extremely loud noise from five floors up - could even hear conversations, and arguments. This is a street with street performers, bars, musicians and continuous crowds of people leaving the subway and shopping and the noise continues all night on weekends- and I mean all night- until morning.The location isn't bad but you are not in a picturesque location and the plazas are being torn up - not a pretty picture at this time.Also, don't expect charm from the desk staff - the waiters at breakfast are friendly however.

<Content>A big let down My husband and I stayed here for five nights last month and were very disappointed by both the room and the staff. During our trip we visited Barcelona, Madrid, Seville and Granada - every other hotel and its staff outshone the Carlos. Both the men on reception was unhelpful - even when paying and booking out!I had asked for a quiet room but we were on the second floor right at the front of the hotel - in a tiny room with very bijou bathroom, luckily we didn't have a cat to try and swing!I should have asked for a move but hindsight is a wonderful thing!We didn't have breakfast there as we were out and about early for visits to Segovia etc. so can't comment on that aspect.Despite other positive reviews this was not a good choice for 50 somethings who like to sleep at night, enjoy their space and have normal expecations from an organisation like Best Western: nvere agian!!

<Content>Superb hotel in an excellent location Just returned from a 4 day break at the Carlos V. We had a triple room on the 4th floor at the front of the hotel. Although the room was spacious and clean with excellent air con, comfortable beds (3 x singles) and sufficient wardrobe/drawer space, the bathroom was on the small size. Noise from the street was not a problem for us. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and spoke good english. Breakfast at 9 euros consisted of fruit juice, cereal, fresh fruit, cold meats, tortilla, breads, pastries, unlimited tea/coffee/hot chocolate; bacon and eggs, etc were at an extra cost. We used the hotel transport from/to the airport which cost 9 euros each; you telephone the hotel upon your arrival and they send a small minibus to collect you; you need to book the return journey the day before departure. The hotel is centrally situated with numerous tapas bars and restaurants close by, we were spoilt for choice. There was so much to see in Madrid that 4 days was not enough and if we do go back ,we will definately stay at the Carlos V.

<Content>Great location and friendly service i can't tell you how convenient the location was. it's so close to every major attraction and tapa bars and yet it's couple blocks away from the puerta del sol(the center) where there's a huge construction is going on right now. (Please be adviced and book your hotel away from the puerta del sol area) and yes the rooms located on the front of the hotel looks very pretty but the streets can be very noisy. my room was located on the back of the hotel and i had no problem with the noise what so ever. the room was very clean and it had a mini bar. the bathroom was really tiny but it's very very clean. the front desk people are so eager to help you with any questions you have.

<Content>Very Satisfactory Wonderful location. Close to subway and able to walk to Plaza Major. Furnishings a bit tired but clean and had everything needed. Breakfast buffet was included and was very good. Staff was helpful when needed. Our balcony opened onto street and could see El Cortez Ingles which had entertainment. A nice touch. However, garbage trucks start very early and people are out very late and very loud so ask for inside room if noise bothers you. My husband slept through everything but it was difficult for me. We walked everywhere and found many restaurants and shopping very close.

<Content>Great Value - Friendly and Obliging After a conference I caught the train from Lisbon to Madrid and spent 6 happy nights at this hotel. (Overnight train also great) I was travelling alone and the staff made me feel very welcome. The complimentary Coffee Pack allowed me to enjoy the comfort of a cup of tea in my room after a long day exploring the nearby museums and art galleries. (I ran out of time before I ran out of sights I could walk to.) Day Trips and transport to the airport were all arranged with a minimum of fuss by the concierge. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip, they made it all so easy.

<Content>Agree with the majority of guests !! We spent 4 nights at Hotel Carlos V at the end of June with our 2 daughters. I chose it because of all the positive reviews  we were NOT dissapointed! We had 2 rooms on the 4th floor, on the back side,  noise was not a problem for us. Our bathroom was nice, but a little small, however the girls had a large bathroom. The staff was very helpful  most were able to speak some English, although we used our broken Spanish also. We bought the 10 trip Metro pass  used it to go many places, leaving from the Puerta Del Sol station which was a short trip down the hill from the hotel. The only excitement we saw at that station was the nude protestors , one morning. They had only horns on their heads  were protesting the bullfights !!! The location is convenient to lots of shopping  tapas, with a wine  cheese store very close. All of us agreed we would stay there again !

<Content>Not so great I had heard many nice things about this hotel, but when I actually got there, I was disappointed. The hotel is in a central area, which is good. However, there is much noise from the adjoining streets, and I was on one of the higher floors. Also, the queen sized bed that we paid extra for was old and groaned and squeaked in an awful way... not what you would expect out of a Best Western. Put your money somewhere else, such as in the Spanish Sol/Tryp properties nearby.

<Content>Great location We stayed 6 nights at the Carlos V at the beginning of May 2006, it was clean and convenient to the city centre and galleries in Madrid. I thought 9 euro was expensive for the breakfast considering what was served but the best English help we had was from the staff serving breakfast. We requested a quiet room in the back and we got it. Our room overlooked an interior courtyard and the only noise was from the water drain pipes occassionally. The room was clean except for the dead cockroach we found one afternoon. The bathroom was very small but maybe that was due to the interior room which was smaller than the front rooms.During our stay there was some very friendly and helpful front desk staff and some surly not so helpful or friendly staff, not unlike most hotels. However we had what we needed and no complaints on the billing.For the price it was okay and i would recommend it as a stay but not for breakfast.

<Content>Centrally located Very happy with our stay at the Carlos V. Hotel Staff very friendly and helpful. Only two blocks from Metro and 3 blocks from Plaza Mayor. Lots of little Tapateria's and cafe's for everything from wine with breakfast to a couple of tapa's before heading out. I'd also recommend the Easymap Walking Guide for Madrid, everything you want to see is within a 15 minute walk, and many within 5 minutes. Adios

<Content>Not Bad Be forewarned -- no airport shuttle! We found that out the hard way when no bus showed up after a half-hour of waiting at the airport. We ended up in a taxi and our driver, too, had trouble finding the place. The trip cost about 30 euros, which we figured was about right for airport-to-downtown in a major city. And yet the hotel does have a convenient location -- near the metro, restaurants galore, shopping, etc. Calle de Preciados right outside -- lively place for evening paseo. We took the metro everywhere and were prepared for pickpocketing, but didn't encounter any trouble and felt safe everywhere we went in Madrid, even late at night.We stayed over the long May Day holiday weekend and were concerned about noise, but considering that our room was on the second floor, over the street and near the elevator, things were relatively quiet.We loved the breakfast buffet and ate there most days -- convenient and worth the 9 euros considering our hearty appetites. (Delicious tortilla and sweet rolls). Plus, they served real brewed coffee, not just espresso.Furnishings were a bit tired and worn, but toiletries, appliances, etc. were all supplied and up-to-date, and the staff was helpful and spoke English, in case you can't get by in Spanish.

<Content>Good Hotel, Well Priced but beware of pickpockets at SOl Metro Stayed in Carlos V in Madriod. Location is very central with easy access to Metro and other facilities such as restaurants and shops. Initial room overlooked street and was noisy but there was no problem in getting a transfer to another room at the back of the hotel.Breakfast is éˆ§? per person and for what you get is expensive. The breakfast room is well decorated, the service is good but the range of food is quite limited.The only problem about this hotel is in using the nearby metro, where pickpockets are commonplace. On the way in from teh airport I caught a woman trying to pick my pocket, and on the day I left my wallet was stolen by a pair of young female pickpockets, despite the fact that I was aware of the situation and had my wallet in a pocket which buttoned.Tony

<Content>Great little hotel - but bring your earplugs The Carlos V is a very nice little hotel, centrally located, with many sights, restaurants and shops within walking distance. The front desk staff speaks excellent English and are extremely helpful.The room we had for five nights in April was of fair size by European standards, but the furniture carpets and walls had a very tired air to it. The bathroom was up-to-date and everything was very clean. We chose to have a room with view on the street and we were prepared for the noise with good earplugs. Over the course of the day and night, you get a variety of street noise: early morning delivery trucks, midnight street musicians and parties, 2 am garbage pickup. As a matter of fact, earplugs were needed in most hotels we stayed at in Spain and several postings mention this. We had breakfast twice at the hotel but I am not sure it is such a good value (it was not included in our rate). The other mornings, we simply walked to a little cafe around the corner from the hotel and had a great breakfast for half the price. Of course we had to contend with the many smokers having a puff over the meal - something one has to get used to in Spain. I would definitely go back to the Carlos V and I highly recommend it. It is nice, clean, perfectly located with nice people running it.

<Content>Good Average Hotel Hotel was very clean and very central. Reception staff friendly and helpful. Rooms a bit on the small side but sufficiant. Bathroom was spotless. Can be a bit noisy at night if you are near the lift. Don't pay the extra for breakfast, there are plenty of good places to eat - starting at E1.50 for coffee and roll.Beware of taxi costs from the airport - our taxi driver took over an hour to find the hotel- even with his sat nav on! - and the meter was running all the time. Quite costly. The hotel is set in a pedestrian precinct, and the driver just kept driving round in circles around the one way system.Brilliant location for shopping.

<Content>Madrid Long Weekend Stayed for 4 nights at this hotel, non smoking room on second floor.I would say that the standard is well above what we were expecting for a 3* hotel, staff were very friendly  helpful,the hotel was clean and well appointed, and the location is excellent.Only one negative comment (not the fault of the hotel), it is really noisy at night, so I would advise asking for a room at the back of the hotel, unless you don't actually need to sleep.

<Content>Mixed opinions This hotel is in a perfect location for shopping, dining and sightseeing. The staff was helpful, the cafe breakfast good, and the room mostly clean.However, we did not like having to leave our key at the front desk when we went out. We also hated that even with the Do not disturb sign on the door, the waiter came in to check our mini bar while we were out. The second day, the maid ignored the sign and came in to clean the room. We felt like this totally invaded our privacy and we did not like that feeling. .

<Content>Don't expect shuttle at airport As so often stated, this hotel is in a great location. I had a non-smoking room on the second floor facing the air shaft, so no street noise, but there was a constant low noise/vibration like ventilation from below, but I'm not sure what it was. I was only staying one night so no problem but I think it would get irritating after a day.The room was similar to many in European hotels in older buildings except larger than many. Bathroom was recently renovated--high step into tub. Free internet access in the bar.No late checkout, but will hold bags. Staff was nice.Do not believe website that states shuttle runs hourly from Airport Terminal 1. I never quite got an answer, but I think you have to book it in advance and then it will pick you up on the hour. It was no trouble booking the return trip a day in advance and it was a great deal at E8. I was the only passenger and dropped efficiently at the door of Terminal 2.

<Content>Wonderfully positioned The Carlos V hotel is in the best spot imaginable. Just far enough from the main stretch to be a little quieter but amongst everything you will need. And while the transport system in Madrid is top notch, the hotel is in walking distance to everything we wanted to see. And we were able to visit everything else on one of the Madrid Vision bus tours. The area is safe, and as a female I was able to leave my partner at the hotel and wander round alone and feel safe. Highly recommended!

<Content>Just fine! Just returned form Madrid and the Carlos V is just fine form a city break in the wonderful city of Madrid, good time to go if you're into shoes as the sales were marvelous and we ended up bringing 4 pairs home with us. We had a family room which was a good size,very hot until we turned the rad down. Breakfast was good and included in our price. My husband and son opted for bacon and eggs on 2 mornings and that was added to the bill, wonderful hot chocolate served too. The bathroom was quite small but had plenty of towels and a wonderful magnifying mirror! Great location for sightseeing very close to Sol square and Corte Inglais good shopping there to Madrid is the up and coming city in Europe for us I think especially with budget airline fares.Yes I would stay there again well worth the money via expedia it was approx æ‹¢250 for 3 people 4 nights BB you can't go wrong!

<Content>Great hotel, great location We had a 3 night stay at the Hotel Carlos V and would definitely stay there again. The location is excellent and you can walk to all the main sights (including the Estadio Santiago Bernbeu, but be prepared for a long walk ... we got the metro back!).The hotel itself was spotless, excellent buffet breakfast and our triple room was more than adequate. We did overlook the pedestrianised street so it was noisy at times but it wasn't a problem.All the staff were really friendly.We got a great price, through Expedia, which included breakfast. Thoroughly recommend it. And Madrid is a great city for a short break.

<Content>Just the Job! My wife and I stayed at the Carlos V for two nights in Jan, the location of the hotel is superb and for what we paid the hotel itself was very good value, staff were fine, the room was clean and had a good bathroom. it also had a tv, mini bar, and ours had a little balcony to look out onto the street below. we used the metro to and from the airport, it is one euro per journey anywhere on the metro which we thought was great value! it took about 30mins from the airport, the closest metro station to the hotel is the Sol, we had a poor map and it took us a little while to find the place after asking a few people so make sure you get good directions from the tube stop, it's only about 500 yards but the area is very busy.Madrid is a lovely city with many cafe's, bars and shops.

<Content>Carlos V hotel - good choice Comfortable 3 star in ideal central location with minibus airport transfer. Had a triple room as mum with 2 children (9 and 10) for one week over new year. Triple room at the back clean and spacious (compared to Paris, Vienna, Amsterdam city centre 3 star hotels have visited). Quiet (even with new year celebrations) no view, bath and shower, tv, lots of heat and hot water. Lift. Pleasant buffet breakfast included. Internet access. Will go again.

<Content>Excellent Location For a long weekend and first visit to Madrid this was an ideal location. In the pedestrianised area, close to two Metro stations (Calao and Sol)giving good access to all the major sights/sites either by (cheap, efficient) Public Transport or on foot. Using the Metro we were in our room in about 70 minutes of touching down! The trip involves two line changes which involve some walking and stairs so you might not enjoy it if you have heavy luggage. We chose to use a shuttle bus service the hotel arranged for our departure (8 euros each), very efficient and easily organised. We had the buffet breakfast and found it good quality and reasonable value. With better weather we would have looked for more interesting alternatives after our first morning.The room we had, at the back, was quiet, clean and well maintained. We thought the bathroom was better than 3 star standardThe staff were all cheerful, friendly, helpful and with varying levels of good English.Overall the hotel contributed to an enjoyable break.

<Content>In the middle of everything I found the location to be good for a first time stay in Madrid. The main department store was very close, and every hour on the hour, the music and the loud speakers blarred. The staff was friendly but not totally honest. I asked if the room was a non smoking room and they said yes. I smelled stale smoke when I entered the room but didn't say anything. When I walked down to breakfast the next morning, I noticed that the doors on the floors below had non-smoking signs on them. (If you want a non-smoking room, make sure that the sign is on the door). The breakfast was very good and included some meat and cheese as well as pastry. Be very careful in the Plaza del sol as I had to outsmart a group of pickpockets. One guy was rubbing my leg while another tried to distract me. I kept my hands in my pockets where my wallet, money, and passport were until they gave up and acted as if they had made a mistake. Also, beware of the pay phones as I got doggy doo on my ear when I attempted to use one about two blocks from the hotel. There is a great bakery/cheese store/deli/wine store combo just around the corner with very friendly people. They will uncork the wine bottle if you ask. Hotel was clean but did smell of stale smoke as mentioned earlier. Supplies in bathroom were plentiful and included a toothbrush, which was good since mine broke in half while there. Shower is hot. Again, location is perfect for first time visitor.

<Content>Love Carlos V, Madrid My sister and I stayed at Carlos V when traveling in Madrid - it was such a deal. The staff was friendly and went out of the way to help us. The location was ideal and the rooms clean and comfortable. Much nicer than the four-star hotel we stayed in while in Barcelona!

<Content>Good location for 1st trip to Madrid Spent 3 nights here and found it perfectly adequate. It's not much to look at from the outside, small reception area on street level. Room was typical, nothing special, certainly clean with a nice bathroom with good water pressure. With the windows closed and A/Con it was quiet at night. My husband prefers to sleep with open windows, but that's usually a problem in most city hotels. The breakfast room, lounge was lovely. The buffet and staff were the best part of the hotel. The reception staff was not so friendly but certainly not rude. The location is great for a 1st visit to Madrid. It is within walking distance to Plaza Mayor and Grand Via on either side. Personally, having done the tourist thing, I would never want to stay in that part of the city if going back. I don't see what is so great about busy touristy areas. I think the area around Velasquez looks so much more civilized.

<Content>Excellent service, great location Upon arrival the hotel staff welcomed me warmly. The room was average in size, but very clean. The WC was small, but clean with excellent water pressure. Maintenance staff was excellent - the room was spotless every day. The location couldn't be more perfect. The hotel is in the center of Madrid, close to shopping and restaurants. Buffet breakfast was filling and good. The hotel also offers a shuttle to the airport at a very affordable price.

<Content>Good value In the heart of Madrid's shopping district the hotel doesn't look much but once inside is absolutely fine. A clean bedroom, nice bathroom, comfy beds and air-con. The dining room was being refurbished when we went in August so breakfast was served in our room. Limited breakfast to rolls, croissants, ham and cheese so no fruit or yoghurt, but this may be due to the refurbishment. Very friendly staff. We had a back room so the view was of the back of other buildings. Corridors were carpeted so no footfall noise. Close to both the Palacio Real (8 minutes) and the Prado area (20 mins) if you want to walk but has 2 metro stations within a minute/2 minute walk.

<Content>Wonderful Breakfast Our room here was so small (after going to many smaller cities with big rooms) but while you're in Madrid you don't usually spend much time in the hotel anyway (right?). The location was excellent and the included breakfast was well worth the trip to the first floor in the morning. They also had access to the Internet. The rooms were clean and provided good air conditioning but only big enough for the bed and a nightstand. Given the price, the hotel is a good value and I will stay here again.

<Content>Great Location The Best Western Carlos V is located in the historic area of Madrid so it is easy to get around to the different sights. The room was a bit small and the bathroom even smaller but it was worth the price for a short stay. The breakfast included was very nice and worth taking advantage of.

<Content>Absolute gem Carlos V was a gem of a find. The location at Puerta del Sol was excellent. The rooms were old Madrid excellent. The desk staff, dining room staff (especially Domingo (funny, helpful, great English), and the cleaning staff were superior. The hallways and rooms sparkled. We did not have a view from our room, but I wanted a quiet room and was given an interior room with no view. This was great. The bathroom was updated and large...with fluffy, large towels. Internet availble for no charge. That was a real plus. I booked through Best Western, but the great price was also available on the Carlos V site.

<Content>Perfect for the single female traveller Never having been to Spain, I trawled the net for recommendations on hotels etc and found this hotel (and my Barcelona one too!) on TripAdvisor. This Best Western couldn't be in a more perfect location for a single Asian female traveller! It was within short walking distance to the best museums, shopping and parks. The area was extremely safe (and believe me, I'm the paranoid kind of traveller) and walking back to the hotel every night around midnight was no problem as it is in a very busy area and always plenty of people around at all times.The hotel itself was a little dingy -- had a little musty kind of smell as some old buildings tend to. The service was mixed - depended on who was on duty. Breakfast was also cheery and the free internet access in the lounge a very welcome one. The air-con in my room worked great and the bathroom adequate. Highly recommended for single travellers who want to be in the centre of everything and still remain safe and secure above all else.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at the Carlos V Hotel during May 2005. We had been traveling around Europe and had stayed only in 4 star hotels. This was our last stay and our only 3 star one.... We were a little worried that, after being highly disappointed with other 4 stars, this 3 star would be awful. However, the Carlos V is quite cute and couldn't be better located. Walking distance to Sol where you can catch the metro. Or you may choose to walk all around Madrid downtown from Paseo del Prado to the Palace. The staff is really friendly and kind. However, be aware that the famous waiter Domingo is toooooooooooo friendly sometimes and you might get overwhelmed by his continuos questions and commentaries. Some people love to be saluted and interupted many times during breakfast, but we didn't. Rooms and bathrooms are clean and comfortable. Probably above european average, but belove US average. We've read in some reviews that rooms facing El Corte Ingles are noisy, but we had one and had no problems.

<Content>Carlos V--A once loved hotel in Madrid. We stayed here last week on the recommendation of a friend who had stayed often in her past, and loved it. A rude staff runs the place now that it's a Best Western. Carpet hasn't been cleaned since Franco died, bathroom the size of 2 phone booths, we moved 3 times to get a functionning air conditioner ( temperature was 100 last week in Madrid ), and our terrace was exactly 9 inches wide. A very expensive hotel even for Madrid that certainly does not deserve 3 stars. Stay elsewhere.

<Content>Happy memories of the Carlos V We booked at the Carlos V by phone to Best Western from Sydney, having read the reviews on TripAdvisor. We received a confirmation by E-mail before I had hung up the phone. We had an inside room which was totally quiet and, despite the snow outside, was beautifully but (unlike some Spanish hotels and most of the galleries) not suffocatingly, warm. Breakfast was a pleasure and the location is, of course, superb. As one reviewer has observed, the staff on reception were a trifle mixed but we had little occasion to trouble them and, when called upon (eg for a taxi to the airport), they were helpful and efficient. Our eight-night stay at the Carlos V was the nicest possible introduction to Spain. We have very happy memories of it,and would certainly stay there again, taking care, perhaps, to stipulate for an inside room even though the rooms on the street with balconies may be somewhat more posh.

<Content>Terrific location and value We spent three nights here in April, in a triple room which was very comfortable for three (three single beds), and had a nice bathroom. It was on the back of the hotel and very quiet. The staff are very helpful and gave us excellent recommendations for dinner. Breakfast is very good and the hours are very forgiving if you sleep late. The location is best of all - walk to the Prado, the Palacio Real, and to many stores and restaurants. The bar is a nice place for a drink at night. This was an ideal spot for seeing Madrid.

<Content>Highly recomended stay My Wife and I (at the time to become fiance) stayed in this wonderful hotel in the centre of Madrid just a minute away from the Puerta de la Sol thoroughfare (translation....door to the sun). You cannot find a better location really, bus and metro routes are a minute away and within 30 mins walking distance is all the cultural venues, i.e the Royal Palace, all the art galleries, theatre's and museums as well as what I percieved as the shopping heart of the city. Sited on a popular noisy pedestrianised street (AC is provided but we had no need in February as it was snowing) I can imagine this as being the best option for those who are not that bothered about getting eight hours sleep per night, but when your in a vibrant city like this then sleep is an optional extra. There is the El Corte Ingles department store a matter of yards down the road which has a handy and very reasonably priced supermarket in the basement also a good number of bars and coffee shops nearby for sudden urges of sustinance. The breakfast is outstanding and the service is the best I have witnessed in Spain. We also managed to pay a visit to the Bernabeau to see Becks, Figo, Zidane and co beat Celto Vigo 4-1 via a touts ticket bought outside the stadium on the day (a tip...take the tout and the ticket he is selling you to the ticket office and they will verify it for you, unofficially of course!) It was a great experience. Incidentally if you are vegetarian the hotel staff advised me of a great veggie reasturant just round the corner from the hotel, I cannot remember its name but it is just north east of the hotel, five minutes walk. My Wife would kill me for not knowing the name as this was where I proposed to her on her birthday (28 February) but after midnight so being a leap year, slight chliche!. Overall if you find yourself staying in this highly underatted city you cannot go wrong here.

<Content>great location The Carlos V is in a fantastic location, and provides great value for miney. The night clubs at the bottom of the street, all of 300m from front door are fantastic, and bounce all night. A metro is just round the corner, the staff are friendly, breakfast ample and the beer cold.

<Content>Great Central Hotel Stayed here for three nights and thought it was a terrific hotel. Right in the pedestrian area of the City, especially good if you like Shopping.All the staff were friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was excellent, with a very good choice of food. The added bonus was that it was served until 11.00am which is great if you've been sampling the Nitelife of Madrid!!!

<Content>Loved it I am not the person who usually writes reviews, but we liked the place so much that I have decided to add my opinion also.Great location. Exceptionally nice staff. If we wanted to go to see the show or on tour to a different place, the best would be chosen for us, and the only thing we had to do was to show up at the arranged time downstairs. Great breakfast. Very clean and comfortable room. I would definitely consider this hotel for myself or anybody who I know in the future.And by the way, I found this place on this webside based on multiple positive reviews. Appreciated.

<Content>A nice hotel We booked a double room well in advance at the best western website and got a very good offer. We also found that the price of the room rose by about 10% if we booked at a later time.The website states that there is a shuttle bus running from the airport everyhour to the hotel at 6 euros per person. When we arrived at the shuttle bus station, there was a man asking us for 7 euros one way to the hotel. At first, we thought that the price in the website might not be up-to-date. So we took the bus. After we arrived at the hotel, we asked the clerk at the reception for the price. He said that it should be 6 euros! So, be aware if you're also taking this shuttle to the best western hotels in madrid. But, anyway, this transfer service is a convenient means, otherwise, you may need to change at least 2 times in the metro to go from the airport to the hotel.The hotel room was not too small but not too large. The toilet was clean but the TV is tiny. However, there were many English channels. Our room was facing the pedestrian zone, so there was some noise from outside even at 3 a.m., especially on Fridays and Saturdays.The hotel is centrally located. It is in between two metro stations, Callao and Sol. You may reach the museums by taking the metro. The Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor are within walking distance. I would recommend the famour restaurant, Botin, which is near the Plaza Mayor. Make sure that you book the seats as it is always full. The breakfast is a continental one which is just enough. The only thing that we may suggest the hotel to improve is the variety of food available in its breakfast.On the whole, we agreed that our money is worth spent in this hotel.

<Content>Great Little Hotel We have just returned from a long weekend in Madrid where we stayed at the Hotel Carlos V. The hotel is well positioned in the centre of the tourist area, being just off the Puerta Del Sol, and it is in easy walking distance of all the main attractions. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms basic but have everything you need and bathroom very well appointed. Lovely bar/breakfast room.

<Content>Great Location and Value I echo the reviews of Trip Advisor. After doing quite a bit of research for affordable, clean and safe hotels, my friends and I chose the Carlos V Hotel. The hotel was clean, modern and in a wonderful location in Central Madrid. Being a first time visitor to the city, it gave us a great base for tourist attractions during the day, and great access to restaurants and bars at night. The hotel was quiet, the housekeeping service was wonderful and all in all we couldn't have been more thrilled with our room. We booked several months in advance and had a great deal on our triple room. Not much of a view or luxury amenities, but compared to the other three star hotels in the area, we're confident we got the most for our money. Without hesitation, if you're looking for a reasonable room and comfortable accommodations, you will enjoy the Carlos V.

<Content>Great bargain if you search around Excellent location. Fresh continental Breakfast substancial. The danish pastries were so nice we would take one to eat later on! You could also pay extra and have bacon/eggs etc. The reception was very friendly, and all spoke excellent english. If you don't mind the noise, the balcony rooms at the front were lovely. I bought some earplugs for 60c and slept much better. Saturday night was very loud, but it quietened down more for Sunday and Monday. Be warned that although on a pedestrianised street, the shops still get their deliveries by vehicles in the morning. Room nice size and bathroom lovely. Although we were not allowed to keep a room for a late departure, they kept hold of our suitcases for us, and we were free to relax in the comfy sofas on the 1st floor  read courtesy papers/magazines till time to leave.

<Content>Great for the money We enjoyed our stay here. The room was small as expected but clean and cosy...and the balcony was just as big as the room. Too bad it was so cold outside, in mid-February. The t.v. was tiny and didn't have many channels, only 2 in English...CNN and BBC. The bathroom has all new fixtures, the water was always hot and the pressure was great. The location was excellent...step out to the shops and a minute away from Puerto del Sol! The guys at the front desk were all very friendly and helpful. The second floor lounge and bar/ breakfast area are tastefully decorated. The complimentary breakfast was just enough - sliced meat, cheese, pastries, breads. They have a computer with internet access in the same area. The price is great. Would stay here again.

<Content>Good Location The best location in Madrid. The staff is friendly, The breakfast very good, the room a bit old but very comfi. We could not find anything wrong with this hotel, it's a simple and good little hotel. If you don't like noise ask for a room at the side of the hotel thats not facing the street. We stay there for two (none consecative) days at the end of November (2004) and for the second day we ask for a room in the back side and it was very quite. If we will visit Madrid again we will stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great hotel and better location!!!! We read all of the reviews and as they indicated, this hotel has a great location. Its centrally located to many attractions as well as two Metro Stops (Sol and Callao). We had a room with a balcony overlooking Maestro Victoria St. and Corte Ingles. The room was small but very clean and the bathroom was big enough. The salon were breakfast is served is beautiful and thethe staff was very friendly especially Domingo, who made us laugh during our breakfast. Its a hotel w'll definitely stay again a strongly recommend.

<Content>Great location, but... As all the reviews indicated, this hotel has a great location. Although the room was very small for 3 lady travelers, the hotel salon served as a great retreat. The salon is a beautiful room where breakfast is served each morning and in the afternoon serves cocktails at a resonable price. It was a great place for meeting and talking to fellow travelers. Be prepared though for the noise from the street below at night as this hotel in right off of Sol. Since we were there over the week-end it was quite like being in New Orleans during Mardi Gras! As long as the night time crowds and noise don't bother you, the location is great as the Plaza Mayor is 5 minute walk as are all major restaurants and transportation.

<Content>Good Location Carlos V was centrally located to many attractions as well as the metro. The rooms were clean, neat and a little on the small side - however sufficient for three people. The air conditioning in our room was in need of some upgrading and/or repair. Also, upon leaving the room one must remove the electricity card - this shuts off all electricity in the room including the A/C. It took a while to cool the room off - but it also had that humid feeling to it due to the ill functioning A/C. We told the front desk - they said they would check it out the next day and give us another room if they could not fix it. There was a changining of the guards at the front desk - so the A/C was not looked at.....and since we were only there for two nights total, we did not push the issue. The restaurant lounge was cozy, but the breakfast was not as good as we experienced at other Madrid hotels. However, the magdalenas and coffee were very good. Domingo, our server was extremely pleasant and helpful. Although the hotel was sufficient for our needs - we would perhaps try another hotel (sticking only with 4 stars). Note: Down the street (next to the Discoteca was a great churos con chocolate cafe - open 10:00 am - 7:00 am). Casa Patas was a great place to go to see Flamenco Dancers - dinner there was very good also.

<Content>Great little hotel Stayed in Carlos V hotel after reading reviews of hotel. Wasn't disapointed, friendly staff greeted us at check in. Room nice and clean with small balcony over pedestrian street to front of hotel. Rooms have air conditioning. Resturant / Bar is very welcoming. Hotel is idealy situated for central Madrid. Most popular tourist places and can be reached by walking from hotel. Would recommend this hotel to anyone

<Content>Enjoyed our stay Just returned from 4 nights at Carlos V. We had a family room (#116). It was a good sized room with 2 double and 1 day bed. I thought the room was charming. There was noise outside, but with the window closed it was not a problem. The breakfast was decent (breads, danish, jams, meat, cheese, juices, canned fruit, cereal, sometimes at omelet). The location was very convenient. Many of the sites are walkable from here. There's also tons of shopping nearby (Il Corte Ingles is right across the street). Overall we were very pleased with this hotel

<Content>Great Location, great people! Stayed here during late February, 2004. Couldn't have asked for a better location! Central to everything you would want to do in Madrid. Might be noisy during summer months if your room is located at the front of the hotel. When we arrived, our room overlooked the interior stone courtyard (yuck!) so we asked for another room that had a balcony. The staff was SO cordial and accommodating and moved our baggage to a much better room (rooms are nice, clean but not spectacular) with a small balcony the next day. Wonderful breakfast buffet with very pleasant waiters (we arrived late one morning and they still served us!). The staff also went out of their way (despite our poor Spanish) to provide us with train schedules, information about flamenco show performances and anything else we requested. They were wonderful! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Madrid. We wish we had known about this hotel on our previous visit!
