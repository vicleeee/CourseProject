<Content>Not very pleasant. On entering the hotel, the atmosphere is very nice. However, we were given a room in a building adjacent to the hotel proper (this second building was reached via the basement level of the hotel). The room looked very worn and old. The windows were extremely damp. There was mold all along the crevices of the windows. We were staying there in December 2008 and the only source of heat was a plug-in radiator that was not very adequate - the room felt very damp and cold. The bathroom was not pleasant either with mold between the tiles. It did not look clean at all. There was no safety deposit box in the room either. We were given another room when we complained about the mold. However, the attendant in the front desk wanted to charge us 20 Euros per night for the other room. The charge was later dropped after sending an email to the manager. The second room was really nice, however it was in the basement level and was very cold during the day (even if you turn up the heat). It only warmed up at night. The bathroom was clean but the floor was tile and literally ice cold if walking barefoot. So if you are planning on staying here bring a pair of flip-flops just in case. Also, beware of good room deals for this hotel because it probably means they will place you in the building next door. Personally, I would not recommend this hotel. This comes from someone who is not a complainer. I have stayed in many hostels in the past and I'm usually easily pleased. However, the state of the first room I was given was not Hotel quality and is probably worse than any hostel I have ever stayed in. Just be careful if booking with this hotel.

<Content>Pleasant Stay I stayed at the Apollo for one night. I originally booked a single room, but my room wasn't ready so I received a double. Very nice room and looked recently renovated, although I could see how it might be small for 2 people. The lobby was modern and clean and the hotel was in an excellent location to the museums. Very close to shops, restaurants and just a quick tram ride to Central Amsterdam. I didn't get the breakfast, which I was happy about because I thought it was pricey. The staff at the front desk were helpful when I asked for directions. I would stay again if I returned to Amsterdam.

<Content>Good hotel, great staff We arrived to our room disappointed to find the old room (see the TA pics from other poster). We asked if anything could be done since not at all what was expected. We were given breakfast the next morning for free and moved to a recently renovated room. No hassle, just done. Staff was extremely helpful and accomodating. They were friendly and very professional. Excellent job by the staff!Room was nice, very new and modern. Shower was a bit leaky on the floor but they do have the bathmat. The breakfast was okay, we didn't pay for it and didn't see paying 12E50 for it the rest of the stay.Great location as the newly opened Heineken Experience and some really good pubs and restaurants are in the area.

<Content>Very Pleased Stayed for a 3 night break at the Apollo Museum Hotel in October 08. We were very pleased with the hotel, yes the rooms were small - but on a City Break - there is no need for a big room as you are on the go the whole time anyway. The hotel was very modern and the staff were extremely helpful.The location is fantastic, right next to the Riks Museum and just round the corner from the Van Gogh Museum. Depending on if you like to walk or not - you can get to every major attraction on foot, failing that it is next to a tram stop and a canal boat stop - both of which can get you round the city. The tram is also very handy to get to and from the Train station. (get on Tram No 5 from outside the train station and that will get you to a 3 minute walk from the hotel - just ask on the tram for the Riks Museam stop and they'll tell you when to get off).Found the hotel quite pricey for breakfast so we walked into Leidseplein and there is a great breakfast place called the Sports Bar which is very popular  reasonably priced. Does fantastic pancakes !All in all - would recommend this hotel to anyone going for a few nights in Amsterdam - any longer than a few nights you may want to either book one of the suites as they are bigger, or find a hotel with larger rooms - but certainly for city breaks - we couldn't fault it.

<Content>Nice place to stay Nice hotel. The rooms had been refurbished and were small but clean with nice clean bathrooms. Close to museums, resturants and a tram stop. The staff was friendly and when we ended up getting stuck in Amsterdam an extra day due to a train strike we went back to this hotel for our extra night. They have a locked room behind the desk to keep your luggage if you arrive before check in time. They also have a few computers in the lobby for free internet access and they have free wireless access. We had read reviews that the breakfast was not worth the price so we did not try their resturant. There were plenty of places to eat nearby.

<Content>An only Average hotel Our tour group stayed here in Sept 2008. Rooms were small. Carpeting in room need replacing as they are worn and dirty. Hotel rooms need updating. Surrounding streets had traffic all night so most of the group complained of getting little sleep. Easy five minute walk to the museums. Trams nearby easy to use for getting around town. As part of a tour we didn't get to pick the hotel so I can't offer value of the room advice. If I went back to amsterdam, I would try another hotel for comparison.

<Content>OK We are just back from a visit to Amsterdam (great city once you get used to the bikes -my advice... If you cant beat 'em join 'em!)We searched for ever on the internet for accommodation which was suprisingly difficult as everything was either fully booked or given terrible reviews on this site.I have to say though this hotel was great. Sure the room was tiny - but I take that as normal for Amsterdam - and if like us you are on a short visit and plan to spend most of your time out sightseeing all you want is a clean room, private bathroom and comfy bed and that is exactly what we got. The staff where pleasant and we had no problems at all. It is also in a great location - close to many museums and canals and tram lines which have to be the easiest way to get around and see the city.

<Content>Better than expected, Great Locatiion I was pretty nervous about this stay because of some of the negative reviews I have read on TripAdvisor. I was pleasantly surprised!The hotel has been recently refurbished. From what I could tell in the reviews a refurbished room differed dramatically from one that hadn't been refurbished. From what I understand from the front desk, they have only 1 floor that isn't finished yet, and will be done soon.My room was 1 floor below the lobby, but it had windows, etc...The room is definitely small, as is the bathroom, but clean and comfortable. Free Wireless, Flatscreen TV, phone, etc...I wouldn't want to spend a ton of time in the room, but as a reasonably priced room, the location can't be beat. around the corner from musuems, walking distance to everything and 1 block from trams if you want to go far.

<Content>Far from lovely The lovely Bilderberg was fully booked on my recent trip to Amsterdam so I booked into the Apollo, which is handy for the office where I'm working.Suffice to say I will do my best to get back into the Bilderberg when I come back to Amsterdam in a few weeks. My basement room at the Apollo was tiny, and the walk-in shower smelt of bad drains. The supply of towels and toilet paper was sporadic. The furniture and furnishings are dark brown, tatty and depressing. Worst of all, I could feel every single spring in the mattress.In its defence, the Apollo's staff were friendly and helpful, the location is fantastic and (can't imagine why previous reviewers complain about this) there is no shortage of bars and restaurants nearby.But those plus points wouldn't persuade me to come back...

<Content>Shabby, pricey rooms do not compensate for hotel location Although the building is classical and good looking and its entrance clean and modern, the problems begin the minute you enter the glass elevator.The rest of the hotel is dilapidated, with exposed walls, worn out carpets, and malodourous. The first room I was given was tiny, had mildew all over the ceiling, and a broken window. The second was larger (with a spare bed altough I was single), but there were no toiletries, no TV, no telephone, and it was marginally clean. The pluses were the friendly, helpful reception staff, adequate breakfast, and the location a block away from the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum and on the same street where Giorgio, Tommy, Cartier, Gucci, et al are. However, despite this I cannot recommend this hotel. I will not stay there again.

<Content>Location and Staff make it all worthwhile TripAdvisor is right again!The location is fantastic for walkers and transport-lovers alike. The price is perfect for business or leisure travelers on a budget.The hotel claims it has finished its renovations, but readily admits (when prompted) that it is behind schedule. Regardless, I never heard a peep of construction or city noise.The multilingual staff save this otherwise lackluster hotel. They pay attention to guests and get to know you personally, including your tourism requests, preferred wake-up times - and especially your language. They are calm in a crisis and cheerful in the morning.Breakfast is filling, but absolutely not worth the price. HOWEVER, there is NOWHERE to eat near the hotel either obviously and/or open at convenient times, so if you have a big day planned, the breakfast can then be worth it (and sandwiches made for lunch!).Reserve AT LEAST a Classic Room, refuse to sleep in the basement, and plan that the rooms will be small with no drawer space.

<Content>The best location in Amsterdam at an affordable price I stayed at the Apollo with my wife for two nights and it was great. The rooms are a little small but very clean and very modern. I read previuos reiviews and I have to contradict the people who said the rooms were not clean. The staff was always very friendly and outgoing. If i go back to Amsterdam this shall be my hotel once again.

<Content>the smallest bathroom in the world stayed from 27th to 29th june .tiny rooms with the smallest bathrooms you will ever experience in your life.not a cheap hotel, but the quality is not reflected in the price you pay.breakfast is mediocre at a cost of 12.5 Euro(if you book in advance) but this does not include a city tax of 6Euro.it costs 17.5Euro plus tax if not booked. it is in a good location though(thats the only good point)would not use again

<Content>Very helpful staff The hotel was clean and tidy although the rooms rather small and I faced the plant area at the back of the hotel on the first floor. This was not really an issue as uou don't spend all day staring out of the window! The staff were very friendly and helpful especially as I use a wheelchailr and they had to let us out in the goods lift whenever we wanted tocome in or go out. It is always worth asking for help and a hidden lift as you could not really see the lift from the outside until you were aware of it.Location was excellant, right next door to to the RIJKS MUSEUM and just a road to cross to the canal.Breakfast was a full hot and cold buffet...plenty of choice.Lots of nearby restaurants of international cuisine to eat in...the best Chinese is the floating SEA PALACE CHINESE RESTAURANT...a must for all Chinese foodies!!I would recommend the hotel and go back again.

<Content>Not enough room to swing a cat! The hotel is located in a really nice area of Amsterdam near to the Rijks Museum. There are many nice bars, restaurants and art galleries close by. It's also only 5 minute walk to the Leidsesplein. If you're travelling with children it's really well located - away from the red light district and sex shops.You can get the number 2 or 5 tram from Centraal station which takes only 5 minutes - alternatively, we walked around the centre most days!As for the rooms....we had room number 7 when we first arrived. It was awful. The room was tiny and the view was of an old building/dumping site with exposed pipes - urgh! The bathroom was miniscule and there was a horrible smell coming from the drains. The only plus side was that the air conditioning worked quite well and the bed was quite comfy.On a positive note, we asked to be moved and the hotel staff were very obliging and moved us to a slighly bigger room when one became available. (room 212). We had a wonderful view of the museum and canal from this room. The reception area of the hotel is very nice and modern and you can use free internet access in the lobby. I enjoyed my stay but I don't think that we'd chose this hotel again.

<Content>Better than expected My husband, daughter, niece and I stayed here for 2 nights this past April. I had booked 2 'classic' rooms months ago for under a $100US total for each room. I was pleasantly surprised that the rooms were ok, the lobby staff helpful and location great. Yes the rooms were small and the rug had a few stains but would I stay there again? Yes...the price was right, the location great, and I felt safe.

<Content>Don't Stay at the Apollo Museum Hotel, small, unhygenic rooms  Don't stay here.The rooms are tiny, we had to ask for a new room three times because they felt like prison cells.The bathrooms are a joke, very modern etc, but miniscule, one person can just about fit in.But all of that would have been ok had I not come home covered in bedbug bites!! I now have to go through the process of clearing out my own house to make sure I've got rid of them.This makes me feel disgusting and I am very angry at the hotel as it was obvious they didn't have very high standards.AVOID.Amsterdam is gorgeous though and this hotel is in a very good location, but that's about all it has going for it.

<Content>Will Not Return The first impressions were good. The location is great, the reception and bar modern.However ...My room was in the basement. The doubleglazing inadequate, so that I suffered a draught at night and was woken at four by morning staff congregating at the entrance (my room window was at feet level by the entrance) and chatting loudly for half an hour. The room was cold, even with the noisy heater ruinning all nightI was charged 60 euros for 2 breakfasts, which I queried, but was assured this was correct by the receptionist, who didn't seem to care.I've asked my company to use another hotel when sending us here again.

<Content>dirt hotel! This is the filtiest hotel i have ever stayed at in my whole life. first off we got there and the lobby was like a constuction site. Then when we got to our room we were disgusted i wanted to check out there and then!, the carpets and walls were visibly black with dirt, the floor was on slant, a broken T.V., ensuite in the midle of the room that didnt close and the floor was on a slant!!!...we spent an hour in the room until i noticed that some previous guest has kindly picked their nose and wiped it on the wall. I promptly made my way to reception via the death trap of an elevator and gave notice that i was cutting my stay by 3 nights. The receptionist very was rude and did not appolgise for my inconvenience. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY!

<Content>Very nice Im not sure if I have selected the right location but the hotel I am reviewing on is Museum Hotel Amsterdam in PC Hooftstraat .Anyway, we came here in May 2007. It had work being done to it, which was never stated anywhere when we booked. But it was not a problem. The staff were great, the rooms were so clean and lovely. The room I had wasnt very spacious but was very nice. The location was excellent, there is a tram stop right near the hotel and takes about 5mins into the centre, you could even walk it, its not that far. In the next street was some designer shops like Gucci, Louis Vuitton and a few more. My favourite bit!! But for the money I paid, it was an excellent stay. I recomend this to anyone. I havent been since the work has been done to it, but I will defnatly be back this year to see it.We got a taxi to the hotel from the airport, but cant remember how much it was, and got a train back to the airport, and again cant remember how much. Im sure it wasnt alot.Basically everything is in walking distance from this hotel.

<Content>Business stay I stayed here near the end of January on two separate occasions. The rooms I had were nice and the hotel is in a great location...not in an overly crowded area but close enough to walk to a lot of restaurants, cafes and other sights. The price was very reasonable compared to other hotels in the area and the staff were friendly and helpful.I only have some slightly negative feedback. The first was that the free internet provided was sporadic. It was down quite a lot while I was there but it never slowed me down too much. I was there on business and I lucked out as when I needed it, it was functioning for the most part. When it was working it was a speedy connection....a colleague stayed at another hotel nearby and they were charging 20 Euros a day for a connection, so it's hard to really complain about it.I had to break up my stay for a side trip that came up, so this may have left to some confusion about my bill but there were charges for breakfast on my bill and mini bar items that I never had. I informed the staff and they quickly took it off the bill though however. There just might be some slight disorganization there.

<Content>Hotel in Vogue We stayed at the hotel for Approx. 3 weeks this September. The hotel is being upgraded and looks, feels like a well designed boutique hotel in the best location of central Amsterdam. The whole experience was great and we highly recommended this hotel well run. The staff were very professional and the food and beverage were excellent. Nice to see that a hotel of this class exists!We will be back next year for sure!

<Content>Recommended hotel for Amsterdam The Museum hotel is excellent. I went with my wife for a three night break and can recommend this hotel. It's located at the bottom of the centre of Amsterdam right by the hard rock cafe, Holland casino and two of the major museums. Everything is within walking distance or the trams run every couple of minutes. To get to the hotel from the airport, catch a train to Amsterdam Centraal station (3 euros 60 each), then catch tram number 5 down to the Riks museum just after the Marriot hotel.The hotel room was small, but very clean with a great shower. The bar area is nice and staff friendly and there's currently 30% off in the restaurant. I recommend this hotel for anyone staying in the heart of Amsterdam.Riks museum, Van Gogh museum, shopping for the well known (expensive) brands - all close by. Plenty of restaurants and bars close by, with cuisine from all over the world.

<Content>Brown! We stayed at the MH at the end of August '07. We booked a 'deluxe' room as we wanted to splash out a bit for a long weekend away. But, we were disappointed with our renovated room. I know hotels in Amsterdam are expensive and rooms tend to be small, but this was really small. There was no desk or table or chair and barely any floorspace. Cat swinging would have been difficult.The hotel has recently been renovated, very much with a brown theme, which makes the rooms seem even smaller. They have obviously cut corners in doing this, as although it looks quite nice the fittings were not of very good quality and the bed was awful - very soft and two great canyons on each side where other people had slept. It was as if they didn't replace the beds when renovating. There was still some building work going on when we stayed, but it was pretty much finished so we didn't experience any noise. The bathroom was also small and was very impractical as whenever you had a shower (there wasn't a bath) water escaped from the cubicle and went all over the floor. We had colleagues staying in other rooms and they too had the same problem. Whilst we were checking in/out there were other people demanding new rooms or arguing about price/service, although the staff were quite nice and tried to help - although they did send us across Amsterdam to a pancake restaurant that was shut! I'd add that the breakfast is not included in the price, but for what it is I'd go elsewhere. The location is good as you're not right in the middle of seedy tourist land, but overall if I go to Amsterdam again I'll try somewhere else.

<Content>Very mixed bag I had the privilege of staying at the Museum during the height of their repairs, when there was dust and construction all around, in fact the weekend I was there, one could walk in off the street and walk up a staircase to the rooms, without even seeing the reception desk.The room was clean, but it was tiny. But at 90E for a weekend night, unbelievably cheap. But, there was dust and debris and bags of something in the hallways, but... 90Euro.If you can get a rate, and don't mind anything other than the inside of your room, the location can't be beat. If you are even somewhat sensitive to 'atmosphere', I would stay as far away as possible.Of course, this is all before the repairs are finished, then who knows?

<Content>Fine hotel I had some friends over from abroad and had them stay in the museum hotel. I checked out the rooms before booking. There are two kind of rooms in this hotel. First the classic rooms which were clean but could use a serious refurbishment, these are cheaper though. Second the recently renovated rooms which I booked, these rooms are what you would expect. The size of the rooms are what is normal in Amsterdam, not so large but for the rest everything was fine, no complaints what so ever. The staff were really helpful and professional. The lady that helped my friends spoke Spanish fluently. I was witness of a unsatisfied customer who really was out of line, jelling and screaming in the lobby . The staff stayed calm and handled the situation. What patience!!The best reason to stay at this hotel is the location. It's just a hundred metres from centre of the city and even closer to all the museums. Last but not least the bar and restaurant are fine as well, the bar was actually quite pleasant to have a few drinks before hitting the nightlife.I spoke with the staff, next year all rooms will be modernised.

<Content>Not so bad at all!!! After having read some of the other reviews on this website we weren't sure what to expect. So what a pleasant surprise to find that actually the hotel (or at least the new rooms) are very very nice! Spacious, modern and comfortable. Also the location is amazing. We only spent 3 days in Amsterdam but due to the excellent location we were able to do almost everything by foot. The staff were also very friendly and helpful. All in all we had a great stay at the Museum Hotel and will definitely recommend it to our friends.

<Content>Needs work The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The location can not be beat, as it is so close to walk to museums, food and tourist sites. But the place is really suffering through the renovations. Our room was mostly clean and they kept the loud construction noise to decent hours. Try to negotiate a lower price with the hotel directly. When it is finished this place will be fabulous and probably very expensive.

<Content>Don't waste your money We stayed at the museum hotel for two nights in august and did not have a positive experience.The hotel is undergoing renovations and the reception and restraunt were very nice and stylish but the room was a different story. The hotel room was TINY, barely enough room for two people to move around in. The walls had peeling paint and there was mould on the the walls of the bathroom and the bedroom area. Generally the hotel room was terrible and even though the room was cheap, it was very basic by any standardsThe hotel is a nice area of amsterdam and it is an easy walk to the major shopping areas and restraunts.The hotel may be a good place to stay once the renovations are completed but until then I think your money would be better spent at another hotel.

<Content>We had mice in our room My husband and I stayed at the Museum Hotel this month which started our trip around Europe. Words can't describe how disappointed we were with this hotel. Firstly we were given room 301. The worst hotel room I have ever stayed in, which had a sink in the bedroom as the bathroom was too small, mould through out the whole room and especially thick in the bathroom. Clearly the room had previously been broken into as the lock was broken. We then asked for another room which was also on the third floor, this room was marginally better (if that is possible) only to find a mouse in our room at 2:00am.This hotel is currently under renovation and only the first two floors out of the three have been completed. If you do want to stay here dont accept a room on the third floor. All I can say is DO NOT STAY HERE. The staff were also quite unfriendly and unhelpful.

<Content>Nightmare dump doesnt ever cover it Total unmitigated disaster. Mould, holes in walls, cigarette butts IN BATHROOM, broken windows, peeling walls. Reception had the audacity to say that these things happen and that many hostels were like this for backpackers and they dont complain!! i backpacked for a year in AFRICA and ASIA and never stayed somewhere so rubbish and I sure as hell didnt pay 拢70 a night for it. DO NOT GIVE THIS HOTEL YOUR MONEY

<Content>Pay only cash, do not give your credit card details My friend booked this hotel from Germany through internet. I visit the Museum Hotel website and did not notice any warning about on going refurbisment. My friend had noticed from the booking companys webpage at least he knew that this was the case. Hotel rooms were nice but nothing else not. 7am in the morning they started banging, talking...We had 2 twin room booked for 4 person and we have given creditcard details in good faith for the hotel to reserve these hotel rooms. As I was first person to leave early in the morning I paid one room with my credit card night before. I left receipt of the payment to my friend as proof that one room is already paid when they check out later next morning. When my credit card bill arrived to uk Museum Hotel had charged hole stay twice in 2 seperate days. So there was no error that some how same day I would be charge in mistake twice. As well my friend in Germany had same problem his card was charge twice. Totally Museum Hotel charge us 4 rooms 3 nights!!!!! I have not received any appologies from the hotel!!! Keep good care of your credit cards pay just only with cash if you stay there.

<Content>First visit to Amsterdam Lovely room. Ignored the renovation work as was going to be out all day. Staff brilliant  friendly. The size of the room was not important, as it was only used for sleeping  showering, in the bathroom. A chair would be useful for longer than one night stays. Definately stay there again, but when the renovation work is completed, I doubt if the single room cost will be 40GBP.

<Content>only if you're desperate!! Having read the reviews I was a little concerned about the hotel before arriving. I should have listened to my instincts! It looks closed from the outside, the scaffolding has gone, but the building is still filthy and massively knocked about.There are dustsheets everywhere covering the interior, paper over a new marble floor in the foyer, generally a very poor first impression. The staff seem pleasant, although take proof of your booking, we were told that breakfast wasn't included for expedia guests, luckily our confirmation email said that it did. You do need to go along the road to a different hotel for excellent buffet style breakfast.We were given one of the refurbished rooms, just as pictured on the website, but perhaps using trick photography!! Quite possibly the smallest double room I've ever been in, you are able to walk round the bed, but there was only about a foot to spare at the bottom. No bedside cabinets or lamps, but the most inappropriately large desk you've ever seen, no chair though!The ensuite was very nice, everything you need, but very snug with a glass door into the bedroom.The air conditioning worked and was needed, it was very warm overnight.

<Content>Worst "Hotel" Ever Worst hotel I have ever stayed in. We were not told about the construction, the windows didn't open in the room (which was very hot and did not, as the website indicates, have air conditioning - the website also claims there is a mini bar etc which, given the state of the rooms, is laughable), the water was turned off without warning from 11am until 3pm one day, no key was available for the room on arrival and our room wasn't actually even in the hotel - we had to go out the front door and go in another door down the road. Terrible hotel - it's more like a collection of dodgy bedsits.

<Content>Worst hotel I have ever been to First I have to say that nobody (not even our travel agent!) informed us about the construction works at the hotel. In fact I was shocked when we entered that dirty, noisy so called 3star hotel. First thing we experienced was that the staff tried to give us an awful room in part of the hotel which was under heavy construction. I immediately insisted on a refurbished room which we got at least. But even the refurbished room was cold, noisy with a lot of ants in it. The only good things about this hotel are the location and breakfast.If you like nois, dirty and ants in your bed i realy recommend this hotel to you! :-)Birgit

<Content>Tthe Worst Hotel I've ever Experienced I read the bad reviews but was desperate for a room on the busiest weekend in Amsterdam. I knew about the construction, but the entire hotel is torn apart. The signs in the hotel promised 9-6 p.m. construction, but I was jolted out of bed at 7 a.m. to the sound of jackhammering and sawing. My entire room was filled with dust. My room had untreated drywall for walls, mold on the bathroom walls, and no telephone (all this in a room that was over 150 euros per night). Yes, the location is ideal, but this hotel should be closed during construction--it is really not professional to have guests there, but especiall not for the price. I checked out and was able to find something better for half the price.
