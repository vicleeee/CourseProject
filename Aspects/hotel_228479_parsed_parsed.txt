<Content>Excellent location My second visit to Barcelona. Last time we stayed at the H10 Hotel del Pi which has larger, brighter rooms but is more expensive - so you get what you pay for. Having said that, the Hesperia Metropol is in an excellent location, close to public transport. (We read some reviews that said it was 10 mins to a Metro station - must have been written by a snail). The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, although their first night recommendation for a restaurant was not great - find your own local places - there are plenty around. Our room was at the front and overlooked the street, so it was a little noisy when the bar opposite emptied, but we heard no noise from adjoining rooms, the corridor or those above us which surprised me, and our friends who had a room facing an inside courtyard had no noise at all. My only gripe was that the rooms vere rather dark and the lighting poor. Taking the lamp shades off the lights helped a bit. We had also seen some reviews that the area was not safe - well we were 4 girls and we never felt threatened at any time of the day or night. Barcelona is a great city, and this is a good place to stay and see it.

<Content>Small rooms - good location far from the metro The location is as good as the other reviews indicate, although it is worth mentioning that the nearest metro stations is a good 10 min walk away. We had specifically asked for a room with a real exterior window - we got this, but the noise from the street was noticeable at first floor. The room we had was very small, but clean and the comfort was ok. We went for the breakfast option, which is good value for the 10 Euros.

<Content>Would stay there again! We rocked up at the Barcelona train station and the Information Office at the terminal booked this place for us based on the criteria we gave - which was walking distance to the central shopping district as well as the beach, around the 100 euro mark - and they got us just that! (NB: we did go in 2006 so the price may have changed). It's located in a central location and is a really modern looking hotel! The first room we received was clean and modern but in the summer heat of Spain, the air conditioning unit wasn't doing much, so we advised the reception desk  they moved us to an even bigger room which had a bathroom the size of a normal hotel room! I'm not sure if you can request the room size but definitely ask for the larger room! Must say, both rooms were spacious but the larger just felt like it was a 5star place!The staff were just lovely and very accommodating. The hotel looked brand new and yes, the location was in an alleyway but most of the hotels near the beach were - and it didn't feel dangerous at all. We were two girls walking down the alleyway at 4am in the morning and felt fine!However, on another note - I feel it is it important to tell other tourists that La Rambla (the main shopping street) is fairly dangerous late at night, mainly for males who often get harassed by the local prostitutes who get violent if the males take up any of their time without payment (even just talking to them!). My advice would be to pass them quickly without making much eye contact to avoid any trouble with them.

<Content>Great little hotel I have just returned from a weekend in Barcelona and this hotel was great for my stay. The location is amazing, literally 2 minutes walk from La Rambla, a lot of people say this area is dodgy but as long as you don't walk around on your own it's fine and I never felt under threat going out for dinner at night, just try to stick to the busier roads rather than the small alleys. The hotel was extremely basic but clean which is the most important thing. We had a well equipped bathroom, a TV and a mini bar apart from tea making faciliites there was nothing more we needed. The staff are very helpful too.If you're looking for a budget hotel in Barcelona then this is a great option.

<Content>Don't Go here!!!!!!!! Do not go here. I chose this hotel based on the reviews and was disappointed. To begin, the location...it was on a dingy street in a neighborhood I did not feel safe in! Later I ask the cleaning lady if this is a safe neighborhood and she said it's very old and I shouldn't walk it alone. Then the internet was 5 euros for 30 mins to use (ripoff!). The room: dingy! We had 2 twin beds that gave you a walking circumfrance of 6 along the table and couldn't open the dresser doors. We had to push the beds another 2 feet to access the safe. Bathroom had a dingy smell with no ventilation and you can tell the ceiling was painted over I don't know how many times. The beds were terrible uncomfortable as were the linens. The internet was down 1 night and didn't know when it will be back up, the elevator another and the staff just smiled and said  in 10 min it should be working NOT! I wanted to upload fotos from my digital camera and their computer was something I used in high school that didn't read the USB and no media slot! Stick to the Internet Cafe that was on adjacent to the rambla next to their plaza in the middle of the Ramblas. Their PCs were modern. The cheapest one was on the Ramblas next to the Subway. 1.80 euro for an hour. Travel within Spain, book via Spainair, Vueling or Easy Jet. They are the cheapest. We flew from Madrid for 60 euros. Sweet! The location was a long walk to the Metro. I would never stay at the place. The halls smelled of mildew and the linens must be washed in something horrible as my skin itched the whole day. Definitely stay along the Ramblas or up by Placa Catalunya! Their fotos look nicer than the real thing!

<Content>GOOD LOCATION, good deal The hotel is in a tiny street, and can be hard to find, but it's clean, practical and a good value. It was very well located, within walking distance to the Picasso Museum, the Chocolate Museum, the Zoo and the gothic Cathedral and the Aquarium. We were traveling with teenagers and it worked out well for us. We had a good meal at an indian restaurant half a block away and the convenience store in front of the hotel was very... convenient. Overall, we were pleased with this good value, and the staff was friendly and helpful. Only the carpets in the hallways could use a makeover.

<Content>Good value Have recently returned from this value for money hotel. excellent location only minutes from Las Ramblas and the Harbour. Very clean and friendly hotel with a good selection at the breakfast buffet. Others have commented on the size of the rooms but ours was at least 50% larger than the one we had in Venice last year! Bathroom will need retiling in the next 12-18 months but overall excellent value in a good location.

<Content>An OK stay. We stayed here for 4 nights with our baby. The room was a bit small for the 3 of us with a cot, but it was clean. Breakfast was good. The surrounding area was a little scary at night, as it was on a side street off the main street. Staff were friendly and helpful. If your looking for a hotel for a short stay and a location close to everything, that isn't too expensive, then this hotel is good. We wouldn't however stay here again.

<Content>Hesperia Metropol Barcelona We stayed at the Hesperia Metropol Hotel in Barcelona for 1 night only. We really enjoyed our stay. Our room was clean, quiet and had a nice ambience. We loved the location as we walked to Las Ramblas and The Sea in no time at all. There were some really charming little bars right on our doorstep too! We'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>Very 'Middle of the Road' We were very disappointed with this hotel. We booked it after reviewing photos online. The photos, even though acurate, were quite deceptive. They did not convey the shabby look of the lobby area (faded and partially threadbare carpets), and the small size and darkness of the rooms.The room was attended every day, and had a high standard of cleanliness.The room was quite loud. We could hear the water from the shower in the room next door, as if it was in our own room.The location is pretty good, and although the hotel is quite reasonably priced, I am sure that there are better quality hotels available in this price range.

<Content>Good value hotel Stayed here for two nights, Friday to Sunday. Hotel was very nice. Rooms were very clean and tidy with tv, safe, mini bar, large bathroom, air con but no tea and coffee facilities for those who like a cup of coffee first thing in the morning.The rooms were not massive but there was more than enough room for the two of us and we certainly didn't feel cramped at all.The location was excellent! Las Ramblas was at the end of the street, literally a minute's walk and there were a number of bars, restaurants and cafes in the street. At this end of Las Ramblas is also the harbour, a stone's throw from the hotel.Again it was only a short walk to the gothic quarter through the small streets again which were filled full of lovely bars and restaurants.Would definitely stay at this hotel again. Ideal for a short city break and very good value for money.

<Content>Christopher Columbus Was the view from our window at the Hotel Hesperia Metropol, well a bit of him anyway, our room was good, the only noise was from the lift which our room adjoined but to be honest it didn't bother us in any way, the bed was very comfortable, the only downside was that the room tended to be a little dark, even during daytime but we found the staff at the Hotel very pleasant, very helpful, and the breakfast was good too, even though we were early birds at 7.30am every morning. Would definitely stay here again for its location, only a short walk from the harbour and beaches, and the historical centre, there is a really cool tapas bar only one street away called La Plata, great wine and fresh sardines for next to nothing!

<Content>Not worth the money The room was clean but very small and dark. At the time of our stay construction work in the first and 2nd floor was going on from 7 am till 8 pm. Living on the fourth floor it was still very noisy and not how you imagine spending a relaxing vacation. The aircondition did not work properly and the fridge did not really cool very well. Breakfast was ok as long as you came till 9 am otherwise there was not much variety left to choose from. The location was good, not far from Ramblas and the sea side.

<Content>Not brilliant Not the best hotel, the decor was tired and shabby and the rooms vary a great deal in size (I looked at several in an attempt to get one that wasn't either a box room or has a window overlooking what smelled like a chip fryer). The location was good though, on a small street that had tons of local character, but just off las ramblas and a few minutes walk from the sea front. Nevertheless I imagine there are much better hotels in Barcelona for the same money.

<Content>good value The hotel offers a very good location and the staff are very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend especially if you are looking for a single room with a reasonable price.
