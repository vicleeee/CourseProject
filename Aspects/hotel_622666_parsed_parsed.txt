<Content>Great hotel, but a little noisy The Laura has great rooms and excellent service, along with a very good location. The rooms are clean, comfortable and a good size, with all of the conveniences that you need. Breakfast is an excellent buffet of fresh juices, fruit, meats and cheese and great coffee.The only downside is the noise level. The windows need to be soundproofed. Since we stayed during the run up to New Year's Eve, the late night noise level was louder every night and at times woke us up. Since we live in city, we are used to some noise. That is the only problem.

<Content>Nice hotel with great staff We really enjoyed our stay here. The location is perfect, just off Gran Via and in walking distance to all the main attractions. We were especially impressed with the staff who were friendly and knowledgeable about the city. We would definitely return.

<Content>Room-mate hotels are a GEM Locations of all the room-mate hotels are fabulous. The hotels are very efficiently organized so the smaller rooms are perfectly comfortable! The breakfast buffet was fresh and nice. The hotel staff spoke perfect English and were able to give us recommendations for restaurants, directions etc. We asked about a restaurant that we were to meet friends at and he looked it up on the web to give us more information. I loved that each building is distinct.

<Content>O.K. as a place for sleeping, but never a nicely decorated hotel It depends on what you expect. If you are just looking for a place to sleep, with a great location, and a helpful staff, it is O.K. Its name is perfectly suited, if you consider it an upper class apartment building for students or very young people. If you are looking for a nice, cozy hotel, this is never the place. Comparing to other hotels classified in top 5 on tripadvisor site (or with other hotels we have stayed in for the same amount of money), this hotel never deserves its place. It is supposed to be modern, but we agree with the only reviewer saying that it is rather cheap and already looks like it has not been renovated for a long time (excepting the breakfast room, which is better than the rest of the hotel). The windows are old, the drain system of the shower cab did not function well (it gets full of water as soon as you start taking a shower), they have no heating system except for the air conditioning which is placed right above your head when you are sleeping.

<Content>A wonderful stay in central Madrid While there are possible criticisms, the Laura suited us very well  was a wonderful base in central Madrid. The potential downside: we had a duplex,  the stairs are split  steep - they would not suit the slightly infirm or uncertain, or those with poor eyesight. Lighting in the living room might also be too low in the evenings for readers with fading sight. But these weren't major problems for us (and we're in our 50s!) Outside - it's the centre of a European capital,  as of Nov 08 there is still building work going on opposite during daylight hours - but it wasn't too noisy,  we were out most of the time; the bin men do bang around outside at midnight - but no more than in Paris or Barcelona;  the bells at the nearby Monastery might disturb you briefly at 06:30.... But on the upside: the main room was wonderfully spacious, high  airy; the kitchen (locked away behind what just looks like a storage room door) with fridge, micro  two electric rings was very handy - especially as there are no other coffee making facilities; the bathroom was clean  bright with a powerful shower; the bedroom area was quiet  comfortable. This is more a small apartment than just a hotel room. Staff were very friendly  chatty,  the location was great - just a few minutes walk from Metro, stores, supermarkets etc and not much more from galleries, palace, cathderal. This was one of our most enjoyable city centre stays ever. We thoroughly recommend the Laura,  hope to return!

<Content>Very very noisey - poor customer servie Hotel is situated on a busy one way system and our room was on the corner of 3 roads. Continuous traffic noise day and night with car horns been blown at all hours, then when you finally drop off to sleep the church bells start! Only there for a couple of nights so did not complain until we arrived home(big mistake), all we were offered was a voucher to come back for a free night - rather poke my own eyes out! Apparently it is against customer policy to offer any cash refund as we have already checked out.So my advice to anyone staying is make any complaints while you are there as the customer service department is not interested once you leave.Felt it was overpriced and although it is modern inside it is done very cheaply and will not age well at all.Glad to get home and get some sleep!

<Content>Great place to stay in Madrid! This hotel was a wonderful place to stay in Madrid. It was conveniently located, the staff was incredibly helpful, and the rooms were great. The hotel even has dark shutters to keep out the light for those late Spanish nights! The only slight drawback is the lack of room service on-site. Overall this hotel is perfect for visiting Madrid in style.

<Content>Sweet little hotel, good location This is very sweet little hotel in the center of Madrid, very conveniently located near the Plaza Mayor and the National Theater, a 20-25 minute walk to the Prado. We got there by Metro from Barajas International Airport in just 30 minutes; the hotel is just a couple blocks from the Callao Metro stop.It advertises itself as being hip; I thought our room was a bit too hip for its own good, as the loft, (which contains the mini-bar,) was accessible only by a steep set of half-stairs...not for the infirm or faint of heart. The staff were quite helpful; the brunch which is included in the room rate was plentiful and good, and served until the very civilized hour of noon. The one computer available free for use could be located in a better place than on the front desk.Great value, great location, highly recommended.

<Content>A hotel with a difference We found this hotel on Tripadvisor  were very pleased with the interior design of the accomodation...such a change from the standard hotel room set up The only negative was the poor lighting at the bedside making it impossible to read at night.The breakfast included was delicious with plenty of variety.The staff were responsive to all our requests.Look for these Room Mates in Spain . They are special

<Content>Wonderful time with Laura Went for a long weekend to Madrid with a number of friends. We had responsibility for booking the hotel, and after seeing Laura's website we had to book. We werent disappointed. The hotel is what could be described as 'boutique' and the decor is unusual, but we loved it. All our rooms were generously sized, the couples all had rooms with kitchen facilities, which of course we didnt use with all the bars and restaurants close by. The hotel is very centrally situated, and there was a small amount of noise from people in the street as they returned to their beds, but it wasnt unbearable, and we expected worse in a city centre. The breakfast was included and had a huge selection - we were very impressed as we had not expected so much to be on offer - fresh fruit, cereals, meats and cheeses, and freshly ground coffee. I would highly recommend this hotel, and would use it again should I return to Madrid, I understand there are others in the Room Mate chain and I would definitely consider staying with them in other cities. It was excellent value for money, the staff were very helpful and we even got a weather forecast left daily on our bed to help us plan our outings!

<Content>Highly recommend Absolutely fantastic hotel at very reasonable cost, right in the heart of Madrid close to all the tourist sites. Hotel staff very helpful, excellent buffet breakfast and rooms are large, modern and very clean. Only 200 yards away from Cortez Del Ingles dept store which is excellent for holiday purchases and has an excellent food hall. Highly recommend this hotel and Madrid.

<Content>Room Mate Laura exactly met our needs After staying three nights at the Westin Palace (the final days in our group tour package), we wanted to move to less expensive digs for the last three days on our own in Madrid. We found Room Mate Laura on the web, and read favourable reviews in Trip Advisor, so we booked it online.The hotel met our needs very well - central location close to Puerta del Sol; good value for money; quiet, clean, modern and comfortable accommodations (looked like it had been furnished from IKEA). A small kitchen (but no dishes as we were only a short stay). Modern large enough bathroom with a walk-in shower. The bedroom was in an upper loft, up some very steep stairs, so we had to use caution in descending, particularly at night. The breakfast buffet was very good, lots to eat and fresh and tasty, including a warm potato omelette. Staff at reception were very helpful, and let us check our email (free) on a laptop at the counter. We would stay there again if we're ever back in Madrid.

<Content>Loved the Laura The Room Mate hotel franchise is taking off around the world and I can see why. Whimsical decorations, interesting room design, friendly staff, what's not to love? We thought our duplex room was fantastic. We were upgraded by Joan who worked nights at the front desk and was just so hilarious, helpful and kind to us. The room layout was very spacious, upstairs/downstairs, two bathrooms, two tvs, automated blackout blinds, great bed. Fantastic. The breakfast was really good as well and served until noon, good for the people who stay out all night which seems to be much of Madrid. The location is near the Metro which is nice, but for being so near the Metro, the hotel is extremely hard to find. Even after staying there a little while it seemed always very confusing to get back to the hotel. There is a laptop on the front desk for guests to use which is nice, though you are standing there with the desk clerks and feel sort of rushed to hurry up and finish. It would be far better to have the computer in another place where one could sit down and not feel so pressured to get off of it. We look forward to going back to Madrid and would definitely stay at one of the Room Mate hotels, perhaps Oscar which is definitely the glamorous sibling of the chain.

<Content>Well located though hard to find! We saw this hotel rated here and emailed the staff about a stay less than a month before...they were prompt with their replies and very helpful. You will not get a notice from them once you have booked and they do not charge your credit card until you arrive. It was hard to find them as they are in a very small side street about five minutes from Plaza del Sol. The upside is that it is relatively quiet at night as opposed to hotels directly on the plazas. We booked the attic suite which had ample space for our multi-day stay, including a small kitchenette with a stove, sink, countertop and frig. We had to ask for plates, knives, pans, etc, upon arrival. Sometimes its too exhausting to eat out and you can go to a small deli around the corner or the large supermarket at El Cortes Ingles down the block to get provisions for a small meal in your room. We arrived at 8 a.m and unfortunately there was no place to wash up or change clothes since rooms aren't ready until 1 pm. The am receptionist was a bit cold and distant and told me I could change in the small bathroom next to the breakfast room. In her favor, she said we were invited to eat breakfast that a.m. The breakfast is self-served from 7am through noon...a real plus. The hotel caters to a lot of Europeans, so count on cold cuts, toast, pastries, potato tortilla and fresh fruit and juices as the typical fare. The coffee and tea was served by an automated machine which did fine. They played Euro trance music during breakfast which is not particularly soothing for the older set (which was a lot of the guests at the time we stayed). They offer the Spanish dailies and the major English daily for news. The decor of the lobby and rooms is quite 70's modern with hard surfaces, bright red colors and spare industrial materials that are arranged in a nice minimalist way. If you stay in the attic you'll need to watch out for the slanted ceilings. My husband really banged his head on one. There are some problems with sound insulation within the hotel. You can hear every door slam...but the bargain price of a little more than $200 for the suite made it hard to complain. Of all the receptionists, most are professional, but not very warm or forthcoming. One man never said hello in the five days we were there! However, there is one longtime receptionist, Luca, who was a true asset for the Room Mate franchise...he was so helpful and warm in his manner that he may have just put the others in a lesser light. You are very centrally located in this hotel and you have some nice restaurants within a block or so. I would return again.

<Content>Great location, clean, comfortable, and reasonable in Madrid. The Hotel Room Mate Laura in Madrid was perfect for us. The location could not have been better, we could walk to almost anything and felt very safe. The breakfast was the best we had in all of Spain. Try the tortilla Espana. The room was clean and decorated in a modern way. I especially liked the loft bedroom with its own half bath.

<Content>Great location We really enjoyed our stay and appreciated the free upgrade from a twin duplex to a superior duplex with two bathrooms without requesting it. Staff really friendly and helpful. Luca on reception recommended an italien restaurant which was really good which was five minutes away on a side street off calle arenal called Anema e core.Choice of english news channels, CNN, sky news, BBC.Location was good as was quiet but two minutes away from the major streets and metro not far also. Loved the tall windows in the duplex with electonic blinds which kept out the noise. Airconditioning and opening of windows was also good. There is no tea/coffee facilities.We had bought our own and they opened up a small k itchen for us to use.There was only one chair and could have done with a small table.Corte el ingles across the way with a supermarket which was handy for buying bottles of water etc.Take a copy of your passport if paying by visa as require ID.One shop asked for it the other didn't when we were buying cigarettes.Went on the hop and off bus for 2 days which was better value.We went to toledo for the day but beware when you go the buy the tickets you need to reserve a seat and only on the train you specify, you cannot change the times. Make sure you leave plenty of time as we were queing for about a hour. You obtain a ticket from the renfe ticket office at atocha station and wait for your number to come up and they wont wait as will call the next number out.

<Content>Beautiful and stylish accomodation I stayed at this hotel for four nights with my girlfriend.The hotel is very conveniently located just 5 mins away from Puerta del Sol, the so-called center of Spain. It is ideal for tourists who want to explore Madrid. Still, it is quite, so that you can recharge your batteries, to get ready for the next day.The hotel does not have room service, a pool, a business center or a restaurant (although they have a breakfast room). So, if you do not need any of these services, you don't have to pay for it. We had a duplex suite, which was just beautiful. The interior of the hotel and the rooms is very stylish, yet simple. They have a seating area downstairs with a little balcony and the bed upstairs. Considering that we paid EUR 121 per night including breakfast, we got excellent value for money. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly.

<Content>Great hotel, great location My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for two nights at the beginning of September. On arrival, we were upgraded to a suite which was a nice surprise. The hotel is in a great location with modern decor. The staff spoke English well and were very helpful.As this is a smaller, newer, hotel, not everyone knows where it is located. We printed off directions on google maps from the airport to the hotel which was invaluable for the taxi driver. I would recommend doing the same.

<Content>Loved the hotel, location, staff, bedroom Stayed at Hotel Laura this week, the staff on reception were fantastic, all spoke excellent English, tried to help out with bus services etc. The room was fantastic, we were on 4th (attic) floor so had very little in the way of view but this was quite irrelevant as we didn;t spend too much time in the room.The location is fantastic, Calle de Arenal is literally 2-3 minutes walk and Plaza Mayor is about 4-5 minutes, in the other direction is Puerto del Sol at 4 minutes and Royal Opera also 4 minutes and Royal Palace around 6-7 minutes, 12 minutes to Prado and 15 minutes to Retiro Park.The buffet breakfast was ample and very fresh.Was priced very reasonably considering central position.Would definitely recommend this hotel,

<Content>Great boutique hotel! We got stuck with a 26 hour layover in Madrid and weren't looking forward to it. Luckily, we ended up with a great place to stay in Room Mate Laura. It was right off the metro (although the Opera stop is NOT conducive to traveling with more than 1 big bag - no escalators/elevators) and a short walk to the Plaza Mayor, Palacio Real, and Gran Via (the major sites we hit in our short stay).  The staff was helpful; rooms were clean and decorated with modern decor. If you like boutique hotels you'll love Room Mate Laura!

<Content>Hip, trendy place with youthful appeal My taste in hotels is eclectic. While I most prefer small places of charm and character like Villa Rosario where we stayed in Ribadesella, I also like larger places of stripped down asceticism like Monumento San Francisco in Compostelo, and even utilitarian places like Vincci Puerto Chico where we stayed in Santander, all on our recent trip to Northern Spain. And I even like super modern, trendy, hip and youthful鈥攚hich is what this place was. It鈥檚 a member of the Room Mate chain which originated in Spain and has expanded rapidly including one of their newest, Grace, in NYC, and another, Waldorf Towers in South Beach, Miami. Madrid has four of them, though at the rate they鈥檙e expanding it may be more by the time I post this. The magazine they left in the room said they were building 25 more in the next year. Laura is located up a hill slightly behind the opera house and it鈥檚 the location that鈥檚 the most off putting of any aspect of the place. The surroundings seem dodgy and they鈥檙e certainly not attractive, and not very clean鈥攐f course, neither is a lot of Madrid as I learned from a Sunday morning after experience in the stinky Puerto del Sol. Otherwise, it鈥檚 a pretty interesting place. You enter up a flight of stairs and most everything is orange鈥攎y favorite color. What鈥檚 not orange is either black or white. The furnishings don鈥檛 appear selected to last but they鈥檙e interesting while they remain around. Our room was a two story affair, with couch and table and chairs plus main bathroom/shower downstairs and bed with (thankfully) a second mini-bathroom upstairs. Even the stairs themselves are interesting. Each is a half step, alternating the place where you must put your foot from the left to the right鈥攏ot good for a person like myself with problem ankles and knees who most often ascends, and especially descends, one step at a time, placing both feet on the same riser at once. I told you, didn鈥檛 I that this is a trendy, youthful kind of place. Oldies take note. I鈥檓 pleased to say I survived all this without mishap, but I admit I鈥檇 not knowingly book similar digs again, even for the flaming orange accents. The headboard for the bed was actually the wall itself, cut back in concentric rectangles with an orange lighted picture of Queen Elizabeth鈥攖he first. No clue what that was all about, but it was arresting. What I didn鈥檛 like was that this loft bed, was by virtue of the small amount of space available, pushed next to the wall causing me to have to shimmy in and out of bed if I didn鈥檛 want to wake my husband to let me out like a regular person. Bathrooms follow the white minimalist formulaic pattern with stainless steel small vanities and black bubble floors that can be laid of a piece. I suppose you have to do somethings simply if you鈥檙e going to erect 25 new minimalist places in the next year in parts unknown. The breakfast room and the breakfast were very nice with more pix of QE1, orange, black and white d茅cor, Chilewich placemats and all the standard offerings, all of which were included in the standard room rate which turned out to average 155 euros per night, though higher one night and lower the next. Truly not a bad rate for a clean, interesting hotel in the center of a major city. I鈥檇 not return, but that has more to do with me than the hotel. For young, hip, agile under 50 somethings, I鈥檇 say it鈥檚 a pretty good deal. But I鈥檇 investigate the Madrid locations of the other members of the chain before booking this one. It may be that the others are in better neighborhoods and still afford the same trendy vibe. See for yourself at www.room-matehotels.com.

<Content>Fantastic hotel! We stayed for 6 nights at Room Mate Laura and we had a fantastic time. We stayed in a duplex and we loved it. It had a bedroom with a good bed and upstairs a little lounge and an extra toilet. Bathroom had only a shower and no bath, but that was no big deal for us.The breakfast is good, typical continental style. Staff is lovely, always smiling and eager to help. Location is perfect, right in the middle of the city centre. It can get somewhat noisy at night, but that will be the same anywhere in central Madrid.We will choose Laura next time we'll go to Madrid as well.

<Content>Fun and Unique Room - Great, big room with a ladder going up to a loft- Very spacious with 1.5 bathrooms- Very high ceilings- Very clean and modern with fun decorations and colors- Decent location but not as good as Room Mate Alicia in Madrid- Free internet and laptop for hotel guests to use in lobby- Breakfast included- NO swimming pool, but apparently all Room Mate guests can access the pool at Room Mate Mario in Marid

<Content>Well placed hotel excellent staff Stayed as the Room mate Laura for 3 nights at the end of August after choosing it through reviews on the site.Booked the duplex room which was fine in layout and size.The staff on the desk were very helpfull throughout the stay and the hotel is in a very good location for local bars,metro stations and walking distance to Plaza Mayor,Royal Palace etc and I even walked to Retiro park and back (about an hour round trip)On the downside the side of the Hotel I stayed on had a disco very near by and the first night I was kept awake 4,5,6 in the morning by a lot of noise which didnt impress me at all,I asked to be placed on a higher floor and was moved up to the second it made a little difference but not a lot.The cleaning staff locked the kitchenette on two occasions which I found strange as on both occasions I had to go to the desk to get them to unlock it..Overall I would recommend the hotel but depending on your nocturnal habits if you like an early night go elsewhere..

<Content>My favorite hotel in Madrid - just don't ask for directions! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Room Mate Laura for one night when we arrived in Spain to do a spring tour of Andalucia. It was definitely one of our favorite hotels of the trip! The room was wonderful (if you look at their website it is the one pictured with odd angles but lovely floor to ceiling curtained windows on either side of the bed, the headboard of which is a painting. I had some digitial camera glitches that day so I unfortunately have no photos to share, but those windows are out to the lovely Plaza de las Descalzas. Parking is available at a city lot just across the park - not a bad walk and very convenient to get in and out of (a rarity we were later to learn in our travels)! the staff was very friendly, the bed was very comfy, the breakfast was AMAZING! short walk to Plaza Mayor (where we ate dinner at Las Cuevas de Luis Caldeas - don't miss it!) I love the room mate chain of hotels and can't wait to try the rest of them! My post script about directions: the following morning we asked for directions to leave the town towards Jaen, and the two staff people at the desk couldn't quite decide how to send us. We ended up driving in a circle around Madrid for about an hour before I finally figured it out.

<Content>Great hotel, better Staff... I was very pleasantly surprised by the hotel and the staff at Laura. The place is perfect for a short or long stay. Me and my friends stayed for 8 nights and had the best vacations ever. The staff is very friendly and allways willing to help in any way possible. The property was very clean and well kept. To top evry thing up they offer complementary breakfast until noon. Will be coming back to Laura on april and looking foward to it.

<Content>Wonderful Boutique Hotel What a quaint hotel - right in the centre of Madrid. We were on the top floor with a suite in the rafters including lounge / kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. Staff were very helpful. You could walk virtually anywhere in central Madrid from here and the train stations are not far either.

<Content>Absolutely amazing hotel! What a fantastic place to spend a weekend!Just got back after 2 nights here with some good friends.We were 2 couples all aged around 30 and we had an absolute blast.The location of the hotel could not be better. Lots of great bars and restaurants on your door step.Staff are great and very helpful.The decor in the hotel is unique and fascinating, but this does not make the hotel inpractical or difficult to stay in at all.Trust these reviews, this hotel justifies its number 1 position in Madrid.Just book it now, don't waste your time looking elswhere.

<Content>A nice stay The overall experience was very positive. The room was quite big and we really liked the decoration.The location of the hotel is also very good.Staff at the reception was friendly and helpful.What can be improved:We had the feeling that the bathroom had been cleant very briefly. The shower gel bottle was empty, a used shower cap was hanging next to the sink and the mirror was not very clean.There was no music in the breakfast room on the first morning.The next day there was music but the play list was not really corresponding to the atmosphear of the hotel.We will certailny come back.

<Content>Excellent service and very friendly personnel. Excellent service and friendliness. The personnel was very attentive to our needs. The duplex was beautifully trendy and felt like home. The Breakfast was amazingly rich and diverse with freshly baked bread and pastries every morning. The location is fantastic, right in the center of busy Madrid yet secluded enough to provide rest and tranquility when sought. All in all an excellent Design Hotel very well priced for the value. A must when visiting Madrid for pleasure or business alike.M. Lopez-Herrera, London, UK.

<Content>Modern and chic My wife and I stayed at the Room Mate Laura in Madrid in June 2008. Some friends of ours recommended Room Mate Oscar, but it was booked. Room Mate Laura is an excellent find. It is very modern, minimal, and chic. The place is very clean and well designed. Our room was very comfortable and quiet. We had a sofa and mini-kitchen. The staff were all very helpful and spoke several languages. The breakfast was the most comprehensive I've ever had in Europe. We had full meals rather than the continental portions we are accustomed to receiving in Europe. The location is great. Room Mate hotels offer a very good value. I would stay with Room Mate in any city where they are located and would recommend them to everyone I know. Stay here and you won't regret it.

<Content>Stylish hotel with great customer service Really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Exceeded our expectations in terms of great design and fabulous customer service. The breakfast is lovely with fresh fruit platter everyday- makes up for all the greasy tapas!The reviews I had read complained about the hard beds but they didnt bother us at all. The location was great and the cost was really good for what you recieved. Only two things could have been improved: 1) the walls to the next room were quite thin and we heard everything going on next door! 2) We had a steep slant to our room on the top floor and the couch was positioned underneath it...so the first time I used the couch I almost knocked myself out from the ceiling...had to walk stooped over in that section of the room...but not a problem by the bed area.Despite the above two points the positives definately outweigh the negatives and I would recommend staying there...keen to try the rest of the room-mate chain now...I hear there are hotels in Miami  New York.

<Content>Great inner city hotel Couldn't fault this hotel in any way. The location is great, a short stroll from the Gran Via and many other inner city offerings. The room (Duplux Delux) was spacious across 2 floors, clean and contemporary style. Everything was made easy for us. Would definately consider room mate next time.

<Content>Lovely hotel in a fantastic city! We stayed at Room Mate Laura for a long weekend at the end of June. We had a fantastic time. The hotel was lovely! In fact it was much better than I expected. Our room (202) was a duplex and was roomy, airy, clean and contemporary - decorated in lime green and white. It also had air conditioning.There is a good continental breakfast available from 7 am to 12 noon.I would definately recommend staying at this hotel, it was in a good location, it was lovely, clean and modern and the staff were very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Very nice hotel Pros:-Friendly staff-Excellent breakfast/room-Modern, stylish hotel rooms.Cons:-If you have a room at the street side (like we had), Saterday night (between 22:00-04:00) is very noisy.-No bath (standard room).Warning: Be very aware of pick-pockets in the Metro/street. It is really a pleague in Madrid!

<Content>Fantastic hotel for the money My wife and I spent a week at the Laura and loved it. The design is very original and attractive. We were upgraded to a duplex. The room comes with an excellent breakfast that is served until noon! The staff could not have been more helpful. We looked at Room Mate Alicia too. It is located on the busy Plaza Santa Ana which is very noisy and full of pick pockets. So the Laura was the better choice. I have travelled to almost every country having worked for years as a trade negotiator. I rank the Laura as one of the best non-luxury hotels I have experienced.

<Content>Fantastic!! I have just come back from a 4 night stay in Room Mate Laura. It was my second visit to Madrid so had an idea of which area I wanted to stay in and this hotel fitted the bill perfectly. After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor it seemed like the perfect hotel and we weren't disappointed!!!!My friend and I booked the standard room and were upgraded on arrival. The room on the 4th floor was great!!! Really big with twin beds, a large curved sofa, small dining table for 2, tv , minibar and air con. The bathroom, whilst not huge, was fine and spotlessly clean. We had a shower but no bath. Our room also had a kitchen area comprising 2 ring hob, sink, fridge etc. There wasn't any crockery, cooking utensils etc but I can only assume that this was because we hadn't originally booked this type of room. The fridge was working though which was an added bonus.Breakfast was excellent, cold meats, cheese, toast, pastries, fruit etc and the breakfast room was tranquil.Hotel location is very central. Near to shops, Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor and in walking distance of Palace, Gran Via. On leaving the hotel I browsed through the visitors book and there were only great comments!!! We couldn't fault this hotel and would definitely recommend it!!!!!

<Content>Funky original hotel, Myself and my girlfriend loved the hotel. We both found it to be great in a number of areas:1. Location was brilliant, only a short walk to the madrid's nightlife and sights. Never needed a taxi2. Decor was original and definitely above standard3. Free breakfast was great4. Staff were genuinely helpfulThe only complaint we would make was the noise. Hotel seems to be surrounded on both sides by busy streets. But I wouldn't hold it against the hotel. Next time I go back to Madrid, I would love to try your other hotels in the city

<Content>Very central to all the major sights. Room was a good size and clean, but the bathroom could have been a bit bigger. Nice buffet style breakfast with various newspapers provided to get you started for the day. Great location for all the sights with friendly, helpful staff. 10 minutes walk to the Royal Palace, Plaza Mayor or Gran Via. About 1km walk (or use the Metro) to the 3 major art museums. Countless restaurants within 5 minutes walk of the hotel and plenty of pedestrianised streets for shopping. There is also a large El Corte Ingles (Department Store with a supermarket in the basement) 2 minutes away.If you are a football fan then take a tour of Real Madrid's Bernabeu Stadium. There is a dedicated Metro station for it and the tour is 鈧?5. The hotel is close to 3 metro stations to take you back and forth to the airport (鈧?) in about 45 minutes and to any more distant parts of Madrid (鈧?) you wish to explore.My first trip to Madrid, but not the last. Enjoy the Tapas.

<Content>Roommate Laurel and Hardy Reception was very friendly. Nice design. Good atmosphere.The room itself (a duplex deluxe) was spacious and beautifull with large windows. But the bathroom, altough well equipped, was way too small.Water closet, shower and bidet were on aproximately 1 square meter. Compared to the rest of the room it was ridiculously small. Big people would have difficulties to get in and out of the shower. Another inconvenience: there was only a cupboard upstairs. Good breakfast buffet and the best coffee of our roundtrip trough Central Spain.

<Content>Great Location We have just returned from a long weekend in Madrid and loved the hotel room. We were upgraded to a duplex room and we loved the stylish and bold deco, having a mezzanie floor was very quirky and the high ceilings with the long windows opening on to the square were great. We were going to a wedding so having two bathrooms to get ready in was a bonous. On the negative side-the bathrooms were small but the shower was powerful and effective a bathtub would have been nice. As we had windows opening on to the square the street life was noisey but luckily we can sleep through most things. The hotel does not have individually controlled air conditioning as advertised- the air con in our room is centrally controlled and is only for heating the rooms not cooling them down- when we asked about air conditioning we were told to open the windows. It was an unusually hot weekend for April but the heat was bearable without airconditioning but if you travel in the summer months I would check the situation with the hotel before booking as the heat can be unbearable in Madrid in the summer, it might be that the hotel switches it over to cool air for the summer but you need to be sure if you want a comfortable stay in the summer. Overall the staff were great very helpful, the breakfast was good and served until 12pm a bonous if having late nights! The hotels quirky design is its best feature. We had friends who stayed in a NH chain hotel and thought it very dull it might have the facilities in the room to get it more stars but it was a pokey boring room in a dull buisness hotel- alright if you like the Holiday Inn or travel lodge -if you want an experience you will remember you are better off at roommate laura. The location is also unbeatable close to all the central sites but in a lovely square opposite an art gallery and an old convent and with back streets full of trendy bars/ restuarants for locals not just tourists- what more could you want for the price.

<Content>Laura, lovely but loud We got onto room-mate through the luxe guides (and then researched them here of course)!. The rooms are funky and quite roomy (we had a mid level suite) and reasonably priced. Staff are helpful, with good grasp of English though they did sit there and watch us drag our cases up the front steps. Believe the other reviews, they are noisy until well into the morning (this is Madrid) and then church bells ring at 6.30.PlusGreat location in the centre of townFun roomPleasant staffWiFiMinusReally noisy at night, particularly Friday  Saturday (on the edge of a square)A bit lumpy in the mattressChurch bells at 6.30 amTiny telly (about 30cm screen mounted a metre from the end of the bed)

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel in a perfect location Stayed here for a long weekend in February and thought this was a great hotel in a great location. We had a duplex room which was very spacious and comfortable. The hotel is really well placed for all the major attractions and the staff were very friendly and helpful.The only downside was that it was a bit noisy on Saturday night/Sunday morning with people spilling out of a nearby bar but all things considered I would definitely choose Room Mate Laura for my next visit to Madrid.

<Content>Great hotel, but... This hotel was great and I will probably stay there again. But, I had issues with my room. I had one of the duplex suites on the second floor. It was very spacious and the decor was very trendy and modern. The layout ouf the duplex suites were a bit funky. As such, each room was different. For example, my room didn't have a closet on the first floor. In addition, my room didn't have a work desk. However, the rooms next to mine both had closets on the first floor and work desks. It may sound trivial, but dragging luggage up and down the stairs and working on a small cafe table was a pain. And, although the website said there were alarm clock in each room, there was none. Outside of that, the hotel was great. The morning breakfast was a huge spread and is included in the rate.The hotel is centrally located, overlooking a plaza. Cafes, bars, shopping, mueseums, metro are all within a very short walking distance.This hotel is one of several Room Mate hotels, which are all trendy and modern. I have also stayed at the Room Mate Mario. My experience with the hotel staff, at both locations, has been great. So, outside of some minor incoveniences that I experienced, I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Location Undoubtedly the best thing about this hotel is its location. All the major attractions were within 25 minutes walk, many only a few minutes walk away. The hotel is close to Metro stations for easy access to the airport or city sights for those not wanting to walk.Plenty of restaurants in the locality. We enjoyed our stay at Room Mate Laura very much. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a duplex room, which was very comfortable. Breakfast was available from 7.30 - 12.00 and offered a good range of choice - fruit, cereal, meat, cheese, cold tortilla, croissants, rolls, tea, coffee and fruit juice. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We were pleased to be able to leave our luggage at the hotel on our last day while we explored Madrid further. The hotel is situated in a quiet side street but there is some noise at night from people shutting up restaurants and people going home after a night out. Soundproofing in general was a bit lacking, although this did not cause us a problem.We would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Madrid. Good value for money.

<Content>miles of style! Just returned from a two week trip to Spain, and our first hotel for three nights was Room Mate Laura. The room was gorgeous, very stylish and beautifully outfitted (like a ship, everything had been well-planned.) My husband and I had a loft bedroom, and my teenaged son had a pull out bed in the living area. I'm an artist, so I loved the graphic wallpapers and sleek furnishings. The breakfast buffet was so good, and many of the other hotel guests were stylish Europeans, so breakfast was always interesting. The front desk staff were nice, the room was cleaned promptly and the hotel is very conveniently located for walking to all the major sights. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Fab room (duplex) What can I say, we are a thirty something couple and stayed here for my 33 rd birthday, we couldnt fault anything, the staff were friendly the room was trendy retro cool and the breakfast was more than sufficient, the place was central to everything and all in all it exceeded our expectations. Its so different to be able to stay somewhere modern rather than walking into a dodgy timewarp with frilly curtains and flock wallpaper. Oh and we met The Babyshambles the night before their gig in the bar next door. The icing on the cake.

<Content>Love it! Our stay was very short (about 4 hours total) but I would highly recommend this hotel and the Room Mate chain to anyone. The decor is excellent and the price is right. The two-story rooms at Laura are huge and could easily sleep 4-6 people (this wasn't evident in the website pictures).The only downsides were that you can hear everything...all rooms have a window to the lobby where you can hear people come and go. Room #101 is right next to the creaky front door so you can hear that open and close all night. And they could afford to make the showers bigger!Despite those minor complaints, we loved it and will definitely stay there again!

<Content>Great hotel , ideal location We stayed at Room Mate Laura for six nights returning to Edinburgh on 26th March . This was our second stay here and again the hotel could not be faulted . We were not upgraded to a duplex , maybe because we got a really good rate from a different website , but the room on 3rd flooor was spacious enough for two of us , with plenty cupboard space , 2 double wardrobes and a comfortable double bed, no problem with noise either internal or external . We really appreciate the kitchen with fridge , electric rings  microwave . Ask at reception for pots , crockery etc . Breakfast is great , meats , cheese , tortilla , rolls , croissants, cereal , fresh juice , a selection of fresh fruit , pastries and cakes . A wide enough variety for those on a longer stay . Within a few yards of the hotel leading towards Santa Domingo metro there are plenty of bars and restaurants , mostly frequented by locals , restaurants offer good quality menus del dia from at lunchtime 3 courses bread and a drink for 9.0E to 10.0E . Walking in the other direction from the hotel to Calle Arenal can take you to either the Opera and Royal Palace area or Puert del Sol . A really cental location althogh not bothered by noise and bustle . All in all the perfect budget hotel in a perfect location

<Content>A great location to enjoy Madrid We've just returned from a 5 night stay at Room Mate Laura, which overall I'd rate as a great wee hotel in a perfect locaiton. set on a lovely square in a very central part of the Old Town, the hotel provided us with a terrific base for both work and our holiday weekend.The rooms are modern, and comfortable - HOWEVER be aware if you are booking one of the larger Duplex rooms to request NOT TO HAVE Room 101 ! It's the most noisey room I've unfortunately had in a long time - mainly because the bedroom part of the room is directly above the stairs and constantly swishing front door - which kept me awake for the entire night!!!The staff however were brilliant and moved me the nex morning into another room - overlooking the squre which was excellent.In all a great place to stay - good value and friendly - oh and excellent breakfast served till 12 noon.

<Content>Great Hotel - very roomy We had a great stay at Hotel Room Mate Laura. We were there for 5 days. This hotel was in a great location. The staff was very friendly giving us great recommendations for food and shopping.The room was very large for a big city - with two bathrooms! We also enjoyed the breakfast which had so many options - healthy and not so! It was very contemporary and had free internet access, always an added bonus.We visited one of the other room mate hotels and had drinks at the bar. All have a very modern feel.We will definitely stay here (or another room mate hotel) again!

<Content>Fantastic hotel We couldn't have been happier with Room Mate Laura. Our room was spectacular - we were upgraded to a 'double deluxe' which was a room with a loft space, huge floor to ceiling windows and two loos. The staff were always exceptionally helpful, the breakfast was great, and we couldn't recommend this place enough. Thank you!

<Content>Great Location and Design Loved the location, close to 4 underground stations and main city points like Gran Via and Preciados. Staff is really helpful and friendly. I stayed there for business and liked the free wireless but there is no restaurant, bar, business centre, etc, so i guess it is mainly aimed to tourists. The room was great, i booked a duplex and included a little kitchen, launch area and nice big bedroom and ok bathroom. No bath though. Street noise could be a bit annoying at times. The hotel was very busy and you could hear the next doors TV and people walking around which i thought really annoying. Everything else was great, loved the design and would consider staying there again making sure i bring earplugs with me!

<Content>good for the price My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night in October. We were, as it seems many people are, upgraded to a duplex even though we had booked a standard room. That was a nice touch. However, the bed was in a loft where the ceilings were very low and the air was very stuffy and too warm. (It was unseasonably warm for October.) We couldn't open the balcony doors because of street noise and safety concerns, so we tried to put the air conditioner on low, but it would only blow hot air. When I inquired about this at the desk, twice, the staff told me this was the hotel setting and would not explain further. I overheard another guest complaining about this as well, so something must have been wrong, but they did not apologize or make any attempt to remedy the situation, which was frustrating and made for a very uncomfortable night's sleep before our flight. The design is funky and the room had great light. The very design-y stairs were cool to look at, but I would not want to climb them after an evening of drinking! As others have mentioned, while the design looks cool now, it seems like it will not age well. It's very cheaply constructed, which is why it's so affordable for a city center hotel, which we appreciated, but it will probably be pretty banged up in a year or two. Also, the bathroom is teeny tiny. I kept banging my elbows against the shower glass trying to wash my hair. It's pretty much the exact size of a tall person. Toiletries smelled nice, though.Fantastic location, easily accessible to Plaza Mayor, metro, other central sights. Free Internet access was a big perk, especially given the low price of the room. I also liked that you were rewarded with a low rate for booking 30 days or more ahead on the hotel website--we paid only 108 Euros for the room, which included breakfast. Breakfast was plentiful. Nothing hot, but I don't like hot things for breakfast anyway. We ate fresh fruit, yogurt, tortilla, fresh juice, coffee, and were very pleased with the selection. The heating problem was a bummer, and hopefully it has since been fixed. But the location is great for the price, and it was clean and spacious (other than the bathroom).

<Content>Fantastic youthful hotel - a good all rounder This hotel is great for people who like contemporary design and like a youthful vibrant feel.Hotel Laura is in a great location in the centre of Madrid near the plaza mayor and the Palace, most of the major attractions are a short walk away.The hotel staff are very helpful and pleasant and the rooms have everything you need plus more.Another bonus to our stay at Hotel Laura was the breakfast that was included which is situated in a minimalist spotless kitchen/dining room with a good variety of breakfast choices and the fantastic thing is that it stays open until midday which means you can stay in bed that little bit longer if you decide to enjoy the nightlife of Madrid.We stayed in a spacious deluxe duplex with the bedroom on a mezzanine floor and big windows, the room was fantastic and I would say the best I have stayed in when on a city break in Europe.The only downside to our stay was the fact that the bed was two twin mattresses pushed together and was not very conducive to a romantic break with my boyfriend, however I believe some rooms do have double beds so perhaps we were unlucky!If you are unsure of which hotel to book in Madrid then this is a safe bet at a very reasonable price and a good all rounder.We did also look at a couple of the other Roommate hotels in Madrid and I am sure thay are just as good as Hotel Laura,

<Content>An extremely well equipped and located little hotel I was very impressed with Room Mate Laura as soon as I entered through the door. OK, the taxi couldn't drop me off right in front of the hotel so I had to walk and drag my suitcase round the corner of the block. But once inside, you're in for a very hip and stylish experience. The staff was very pleasant and efficient, and the lobby was small but impressive looking. The room I had was cute and quirky, it's something to expect from a Room Mate hotel and this lived up to the expectation. (I know the last review said it's tacky, but hey, I wasn't expecting the Four Seasons or something with a classic posh hotel look, I was looking for something more eccentric less formulaic, which I think this did the job)Loved that wireless internet was free and the connection was good at all times. The TV even has a dvd player, although it is not a huge screen. Breakfast was very very good. Overall I really liked the convenient location, you can walk to Sol, Plaza Mayor, Opera in a few minutes. As far as locations go, you can't get much more central than this. Loved the price too -- please don't increase your rate after reading this!I would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to any of my friends. See you again soon, Laura!

<Content>Maybe good value, but really tacky I booked based on the good reviews and the nice pics, but frankly it was one of the worst hotels I've seen, if you consider the price of 150 euros, which is maybe cheap for Madrid but fairly expensive for Spain. First: the area, it's probably good for students and backpackers, but it's really the Soho of Madrid, dirty and crowded and a bit dodgy. Then the room, I was put in the suite which was basically an apartment, with a staircase that lead to a bedroom wich was made for dwarves since the height was about 1.80. The room stank, not to talk about the bathroom. I was there just for 1 night and for business, so I basically just slept in there but if I had been for holidays I would have changed hotel, Madrid has a lot better at decent prices, like the NH chain hotels. Even the furniture was that sort of modern style which is already old after a couple of years. It was the second time I slept in a room mate hotel, the first one, Mauro, was just ok, this was really bad, last time I book with them, sorry. I mean, if you are a student or are on holiday, you might want to go there but then I would try for something cheaper with the same level of comfort. The only good point was breakfast, which was fairly good.

<Content>Fabulous Service Rooms were smaller than we had expected and the bathroom was a bit squashy. However the furnishings in the room were unique the service of the staff was the best I have come across in Europe. All three staff members we spoke to were extremely helpful and friendly. I would definite recommend this hotel.

<Content>Room Mate Laura is the most Fantastic Hotel ever The Room Mate Laura was a perfect experience from start to finish. The location is splendid - a quiet plaza that is seconds from the Puerta del Sol and five minutes from the Plaza Mayor, two key areas to enjoying wonderful Madrid! Laura's staff helped us out from the moment we arrived - and nothing could prepare us for the amazing duplex, where my wife  I stayed above whilst the children slept on a comfy sofa bed (big enough for two adults, I may add). Decor is stylish  chic without being overbearing and we had two little terraces from which we could enjoy the classic narrow Madrid street below. Desayuno - breakfast - was sumptuous, with fresh cheeses, pastries, local foods, fruits - which is not always served with every Madrid hotel, mind you. Room Mate Laura was not just a hotel - it was an essential part of our magical Madrid adventure!

<Content>Nice hotel Very good location, close to Metro, nice staff, breakfast fine but not great. Our room was fairly spacious with modern furniture, flat screen tv (though we didn't watch it). Did smell of cigarettes, but we left 2 balcony doors open, and it cleared out. Had a nice view of the plaza. Also, lucked out getting to see for free a great Durer exhibit at an annex of the Thyssen Museum at the Descalzas Reales Plazas near the hotel. Hotel is not plush by any means, but staff is professional. Don't rate this higher than average because we did not have hot water in the morning so we were glad we were there only one night. Staff at checkout admitted there was a hot water problem that would be addressed but that was it. Think that in an American hotel, they'd be less matter-of-fact.

<Content>Great stay at Room Mates Laura. We very much enjoyed out stay at Room Mates Laura on our recent trip to Madrid. The staff were friendly and helpful. I'm sorry I didn't get the name of one particular staff member because he was so nice. I would have liked to let Roommates Hotels know. The hotel was clean, efficient, and attractive. An excellent value in Madrid.

<Content>Love this hotel! We loved this hotel! It actually represents in person as well as the photos do,... which is not always the case for a European hotel. We rented a studio deluxe room, it had an upstairs loft, with a desk, mini-bar and couch, and a downstairs bedroom  kitchen. I love the style mixing contemporary design with old world portraits of Queens. All of the staff spoke English and were patient and helpful. The location was great, a short walk to lots of shopping, restaurants and a 10 minute walk to the museums. It made a great and comfortable end to our 3 week trip. There was noise, like jackhammering on the street, but I think that's impossible to avoid in a city like Madrid. :)

<Content>Great Service Great Value We stayed at the Hotel Room Mate Laura 02/09/07-06/09/07 and were impressed with the service above all else. We arrived at 9 am and were placed in rooms as soon as they became available, with the assist of Luca. He also spent a significant amount of time giving us heads up on restaurants and other touristy concerns. Rooms were spacious for european standards and while kitchen amenities were lacking they were not necessary since beyond breakfast, which was included in the room price and included breads, meats, cheeses, fruits, cereals, granola, yogurt, milk-including soy milk, tea and coffee, we ate all meals out. Without question we would stay at this hotel again. Oh, and the location was a plus.

<Content>Almost Great Ok, I do still like this hotel and its brother property Room Mate Mario. After staying at both, I think Mario is a bit nicer. Overall the room was relatively spacious, v. clean and comfortable. The design details add a nice touch. The bathroom is the weak point here. There were chips in the tile wall, and paint stains on the floor. The cold breakfast buffet is great. Nothing fancy here, but plenty to choose from. The room itself is OK, but I liked the b-fast room at Mario better for the natural light, etc. All in all, solid value for money. The location is perfect. The staff are super friendly and it beats the pants off the nearest competition for the price (or not). P.S. - Photos coming soon.

<Content>Room Mate Laura OK I felt that the hotel was not nearly as well thought out as I had hoped. Although the staff was very pleasant, there is very little interaction and it felt very hands off. This might be a good thing for some travelers but I was hoping for more of an experience and this was more of just a place stay. There aren't enough common areas to meet and get a feel for the other visitors and it felt isolated inside of the hotel. The design of the hotel, although contemporary in it's direction, is fairly cheap and lacking in anything memorable. The general finish, polish, luster, is simply not there and the design felt rushed and because of this, the materials and construction methods used, will not age well and I expect the interior of the hotel to age poorly and look rather worn within a few years. I would definately hire a better designer next time and try to design an entire experience and not just a nice pattern for the wall paper. The breakfast was very nice and the juices were amazing. The area is great, very central, but at the same time it felt secluded and tucked away. One thing that I must really object to is the hotel conducting construction while there are visitors. A good bit of the hotel was being built or remodeled while we were there. We were not told that this would be the case and the first thing we saw when we walked in was a huse plastic tarp hanging from the ceiling, with dust surrounding the entrance way, and a cheap paper sign pointing to a makeshift reception desk. That alone is just unacceptable, I mean I don't get a chance to travel much and you want it to be special, all of these things added up to something sub par. I would not stay there again. I must say the next hotel we did visit was absolutely perfect and definately did exceed all of our expectations.

<Content>Good looking Laura Spent a week at the Room Mate Laura with my girlfriend. I was immediately impressed by the attractive lounge  reception area. The room was also very stylish  spacious. The balcony,whilst not big, was a nice place to relax. We certainly didn't feel cramped. The weather reports  free apple left everyday was a nice touch.The location of the Laura was very impressive. Everything noteworthy in Madrid was located within a 15/20 minute walk. It was also located close to all the Metro stations. Unlike other reviews, we found the area very quiet  had good nights sleep.The staff were amongst the most friendly we have encountered. They always said hello  were a great help when looking for football tickets or restaurants. The room was spotlessly cleaned everyday. The breakfast on offer was of a good standard  replenished every few minutes. It was great that we could go down so late in the morning.We did have a few complaints. The beds are very hard. The bathroom was plain compared to the rest of the room. A bath would have been nice. Some of the plugs didn't work and looked dangerous. There was no written information on hotel services in the room. We had to ask for everthing at the reception (how to avail of the internet,etc) but this was compensated by the friendliness of the staff when we did ask for information. Also building and drilling work began unannounced during our last day. Would've been nice to have been warned as we were woken up by the drilling.Overall, Laura is a very pretty hotel in a great location with brilliant staff. With a few adjustments she could become a supermodel of a hotel.Ps. Bring a map as our Taxi driver didn't know where the hotel was. It was lucky that we could direct him with our few words of Spanish.

<Content>Great experience We found the hotel to be very comfortable and in a fantastic location. Not very clearly signposted so keep an eye out. The breakfast was simple but we really enjoyed it. Room was cleaned every single day. Staff were amazing. Really helpful and had great English. Very friendly also. All in all we had a great stay.

<Content>The Perfect Place to stay! I found the hotel website whilst looking at hotels on various sites. I was instantly attracted to the modern chic feel to it and it seemed a good location to explore the city. It was my boyfriends birthday present so i booked the penthouse suite for our 3 night stay at a discounted price of 81 Euros per night (about 拢55). I got a discount as i booked over 30 days in advance directly with them.When we arrived in a very hot Madrid we found the hotel really easily, the closest metro stop is Opera and it is literally 2 mins walk. The Hotel is just off a small square which has a church, a couple of restaurants and another big hotel. The entrance/decor etc is just like it is on the website and very impressive. The staff on reception were fantastic and very friendly from the second we arrived, they all spoke perfect english and are happy to help with any query. Our room was superb, a large kitchen/dining area, a large relaxing area with plasma tv, minibar and sofas, a good size bathroom with double shower and a wonderful bright bedroom overlooking the square. All decorated very minimal and chic. It was well worth the money i was gobsmacked!! Breakfast was buffet style, served till noon everyday and had a great choice of cereal,fruit,toast etc. It was always fresh and nothing was ever running low or empty. the spanish omlette they served was very moreish!It was in a perfect location too, everything was within walking distance and easy to find. The hotel is in a quiet area but very well lit with street lights so we never felt threatened when coming back in the early hours. We found the only noise was from the bells at the local church, they did seem to ring at very odd times but it wasnt that bad!Madrid is a wonderful city and we intend to go back, when we do we will stay in Room mate laura again without a doubt.

<Content>Just fantastic... zero fat just appropriate perfection Traveling frequently to Madrid, Laura is clearly THE place to be if :(i) you want to feel as comfortable as at home(ii) you fancy design mixing Ikea and exclusive designers(iii) you don't fancy unnecessary services that make you stay bold and distant... here everything is there, help yourself... best quality guaranteed(iv) location is meaningful to youWe had a bad experience with the Penthouse room with deficient heating system... we can't consider it wasn't fixed.

<Content>Loved it! I love Madrid - it is my favourite city in the whole world. I don't know why because it's not the most attractive or historically significant, but what it does have is an incredible atmosphere. This hotel is located brilliantly - close to everything but it in a quiet area. I stayed in a penthouse room and paid 80 euros a night. It was a huge room, very comfortable with extremely reliable A/C which was just as well as temperatures outside were in excess of 40 degrees celsius. WiFi throughout hotel, good breakfast and nice staff. I will always stay here whenever I return to Madrid.

<Content>Okay - decent location We stayed at the Laura for 3 nights in July 2007. We booked a standard room. When we arrived, our room was not ready, so they upgraded us to a Duplex. It was very large (approx 600 sqft), but has the perilous stairs as mentioned by other reviewers. The staff was very professional and helpful. The breakfast was good. We had no problems with the free wifi internet access. The cleanliness was okay. The only problems we did have is that the physical qualities of the property were not up to the expectations of a 3 star hotel. The bed had the most uncomfortable mattress we have ever slept in. The linens were of just okay quality and the towels were worn. I have had more comfortable stays at Motel 6s. The build quality of the property was not great and the finish work was nonexistent. Basically, the builders and designers cheaped out. It's like they tried to do what The Square Hotel in Copenhagen did (a hip, modern hotel with minimalist furnishings), but failed.The location was good. It was within walking distance to the Palace, the Old Town, and the Museum District. Everything we asked of the staff was done with no problems. But a good staff isn't enough for me to give this property more than two stars.

<Content>Great time at the Laura My friend and I stayed at the Hotel Laura for five nights, and were delighted the moment we walked in the door: a fresh coat of paint and new decorations seemed to be all that had happened, but the place was modern, well-lit, and well-appointed. Our room was tidy, with plenty of closet space and room to move around. We were charmed by the green apples left bedside and the card left on our bed indicating the high and low for the next day. Most of the folks at the desk spoke excellent English and were more than obliging when asked for help. Breakfast was in a lovely room downstairs, and included fresh fruit, croissaints with Nutella, cheeses, meats, breads, and traditional Spanish omelet. We left full every morning, especially since their breakfast hours were from 7-12. We weren't penalized for oversleeping! Since the Hotel Laura is situated so close to the Plaza Mayor, we had no trouble walking just about anywhere. Metro stops are also quite close. The only trouble we had was receiving an important call one night: the desk clerk that didn't speak English was able to patch my family member through, while the fluent one was not able to do so, which was odd. Also, the bed was quite firm, though we amended that with every pillow we could find. Should I ever get the chance to go back to Madrid, this is definitely where I will stay: clean, affordable, pretty (shouldn't matter to me, but it does!), and some of the friendliest people I've ever met.

<Content>Great staff great hotel Everything about our stay at the hotel Laura was great.I really liked the Delux Duplex we were upgraded to, the decor was funky and relaxed. The staff on the front desk were very friendly and relaxed . But the best bit was having returned to our room at 7am after a wedding the morning we were due to check out the staff letting us extend our check out time until 2pm so we could get some sleeep. I will definately stay in a Room Mate hotel again.

<Content>Hot Hot Not The rooms were certainly different, clean and well equipped however it lacked any atmosphere and a little cold and unwelcoming. We stayed in 207, the paint in the bathroom was coming off the floor. The stairs to the living area were very precarious. The room was sound proof.The staff were very pleasant at the reception and helpful when required.It is positioned fabulously for the centre of Madrid, although you will need a map to help you find it if you are on foot.

<Content>loved the place Booked this place with a little apprehension, due to the negative comments on this site. Booked directly thru Room Mate website, not thru one of the suppossed 'discount sites'. Upon arrival we were given an upgrade to a penthouse room, with large living room and separate bedroom, and were brought two small bottles of compimentary cava sparkling wine on ice. The original booking rate quote was billed. The staff were all extremely friendly, the room was great, and the breakfast buffet, (included in room rate) very good, with healthy and plentiful choices.We were at many four star hotels in the month we were in Spain and this was the best room we stayed in, and one of the nicest hotels. The location was also great.

<Content>RoomMate Laura: Great location, good value hotel A great 'chic and cheap' option in the very heart of Madrid. Stylish,clean rooms -although fairly low spec. And the good friendly, chilledstaff made for a very pleasurable stay.Only annoyance was that our room was downgraded from a 'duplex' to'executive suite' with the front desk citing problems with the plumbing that won't be fixed for a couple of days...It was very obvious that the hotel was over booked and the plumbing was fine. We would have apprecaited the truth not some lame excuse.

<Content>Great vibe, excellent location, super staff! While in Madrid, we stayed at both Laura and Mario hotels. Both were within easy walking distance of all the sites. We had a fantastic experience at both hotels. The decor was beautiful and our rooms were very comfortable and spacious. The best part of our experience was the bilingual staff. They were all warm, friendly and eager to help us. We'll definately be staying at a Room Mate hotel again soon, and recommend them to everyone traveling to Spain. Especially good for younger travelers with some money to spend and an eye for design.

<Content>not there yet We stayed at the hotel as it came recommended in a number of magazines lately. Check in was effortless and quick and in no time we were off to our duplex room (鈧?90/night including breakfast booked on hotel website) on the ground floor. First impressions were good. A large duplex room with white minimalist d茅cor, featuring a large design mirror and a mezzanine which has its own bathroom encased in glass. On closer inspection the faults started to appear. First off the air-conditioning was not working and it took the hotel more than 24hours to get it to work. At 32c in Madrid at the time it can get VERY hot in the room. As we requested a smoking room ashtrays had to be ordered from reception. The desire of the hotel to be a design boutique hotel has not been followed through on. The glass bathroom had a lot of white paint smeared on the glass and did not come with toiletries. The main bathroom was simple and clean (at least on the first day, more on that further below). However the fixings were cheap and the again attention to detail was lacking. The tiles were pained over (badly) with white gloss pain making it look cheap and not so boutique hotel. The mini bar did not contain a bottle opener and again reception had to be asked for support. Now it should be noted that the staff were very courteous throughout and helpful.The bed was large but not very comfortable.The breakfast is a simple buffet affair. Unfortunately no hot options were available and at times there were problems with items not being replenished quickly enough. Housekeeping was not the best. One day the bathroom was only selectively cleaned and towels were taken but not replaced. This and the lack of air-conditioning for 24 hours were the biggest problems we encountered.Overall Room Mate Laura is centrally located (expect some noise from the outside), has stylish rooms and with a bit more attention to detail could be a good mid price hotel. However if you have ever stayed at an international boutique hotel you will come to realise that this property has not yet achieved what it set out to do. In its current format it is very hard if not impossible to justify 鈧?190 a night for a room.I should state that when I mentioned the problems we had during our stay the hotel immediately dropped the price to 鈧?50 a night and apologised. Again this is a credit to the staff at Room Mate Laura.

<Content>An excellent, contemporary, central choice I have just returned from an amazing weekend in Madrid with 10 friends and had a perfect stay at the Laura.Very stylish rooms and we all received upgrades to duplexes giving lots of space to get ready.Non fussy communal areas allowed us to get between the rooms easily and make the place our own.Breakfast, simple yet all you could need and a God send that after a night clubbing, open until at least 1pm. Continental in style with something to suit all. If you are going to Madrid to have fun then this is the best centrally located hotel you will find for a mid range budget. 2 mins from Arenal and Gran Via and a mere 30 second stumble home from Joy!

<Content>A little disappointed I booked two nights at a different property, Roomate Alicia and received a confirmation but was told they were filled when I arrived. Fortunately I printed out the confirmation since they had no record of me. Alicia was situated right on the Prado (at the very end) in a jumping area. It was connected to a restaurant with a lot of activity right outside the door. I did not see the rooms but the lobbly was all white with accent color -- very hip and trendy. The clientele seemed the same.The front staff did not tell me they had no rooms but immediatley spoke in Spanish (I don't speak the language) and looked frantic -- it was obvious they had no room. They contacted their other properties and sent me via cab (they paid) to RoomMate Laura. Laura was located closer to the Opera House and Arenal -- a convenient location for sightseeing, but it was a little bit removed, on a side street that seemed a little seedy at night. They upgraded me to duplex room (which they seem to do often from other Trip Advisor reviews). I asked instead for a slight deduction in my rate but they refused (not angrily).The room itself was nice. if you like contemporary, artsy' decor you'll love the aesthetic (as I do), if you are more traditional then you won't. There isn't much to say other than it is a strong statement and only personal preference. The room had no bathtub -- only shower but was otherwise well supplied. The bathroom was in need of sprucing up -- paint was chipping from the walls and fixtures. Not too bad but compared with the very white, clean look of the place any flaw stood out.Breakfast was fine in the dining room -- assorted meats, cereals, pastries, etc. The staff was young and eager to help. the bed was comfortable, the flat screen tv a little small but fine. OverallIi was a little disappointed by the property (compared to what the Alicia seemed like) but I can recommend it for the right price.

<Content>Room Mate Laura's a good option for central Madrid Room Mate Laura is a centrally located serviced apartment in a renovated building with imaginative modern decor. It was clean and comfortable, with an unusual two-level layout. Access to the upper level (lounge, cupboard and desk) might be difficult for the very unfit. Like all Madrid CBD accommodation it is subject to some street noise at night, but is OK with windows shut. Although it has a small kitchen no utensils, cutlery or crockery were provided, so it was difficult to use. This was a disappointment. There is an included breakfast, which is adequate, but with little choice: no hot items. There is also a joint-use laundry and it would have been helpful if this had been mentioned in in-room documentation. Free wireless internet was also available. Staff were friendly and helpful, but had a range of English language ability. We (a mature couple) would return given the opportunity.

<Content>This is a great hotel!! We stayed for 3 nights at this hotel. It was the least expensive hotel we found in Madrid and it was beautiful and comfortable. The staff was so friendly and so helpful without exception. Breakfast was included and was very adequate. It's a great location, very central to all things and within walking distance of almost everything you want to see. The room was great and it spoiled us. It had a loft with the bed and desk upstairs and then downstairs were couches, a TV, a table and chairs and a bathroom. The mattress wasn't bad at all and I have a terrible back. We loved this hotel and would stay there again in a minute. You will be happy you did.

<Content>Nice place to stay We found this a very nice place to stay during our weekend break in Madrid. The young staff were courteous, helpful and ever smiling during our dealings with them. The hotel is kept spotlessly clean and is in an excellent location for visiting the main tourist venues, most of which can easily be reached on foot. The hotel has an ultra modern decor throughout so expect minmalist chic. The only downside of the stay was getting up and down the terrifyingly steep staircase which split the two floors in our room (room 101). For this reason, if you book a two floor room then beware if you are elderly or infirm. The location is on the nice side of Puerta del Sol Square (we found streets off the other side of the square to be seedy) There is a good range/choice of bars restaurants in the vicinity. The local restaurants offer excellent value for money with their 'menu del dia'. Madrid is a beautiful city with lots to see and do, however, we hadn't realised that it had become a destination for British stag and hen parties and we observed several incidents of loutish, drunken behaviour that made us ashamed to be identified as British ourselves. Local Spanish young people do not go in for getting drunk and some of the yobbos we saw were making complete idiots of themselves. In one bar we saw a group of young men have to be physically ejected by the staff because of their behaviour as locals and tourists of various nationalities looked on in horror. Avoid any of the 'Irish' pubs at night time as this is the crowd they cater for -stick to proper spanish cafes and bodegas where you will be able to have a quiet drink in civilised company. There are dozens of them tucked away in the side streets. By the way, a little Spanish goes a long way here - any effort will be appreciated.A very enjoyable weekend at a nice hotel.

<Content>Air - con con. If you fancy a long weekend in Madrid this is hard to beat. It is spotlessly clean, the staff are helpful and friendly and the position is excellent.The only downside is that the area is noisy at night. Not a problem if you can keep your windows shut, but we found that despite all attempts to adjust it ,the aircon only blows hot air. I queried this with the staff and was told that in spite of individual fan units in the room, the system is centrally managed. Being April the Spaniards think it is winter! Being northern Europeans 20C feels a lot like summer to us!

<Content>If you want style, you've got it! We arrived on the Thursday evening for a long weekend. At first we did have a shock of the front steps, I have a mobility scooter and it doesn't climb stairs! The staff were quick to offer an alternative entrance that had a lift into the building. This was via the underground private car park, and operated by remote control. The remote opened the gates and called the lift automatically and opening the doors. The lift is for cars to go down to the car park. From the car park level there is another lift to go up into the rest of the hotel. Because of the inconvenience of having to go around this way we were upgraded to a pentouse suite, which was great for my vehicle being so roomy. There is no upper level on a mezzanine like other rooms and a larger shower room, so disabled user friendly. The only difficulty was the narrow corridor when getting out of the lift, manouvering was tight! Although if one has a problem with using the shower or loo there wasn't much space for another person to help, and no wheelchair space at all. Yes this area is noisy at night, the Madridians party all night, finally going quiet around 5am!

<Content>Snazzy hotel, great value for money! We stayed at this hotel for a break over Easter and were more than impressed! The room was a good size, and was well equipt with four wardrobes (good for all the shopping!). The decor was pretty cool too, made it feel as though we were staying in an almost 'boutique' hotel, even though we had paid budget prices for the rooms. The hotel itself was immaculate, and the room was cleaned to a decent standard every day. The breakfast was good - we thought it the selection was extensive and were able to stock up on food to keep us going well into the afternoon! We were also impressed that breakfast was served til noon which meant we could sleep in until we wanted. The buffet was always neat and constantly replenished. The staff were also helpful, as others have mentioned - on the day we left they were willing to open the restaurant early for us to have breakfast (our flight was in the morning). The fact that it had no bar or restaurant made it a no-fuss hotel, and with so many facilities nearby there would really be no need. The road works were still ongoing at the time of our stay, but everything needs updating once in a while, and as another reviewer wrote, they are temporary and didn't have an effect on our stay. All in all a great hotel in an amazing city! Highly recommended!

<Content>everything you read is true Before heading to madrid, i was reading reviews about Laura on trip advisor.the general vibe from the reviews was - cool decor, not much facilities, service not great - except for front desk which was good and great location. I saw pictures of the decor and fell in love with the place. It is very cool decor... but I have to be honest, I did miss a gym, pool and room service like other hotels would normally have. The breakfast service also wasn't great, dirty plates lying around, etc. But as far as other hotel rooms go - it's very cool. It's more like a small one-bed apartment really. so in a nutshell, i would say:if you're looking for a funky place in the heart of the city - GO! if you love your little luxuries like room service and pools/jacuzzis.. don't.

<Content>Cool Place Except the Jack Hammer Outside I was traveling with my girlfried for two weeks and decided to stay here while in Madrid. We picked this place becuase it had a great write up in the New York Times.  Upon arriving we were impressed with the lobby, room, and location. It was more than expected. While checking in they also gave us a room upgrade which we thought was awesome at the time.  Our stay kind of took a downward turn at about 7:00 AM the first morning when we were awoken by jack hammers right outside our window. I understand hotels can't stop construction for guests, but a little warning would have been nice. We also thought it was amuzing that they put us in the room directly above the jack hammer. We questioned whether the room we were given was truely an upgrade.  We complained about this situation, but were offered no sympathy or help.  If visiting Madrid we would definately stay here. Rooms are big, clean, and new. Breakfast was up to par as well. Just be sure there is no construction outside your window.

<Content>Nice little hotel The Room Mate Laura is a funky little hotel located in Old Madrid, 5 minutes from Plaza Callao and its shopping, 7 minutes from Plaza Major and its throngs of tourists. It is slightly out-of-the-way, so it is quiet, and it has these amazing window shades that made our room pitch black in the middle of a sunny Madrid afternoon. Perfect for that siesta, which you need when dinner isn't served until 11 pm. The morning breakfast isn't gourmet but it's good, and the staff were friendly and helpful. Plus, it's not expensive. What more could you want?

<Content>Cool and classy yet cheap! A friend and I stayed at the Hotel Laura about a month ago for a several-day visit to Madrid. Our experience there was wonderful. First of all, we were warmly greeted upon check-in and upgraded to the duplex level room at no extra cost. The room was huge considering what we paid; substantially bigger than our New York apartments. I believe the same type of room has been described before: living area on first floor, complete with bathroom, walk-in kitchenette, large couch, breakfast table, balcony with street view, flat screen wall mounted TV, and closets; and bedroom, desk area, and more closet space upstairs. Yes, perhaps the staircase is a little tough to master, but the room has a great setup and you can't beat the amount of space. The furnishings are not at all opulent, but they are trendily attractive (think IKEA) and the space is very pleasing to the eye considering its cost.The free breakfast is really fantastic--most free hotel breakfasts (at least in the states) consist of bad coffee, instant oatmeal, bagels, and some sorry looking fruit. This breakfast included cured meats, cheeses, a Spanish omelette, a wide range of juices, breads, and much more. Two very small gripes: first of all, the hotel advertised a free wi-fi connection, and maybe it's the fault of my computer, but we couldn't connect (and the man at the desk at the time was of very little help). Second of all, the room could have had a couple more basics in the kitchen--we wanted to have a bottle of wine and some snacks before heading out but there were no wine glasses, corkscrew, silverware, or plates. However, considering the amount we were paying it's okay to let that go.Overall, it's a wonderful budget/boutique hotel in a great location, the perfect place for young travelers looking for a cool, affordable, place to stay!

<Content>All "fur coat and no knickers" Went to Madrid for second time in 3 months with 2 friends and stayed here based on the Trip Advisor reviews. I'm afraid my confidence in Trip Advisor reviewers has been shaken by this hotel as I didn't find it anything like as good as many others. It has some good points but it places far too much emphasis on quirky style but lacks many of the basics I expect of a decent hotel. Like many other reviewers we also had a duplex room, this time on the ground floor, with the bed downstairs. The upstairs space had a ridiculously deep sofa at 90 degrees to the flat screen TV and was frankly a waste of time. The stairs have already been commented on before and I agree with those who feel they are a health and safety hazard.Good points: nice staff, good location, good bed, good shower, bathroom small but ok.Bad points: 1 key between 3 guests, no additional copies available; pointless upstairs space; no tea/coffee facilities in room or even in hotel except at breakfast time (I know there are lots of places nearby but sometimes you just want to chill out in the hotel or room); only one ironing board for hotel, which was unavailable for hours because another guest had it but reception didn't know/care where it was; uncomfortable chairs in room. There was just nothing that made us want to spend anymore time in the room than was strictly necessary.In summary this place falls a long way short of what I consider a 4 star hotel to be, I would say 2 stars would be more appropriate. A little more attention paid to the basics of being a hotel instead of the apparent obsession with vacuous style would serve this hotel very well.

<Content>Good hotel, great locationl Stayed in a superior duplex room on the 2nd floor, lounge area at lower level with bedroom on mezzanine level up the suicidally steep, glossy staircase, (needless to say my partner fell down the stairs while carrying her suitcase - ever heard of risk assessments Laura?) Also strange providing kitchen but no utensils, had to ask for 2 cups and saucepan (no kettles) to make tea. All minor quibbles though - this is a good hotel with helpful staff in a great location. Similar to other guests we experienced late night street noise but this is a centrally located hotel in a big nightlife area, I think this is a common problem with many city centre hotels. The noise tends to be sporadic and in keeping with the lust for life that exemplifies Madrid! Breakfast is good with decent coffee, staff are helpful, hotel is pleasingly quirky and very stylish. We very much enjoyed Madrid and would heartily recommend Laura.

<Content>We're in love with Laura What a find! The Laura is a wonderful modern style hotel in a central location handy for the Palacio Real and Plaza Mayor and a comfortable walk from Museo del Prado and the Parc Retiro. There is good shopping close at hand.The staff were very friendly and gave some excellent restaurant recommendations. The rooms were very interesting and wonderfully clean. We stayed in a duplex which was very nice although the stairs to the upper level would have been a bit of a challenge to the less able bodied. We had two plasma TVs and a second bathroom on the upper level with a toilet and basin. The lower bathroom had shower, toilet, bidet and basin.The included buffet breakfast was more than acceptable although we would have liked a slightly wider choice.Only two slight negatives:The nuns in the nearby Converito de Las Descalzas Reales were awakened, along with the rest of us, by clanging bells at precisely 6:30 a.m. The ringing did not go on for long and we managed to gett back to sleep again afterwards.Also there were workmen digging up the small cobblestones around the hotel. This made access quite difficult and their noise and vibration started around 8:30 a.m.. This, of course, is a temporary inconvenience which may last just a few more weeks.All in all, a brilliant little hotel.

<Content>Wonderful staff, but... This hotel has a wonderfully central location and exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. Breakfasts are super (the best oranges ever!) and the rooms are spotlessly clean. Very comfortable beds. The price for the central location is the noise, however, which seems to go on throughout the night. And right now they are doing major (and I mean major)roadworks right outside the hotel, and the road-digging starts very early. The rooms are fun and quirky (we were apparently 'upgraded' from a duplex to a 'superior duplex' - does everyone get upgraded?) but the the layout was a bit weird - the 'sitting area' was upstairs, though there were no comfortable chairs or sofa - you had to lounge on what was basically another bed, there were certainly no bathrobes, as promised in the blurb, and yes, there is a kitchenette, but not a spoon or a cup or a plate or a saucepan - so you're a bit limited as to what you can do in it. Small bathroom and not the greatest shower either - one of those that is difficult to get either not too hot or not too cold. Nowhere to hang your coats when you come in from outside (well, unless you totter up the very steep stairs to the cupboard that's located in the 'sitting area'). I hate to be critical because the staff were so wonderful but it just wasn't very comfortable. I'd like to think we'll be back - but I suspect that we won't. (Have just read through some other reviews and we had the same duplex as the guy who stayed in January and said he thought he had the worst room in the hotel - maybe we were just unlucky, too!)
