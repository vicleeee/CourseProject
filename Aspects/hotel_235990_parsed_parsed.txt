<Content>Amazing Boutique hotel in via Tornabuoni Great boutique hotel, in via Tornabuoni, just next to all the top brand shops.Absolute great location...5 minutes walk to Uffizzi, Ponte Vecchio, and Piazza Duomo.Hotel reception is on 2nd floor. Rooms nicely furnished.Did book a 2 rooms suite (suite nr: 19, on 3rd floor), for the price of 150Euro per night, breakfast included. Amazing !!!Hotel is rated 3star, but its excellent services, and its rooms, make this hotel, more like a 4 star hotel.WIFI internet is available and free of charge.Bathrooms are small, but very clean.Ask Reception for pre-booking tickets for Uffizzi visit, so no needto make queue.Just outside hotel (walk left 50 meters, just next to magnificent Palazzo Ferragamo) you can get on the 2 deck Tourist Bus, to visit Florence and its surroundings (tickets purchase inside bus).Enjoy Florence !!!

<Content>A Beautiful Stay A very nice 3 star hotel with great service, large rooms, and a superb location. We walked there from the train station (Santa Maria Novella) in about 10 minutes. All the major attractions of Florence are within 15 minutes walk of the front door. Our room was on the back of the hotel and was extremely quiet. Nice breakfast in the morning; also a small bar for a nip at the end of the day. All the staff were very helpful; most spoke English well.

<Content>Excellent location La Residenza has a great location in Florence. No more than a 15 minute walk from any of the major sites (on both sides of the Arno). Also, if you love designer shopping, you'll be in heaven. All the big designers have stores on the same street. Prada was directly across the street and the other big names were just a few doors down.Staff was helpful and friendly. Breakfast was very nice and included meats, cheeses, cereals, breads, yogurt, juice, and any type of hot beverage you could want including espresso, hot chocolate, lattes, etc. Our family booked three rooms at the hotel. All three rooms had very modern, spacious bathrooms. But if you need a powerful blow dryer, bring your own. The hotel blow dryers were not very powerful. I will probably book this hotel for future trips to Florence.

<Content>Ask for a room at the back - not facing onto street Hotel was easy to find, Great map on website - That's all it has going for it.Arrived at hotel after 21/2 hour train journey and then had to lug cases up their stairs as the lift was broken. Their reception is on the second floor and our room was then on 3rd floor.Room was clean however there were a good few loose floor tiles, Hairdryer on wall in bathroom had wires hanging out of it. Filthy smell of cigarette smoke in the room. Carpet on landing on way to room was filthy. Was kept awake for whole 3 nights by traffic on VERY bust street below. Asked at 4am on first night if we could switch rooms but none available. Got new towels only after 2nd night when I complained.We were in Italy for honeymoon and we stayed in 3 hotels in total - The other 2 were fabulous but this one was a disaster.

<Content>Perfect location We stay 3 nights at la residenza. Rooms are very clean. The owner of the hotel was a nice old lady. Her son luciano was also nice and helpful. We feel us like at home. The hotel is in the centre of firenze. Very close to restaurants, city center and nice stores. (Prada is across the street, cartier is under the hotel, all famous brands are in the same street) I ll definitely stay in this hotel in my next trip.

<Content>Great! Excellent accommodation. We asked for a room with a balcony and had fantastic views over the river! pleasantly surprised - 4 star quality suite, large room with sitting room and lovely antiques. Central location. Breakfast basic and could have been a little better. Would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>great location and very friendly service We stayed at this hotel 4 nights. The location is very central as you can virtually walk everywhere. The customer service was perfect. The different receptionists were all very helpful and gave excellent recommendations. There is one hint though: the noise of the street traffic and the small size of the room. However, if you are well-traveled like us, you know that rooms are small in Europe and Florence is a city which means traffic noise.

<Content>Stains on carpet = bad hotel The location of this hotel is great. It's on the best street for shopping in Florence, but it is located on the upper floors of a building, meaning you have to get up steps and then take an elevator just to reach the check in. We got there late in the evening and the elevator was already shut down for the night. Big pain to carry luggage up to the 3rd floor. The room itself was not good. Carpet had stains everywhere. Bed was hard as a rock. Bathroom was small even for European standards. But for the fact that the hotel was close to all sights, I would not recommend this place to anyone. If you're looking to save money, this place is okay, but if you want to be comfortable, go elsewhere.

<Content>Poor Standard We had a 3 night stay here and were very disappointed with the hotel. Our room had threadbare carpets, poor quality curtains, dirty walls in need of re-decorating and hard beds. The decor was generally very shabby and tired looking. Breakfast was very basic with hot and cold drinks dispensed from very tempramental vending machines.I felt the 3 star grading flattered the hotel and at best would grade it 1/2 star. The hotels location is excellent and its only good feature. You are paying for its location and not its quality. I find it very difficult to be positive about this hotel.

<Content>Rooms vary in quality, but otherwise OK We only stayed in this hotel for one night. Our room was extremely small. The bathroom was even smaller, the size of a cruise ship bathroom if not smaller. The beds were comfortable enough. Luckily we didn鈥檛 spend too much time in the room. However the couple traveling with us had a really nice large room, probably twice the size of ours, with a balcony, and really large bathroom. And we paid the same amount for the two rooms, even though they were vastly different in quality, 90 euros for the night. The hotel also has a really nice terrace with tables and a computer/tv room. Although I don鈥檛 think the computer has internet access and it鈥檚 really old. Breakfast was the typical yogurt, breads, meat, cheese, juice, and cappuccinos. I probably wouldn鈥檛 stay here again, unless I knew I was going to get a nicer room, like the one the other couple had.

<Content>Excellent location and rooms We just returned from Florence. We had a wonderful experience in the town. The hotel was a good part of it. It's location is excellent. We felt very safe there. In the midst of the pricey shopping district (we didn't shop there but it's fun to look). It is very convenient to restaurants, the Internet Train Cafe, and attractions. We walked everywhere except we took taxis to and from the train station with our luggage. Otherwise, we even walked to the train station - about a 10-15 minute walk.The staff was excellent, breakfast was awesome, and our room and bathroom were very roomy and well appointed.Always clean in our rooms as well as the public areas. We would love to return - the greatest compliment we could give!

<Content>happy memories We stayed here in October on our first trip to Italy. We were here 3 nights, then to Siena for 5, then back to La Residenza for the final 2, so we experienced 2 different rooms. We were completely comfortable and the great location helped us get acclimated quickly. The staff was helpful and friendly, and when they found out it was my birthday, surprised us with a bottle of wine and a little note. So nice! We particularly enjoyed the breakfast. Capucino is included here (it cost extra in Siena). The minibar is well stocked and very reasonably priced as well. I am eager to return to Florence, and would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Great Location  We just got back from an 8 day italy trip. 3 nights in rome, 2 in Florence  2 in venice. We booked using europeandestinations.comI choose this hotel for the location. I have a teenage daughter and when I found out it was next to Cartier, I knew she'd get a kick out of it. When we got there, I couldn't believe it not only is it next to Cartier. It's across the street from Prada and on the same block as all of the fancy stores - Gucci and so many others! If you're going to rome, I would skip the fancy stores at the Spanish Steps. They're all here and are significantly less crowded!What also surprised me was that I didn't realize how close it is to everything else! My husband has a bad leg and we mostly cabbed it in Rome but here we walked to EVERYTHIING. It's a few blocks to the Uffuizzi and the Duomo and the Ponte Vecchio and more!The hotel itself is very cute. It has an old fashioned lift where you need to close the door. The proprietors were wonderful. It's run by an old italian women and her son. It was very clean. It had a relatively new bathroom and it was decorated fairly well with unique pieces in every room - Some a little older than others. The accomodations weren't exactly luxury - not like our hotel in Rome - Albergo del Senato, but we had two room (for a family of 4) and it worked well. If I went back, I would definitely choose to stay there again. It also had a great roof deck and had a sitting room that had a computer you could access for free and get internet! Just as an fyi in rome we stayed in the Albergo del Senato. I would definetely recommend that to anyone and in venice stayed at the Hotel Commercio  Pellegrino which also had a great location and I would also recommend that - I'm writing a review of those also.Good Luck!

<Content>Just perfect. We really felt that we were staying in a typical homely florentene atmosphere. The triple room was large and very clean with lovely old bric-a-brac.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and welcoming. The location could not be more perfect for dining, shopping and sightseeing. Helen Scott Jan 06

<Content>A Little Piece of Paradise Tucked between two of the great Italian fashion boutiques on a street a dreams in the heart of antique Florence, you will find La Residenza to be a charming and delightful retreat.The location is fantastic. There are several delightful restaurants withinn 2 or 3 blocks from the hotel, and Gabrielle, the incredible manager of La Residenza will make all the reservations for you. He will also make all your tour reservations and direct you to the best places to visit. The walks to the Ponte Vecchio, Pitti Palace, Duomo, Plaza Repubblico were easy to manange. Our triple room was very large, with tall ceilings, air conditioning, yet the feel was of old Firenze. Beds were large and comfortable, with a large bathroom including bath and shower. The other public rooms in the hotel are delightful as well, including a charming breakfast room, internet room and the outside terrace on the 4th or 5th floor. Gabrielle will bring you a glass of wine to enjoy as you relax at La Residenza. His personal touch and helpful manner make you feel pampered during your visit to this hotel. I highly recommend La Residenza!

<Content>Fabulous location and helpful staff helped make this stay memorable. The Hotel La Residenza was a great find and we stayed there for 10 nights on our recent trip to Florence. The staff were attentive and helpful. The rooms were very clean and large; the bathrooms modern and recently renovated. The location of this charming hotel was perfect, right in the center of the historical part of Florence. We would definitely recommend this hotel to others and would stay there again on another trip.

<Content>La Residenza is really OK folks. My wife and I have recently spent 4 days in wonderful Firenze. We booked La Residenza ..actually by mistake ( its a long story) and were worried by some of the reviews. We need not have been. Although it may not be to every ones taste we thought it well located, comfortable , quirky, the breakfast was very good and the management very helpful.It is true ..the lift is small . Three people max. However it is a design wonder.A period piece of glass and fine wood . probably a thirties job ..or even earlier.the short of it is that it works perfectly. We did not fancy our first room ..at the front of the hotel because I thought it would be noisy at night. In fact the street is very quiet at night. The staff were v. helpful and gave me the keys to available rooms so I could choose which one we liked. We chose room 21 on the fourth floor at the back with views of the Duomo and Campanile ( Palazzio Vechio).The bathroom was v.small but we coped and the general charm of the room helped us overcome that particular concern. There is a fine roof terrace and a lounge area for those that want it. True ..the hotel is a little tired but it is full of charm and taste. There are however stairs to climb so the Hotel may not be perfect for the infirm or for families with small children. The lift goes only to the third floor so if you dont like stairs ask for a room on the second or third floors. Try it . We thought it very good value for money and anyway we quite like quirky and slightly eccentric Hotels..just like us really.In Firenze there are many places to eat but none quite as good as the gem we found called `The golden open view`. Go over the Ponte Vecchio, turn left, walk about 50 -75 yards and there it is . Once again it was a chance find. You will find it difficult to choose elsewhere to eat once you have sampled the grub in this exemplary and relatively inexpensive eaterie.Ask for table overlooking the River Arno ( get there early) ..quite delightful.Enjoy

<Content>Shabby but not chic I don't know if all the other reviewers stayed in the same hotel that I did, but I found it extremely shabby and run down. I wasn't expecting the Ritz, and although perfectly located on Tournabuoni in the high-rent district (Pucci, Gucci, Cartier), I'm sure those shoppers don't stay here. There is no lobby and the reception desk is on the 2nd floor. There is a tiny elevator which won't hold 2 people with luggage, so the options are several trips or the stairs. The first room (tiny) I was shown looked like the room in a monastary, and the 2nd room wasn't much better. Carpet was old, dirty and threadbare, as were the curtains and bedspreads. I can't quite figure out the rating system, as this is a 3-star. I had a room on the 4th floor (elevator doesn't go that high) and when I checked out there was no one to help me with my luggage so I had to schlepp it down the stairs myself.Would definitely NOT stay here again, as there are tons of other options in Florence. I guess 100 euros/nite (February) with bath and breakfast make it a good budget hotel, but nothing else.

<Content>Home Away from Home Just returned from a wonderful 2 night stay at this great little gem of a hotel. The hotel owners go out of their way to make your stay pleasant. We had wine each evening in their inviting living room area, and enjoyed a very delicious breakfast each morning in the adjacent dining room. The nicely decorated rooms were spacious and bathrooms were new. The location, next to Cartier and other fashionable shops and restaurants was ideal. I can't wait to return to this very nice home away from home!

<Content>Beyond our expectations I stayed at la Residenza in 1995, so I thought I knew what to expect when my husband and I visited recently for our anniversary. It was even better this time. Hospitality above and beyond. The location is perfect. Close to everything. They may not mention the rooftop terrace that is our favorite part about the hotel, so seek it out. Breakfast was the best of any hotel we visited during our trip. Our room had a bonus room that we weren't expecting, so if you go, you may want to request that. La Residenza is locatated close enough to the train station to make a walk with luggage bearable. When arriving, take the cool old elevator to the 2nd floor. We can't wait to return.
