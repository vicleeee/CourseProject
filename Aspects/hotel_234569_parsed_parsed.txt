<Content>Do not stay here! Do not stay in this hotel! There is no way this hotel deserves four stars. I had no water in the shower - two days in a row! The staff would not help me (reception staff hardly speaks English) or allow me to change rooms. I had to shower in a colleague's room the first day and did not shower the second day. Some rooms (mine!) are ridiculously small - I didn't even have any room to put my suitcase down. In addition I couldn't control the heat in my room: I slept with an open window and ranging heater. I was in Barcelone for a conference and would expect a four star hotel to have internet wifi and a desk in each room, but no. Furthermore, it was noisy. When I complained at check-out, I was completely ignored. So:- no water to shower- tiny rooms - no climat control- noise- unfriendly  incapable staff.

<Content>Great location We stayed at this hotel for three nights and had a great time in Barcelona although it was raining for most of the time. The hotel was smaller than the impression you get from pictures. It was clean (cleaning every day), the room was accomodating in size and standard, not overly extravagant but not rough. Bathroom was ok and clean. The only really big problem was the insulation. At night (if you got a room facing the street as we did) it sounded as if the people were actually in your room or at least that a window was open which was not the fact. Also loud noise from other rooms such as clicking shoes and scraping of furniture. The real plus is it's fantastic location right in the middle of old town, 5 minutes walking to Las Ramblas, the port or Plaza Catalunya. Breakfast was a let down as it did not have great variation, but for Spain I think it was the norm. The last morning though the staff (=person) in the restaurant was nowhere to be seen and the coffee was cold. The staff of the reception took the anomality with perfect calm and was not overly concearned by this... No coffee until the airport therefore. I would give the hotel three stars although it gives a rather elegant impression when you get out of your taxi the first time and see all the chandeliers and marble floors, but in the corridors and room it's more of a three star. We did leave rather happy as we tend to be a bit suspicious of the classification of hotels and therefore we did not have overly great expectations.

<Content>4 star - I dont think so! This should definitely NOT be graded as a 4 star hotel. The facilitites are poor, the rooms are small and the bathroom was old and not very clean. The breakfast was terrible. The only good thing about it was it's location. It is easy to get to anywhere from this hotel. If you are looking for somewhere for a relaxing quiet holiday definitely stay clear of this hotel. This is in a very busy, and extremely noisy area. My room was on the 4th floor but I still did not get to sleep every night until at least 4am. There were crowds of people outside all night and music being played very loud. Ther is nothing welcoming about this hotel. This is at best equal to a 2 star hotel. Unlike other people who have commented on this website I found the staff quite helpful. You pay for 4 star quality - but you do not get it. I was very disappointed.

<Content>Basil would be proud. For a 4 Star this is a no go area. You have to have nerves of steel to get through the experience. Staff who go out of their way NOT to help. No hot water,noisy rooms poorly maintained  dire breakfasts to boot. Poor facilities in the rooms  not very much information about the hotel or the city. For the price we maybe expected a miracle to happen  just for once the web site would be truthful!!!!!!!! The only good point was its location. Ah well ,another lesson learnt.

<Content>Nice, Clean, Comfortable I don't know why anyone is so crabby about this hotel. My boyfriend and I stayed there and found everything to be just fine. The location is wonderful - just steps to La Rambla, the cathedral, and public transportation. The staff spoke English better than any other Spanish person we came in contact wtih. They were rude, my Hi, we'd like to check in. was met with a Who are you? instead of something friendly, but that's not enough to ruin our trip. It was a large room, everything was clean, it had a nice bathroom, and a great terrace overlooking the street. Breakfast wasn't included and we didn't even walk over by their bar so I can't comment on that. The only thing questionable was the safety of the luggage room, it's not locked and they don't keep an eye on who goes in and out, but we didn't have any problems. They did take a copy of our passports upon check in but I've never checked into a hotel in Europe that didn't. Bottom line: this is a clean place with a great location that I would recommend.

<Content>Verrrrry Baddd Gran Hotel Barcino...I've stayed here 3 nights (140 Euros / night) in June 2008 and it supposed to be a 4 stars hotel...Yeah right!!!The bathroom and the room is the size of a normal bathroom. The elevator is enought for 2 people max. The view is miserable (pipes) and it is not even cleaned. I strongly encourage everyone not book in this hotel... I would rate this hotel as 1.5 star hotel. The staff are ok (depending on the shift) but really do not care about you. The bar is closed. The bed is very small and is so poorly decorated. Of course, the walls are so thin that you can hear all noises your neighboors make. The bar is closed. There is no pool, gym, restaurant, iron, landry, etc.... The only good thing about this hotel is the location. It is well located (town) which is a good thing because you do not want to stay in the hotel too long!!!

<Content>YOU HAVE NEVER MET SUCH RUDE STAFF! I recently went on my hen weekend with 17 of my friends to the hotel barcino. On arrival the staff photocopied our passports and card details , later on in the holiday i was told they had lost them so we had to cancel our credit cards ! the staff were rude and unhelpful , when ever we asked for something whether it was some drinks in the mini bar or a cab etc we were told to go away as they were to busy. when we checked out of the hotel they tried to charge me for a room i had allready paid for , and when they realised after shouting at me that they were wrong they did not even apologise. I said to them thanks for spoiling my hen weekend he said 'your welcome!' if you can help it dont stay here , they are so unhelpful andrude you wouldnt believe! Barcelona is wonderful so dont ruin your stay by staying at the hotel barcino.also the breakfast was disgusting and when we came down to eat in the morning we had to go somehwhere else as there was no food and all the tables were dirty with everyone elses left over breakfast. this more like a 2 star than a 4 , and we are not the only people to say this

<Content>Do Not Stay At This Hotel!!!! It was my daughter's hen weekend with 18 girls aged from 15 to 51 - we were so looking forward the trip until we got to the hotel. In all my life I have never met such rude and obnoxious. They would not accept the hotel vouchers - they took photocopies of all the passports and credit cards - which they lost so identity fraud here we come.The rooms were quite nice but we were stuck in the well of the hotel and so so hot and stuffy - 3 people stuck in a room meant for 2 with a bathroom you couldn't swing a cat in.They blocked 1 of our rooms as they wouldn't accept that it was paid for even though we had proof with our hotel vouchers. The key cards hardly ever worked and the staff never wanted to re-scan them.Never put anything in the safe as one of the staff said that because they are key safe's they are easy to open as thieves have copied them.Do not ask the reception staff to order you a cab - they won't.Do not ask them to fill the mini-bar - they tell you to go to the supermarket.Breakfast for a 4* hotel was awful - few cereals, uncooked bacon and snotty eggs, few croisants if you were lucky.Do not expect 4* as this was definately a 2*.Oh, and the bar was NEVER open.The only good point was that it was central.Sorry, as that is the only good point about Grand Hotel Barcino - I could go on quite alot more but hey ho.DO NOT STAY THERE IT WILL SPOIL YOUR HOLIDAY.

<Content>Awesome location. We stayed at Gran Hotel Barcino in Dec 2007, during our 3-day stay in Barcelona. The hotel's location is ABSOLUTELY unbeatable. It's literally a stone's throw away from the historic Plaza St. Jaume, and just a short short walk from the cathedral, the main pedestrian walk Las Ramblas, as well as many other cute little neighborhoods, tapas restaurants, bars, bakeries, etc.The staff service attitude can be indifferent sometimes but since we were never in any hurry I think it's okay. The room was okay, but at least it was clean, thought it can be a little noisy (revelers on the street partied into the early morning hours during our stay) if you are a light sleeper w/o ear plugs since it's kinda near the center of action.Overall, I think it's a great hotel given its superb location.

<Content>Definitely not 4* and really pushing 3* When we arrived our friends card key did not work and had no electricity due to this so they changed the room. The rooms were so HOT that although we live in Spain we found it unbearable and had to open the window and sleep all night everynight (four nights) like this even though it is November and the temperature outside was cold.. The noise was LOUD outside. We asked for the heating to be lowered but although they attempted it, it did not happen. Then we found our door didnot lock. We just pushed it and it opened! we spent ages each time we left the room trying to get it to stay shut - my husband went to the reception and the gentle man said 'this is Spain - things get broken ' my husband said 'could he arrange to have it repaired 'the reception said ' what was the point it would only be broken again!.The conversation went on in vain for at least another five minutes and never was repaired..Also the toilet syphon plunger didn't work we had to keep repairing it after use. Also the shower curtain rail came off the wall. Also the key to the mini bar lock wouldn't lock.Also the sink plug did not work so we had a dirty sink at all times. Also when the people upstairs had a shower - so did our bathroom and next doors! According to the concierge 'this is normal as it is Spain' We pointed out that we live in Spain and had never experienced this before in ten years of residence and he just smiled and shrugged. The bar was never open and a snack bar was not in existence - we could find no instructions as to the whereabouts of the breakfast room and just followed our noses. A dreadful experience all round not to be recommended.The only help we received was when we were leaving and an elderly gentleman on the desk assisted us with directions.

<Content>Not a Four Star Hotel I have never stayed in a four star hotel with so few facilites. If you like to relax in your hotel at the end of the day find a different hotel. There is a bar, but it is never open. You can't even have a coffee in you your room because there are no coffee making facilities. Breakfast is not that appertising, but ok if you like a fried egg or cornflakes. The hotel itself is clean, but a little run down, you would exspect white towels in a 4 star hotel, not grey white.The staff were all freindly and helpful. As for Barcelona, it was great, lots to see and do.

<Content>Warning others: Terrible hotel This is one of the worst hotel I have everr stayed at. The bathroom was not completely clean, there was no body wash or enough shampoo. The staff CANNOT speak ENGLISH. The breakfast was cold, the tea and coffe cold, they've even put tap water in storebought bottles to fool the customers. AND plus, we payed for inclusive breakfast in our hotel rate when ordering online, but the receptionist made us pay additional 36 EUR because of someone misunderstanding with the agency,, they were rude and not friendly. Good location, but the experience was terrible, it felt like 2 star hotel..Find something better!!

<Content>Great location comfy rooms Stayed in Barca for 2 nights over a very hot and busy weekend...was fantastic having a hotel in such a good location... just off the Ramblas. Some great shops and eateries nearby and hotel is within 5 mins walking distance of the main square in Barca. Breakfast was included and was quite nice...tasty traditional european breakfast. Overall a very good stay worth the $$$.

<Content>great location, shame about the hotel might look good in reception, but the standard behind the scene was dirty and dismal, the door to our room diid not open or close properly, you could not read a guide book by the lighting. The breakfast was very poor, it would have been nice to have had hot coffee at least one day, the very small sad looking oranges looked second hand and that was the only fruit. they seemed not to understand that tables needed to be cleared for the next guests, the staff in general were poor espcaially the chap on reception one evening who told me he did not like tourists, and he could not understand why people came to the hotel as downtown barcelona is a nastY place. all this while I was waiting for a boy to open the room door as I could not open it. 4 stars on the wall outside the hotel, no way more like 2 stars

<Content>Good standard, great location We just arrived back from 3 nights at the Barcino yesterday. We were booked into the Rialto, a 3* sister hotel about 60metres down the road, but due to refurbishment of rooms were re-located to the Barcino. This is a good standard Barcelona hotel in a superb location. The street is lined with cheaper, more traditional, tapas restaurants/bars ( compared to Las Ramblas), intermingled with quaint souvenior shops. The hotel room was nice  tidy with plenty of space for 2 people. We found the hotel staff pleasant and helpful - as with most people, politeness works both ways!( It also helps if you try to speak a little of their language in every day conversation - hello, thank you, etc).Las Ramblas is less than 5 minutes walk away, the Cathedral 2 minutes away and the Port about 10 minutes.I would certainly recommend staying at this hotel - purely for the location and the price. Excellent base for a short trip to see this beautiful city!

<Content>Desperate need of a revamp My sister and i stayed at the the barcino oct 2006 for four nights. Location great but the hotel itself requires a total revamp. Probably fantastic in the eighties but leaves a lot to be desired now. We found mouldy bottles in the mini bar, the last guests fag stumps on the balcony, cigerette burns in the bed linen and no hotel bar which is a bit of a disapointment when you've been out all day and all you want is a good glass of cava and a chill out close to home coz believe me barcelona is a maze. Take my advice and stay at the Ravioli, in my opinion a much better base for a short break in barc. happy hol's. x

<Content>very disapointed We had requested a quiet non smoking room and were given a room right on the front very noisy and smoking,We could not change as the hotel was full. We went for a drink one evening and waited and waited for someone to serve us.Eventually we went to reception and asked if the bar was open.We were told they would have to phone there sisiter hotel for someone to come and serve us as they did not have a barman.The room was O.K. but had holes in the bed cover from previous smokers.Hotel is central but needs attention to bring it up to 4 star.

<Content>Perfect Location I read the reviews just prior to my trip and frankly was close to cancelling the trip. I didn't and was glad I didn't. This hotels situation is perfect for all the sites and very close to the Ramblas. The staff were friendly and the rooms immaculately clean. It was noisy at night but what do you expect, it's a city centre hotel and is right on the tourist route. The comment about the breakfast being on the cool side was true but again, a member of staff was there to assist if required. I'm also not sure that it is a four star standard especially seeing that coffee makeing facilities are not provided and there is a 2 euro fee per day to use the room safe but having said that the tarif was reasonable and I had a very enjoyable stay.

<Content>Nov 2004 and Nov 2005 visit I gave this hotel the benfit of the doubt after last year's visit,hoping that the staff had been on a customer care course in the meantime.......sadly, NO!!The young male receptionist was rude, not so much in what he said, but what he did not say.I honestly have no idea what the recruitment policy is for this hotel, lack of personality and indifference to clients must be high on the list.The only exeption to this would have to be the chambermaid.She was excellent.Initailly the afore-mentioned receptionist allocated us an awful twin-bedded room,with the stale smell of tobacco with view of a wall!!!When I complained stating I had made a specific request for a non-smoking double room with balcony he was not bothered.I rang up Hotelsrus who immediately rang the hotel up.The same receptionist, at first spoke excellent english with them, then once realising that it was a complaint, and not a booking they were ringing up for,went from excellent english to...no understand english, phone later!!!!Once they had spoken to me and realised he was winding her up, she rang the hotel back and basically worked wonders, managed to get me massive room,jacuzzi bath-tub,with terrace, no less on top floor of hotel!!!FANTASTIC.....although the same receptionist never looked my way after that!!!Breakfast was fine,no problems.Have to say this hotel excelllent for it's location alone.I would stay agAin for this reason.

<Content>Call to confirm room type before making reservation We went to the Hotel Barcino and booked on line more than three months in advance. The first room they showed us had a large patch of black mold on the wall around the window. The windows are very small and the rooms are dark. There are better rooms available, but they were already taken. After mentally adjusting to the actual room compared to the room shown on the internet, we did get a good nights rest. We had a problem with the door not locking and other guests had similar problems. The manager and desk attendant were not helpful. The street is quiet and peaceful at night. There were several nicer motels within walking distance of the main attractions. We would not stay here again.

<Content>Very disappointing Only positive quality is location. For the price, this place fails on every other level. Terrible service. Room was nothing special; we could have been in ho-hum room anywhere. The worst was that on the first night we asked the front desk for restaurant recommendations and the place they sent us to was terrible. We then got recommendations from a local friend and when we asked the hotel to book a reservation at one of the restaurants (which ended up to be fantastic), the hotel said, this restaurant is no good, and tried to get us to go with one of their recommendations.

<Content>Unpleasant stay I stayed at this hotel 21st MARCH 2005 for three nights I can not fault the rooms or the decor. but the food and the staff are a different story, the morning dinning room staff were unhelpful and down right ununfriendly . the food was of a poor standard , stone cold fried eggs ,sausages that were not properly cooked ,breakfast was just a disaster.The Bar never opened once during my three day stay , needless to say I wont be back or recomending this hotel to anybody.

<Content>Excellent hotel Stayed at the Hotel Gran Barcino in February 2005 for 4 nights.We were given a nice, spacious room on the first floor with lovely furnishing (but no tea /coffee), overlooking the road to the front.The hotel has a very good standard of cleanliness throughout. The staff are friendly, helpfull and speak English. We didn't try the breakfast as I thought it a bit expensive at 14euros.The location of the hotel is ideal being in the wonderful streets of the Gothic district and less than 10 minutes walk to the rambla and the port. I would definitely recommend Barcelona and this hotel.The only problem we had was workers turning up at 8am one morning and digging the road up outside, but that happens everywhere !!!!

<Content>Great Central Base Stayed in the Barcino for four nights in March 2005, staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were very clean and spacious enough for a short break. Great location for getting to all of the sites but quiet enough at night, watch out for pickpockets in the surrounding streets though!Take a travel kettle - it's the only criticism we had, as there are no facilities in the room for warm drinks.
