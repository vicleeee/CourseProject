<Content>great hotel and location stayed one night having booked over the phone with the hotel. The booking went smoothly. The hotel was as it says in the name, and done very well. It is in a traditional canal house. We had a canel view room and the bathroom was excellent. Breakfast was good and there was a computer with internet access. Staff were helpful and polite. Location is excellent 5 to 10 minute walk from the train station and at the top of the nine alleys area. Beware though there is no lift.

<Content>Recommended by my dentist..... .... but then he is from Amsterdam! He also recommended the area - Jordaan - in general: still part of Old Amsterdam and great for just schmoozing around. The hotel is wonderfully located: nearby is a street with bakeries, delis, coffee shops,and restaurants; you can walk from the station:it's 0-6km. If you do take a taxi, beware of the drivers who claim not to know where the hotel is: the street number is 13-19. Public transport is a five minute walk away. I had a spacious room (Room 401) with its own front door, so I could pretend to be a real Amsterdammer. It hasn't been given the chic and basic treatment yet, but was cheap and cheerful - light, spotless and with a huge window overlooking the canal.Comfortable beds. Breakfast was fine and excellent cappucinos, lattes etc. ( and I do mean coffees) are available 24/7 in the dining area. Staff are terrific: young, mostly Dutch, energetic, helpful, relaxed and genuinely welcoming. I wouldn't stay anywhere else!

<Content>great little hotel Definitely chic, and much better than basic. A great location: an easy walk from the station, on a quiet canalside residential/business street. All the staff were welcoming, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable. Thanks for the excellent advice directing us to shops selling antique light fittings - and for the sellotape. The room (large double) was fine, with full-sized bath in roomy bathroom; bed very comfortable; adequate storage space. The lighting in the bedroom was a bit quirky, being partly controlled by a remote control which cycled round different colour effects. Good quality basic breakfast (available till 10:30) for 鈧?.50 - bread  jam, cereals, juices, hard-boiled eggs, meats, cheese, yoghurt, fruit. Coffee and tea free; also computer. A very pleasant place to stay, and good value.

<Content>Exactly as the name says Stayed for one night.Great location; less than 10 mins from the station and max 15 mins to Dam Sq (and thats at a real leisurely pace).Located in a quiet street just far enough away from the tourist track to have shops and restaurants residents would use. But close enough that you can be in the middle of town in minutes.Hotel overall is very clean; it has a white, modern minimalist interior.Rooms aren't large but big enough for a double bed and 2 people not to fall over each other. Each has a slightly different theme (mine was Sports; with rackets, balls, etc painted in corners). Nothing dramatic but makes the hotel a memorable part of break unlike the bland chains.Incredibly friendly staff; couldn't do enough to help. Take their recommendations as to local restaurants. Suggested a fantastic Thai restaurant just around the corner for us.Breakfast is well worth the extra charge.Only thing to highlight is that the stairs are all quite steep. Nothing ridiculous but might be a concern for parents with small children, etc. As for me will definitely be staying at the Chic  Basic when I go back to Amsterdam in the New Year.

<Content>great hotel, perfect base to explore Amsterdam my wife and i spent 3 nights at the Chic and Basic and we enjoyed it very much. The hotel is in a good location (no dodgy stuff next door) and is a short walk to almost everything in Amsterdam that you would want to see (and some of the things you might not want to see too :-).The breakfast is excellent, and they will do you laundry for just 10 Euro! All you have to do it drop it off at reception and you get it back in the evening.It was also handy to have access to the internet via the free PC in the reception area.

<Content>Travel Light? and Chic? Chic and Basic, as its namesake, is chic and basic. Located close to the train station, this is a great place to stay if you enjoy boutique hotels. We had canal side rooms, which had large windows opening to fresh air and great views. Welcomed with a personal note and welcome pack, the chic white rooms were clean and a good size (although basic- ie., no closet, sitting area). Our room was on the third floor (after two treacherous stair ways-the stairs are unduly steep, short-runs with high-rises, and twist! upwards). It was very difficult to get our luggage up the stairs, and we would only recommend this hotel if you travel light, and are young and able (older folks would have trouble with the steep stairs). The bathrooms are large, but the showers are not separated from the rest of the bathroom (everything get wet when you shower - the toilet, sink, towels and floor, no matter how careful!). The breakfast is solid value, and the staff are really helpful - with luggage storage and arranging bike rentals from the hotel directly). This is a true boutique hotel - great if you enjoy a little different room layout, and enjoy the chic and basic. If you like the little extras in a luxury or business hotel, this may not appeal to you at all. We had a problem with moquitoes coming into through the windows, and the citronella plug-in didnt do much.

<Content>Great hotel I booked this hotel based on TripAdvisor ratings and reviews, and we had a great stay!The staff are very friendly and helpful - one lady went out of her way to help us find a sushi restaurant.The bathroom is huge, and the place is very clean. They have tea and coffee always available near reception, and free wireless throughout the hotel. It is well located - a short walk from the central station, and on a beautiful canal.Our only complaint was that the window could only be opened a little and it got quite stuffy in the room.

<Content>Value for money After reading reviews on here we decided to book in for 3nights.The hotel was excellent, about 5-10min walk from the main train station and a similar distance to Dam Square. In a quiet street overlooking a beautiful canal.Our room was in the attic which was a bit of a pain as there are no elevators and quite a few narrow tight stairs. Some would have trouble negotiating these stairs and would no doubt be upset about it, but you take the good with the bad when travelling in europe.The room was quite spacious with a large double bed, large shower and toilet... both of which were clean. We also had a mini lounge area that consisted of 2 hard plastic funky chairs and an lcd monitor with free cable... lots of channels included, including the adult channel which was good for a laugh.The staff were excellent! very helpful and spoke excellent english. Breakfast was your standard euro breaky with meats cheese breads and cereals.The free wifi was also a nice touch for those travelling with iPhones or laptops.All in all we enjoyed our stay at the chic n basic and would no doubt go back in the future

<Content>Clean, tidy, small, Amsterdam style Although the landmark red lip sofa 's missing from the front, we managed to find it after getting off the street cars.It was stacked in the back, as it turned out.As promised it was very recently renovated; it was refreshing to step inside the property.Staff were very friendly and showed us to our room in no time. Although there was a bit of struggle carrying the heavy bags up flights of stairs.We booked the large room with canal view. It was not the one on top floor, but still had a good view of the canal and streets.The room was clean and tidy. We didn't bother turning on the sensational colorful lights; just sat down and watched Tv. Though small, the room was well equiped.For our package, breakfast was included. There was bread, cereal, ham, cheese, boiled eggs, fruit. All were fresh and excellent. Online access was limited during our stay, because the main computers broke down, we had to use one at the cafe with a cable connecting to the front reception. There was only one computer available for all the customers of the hotel; I had to resort to uploading the photos to facebook at night as it took a few minutes. Other than that, I had no complaints. Hopefully it will be fixed by the time you read this.I would like to thank the staff for their kind help during my stay.

<Content>Terrific room, good breakfast, lovely neighborhood We stayed one night at the Chic and Basic. Easy walk from the train station with our rolling bags. Lovely residential neighborhood right on a canal. We had a great room - large and airy, big windows, very nice bathroom with a door, comfortable bed, flat screen TV. Yes, there were steep stairs, but the staff offered to help with the bags. Breakfast was included in the price and was very good - cheeses and meats, breads, yogurt. We did a lot of walking and found the location to be very convenient. I would stay there again.

<Content>A Nice Centrally-Located Hotel This hotel is easily accessible to the train station and in a great location to see Amsterdam! The room for a single is very small--but it is fine. The stairs were brutal but that was the case everywhere in Holland. The room did not have a window that could be opened -only one in the ceiling. (although they put in a portable air conditioning unit) I found that rather claustrophobic. Also the magnetic key did not work and the staff had to let me in whenever I wanted to go in and out. (although they did so happily at any hour) My room number was 122. (although it was up two very steep sets of stairs)The free wireless internet and the free 24 hour coffee/capuccino machine and bottled water was appreciated. The staff was more than helpful in every way. My rate was good---95 Euros.

<Content>Nice basic hotel with excellent location! We always stays in Amsterdam on our way back to US. This hotel is one of the best hotel we have found in this price-class. (We paid Eur 135 without breakfast.)The location is great and the walk from the train-station is a short 5-10 minutes walk.The surroundings is nice and it's easy to walk to bar's restaurants and coffee-shops.The receptionist was very friendly and the room was basic, but clean and quiet. (We stayed on the 2nd floor).The only draw-back is that the stairs is very narrow and steep, it's very difficult to bring a large suite-case up the stairs.(That's the case in a lot of hotels in Netherlands)We didn't have breakfast, it didn't look any special to us, but we enjoyed the free coffee 24/7.Now we now where to stay next time!

<Content>It does what it says on the tin It is exactly what it says it isChic - painted white and very minimalist. Modern reception loungeBasic - nothing more than you need. Some rooms apparently don't have bathrooms. Our room did have a bathroom but no door (not overly ideal!)The key thing about this hotel is it's location, it is so central. It is just a stones throw from the train station, you can easily wheel your suitcase there if you know where you are going. It is very close to a nice shopping and cafe area and some fantastic restaurants are nearby. We went to Christophe's (highly recommend it) it is the best meal we have had to date.Breakfast is basic, but more than adequate, fresh coffee seems to be available all day via the machine, as is water. Internet is also available in the same area.This hotel has very clever use of space. The rooms up the top are lovely, but beware, as with all buildings in Amsterdam, very steep stairs!!

<Content>Non Smoking, Not Completely True This was the most expensive hotel we stayed in our Netherlands and Belgium trip but then again most of the hotels in amsterdam were very expensive on those dates. We paid 140 euros per night without breakfast and I really wasnt that happy about the place. No refrigerator in the bedroom, bedroom was small, walls were too thin, you can hear everything, above, beside and around you and the worse thing is that I smelled smoking in the other room. When I asked the front desk he said that they have smoke alarms and it would sound if someone smoked in their rooms. We stayed in room 312 and our french neighbors were huffing and puffing through the wee hours of the morning. We hate smokers and that really pissed us big time. As a warning, if you have kids, dont leave them with the remote because there is a porn channel. That might be good for adults :) The room is modern with contemporary hip design. It reminds me of the paramount hotel in NY with its all white simplistic clean line look. Now for the good, Jessica who helped us on our arrival was fabulous, she provides great service and gave a wonderful restaurant recommendation, MUDERS which means mother. This place is not your fancy place but your local comfort food place, oh so yummy. You need reservations to get in and you need to be careful when you look for this place because there are no big signs. we walked past this place 5x, can you believe that? They have free internet connection in the lobby. If they truly get strict with the smoking and if the rates is less than 100 euros, I will recommend this place and even come back

<Content>Cosy, Chic  Chic  Basic is situated in an unassuming corner that faces the canal, quiet and serene, away from the hustle and bustle of the main roads BUT, all required to get to the main area like Dam Square with just a little 5-10 minutes walk out, and viola, we are at the heart of the city!True to its claimed, it's truly chic and basic. The staffs are VERY helpful people, not forgetting friendly. And yes, accommodative as much as they could. The ambience at the reception and cute lobby has a typical urban chic feel, with a stylish pantry at the end and internet usage. Our room was reasoably spacious tho' it's up on the 2nd top floor (if one doesnt mind climbing because the steps are rather steep). Very cosy because linens, towels and toilet is clean. Everything in the room is kept simple 'white' but cosy enough to be comfortable. It also has a nice small flat screen TV! What differentiate Chic  Basic from the rest is their VERY cute soaps and shower gels... READ what it says. Frankly, I was just so attempted to steal a few back for souvenirs! And it always makes me smile reading it.

<Content>Perfect It was great. Although a 2-star hotel, everythink was great. My partner and I had a mini-suite on the top floor and we were amazed how cosy it was. The bed was confortable and the most important thing is that every corner of the room was very clean. Perfect location (5 minutes walk from the station) and great staff. The price seemed a bit high for a 2-star hotel but we didn't regret it at all. Next time I will be in Amsterdam I will surely book this hotel.

<Content>A little disappointed Was a little dissapointed with the hotel, Staff were very pleasant and it was in a excellent location however the room was very small although the bedding was clean and the shower also there was a lot of marks on the walls that let this room down ( In nee of a paint i think) also you are lead to believe that the breakfast is free which isnt the case i think they need to change the wording on the rooms welcome note.Also room was nothing like picture of room shown on internet with nice pic behind bed . we had a pic of a glass and a newspaper on our wall ???? Also net curtains could do with a good clean and the view from our window was a dead plant in a plant pot

<Content>Another Satisfied Customer The excellent rating probably comes as a combination of many things in which chic and basic scores highly: value for money, location, friendliness of staff, breakfast. For me, what stood out was the excellent staff and the location near the Jordaan - this area is full of good bars and eateries, untainted by the commercial trashiness of the main drags of Amsterdam. In fact, Jordaan provides a whole new perspective on Amsterdam. Don't miss the gems that it has to offer. Chic and basic does exactly what it says on the tin and for that, it deserves its position as one of the most conveniently equipped and understated hotels in Amsterdam.

<Content>Fab Hotel, will be back again Just back from a weekend in Amsterdam staying at Chic  Basic with family group. I knew from talking with staff before we arrived that we'd be looked after and we were. It was a special surprise trip for our mother and they looked after her so well giving her the best room in the hotel overlooking the canal. Our rooms were less Chic and more Basic then hers, but perfect for our short stay. Location was perfect, just short walk from central station, cafes and main attractions.Staff booked fabulous restaurant for us and arranged taxi's etc, and couldn't have been more helpful.Breakfast was surprisingly nice and better than most continental B+B offerings.Can鈥檛 wait to go back for longer next time and will be staying in Chic  Basic again.

<Content>Chic but not too Basic What a fab little hotel! About 5 - 10 mins walk from Centraal station /RLD/ all the noise and action, yet it's sooo quiet and peaceful. Staff absolutely superb - meet and greet with a coffee (much appreciated as it was snowing when we arrived!); excellent english and a fund of useful info. The rooms are small but perfectly designed. Bathroom is a wetroom with separate wc. The rooms on their website are the ones you actually get (not some super upgraded version like on some websites) with the lightbox headboard and everything. Everything is ultra ,modern and well designed, and the proprietors are rightly proud of the place. One really nice touch is the availability of fresh coffee/tea/hot choc at any hour in the lobby lounge area - another thing that adds to the very civilized feel of the place. There's free net access in the lobby as well if you feel the need to browse with your coffee. Can't praise this lovely little hotel enough - more that excellent value for money - we'll be back!

<Content>Fantastic hotel, central location I have just returned from a week-end trip to Amsterdam with friends and we all loved this hotel. It couldn't have had a better location, 5-10 minutes on foot from the train station in a very pretty and quiet street. Perfect for shopping, sightseeing and going out in the evening. The rooms were small, but very modern and spotlessly clean and although the beds were narrow, they were very comfortable. The staff was great and really friendly and helpful. The 24-hour coffee and water machines were a nice extra! Note: it is not suitable for the elderly, as it takes some doing getting up and down the very steep and narrow stairs, especially with a suitcase.

<Content>Loved the Modern Feel We just returned from our week long trip in Europe. We booked a triple for 3 nights (Nov 20-22). The hotel is only a 10 minute walk from the Centraal Station. It took us longer because we missed a canal. But it is very, very walkable with wheeled luggage. I was impressed when we walked through the front door. The lobby and lounge is very cool. It has a modern minimal look, but is very comfortable. The staff was very nice. They had us sit down, got us coffee and or tea, while they did the check-in proceedure. They showed us the room. This might be the only small issue I had with the hotel. They did not have an elevator, but I think this is very common in Amsterdam. To get to the room we had to go up a very steep winding staircase. It was not really that bad. My 75 yr old father with knee problems was able to do it, but it was a little bit of a challenge, and if you travel with anyone that has limited ability here will be an issue. The room was very cool. Again minimal and modern but clean and looks like it could be in a design magazine. Breakfast was provided in the morning, and was pretty good, coffee/tee machine, cereal, meats, cheeses, hard boiled eggs, croissants. Overall more than you would expect from a continental breakfast. Hotel location is pretty good, it is no more than a 15 minute walk to just about any tourist attraction you would want to go to. Staff was very helpful with directions and recommendations on where to go. The hotel was perfect and we had a great time.

<Content>Loved the place A friend, my partner and I were in Amsterdam for five nights. We booked both a single and a double-bedded room. My bias is to stay in small properties (less than 30 rooms) and Chic and Basic was more than a pleasant surprise. This is my third trip to Amsterdam and I have stayed in the Grand Tulip (200+) and in a canal house on previous trips. One of the gems of the hotel is its staff - more about that later. With the exception of housekeeping, everyone was fluent in English - my native language and some were fluent in spanish - the native language of my partner and my friend. Housekeeping had a perfectly good understanding of english - significantly better than my non-existent dutch!First the location. CB is conveniently positioned facing the second canal - Herengracht - within a short walk to Cental Station and the major tram/bus routes in the city. The character of the neighborhood in which CB is located is very quiet residential yet within two blocks are an excellent restaurant (just across the pedestrian bridge on Broeweurgraht (sp)) and a neighborhood coffee shop. Two more blocks and there is a secondary shopping area with an abundance of restaurants/retail locations (but not the cookie cutter stores seen in most major cities that cater primarily to tourists). And the location of the hotel is within a ten to twenty minute walk to any of the active night life, restuarants, museums and typical shopping fare.As indicated in other posts, the rooms are smallish. If you plan on staying in your room most of your stay in Amsterdam, then this is not the property for you. Neither of the two rooms we booked had an area separate from the bed for writing or reading - less of a problem when traveling alone but problematic if traveling with another person and on different sleep schedules. The ability to read in bed is futher limited by an absence of reading lights - the room is either fully lit or dark with no in between possibilities. A common area is available for guests to take advantage of flat writing spaces as well as providing complimentary wifi if you have your own computer. Adjacent to the common area is a computer with high-speed and complimentary internet connectivity. The rooms and bathrooms were spotlessly clean - kudos to the housekeeping team. And each of our rooms had excellent hot water heat, plenty of water pressure and large windows that opened easily. The windows included both sheer curtains for filtered light and a curtain to darken the room considerably when sleeping during the occassional afternoon nap. The only weathered look in the hotel was the carpet leading to the rooms. It appears the carpet has remnants of last winter's snow and boot traffic. The carpet appears to be in good shape but not as clean as it could be and certainly not as spotless as are the rooms. And while speaking of stairs - they are typically Amsterdam - a cross between stairs and a vertical ladder. The self-serve breakfast offers an ample selection of fresh fruits, cheese, juices, hard boiled eggs, cold cuts, etc. The bread an role variety was exceptional and an apple tart can only be described as european - excellent flavor, texture and not ruined with sugary sweetness.But for the three of us, the most important element of our stay was the staff in the hotel. They were extraordinarily helpful and friendly - it was as if we were staying with friends and not interacting with the typical stadoffish clerks in larger hotels. Indeed, one evening we were invited to go local with a member of the staff. We in turn have invited their staff to visit with us whenever they come to Costa Rica.If going to Amsterdam again, this would be my first choice.

<Content>An Amsterdam gem! We were in Amsterdam a year ago and stayed at 2 adequate, but uninteresting, hotels. This time we found Chic and Basic on Trip Advisor and couldn't have been more pleased. (In fact we returned there for a night on our way back to the States.) We had a similar situation to that of a previous reviewer in that when first arrived we were looking for the Hotel New Amsterdam. After walking past Chic and Basic several times, I remembered a reference to a new name on their webpage and we were set.It is close to Central Station (5-10 min. walk) and in a very quiet neighborhood. The staff couldn't have been more accommodating. The entire hotel is newly remodeled (candid photos are more accurate than the hotel photos on Trip Advisor). The rooms we stayed in were very clean, European smallish as were the bathrooms but very efficient. The breakfast was one of the most extensive I've had in a small European hotel and they have a super coffee machine which also makes espresso type coffees quite well.The biggest negative I saw was that many of the rooms are accessed by very steep staircases and there is no elevator. There are rooms on the ground floor so if a guest has mobility issues (or lots of large luggage) they might want to request one of these.Other great amenities - free internet and wifi and a great welcome bag with high quality toiletries, etc. The staff was also very willing to hold our bags both when we arrived early in the morning and also when we were not leaving Amsterdam until late afternoon.We will plan to return to Chic and Basic on our next trip to Amsterdam!

<Content>Great Hotel Have just returned from a 3 day city break in Amsterdam. When choosing hotels we normally go for 4 star but was very impressed with the reviews for 'chic and basic' so decided to give it a go. Was DEFINITELY not disappointed. It was very modern and exceptionally clean and friendly. Room 311 is on the first floor and has a canal view. Ideal for anyone not wishing to use too many stairs. Room and bathroom not huge but lovely white bed linen and didn't spend very much time in room as we wanted to see as much of Amsterdam as possible. Excellent location, just 10 minutes walk from Central Station (walking instructions given by hotel by email - brilliant). Lovely quiet location but within easy walking distance of attractions. Hotel staff very friendly - always on hand to give help when needed. Breakfast more than adequate and access to tea, coffee and fresh water facilities for 24 hours. Free internet access. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel. The stairs could be a problem for older people as there are no lifts. Would definitely have no hesitation in recommending.

<Content>Splendid Chic and Basic was very charming, in an excellent location and on a quiet beautiful road, with a BB feel but with the amenities of a boutique hotel (relaxing lounge music, Wi Fi, great cappucino machine, etc.), and above all, fantastic service by their reception / managers. Knowledgeable and attentive professionals like Ferdy make Chic and Basic a great option for different categories travelers to Amsterdam.

<Content>Would stay again Just got back from Amsterdam after a 4 night stay, staying with friends for 3 nights at The Flying Pig Hostel Downtown and then staying for one night with my boyfriend at Chic and Basic for a little bit of a treat before heading home. Chic and Basic is probably a good way of summing up the experience. The only information we were given on check in was the time of breakfast and that we could use the internet for free. I'd read about the free coffee machine but was not introduced, I'm also not sure what happens if you want an alcoholic drink (though I saw some spirits at breakfast behind the counter!). There was also a sauna but again no idea if you were allowed to use it or how you would go about it! Saying that the hotel is modern and clean, room fine (proper double bed, not 2 singles as is often the way). We were in room 111 on the first floor, canal view, stairs ok, I've seen much steeper!. Small room, small bathroom but good shower. Tea and coffee facilities and TV. Main positive was the breakfast which is the best I have had in Amsterdam. Having stayed at about 5 hotels in Amsterdam I would say this has many positives going for it for a small hotel in a traditional Amsterdam building. Good location near central station but near enough away from the Red Light district for my liking. Good bars and restaurants nearby. On a quiet canal which is lovely for walking along, very romantic! A good value hotel, I'd be interested in staying in a larger room though if I returned, especially if for more than a night or two.

<Content>Chic....and basic it is. Basic it is. No elevator, no reading lights, no closets, no shower curtin, limited tv channels, steep stairs (not recommended for people with disabilities. And, not sure you could put two people in a room comfortably. That said. Great location  staff. Good competitive rate. Decent breakfast. Internet terminal for guests and all the coffee you want. Recommend highly if you are an independent traveler looking for a great Amsterdam experience!

<Content>Hotel was one of the highlights of our Amsterdam visit This hotel was a treat! It was very close the Central Station (8-10 minute walk). Decor is modern and chic. But, still allows a comfortable stay. Staff was friendly. Our room was super! All white sheets. All white shelves. And green/earthy wood flooring. The bead head board was a sexy black and white picture of a couple kissing. The head board also doubled as the room light. At night, you could flip the switch to a green flashing night light. This room was a canal view so it was fun watching tour boats go by, especially at night. Breakfast was great. Amenties were great, as well!

<Content>Stylish, convenience, helpful staff - what a great place! If you're after a unique hotel which differs from the mainstream then book this place! Our room was everything we hoped for - it was on the top floor overlooking a canal and encompassed really smart design. The welcome bag was a great touch - great tolitetries! The breakfast was brilliant and included in the price - lots of choice. The free internet access was a welcome bonus as well. The location is really handy - it's in Jordaan, a really cool part of Amsterdam which was close to the centre but not in the middle of it, and was about a 5-10 minute walk from the train station. One word of caution - the stairs to our room were really narrow (not unusual for Amsterdam) and it was hard to carry heavy suitcases up the stairs. The staff were more than happy to help out but ask for a room on a lower floor if you're mobility-impaired.

<Content>Treated great at Chic and Basic. We booked this hotel when it was called Hotel New Amsterdam. When we arrived it was called Chic and Basic. My husband and I and our two daughters had to have two rooms to accommodate us. The rooms were pretty small, as were the bathrooms. Both rooms were up quite a few stairs. The views out the rooms were of the canal, so that was very nice. The location was great, especially with it's easy walk to the train station. The staff in the hotel was absolutely wonderful to us, especially when they carried out suitcases all the way up the stairs. Great espresso machine. Overall, just really nice experience, mostly because of the great staff. We did not like Amsterdam very much, but we liked Chic and Basic.

<Content>Perfect Stay in Amsterdam We were so happy we chose Hotel New Amsterdam (now Chic + Basic) for our 3 night stay in Amsterdam. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Central Station and is located canal side on one of the most beautiful canals. We decided to pay a little extra for the canal view room and it was worth it!!! We left our windows open the whole time and enjoyed the sounds of Amsterdam. Our double room was great, a little small, but enough room for everything. The bathroom was clean and nice too! The stairs are a climb, but part of the fun. Every morning we ate breakfast at the hotel (included) it was really nice. Bread, rolls, cereal, fruit, cheese, meat, yogurt, juice, coffee and water. We loved the 24-7 coffee machine to make espresso or cappucinos, the water jug and computer to use. The staff was very helpful with all of our questions. We would stay here again!

<Content>loved this newly named hotel We booked two nights in the Hotel New Amsterdam and arrived to find it has a new name - Chic and Basic - part of a small European hotel chain.The lounge/breakfast room was very chic and modern with real espresso and lattes available to guests any time of day. The staff was immensely helpful and friendly and the breakfasts fresh and tasty.We had a lovely large room overlooking the canal with a good sized ensuite bathroom and comfy beds. The only disadvantage of this lovely hotel is that there is no elevator and 36 steep steps to our room. However, the desk clerks carried our luggage up and down and housed it in a secure room on our last day as we went sightseeing before our flight left for Canada. One of the desk clerks invited us for a private tour of the canals on his motor boat. We settled on 60 Euros for an hours trip but we had such a wonderful time travelling around the city and getting to know our guide while enjoying the wine and picnic dinner he brought along that the journey ended up being three hours. We suggested to him that he could offer tours to other tourists - we were his first clients. Don't let the many stairs deter you from staying at Chic and Basic. It's a super hotel on a very quiet canal just a 5 minute walk from the Central Train Station.

<Content>My favourite in Amsterdam! Stayed here for a holiday break with my boyfriend last Christmas and i must say it was perfect!The hotel is wonderful, really nicely decorated and clean.We arrived on an early flight and were able to leave our bags safely at the hotel while we took a walk until our room was ready. The staff were very helpful, carrying our bags to the room etc. There are some steep stairs so be warned. But think thats a given in most places in Amsterdam.The self service buffet style breakfast was a lovely start to my mornings, a few hot drinks was certainly needed in those winter temperatures!The hotel is in a really great location, walking distance from Central station, and some great restaurants and bars, not to mention Anne Frank house etc. I did take some photos of the room etc, but my camera is out of action atm so i'll post them when i can. The photos already on here are do the hotel justice anyway.I would most definately stay here again, i would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>One of my favorite hotels, hope that doesn't change... This has been one of those finds. I have stayed here about four times in the last two years and I have always enjoyed my stay. While the rooms are on the small side (even by European standards), they are comfortable. The location cannot be beat -- sitting at the intersection of the Herengracht and Brouwersgracht it is one of the prettiest parts of the canal rings. And it is literally less than 10 minutes walk to the Central Station.But on my last visit I see that the hotel management has changed hands and it is now part of a Spanish chain called Chic + Basic. The hotel was in a flux period as they are renovating some of the rooms, but the staff remains the same and they are very good and friendly! Let me tell you my what I see as the potential upside/downside of this management change. First the style is changing from quaint contemporary Dutch to modern and austere. Immediate upsides -- they seem to be renovating many of the rooms and while they were OK they are starting to show their age; free computer access in the lobby with wifi in the rooms. My concern is that you will see the prices start to rise, but some small increase might be expected.Finally, the continued saving grace is the location and the staff. The staff remain the hotel's single most valuable asset. I hope that doesn't change.

<Content>Great stay at Hotel New Amsterdam My best friend and I selected this hotel based on other Tripadvisor reviews and were definitely not disappointed! It is in a very central area of town within walking distance of everything (some are longer walks than others!) - Niewmarkt, Red Light District, shopping areas, Van Gough Museum, Ryksmuseum, a couple of blocks away from the Anne Frank House, and close to many coffee shops and restaurants. Better yet, we took the train in from Schipol to Centraal Station (about 4 Euros), and the hotel was about a 10 minute walk from Centraal (handy b/c we had to lug a ton of luggage).The staff was super friendly and very helpful. As other people mentioned, they will hold your luggage for you in a locked room if you arrive early. We stayed in room 121 (a canalside double, on the 3rd floor, I think), which we had to walk up some narrow  steep flights of stairs. This was not a problem, as the staff carried our luggage up the stairs for us. The room was very nice and clean and was an excellent value for Amsterdam. As in most of Europe, there is no central air conditioning, but the temperature was very mild during our stay and did not cause any problems. There is a hairdryer in the bathroom, but be sure to bring your own soap  shampoo (they provide shower gel).There is free coffee 24 hrs a day (from a fancy coffee machine), free high-speed internet access in the lobby, and complimentary breakfast, which consisted of pastries, toast, fruit, hard-boiled eggs, cereal, several types of juice, milk, and coffee. Very tasty!We had a very nice experience here, and would recommend to anyone!

<Content>Great location and staff Stayed post cruise and enjoyed our stay. We arrived at approximately 10 AM and staff stored our luggage until our room was ready. Short 10 minute walk from Centrael station and located on a canal. Centrally located for a lot of sites. We were given an option for a smaller room with quite a large discount and took it. Small room on third floor, but good beds and we used room for just sleeping anyway. Staff carried luggage up for us. Had good nite sleep. Good Breakfast. While walking to Centrael station after check-out, a staff member getting off work offered to help with our luggage to the station since he was going that way. Nice gesture. Would definitely stay there again. Only problem I can forsee is someone with disabilities with the small stairs.

<Content>Nice Hotel, but small things to work on..... Nice tidy hotel, great location, breakfast, coffee machine and friendly staff. The only con鈥檚 were room was small and walls are thin.The room (photos in the below reports with the monkey鈥檚 on the wall) we had included a large sky light window which allowed all the other guests in the higher floors a direct view of or room and partially of the bed. Even though there was a curtain that we could use to shield the bed you would have thought that management would at least frost the window and still have the benefits of the additional light from the skylight. I guess that is Amsterdam for you 鈥?there is a view in every window 飦?飦?br/>

<Content>Fantastic time! We stayed at this hotel in early May and had an incredible time. The staff are extremely nice, and are always trying to please! The breakfasts were way above average (best we had in our whole Europe trip) and the rooms are lovely. We had a room with balcony on the 3rd or 4th floor which was superb. Great place to eat strawberries and cream! And the free drinks all day long.... yumm....

<Content>We loved it! My husband and I loved this boutiqueish hotel. We travelled for 5 weeks after leaving this hotel and this hotel remained in our thoughts throughout the whole trip. I loved the all you could drink espresso drinks in the lobby and the fresh circulated water. The hotel staff are SUPER friendly. We stayed in the parrot room - which happens to be the biggest room. This room had a lovely patio for us take in the fresh air. The bathroom is very small, but we dont spend a lot of time in there anyway! The bed was comfortable! Thank you New Amsterdam for a great stay!

<Content>Clean and good location but aimed at gay community. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable but small. We believe they cater for a gay market, whilst this does not bother us at all, we did find the explicit gay pornography left in the common areas offensive and gave the hotel a seedy element. We would feel the same way about heterosexual material being availabe in the same way. Would not stay there again based on this.

<Content>A Gem of a Hotel in a Fabulous Location Just returned to Paris after a 3 night sidetrip to Amsterdam. The best part of the trip was the Hotel New Amsterdam and its staff.We arrived wet and cold and were immediately sat down and offered our choice of hot drink from the 'magic machine'. We could not have asked for a more congenial welcome.Our room (#311) was one floor up and looked directly over the canal (Herengracht). It was the most beautiful and quiet street in Amsterdam and less than a ten minute stroll from everything. Yes, the rooms are tiny, but we were there so little and they have everything they need - the beds were comfy. The cleanliness, warmth and congeniality, location, free breakfast and 24 hour 'magic drinks machine' ensure that when we return to Amsterdam that we will make a beeline for the New Amsterdam.

<Content>Very Good Hotel Arrived at the hotel very wet as it was peeing down and did for most of our vacation but that didnt put us off!! We arrived very early at the hotel as our flight landed at 8.30am and they couldnt do enough to accommodate us with warm drinks and a comfy seat! Our rooms were almost ready so we hung around and were unpacked and back out to hit Amsterdam by 11am! The rooms are small but adequate and our friends managed to get the attic suite with a bedroom and seating area. The stairs are very steep and narrow and by the end of 4 days our legs were aching but you have to do it!!! There are no lifts in these old buildings. We didnt find noise an issue from our 3rd floor room - the only noise we could hear was the rain!The breakfasts were good. Freshly squeezed orange juice, cereals, eggs, cheese, ham, fruit and various freshly baked breads and rolls. The coffee is also really good and service very attentive. In fact all the staff are excellent and so friendly. Nothing was a problem and they went out of their way to speak to you on your way in and out of the hotel.The location of the hotel is also very good. About 5 minutes to Dam Square and the train station and 20 mins to the Southern Belt. We found the whole experience really good and would return to the hotel and recommend to others. Another good point, they have loads of umberellas which were needed during our stay!

<Content>New Amsterdam Hotel We have just come back from the New Amsterdam Hotel. It was our second stay there in 18 months.Superb very helpful staff. Nice modern, recently refurbished hotel. Excellent breakfast, excellent coffee, and the room was perfect.We have stayed in many hotels over the years and this ranked among the highest quality we have experienced. The room faced the canal and was a good size with a good sized bathroom.It was all nicely modern with an oldie worldie feel.We have stayed in room 321 both times and I understand that there are some sub-standard rooms in the hotel so if its free 321 should be your first choice.The Location is perfect too, nice quiet canal walks and, within 2 minutes there is a fine coffee shop and a further 2 minutes, all the shops. Harlemer street is very close by too with lots of nick-knack shops and supermarkets and excellent restaurants.Hotels in the dam can be a bit hit and miss but room 321 in the Hotel New Amsterdam is a hit every time.

<Content>Absolutely the best hotel in Amsterdam! I don't see how anyone could have any complaints about this fabulous hotel! Sure, the rooms are small, but this is Europe, and we did pay only 100 euro/night! Good things:-SUPER nice staff. Always helped with every need, even carried my very heavy suitcase up the narrow stairs for me =)-GREAT breakfast. Fresh squeezed juice, eggs, meats, cheeses, ect.-Free coffee anytime, from an awesome machine that could make anything from a macchiato to espresso.-Extremely clean rooms and bathroom.-Terrace to go out and sit at night with a glass of wine or a coffee.-Perfect location. Quiet residental street, but only a 1-5 minute walk to the more bustling areas.I could go on and on about this hotel. I have traveled through Europe since I was quite small, and this is the 1st hotel that I know for a fact that I will return to. I will never stay anywhere else in Amsterdam.Some tips:-Eat at the resteraunt right accross the little pedestrian bridge by the hotel. It is fantastic, quiet, and reasonably priced with great food. -Visit Albert Hejin supermarket, they have great little snacks.-Anne Frank house and Van Gogh museum are must-sees. This hotel is only 2 streets over from the Anne Franks house (and visit on a weekday - we had no wait!).We had a great time and can't wait to go back. We loved this hotel so much that we are sending them a Christmas card. Please stay here, you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Great canal view Booked for a canal view back in July but given some reviews were a little apprehensive that we would get one. Did we? Oh yes. We had the top floor in the attic area like a suite. Odd layout with separate toilet in one room and shower in another room. But 2 TV's (where else do you get 2- one for each room?) although not many channelsDoors opened to reveal a view of the canal. Superb view and location and tea/coffee maker. Chuck in the tea and coffee on tap downstairs and its was a great hotel. Breakfast was OK although very basic.OK, some of the fixtures and fittings are a little dated but the quirkiness is its charm and to be honest I have been on six trips this year and I felt at home here. Try and get the canal view and if you can get the top floor suite (cost me 拢250Euros for 2 nights) then it is well worth it.Location is superb, less than the 10 mins walk from station as it says on website. More like 5/6 mins. Easy walk to the red light district and main sights.

<Content>A disappointment! I have a few remarks about this hotel. We stayed at the hotel for three nights, and had the tiniest little shoebox room, located in the basement. It was just below a street, not a very noisy one, but when a car went by or a person walked past, you could definitely hear it and we were woken up by this several times.During the nights the radiator went off, the room then was freezing! Also there was a constant cold draft from the tiny windows which the curtains didn麓t do much to keep away. We tried to change rooms, but this wasn麓t possible, we were told that the hotel was fully booked. The persons working at the hotel wasn麓t very helpful, when I was telling on of them that the room was chilly, he retorted it couldn麓t be that cold, it isn麓t even winter yet, like he was the one deciding on what was cold or not. The night after we were given extra blankets by another person working there, though I would have appreciated getting it the first night. The hotels slogan the quiet hotel isn麓t really suitable, and if your into it麓s location, there are loads of other hoteloptions nearby..

<Content>Decent but not fantastic Hotel New Amsterdam is a decent place to stay. It has a really nice location, right on a canal and is near to most activities. Good restaurants and coffee shops near by. The rooms are small but clean. I actually enjoyed the narrow staircases and the opportunity to see and live inside one of the beautiful historic buildings in Amsterdam. I will say that the bathroom is interesting with one room for the shower and sink and a separate, very small room for the toilet. We booked through the tourist office. (3 euro pp to book) and the rate was 100 euro a night. It did include breakfast but it was nothing impressive. All in all I enjoyed the hotel, the staff was friendly and the location was good. I would recommend them for a stay but would be a better deal at 70 to 80 euro a night.

<Content>highly recommended I stayed here for 4 nights in August and have lovely memories. The room was comfortable, modern, clean and quiet. The staff was very friendly, helpful and made me totally feel at home as a solo female traveller. It was a delight to see a smiling face at breakfast and when coming to and from the hotel!

<Content>Fabulous Hotel! My friend and I chose the Hotel New Amsterdam after extensive online research, and after cancelling a reservation at another hotel after reading too many negative reviews.We loved the Hotel New Amsterdam! The location was excellent - centrally located between the Center and the Jordaan neighborhoods and we walked all over the city from there. Despite the location, the neighborhood itself was very quiet, which was something we'd really wanted.The staff was excellent. Everyone was extremely helpful and very friendly, and they really helped to make our stay absolutely perfect. When we arrived at the hotel after a sleepless night of traveling, they carried our suitcases up to our room for us after bringing us each the coffee of our choice. I'd also emailed them several days before to let them know we'd be arriving early and to ask if it would be possible to check in straight away, and they made sure that we were able to do so.The hotel was clean and quiet, and the room was perfect (though admittedly, the shower pressure wasn't great).The guys always had excellent touring and restaurant suggestions as well, and really seemed to enjoy interacting with the guests. I can't emphasize how wonderful this hotel was.

<Content>appreciated the extra help in our time of need i have been to amsterdam twice previously and know my way around the city center.i was taken to the hotel by my partner for my birthday. we arrived at a lovely old canal house in an area of old houses, some made into hotels, some as professional business locations. it is a 5 minute walk from the central station. i would recommend a location a little closer to the museum areas so that you don't have to use the trams as much.this hotel has a nice continental breakfast with a machine that dispenses fresh orange juice. another machine makes espresso/cappucino by pressing buttons. most excellent as it is available 24 hours.the first room we had was up 2 flights with narrow steep stairs. not for the vertically challenged. the room was small but very comfortable. two twin beds put together created a lot of bed space that was appreciated. excellent shower.on our second day in amsterdam i was accidentally tripped and tore a calf muscle. the hospital put it is a cast and i was to be immobile for the next week. we only had two days remaining in amsterdam. the staff moved us to the ground floor and took every effort to make the remaining portion of our stay as comfortable as possible, including helping me go up and down the few steps toour room. all members of the staff receive the highest marks. they went so far as to allow us to stay in the second room for a longer period of time (as our trip was to extend following the time in holland) if we could not arrrange an earlier flight. when we arranged the earlier flight they released us from any further room obligation.

<Content>perfect location - noisy room We have just returned from a short week at the New Amsterdam. The location of the hotel is great (Herengracht, nearby Prinsengracht and the attractions at city center - Oude Kerk, flower market). We had the room on the ground floor with canal view. It has a fantastic view, but we couldn't enjoy it much because the room is very noisy! We spent most of our time away from the hotel. Overall we would say it is an average hotel. Service/ breakfast ok.

<Content>Superb hotel-great service Returned yesterday from a 2 night stay at the Hotel New Amsterdam with my wife and 11 year old son and have to say what a joy it was,from the initial welcoming cup of tea to the final goodbye it was a superb experience.The hotel is very centrally located just a 10 minute walk from the Central Station and next to a charming canal and although the rooms are on the small side(we had the mini-suite in the loft which had a tricky low ceiling! and generally traditional Amsterdam hotels are on the small side) they are beautifully decorated and very cosy with high quality furnishings.Just look out for the steep stairs if you have large suitcases it can be hard work!The breakfast was typically continental with cold meats,cereals and a lovely selection of bread ,fresh juice and good coffee etc.served in a smart little dining room with a tv showing BBC news.What set this place apart for me was the service from all the staff who went out of their way to help and make us feel special-we have used many hotels in the US and Europe and can honestly say this hotel is right at the top when it comes to service,nothing was too much trouble.Would not hesitate in returning to this hotel.

<Content>great place We loved this hotel. It's kind of funky because it's a couple of canal houses put together but the staff couldn't have been nicer. We went with my two kids and their friends so we had 3 rooms. My husband and I had the canal view which I loved and the kids had interior views that were basic walls. These all would have been great in normal circumstances but we were there in a heat wave so got a little toasty in the rooms but not their fault. A couple of fans might have helped but no one was prepared for the 96 degree weather. The location was fantastic, you could walk to the train station and all the main spots and you could catch the canal boats at the train station and get a day pass which gets you all over by boat. We had a car so they have a lot you can park at for a fee of I think about 20.00 per day. I would gladly recommend this hotel and would go back again.

<Content>Very cute little hotel Stayed here 5 nights with my boyfriend and we really enjoyed our stay. I had booked a double room couple months before from the hotel's website, based on the reviews here. Staff was very friendly and helpful. They showed us our room and helped carrying the luggage. Room was small and there was no air conditioning, but gladly we didn't need one. Room and bathroom were clean and they changed the towels daily and took out the carbage.Breakfast was included and there was plenty to choose from.The hotel is in a very narrow house without a lift, so that can be a bit difficult to some. We didn't mind, but our room was in the first floor. I really liked the hotel's environment - it was close to the shops, but there was still peaceful and relaxing. The view from the hotel's frontdoor is beautiful and it really is located in the nice neighborhood.We would definitely go there again.

<Content>Average Hotel but not bad for Amsterdam I stayed here for one night in April. I booked online and was offered a rate of around 88 euro.To be perfectly honest, I found the room ( at the top of the hotel and many many stairs including a flight of stairs once you have opened your own room door! ) to be quite average. It was perfectly clean and quiet which was fine. However, I did not get the wow factor at all that other reviewers seem to suggest.Maybe this was due to my picking the weakest link so to speak or others have just had many bad experiences in Amsterdam in the past. Overall, a clean, comfortable hotel in a central location. I would return maybe but would definately ask for a different room and maybe then I could also give a glowing report.

<Content>5 Star in my book ! We just returned from a wonderful 4 day stay at the Hotel New Amsterdam.We arrived in the pouring rain and were greeted with smiles and warm coffee ! We were put in a lovely room on the top floor with an outstanding view of the canal ! Our entire time there was great - kudos to the staff, especially Maarten ! He carried our big luggage up 4 flights of very narrow/straight up stairs ! Great breakfast each morning with fresh Orange Juice and Eggs,Meats,Cheeses,etc. And a great Coffee/Cap machine available 24/7.Hotel is 10 minute walk from Central Station, close walking to The Dam and other sites, great restaurants and shopping nearby. You most also do a Bike Tour of the City and Countryside (Mikes) and go see the Tulips (just coming out now, late winter)!Very nice, warm hotel - I can Highly Recommend !

<Content>Loved the New Amsterdam Hotel The Hotel New Amsterdam was wonderful in every way!! The location was central, walkable to the train station and most everything we wanted to do and there was always the tram if we were too tired. The service was outstanding! Helpful, fun and very accomodating. Our room was spotless, though a bit small, but no matter. And the breakfast was such a treat -- fresh orange juice, coffee, cheese etc. My Mom and I just loved being there, and hope to again some day!!!

<Content>Great Hotel Me and my boyfreind just come back from a 3day break for my b-day, my boyfriend had emailed them before we went and asked if they could leave flowers or chocolates in our hotel room as a surprize! and they sure did, which was lovely. When we arrived we were welcomed with tea/coffee, which i hadnt experienced before,after a long day travelling from pembrokeshire you were dying for a nice cup of tea!We read that the rooms were small but the one we had was quite Spacious,including the bathroom which i was suprized of after reading other reviews.(ROOM 401)our room was nextdoor to the main entrance to the hotel and had a canal view. Rooms were warm and most of the windows opened.We had a bath/shower with a a range of accessories (shower gel, shower cap etc...). Rooms were equipt with iron and hair dryer, no telephone tho. Rooms were cleaned everyday.For breakfast, there were a choice of cereals, meats, bread and boiled egg. with many diff teas, coffee fresh orange juice and water. Coffee, tea and water was available 24 hours. There was also a snack vending machine in the breakfast area. We also had coffee/tea making facilites in our room.The hotel is situated in a residential area which is 5-10 minute walk to the main streets and central station and within walking distance to the red light district.Staff were very freindly and went out of there way to make you feel welcomed.We highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in amsterdam.

<Content>great spot stayed three nights at Hotel New Amsterdam in Jan 06; excellent location, handy to all sights and amenities without being in the midst of it all. Accommodation was very clean and modern, yet with great character (especially if you are on the third floor up three very steep flights of stairs!). Coffee on tap was very welcome after busy days out and about. Best point was undoubtedly the friendly informative staff who did all they could to make our short visit the best. Great accommodation at a great price. Would highly recommend this hotel for your consideration next time you are staying in Amsterdam.

<Content>sweet memory My wife and I were for 2 nights in this well situated hotel close to all that happens in Amsterdam. On foot we could reach most of the buildings we wanted to see. The room was very snugly and had all we needed. The breakfast surpriced us with fresh fruit, drinks and all kinds of food in a clean and nice setting.The people were very helpful. We were very satisfied.

<Content>Great location, great staff My three day stay at the Hotel New Amsterdam was without fault. I will most certainly return again. The room itself was on the small side, but that is expected in central Amsterdam. The staff were very helpful and thoughtful and the welcome was first class. The breakfast was of a good standard and furnishings and decor excellent. I would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>Does not live up to expectations. This hotel comes highly recommended by Tripadvisor users as a charming hotel of good standard. I can only assume that these comments come from over-enthusiastic American guests who are so overwhelmed by being in a hotel by a pretty canal in Amsterdam that they do not see the flaws... To be fair the rooms are clean and the beds comfortable, but we were given one with one small window just under the ceiling (more like a cat flap than aything else) and a bathroom where we could not stand up straight in the shower due to a very low ceiling..The breakfast is pretty sub-standard and the staff both rude (no, we do not appreciate having someone swearing in Dutch expressing her hatred of her job or how bored she is when we are breakfasting; I guess it has not crossed people's mind that some guests are Dutch speaking and hence understand the comments made...)and inefficent (not bothering to clear the table for new guests and walking straight past an American couple who did not understand how the juice machine worked etc). You can see directly in to the dirty kitchen from the breakfast buffet and that was also pretty disgusting since there were used cups and plates all over the place.Having been in Amsterdam many times before I would also like to add that most people in Amsterdam are very friendly and cooperative by nature, but the reception at Hotel New Amsterdam did not reflect this at all. It was not unfriendly, but very casual and rather bored.When returning to this beautiful city next time I will not waste my time going to this hotel, but will be looking for a place where hotel guests are looked after better.

<Content>I'd recommend the Hotel New Amsterdam We stayed at the New Amsterdam for a weekend recently. It is very centrally located, just a few minutes walk from Central Station, yet is on a quiet street overlooking a canal. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel was very clean. Breakfast was good, and free coffee was available 24 hours, as well as water from a cooler. Our en-suite double room was on the small side, but very well equipped, clean and comfortable. The room was cleaned and we had fresh towels, though we only stayed 2 nights. For 125 euros per night for the room plus breakfast, we thought it was very good value. The hotel used to be gay but is now described as straight friendly, which is a nice way of putting it.

<Content>A Nice Budget Hotel in a Great Location I had a meeting in Amsterdam and my husband tagged along and played tourist. We both couldn't have been happier with this hotel as the base for our trip. The location--an easy walk from the main train station--is along a canal on the edge of the Jordaan section of Amsterdam. It felt more residential even though it was close to the city center and the neighborhood was filled with great bars and restaurants. The hotel itself had an adequate breakfast (though since we were there a week--it got a little boring). The rooms were small but completely sufficient. The staff made the place--they were helpful and suggested some great neighborhood eateries. Plus, one of them brought a gorgeous labrador to hang out in the lobby (who is also depicted in a mural), so that gave the hotel a relaxed and friendly environment. One minor quibble: we had a bit of a mosquito problem in our room and since there were no screens we had to close our windows at night, which got a bit stuffy. I would bring some bug spray if I returned so we could sleep with the windows open.I would recommend this place to everyone and if I have to return to Amsterdam would stay here again. The location and the venue--an old canal rowhouse just made this an excellent choice for a true Amsterdam experience.

<Content>New Amsterdam Hotel : I love you I stayed at the New Amsterdam from 14 till 16 august. When i arrived i was welcomed by the receptionnist by a cup of coffee and immeadiately brought to my room, on the first floor with canal view. For sure, the room was small, but very clean and fitted with a tv with 14 programms,iron, and modem plug. The bathroom was tiny, but very clean and also nice bath ammenities. (body gel, shampoo..). The breakfast is served on the ground floor which is next to the front desk, daily newspapers and bbc tv are available to enjoy freshly pressed orange juice ( hey, super nice idea), bread and some good old holland cheese. Small breakfast buffet, but very nicely arranged and the best of all was the coffee machine, where you can choose all sort of coffee... The staff is very friendly , helpful and nice and i enjoyed every minute of my stay, i feeled like home, and this is very rare in a hotel, guests are treated like vips not like numbers and they take care of you. The situation of the New Amsterdalm is excellent, quiet, long the Herengracht (canal) and not far from the Center (10 min ). I will stay at this Hotel again, for sure and will recommend it to others . New Amsterdam Hotel i love you !

<Content>nice small hotel Stayed here four nights in July. It is a charming hotel in a charming area of a charming city (can you tell I enjoyed my stay?). The room was nice, average size for a European hotel. There is no AC, so it was a bit stuffy, but the electric fan provided made it comefortable. The desk personnel were helpful, and yes, the 24 hour espresso machine in the lobby was an asset.
