<Content>But It's Centrally Located..... Oh Lord...where do I begin? You know, we are glutton's for punishment. This was not our first stay at the Shawmut. We rationalize staying there with what's become a catch phrase in our family-It's Centrally Located. And it is. To Quincy Market, Fanuel Hall, the subway, Rachel Ray-recommended restaurants just around the corner, etc, etc. However, the central location comes with a price. I traveled with my son, sister and brother in law in October 2006. This was my son's high school graduation gift. The first room we were checked into reeked of something that none of us could indentify. I can only assume that whatever it was had been around since Paul Revere roamed the streets. We asked to be moved to another room due to the stench. Our request was granted. The new room was without the stench. However, the carpet was in such a shape that none of us would walk barefoot. Thank God we all thought to bring our flip flops. Though it was October, it was rather warm and there was no A/C. If I remember correctly, the unit is shut down at this time of year and the hotel will not turn it back on until spring-regardless of the outside temp. The next fiasco came in the middle of the night. We had only one king size bed and a sofa sleeper. My son and I took turns with my sister and her husband with the beds...us on the sofa one night, they on the sofa the next. Our third night there, my son and I took the sofa sleeper. I had awakened in the middle of the night after hearing a creak in the bed. My son was sleeping but turned over onto his side and at that time the sofa sleeper jack knifed! Just like an 18-wheeler! We slipped into the dark abyss of the sofa and soon found the tops of our heads on the floor. Thank God it made a loud noise and woke up my sister and husband. They had to pull us out of that black hole. We all laughed so hard we nearly peed our pants amid cries of, But it's Centrally Located! All in all, I would probably stay there again. It is, after all, a good conversation piece and rememember,Centrally Located.

<Content>Worst place we stayed in North America We, unfortunately, were in Boston the weekend the Red Sox were playing. Not being from North America we didn't even know who they were only that it was very hard and very expensive to stay in Boston. This was the worst value hotel experience of my life. There were holes in the sheets and the second night parts of the sheets were worn through, the towels were thin and the blankets some type of synthetic which managed to be sweaty but not warm. The heating was not on even though it was mid-October and coats and scarf cold. Requests for extra blankets were met with bad grace. The breakfast room was small and the breakfast very poor quality.Various items in the room were in need of replacement not just the beddiing e.g. no safety guard on top of heating unit, taps not working properly in bathroom etc.On the positive side it did have free internet in the lobby and it was within walking distance of the Quincy Market and public transport. However, it was in a dingy backstreet with a number of seedy bars which stayed open until 2am

<Content>Both Good  In Oct. , Boston in the downtown area accomodations are at a premium. We did not want to stay outside of downtown and wanted to be close to attractions and areas of downtown. This inn is GREAT for that. This inn is right next to a subway stop which makes it VERY convenient for transportation purposes. We spent a lot of time in the Fanuel Hall, Quincy Market, and North End area. The inn its shelf is about average. We have stayed at many hotels  inns around the globe. Looks like there is some rehabilitation of buildings and some construction. This is good for the future. There is noise because of this. There is some loud partying going on around the inn as well. There are many bars and they seem to set their own hours depending on how the Red Sox are doing. Not a real big problem for us. Safety was never questioned. The inn staff was helpful and courteous. Not much of a continental breakfast fan, however, this is included every morning between 7-11. Would we stay there again? This time we did not want to spend big money on the hotel. We were only in the room to sleep for the most part. Have seen what there is to see in the downtown area of Boston now. Probably, won't stay here again but not because anything is wrong just other places to see and do.

<Content>dirty dumpy but cheap Room was dingy....peeling wall paper, carpet was a remnant that had gaps around the edge. Furnishings were uncomfortable in the extreme and cheap. Bathroom was moldy, fan was broke. Breakfast buffet was as cheap as you could put one on. Noisy next to bar. Lots of homeless folks sleeping in doorways all around the hotel every night added a bit of local color. Otherwise location is convenient for TD banknorth Center and North Station.Note....some rooms in this place had been renovated and were nice, but mine was DUMP.All in all, I should have spent $30 more and stayed in a less run down location.

<Content>A great stay I stayed here for a few nights while my dad visited me in Boston. We paid around $150 per night, something next to impossible in Boston. Parking was definetly an issue but I just parked outside of Boston at Alewife and rode the train in. It was only 20 minutes each way and it only cost me $20 to park for the entire 4 nights. Location could not have been better. Sports bars galore within 1/2 block, and only a few minutes walk to the North End and Faneuil Hall. Plus, it's right next to North Station so you could get anywhere in the city within minutes. We went to Fenway and it only took 15 minutes on the train, then was just an $10 cab ride back (the T was too crowded for us). Additionally, my father is handicapped and he had no problem with the accessibility of the hotel or the room. The room was very spacious and was definetly more accessible than other hotels we have been to.My only complaint is that the hotel didn't have ESPN or any other sports station on the TV, but that's just me. (The guy at the front desk said they are working on it.) They did have free internet access by the front desk that I could check the scores at though. All in all, a great stay for a great price.

<Content>Excellent value! We stayed 9/6-9/10/07. Had a great, clean room, friendly front desk service. We forgot about the offered breakfast, so don't know how that is. The room was a bit noisy from the fitness center across the street, but the location couldn't have been better; across the street from the T, we never used a taxi. We will definitely stay here again, suggest it to anyone. Don't go on appearance of the downstairs front lobby, hotel begins 2nd floor.

<Content>Rude and Indifferent Never even got past the front lobby, which was shabby and dark. I was supposed to stay here while travelling with a friend, who is the person that made all the arrangements and paid up front for the room. Well, she had a family emergency at the last minute and couldnt go. I went alone and got to the city too early to check in. So I left my bags with the hotel and wandered around the city for 5 hours. At 5pm I came back, exhausted. I just wanted to get the room and lay down for a few minutes. The girl at the desk told me I couldnt have the room because the person that reserved it wasnt with me. I tried to explain that my name was on the reservation as well and that they could call my friend and have her explain the situation to them. So she gets the manager, who calls my friend. I overheard the conversation and it seemed like everything got worked out, except when he hung up the phone he says OK, you can have the room as soon as she arrives. I got mad and said UM, she isnt coming! Thats the whole reason you called to talk to her! So he just shrugs and says no dice. No friend, no room. Even though it was paid for a month in advance. You lose. Now its 6pm and dark out. He told me he would cancel my friends reservation and give me my own, but for some shifty reason the price was double. I ended up leaving, dragging 3 pieces of luggage 4 blocks to a rental car place, renting a car and driving to a relatives house 2 hours away.Then when I tried calling to complain about this place to whoever owned it, I got a runaround by some girl on the phone who said there aren't really any owners and the person I need to address my concerns to was the jerk manager who originally helped me! Oh but she did say she would write everything I told her down and make sure it got filed in the proper place. Gee thanks.

<Content>are you driving in? The reason for the review title is that the affordability of the Shawmut Inn needs to be called into question if you are driving into Boston and have to park. 1st - they don't have anywhere to unload your stuff, as the street is entirely no parking. It worked out ok for us but if you were alone it would be a drag to worry about your car being ticketed/towed while you checked in  brought your bags up to the room.2nd - parking in the nearest overnight available parking added $93 to the cost of our TWO NIGHT stay. Which would have paid for the much more upscale hotel that had discount parking available.About the hotel: The room was dingy but clean [a 5 square tile was missing out of the middle of the bathroom floor and toilet listed to the left], service was friendly. It is RIGHT by North Station, the TD Banknorth Garden is literally at the end of the street, around the corner on Canal St you will find a few blocks of bars  places to eat.

<Content>Good and Bad The Shawmut Inn has it's pros and cons. Let's start with the good stuff. The location is perfect. It is right in the heart of the city, with North Station one block down. Easy access to the T. There are some sketchy people around yes, but it never felt unsafe. There's way more normal, regular people walking around. The few crazy/homeless just tend to stick out. Another positive aspect is the staff. They were friendly and and provided complimentary breakfasts every morning. Another positive is the price. It was very affordable.Now for the negatives. The air conditioner did not work. The first day we showed up it went down, and were told that it was being fixed. We were there for 4 days and it still wasn't fixed by the time we left. (It didn't help that this was during Boston's 3 day heatwave with temps from 90-100. Another negative aspect was the appearance/cleanliness. It was kind of dirty. Our bed blanket cover even had cigarette burns in it. (Granted our room was a smoking room, but one would think a hotel would be able to afford new blankets without cigarette burns.) Also, the window would not stay up on its own for long. It would come crashing down on it's own if left open for a long time.Overall, I'd recommend the Shawmut to the budget traveler who wants a convenient location to get around the city. However, if you are going to spend a lot of time in your hotel, you may want to pay a little more for a better quality place.

<Content>Dingy but great location I kind of have two reviews of the Shawmut, because I stayed here once for a romantic stay with my then-boyfriend in November of 2003, and my friends ended up staying there in August 2005 to attend my wedding to the same guy.So, the first thing I would say is--if your long-distance romantic partner is coming to visit, splurge on something nicer. I really couldn't afford more but I was living with my mom at the time and wanted some privacy, if you get my meaning. The room had huge water stains on the walls and ceiling, and the linens and drapes were very dingy and dusty. So--not a romantic setting.However, when my friends were staying there, I saw it in a different light. It's a very affordable, basic place in a great Boston location. The staff is helpful and breakfast is included. The rooms are really nothing special but if you just need a place to rest your head, the location and price can't be beat. You can walk to Quincy Market/Fanueil Hall, the North End, Government Center, Downtown Crossing and the Boston Common. At the Boston Common. If you want to take a day trip to the pretty New England towns on the North Shore, North Station is right there with all the commuter trains. It also had local subway lines into other parts of the city. They really enjoyed it staying there.My commute used to take me through that neighborhood and I can say it's not dangerous at all. There are homeless people everywhere in Boston, except maybe Back Bay--but you'd have to sell your mother's kidneys to stay in Back Bay. So, in summary, this is not a pretty hotel but it will save you a lot of $$ that can be better spent elsewhere. It's not romantic, it's practical.

<Content>Does the job, but does it better in the week The Shawmut Inn is what I would call functional, cheap and cheerful, and all three it was. Stayed here for 3 nights (weds to Fri) in June 2007 and was very happy. Room was clean and spacious, everything worked and the bed was comfortable. Even had a brand new kitchenette!! Also very close to the centre of town and the Celtics stadium. However the room was in a slight state of disrepair (Curtains didn't close properly, some old drill holes not filled in in bathroom), but nothing major. The only downside was that on the Friday night both the street outside (there are a number of bars along the road) and the rooms in (there was a group of students who kept running from room to room and shouting a lot) were noisy, not so much that it kept us awake, but it could be a concern for some people. Overall, pretty good. Vrey good for the price.

<Content>Two Canadians and Two Brits loved this Inn We just got back from Boston and loved it. When we first saw the Shawmutt we were a little weary. But we ended up loving it. They had a good breakfast room, well stocked open 24 hours. It was close to the North Station. A lot of great restaurants within walking distance. Lots of taxi's always parked nearby. The room was roomy, and always very clean. What more do you need when you are out all the time sight seeing. Well worth the price. I own [--] and needed Internet service to keep in touch with my business. They had a laptop right in the reception which was awesome and very helpful reception staff. We would definitely use this hotel again. We even met an Elvis impersonator staying there! I will post the photo later

<Content>A good place to stay I stayed at the Shawmut April 14 through 17 for the Boston Marathon. The first two nights, I had a room with a queen-sized bed to myself. The last night, I shared a two queen bed room with 3 others. The Shawmut is clean and maintained, if slightly worn. The rooms are large for a city hotel, and everything in both rooms worked. The beds were comfortable. The staff was helpful, and allowed us all to store our luggage on Saturday before check in. I wasn't that excited by the breakfast, but it was adequate. Yes, some of the rooms can be noisy (especially at bar closing time on Saturday night) - but no more so than in any other city hotel in which I've stayed. The proximity to the T was super - and getting to race events was easy, as it wasn't necessary to change lines.There were only two items that were less than satisfactory: 1) We were given smoking rooms despite asking for non-smoking rooms. 2) I thought I had lost my watch, and I emailed the hotel to see if it had been found. Happily, I found my watch, but the hotel staff never responded to my query.Despite some of the less flattering reviews I've read here, I believe the Shawmut is a good place to stay.

<Content>Shawmut....love, love, love. My friend and I stayed at the Shawmut Inn over the March Break this year. We found it on hotels.com and, let me tell you, I am happy we did. First off, it was cheap. There was a special, and because we were staying there for 4 nights, the rate was ridiculous. I think we ended up paying roughly $87 C per night. Secondly, the staff is AWESOME. The two guys in particular. They took care of us and answered any and all questions we had. And believe me, I had a doozy of a question about Coldstone Ice Creamery (I think that's what it was called).....he hadn't heard of it, and I insisted I had ice cream at this place the last time I was in Boston. The internet was down, so he said that he would check into it. I didn't really expect to hear from him....but then I got a note stuck to my door...he had called a friend of his, and his friend looked it up, got the address and the phone number of the place and there it was on my door by the time we got back from our walk! It was unbelievable. Also, my friend and I had gone out one night to a bar located down the block from the Shawmut (it's called The Greatest Bar in Boston....not just a name, folks....we had the best time there) and when we got back we were hungry. Well, they lock the doors after a certain time so you have to get buzzed in by the front desk. We didn't wait long, they buzzed us in a minute or two later. Anyway, I wanted to make sure that we could get back in after we went out to get some food, so I asked one of the guys if I just went around the corner to the 7-11 if I could get buzzed in right away, he asked what kind of food we were in the mood for. At that point in the night, we were up for anything. So he basically opened up the kitchen for me and loaded me up with a big box full of the complimentary breakfast stuff the hotel puts out (bagels, danishes, cereal, etc). I am telling you. The staff is beyond amazing.The location is awesome. We went to see a Celtics game - TD Banknorth Centre is right across the street, literally. We walked EVERYWHERE. I think we spent like $20 on cabs the entire time we were there. And it was all in one night where we could have just gone to the Greatest Bar which was down the street... ;) Ah well.The room was what we were looking for....we just wanted a place to sleep pretty much. We knew we weren't going to spend a lot of time there. There was a fridge, a microwave.....again, nothing earth-shattering, but the place was $87 a night!! It was perfectly clean, the noise wasn't that bad, there was some noise but because I'm a heavy sleeper it didn't bother me really.Parking - you have to park at the Gov't Centre a few blocks away, but it's a secure building so our minds were at ease. I think we paid $100 C for almost a week of parking. I'd rather leave a vehicle there than down the street at this parking lot.....but one of the guys working there was really nice and let us unload our car there and check in before moving our car....so that we wouldn't have to double-park in front of the hotel.Everything you need is at the hotel or around it. Faneuil Hall, a touristy marketplace area is a short walk away.....we walked to the Financial District, New England Aquarium, the Park with the Frog Pond (ice rink)...plenty of pubs and bars....subway is right there. Everything is close.I would definitely recommend the Shawmut to anyone, and I have already. I would also definitely stay there again.Thanks for a good time!!

<Content>not worth the cheap price Ok, first I have to start by saying that in general, I found this hotel to be pleasant. The staff were courteous and helpful. In general, I find Boston ridiculously overpriced for hotel rooms and was looking for a deal, but I certainly did not expect to have to share my room with mice, my basic complaint. If not for the live vermin, scurrying around the room at night, I would have thoroughly enjoyed my stay, particularly given the location and price, however I was unable to sleep peacefully with mice scurrying around the room. Conveniently located, the Shawmut Inn has a number of perks that include the fact that it is easily serviceable by public transportation, and serves a nice continental breakfast, that definitely helps get the day started right if you are sightseeing shopping etc. The neighborhood is fine. If you have ever lived in any urban area there are neighborhoods like this. Yes it is noisy, this is not a nice quiet hotel but once again the urban noise is expected given the area and its proximity to sports venues, bars, and clubs. When I complained about the mice I was given another room. Initially I was impressed with the quick change of rooms and the accommodating nature of the staff...little did I realize that mice were just a problem in the hotel period. I am writing this from my hotel room at nearly 4 in the morning because I literally cannot sleep, and I have seen one mouse scurry across my room twice (or maybe its two different mice) as I am writing this. Overall, I honestly cannot say that the cheap price is worth sharing your room with uninvited guests. But if the occasional mouse in your room doesn't bother you, then this is actually a great deal for the money.

<Content>Great Location and decenet for the price The location of the Shawmut is perfect if you want to see a Basketball or Hockey game. It is also in easy (4-10 blocks) from both Little Italy  the Quincy Market area. For the price, this hotel is decent. There were some problems that should be noted:--there was a small fire on the first floor and no alarms went off alerting us to evacuate. We advised the front desk staff and they ignored it completey. The fire was put out quickly, but we were still disappointed to learn that our safety was comprised with the lack of a smoke alarm.--large variation between the sizes of the rooms. We had a large room in the front with a view of the street. My in-laws had a shoebox in the back of the hotel with a tiny window near the ceiling.Advantages:--location is wonderful as noted above--easy access to trolley or T--easy to find--decent continental breakfast--fun bar area. Several bars on on the street and the streets near the hotel.I would definitely stay here again if I were looking for a cheap hotel that is decent.

<Content>Loved the Shawmut! Stayed at the Shawmut for 3 nights in mid February. Loved it! We were down for a guys trip and booked the room over the internet. Before booking, I phoned the hotel itself and made sure that we could get 2 double beds and the fellow assured us that it would not be an issue. He also told us to book over the internet because that price would be the best. We ended up paying about $105 CAD/night for the room. When we arrived in Boston, we took the T from the airport and the subway station is right across the road from the hotel, conveniant, $2 to get there. When we checked in, a room with 2 double beds was given to us for no extra charge. The room itself was clean, had a microwave and fridge, and was quite roomy. The room is nothing special, but hey, what do you expect for $105? All I wanted was a clean room and a comfy bed and I got both of those and more. There is a free continental breakfast, juice, cereal, bagels, etc, more than enough to start the day off right.Location: We both found the location to be unbeatable. The hotel is located across the street from the TD Banknorth Garden, and is in a very safe area. We walked around late at night and never felt threatened. It is also a short walk or a $5 cab ride to Fanieu Hall.If you're looking for a clean, comfortable nights sleep in an inexpensive hotel, don't even think twice, I'll be staying here on my next trip to Boston.

<Content>Loved the Shawmut I visited Boston in January 2007 and found the Shawmut to be clean and comfortable and the staff were very helpful, in particular the Assistant General Mgr, who was very obliging. The rates are reasonable and I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great location Stayed there in early October for one night trip to Boston. The hotel staff was very polite. The hotel is very close to the T. The only draw back is the noise from the street at night. Another drawback is all the bars on the street where the hotel is located. Despite the small problems I thought the hotel was great.

<Content>Great for the price We spent 4 nights at the Shawmut in October. I understand why some people might not like the hotel... it's just a small hotel with very limited services in a sports bar area near the Bankworth Garden. However, we found it very satisfactory: the room was large and clean, at an excellent price for downtown Boston (we paid $117.80 a night average for a queen bed). Virtually all hotels in downtown Boston are well over $200. And we like bars! Plus easy walking distance to the North End, downtown, Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Beacon Hill, Boston Common, and the T is a block away (Boston's great subway, you can go everywhere).We recommend eating in the North End: try Regina Pizza, Pagliuca's for traditional Italian, or L'Osteria for fancy. Try the Corner Cafe on Prince Street. It's more of a bar, but it is classic italian!We'll make the Shawmut our place to stay in Boston

<Content>Great/Bad* Location (delete as applicable!) Intially the location of this place was fab. Came out of North Station and within a minutes or two walk you're there. The room was big with kitchenette, nice bathroom and big tv. A 5 min walk takes you to Fanueil Hall so an excellent base.Unfortunatley we stayed there on a Saturday night and were at the front of the hotel. There are a few bars about and to be fair the noise was not a problem from them but the people coming out and shouting! It calmed down though and i suppose every City is more or less the same.On the Sunday night all was calm until 3am when the refuse truck came up the road - not the quietest activity. Then at 6am the bar across the road had a delivery of scaffold or something. The guys delivering it put the truck radio on and decided to communicate by shouting. Lasted about 30mins.Breakfast was also good with a make-it-yourself bagels, muffins, coffee etc, so a good start to the day. Free internet access was also available in the reception are and they let us put our bags in one of the rooms on check-out day.Saying that though, I'd definitley stay here again as room was top notch and good location. Probably quieter in the week! Might ask for a room at the rear next time.... But loved Boston!!

<Content>My worst nightmare! Don't stay here. Can I give this hotel a negative 5 stars? It was worse than terrible.Okay, I admit, we stayed here as it was cheap. Boston is way overpriced, and I couldn't see spending $200/night for a hotel. I did read the reviews, and knew that people either loved or hated it. I was willing to accept mice (most of the complaints) and a less than ideal neighborhood.We arrived about 5 pm and checked in. The room was dingy. Boston was 90+ degrees w/matching humidity. The a/c didn't work. The window was ajar, and couldn't be moved. I try to have an open mind, and my husband didn't want to cause a stir. I knew I wanted to move (and had alternate reservations for the next night), but against better judgement, we didn't.The neighborhood is scary. It was a Friday night, and our room, w/the open window, was the 2nd floor, above a bar. The patrons were noisy and coming and going all night. Emergency sirens all night in the neighborhood. About 3 am, we hear boom, boom, boom every minute. Off and on for about 20 mins. I am certain it is a driveby shooting, and worried that we'll see bullets in the room! (In retrospect, probably was fireworks, but unlike any I have heard). The room was stiflingly hot. After a sleepless night, I went to the front desk and asked to move, someplace more quiet. I was told well, I don't think I have any other rooms. I can tell you after 11 am. I could not do this for the next 5 nights, so we walked down to the Clarion Bulfinch, who allowed us to check in before 9 am. When we came back, packed our bags and went to check out, we waited in line as at least 4 other parties, normal checkouts, left. And she told me she didn't have any rooms! They obviously don't care, as she didn't even ask why I was leaving 5 nights early.I think our rate was $90-110/night. I am a budget traveler and wouldn't stay at the Shawmut Inn again if they paid me. The $150 at the Bulfinch was well worth it. It is 3 blocks away and CLEAN. The neighborhood is much better that 3 blocks away.

<Content>decent for the price My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights during our first trip to Boston. We flew in on a red-eye and arrived at our hotel around 7am. We knew we would not be able to check-in, but we were able to leave our luggage in a secure area. We asked the man at the front desk to recommend a place to have breakfast nearby, but honestly, he seemed unfamiliar with the area, as he was not able to come up with much! So, we took off on our own to explore. Upon returning to the hotel around 2pm, we were finally able to check-in. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of our room, as well as the mini kitchen it included. There wasn't much in the way of decorations, but if you don't care about that (as we didn't) then you won't mind. The location of the hotel is great, as we came to find out after doing alot of sightseeing. It is located across the street from the T (aka: subway) and is within walking distance of most areas and restaurants (as stated in the travelguide I used to find this hotel). I would say our biggest complaint was regarding housekeeping. The first day I called down to the front desk to ask for an additional towel and was told I would have to come down myself to get it, as there was no one available to bring one up for me. Quite honestly, after being on a long flight, walking half the day around the city on no sleep, the last thing I wanted to do was move fom my room after finally being able to check in! Then, the next day after returning to our room after it had been made up, we found that we had no washcloths and the box of tissue I had used up was not replaced. When I went down to ask for these things, the man at the front desk had to seach for a box of tissue, eventually coming up with nothing. He told me if he found one, he would bring it to our room. Never happened. This wouldn't have been such a big deal if i had not had a cold the first 3 days of our trip! Obviously these are all minor things and did not affect our overall trip. I would recommend this hotel as far as price and location, but if you are expecting any kind of service, it's not the Ritz!

<Content>perfect hotel for roadtrip We just got back from a weekend in Boston and we stayed at the Shawmut Inn. It is a perfect hotel for roadtrips. You are within walking distance to all kinds of bars/restaurants. The train station is across the street and cabs wait across the street too. It is a short cab ride to/from the airport.The staff was very friendly, and the hotel was clean. I would go back there again. You can't beat the price.

<Content>clean and a bargain we wanted to see the northend, and attend a concert and be near the T. We expected basic, older rooms. That's what we got, and it was quiet, clean and perfectly adequate. As the Amtrak goes to Northstation (across the street), we will do that next time and leave the car home. We parked the car this time directly in front (got lucky), and walked/taxied around town. Fun and safe.

<Content>Worth the trouble? Probably not The Shawmut Inn is a hotel located on Friend St in Boston, about four long blocks from Quincy Market, and directly across the street from the TD Banknorth Garden stadium. On first glance inside, it is a budget hotel that is serviceable for its price. The guy who checked me in was polite and helpful. My room, at first glance, was clean and comfortable.Then night fell, and I got no sleep because of a combination of loud bangings in the hallway, the sound of mice scurrying along the floor in my room (that was unpleasant), and the sound of drunks hollering in the street at one of the several bars directly downstairs from the Inn. Add to that the 4 am garbage trucks, the taxis honking their horns for early morning pick-ups, and then, the final insult (I hope - I am writing this from the Shawmut as we speak):I went out (because I could not sleep) to get a sandwich and coffee from the Dunkin Donuts down the street, and when I got back, I had to hit the bell to be buzzed into the hotel. I hit the bell about once every minute to start, and then about once every 30 seconds, and eventually once every 15 seconds. For ten solid minutes. Enough time to eat my sandwich, in fact. So I spent money calling information to get the hotel number, and when I reached the front desk, the guy on the line said I could not have been buzzing for 10 minutes because he had only been away from his desk 3-4 minutes. So not only was he a liar, but he was also calling me - a guest - a liar. What a pleasant individual.I am writing this review at 5:35 a.m. on my second night here and the reason I can write this review is because I can't sleep. There is a delivery truck downstairs making some sort of delivery, and every manner of banging and clanging is going on. In addition, the room is very hot - I have tried every setting on my climate control, and none of them do anything. I could open the windows to let in some cool air, but it would do nothing for the noise problems. It would cost more time and trouble than it is worth to switch hotels, especially with the last-minute rates. Thankfully, I have only one more night here.Avoid the Shawmut Inn like the plague. Or, let's hope the mice aren't carrying any.

<Content>Even though the price is tempting.....its not worth it.... Well, where do I begin? Lets start from the beginning, we arrived on friends street (at night) and I must say this Inn is located on the sketchiest street in the world. It was blanketed in darkness, which made us very tempted to go in. When we walked in it appeared very nice, we checked out our rooms...it was okay. But it wasn't until we came back in, did it go downhill. When we came back at around 9:00, the room was VERY cold, so we put the heat on--after 15 minutes we noticed it wasn't getting warm! I am not joking when I say this, but this is February in Boston and the temperature was warmer outside than it was in our room! This Inn is located near bars, quite a few of them..so at 2 am many drunkards were loud in the streets. The noise level was the equivalent to bar scenes shown on the show 'The Real World.' All in All, don't bother coming here, spend the extra money on a hotel-thats worth every penny.

<Content>Perfect for the budget traveller This hotel is perfect for the budget traveller who wants to stay in downtown Boston. The location is a 15 minute walk to Faneuil Hall or the Italian North End. The North Station subway stop is 5 minutes away.The rooms are what you would expect for a budget hotel but come with the appreciated amenities of a refrigerator and microwave oven. Continental breakfast is free.If you want the luxuries of a Hyatt or Marriot and can spend $300 or more a night, do it. If you want to spend a little over a $100 a night to stay in downtown Boston, I recommend this place.A friend of mine rates hotels as (1) walk barefoot in the room, (2) wear slippers in the room, 3) wear shoes in the room. I rate this a (2).The problems noted in earlier reviews about rodents appears to be gone. There is no parking so be prepared to pay alot to park at nearby lots. Cab fare from the airport is about $25 for two. Subway fare for two is $2.50. We did both.

<Content>Do NOT stay here THis hotel stinks! We didn't even check in. Does not look like the photos on the internet. Very dirty and shabby on a shady side street. We arrived about an hour and a half before official check in time. After waiting ten minutes (no exaggeration) for the clerk to get off the phone to her friend, we were told that even though there were rooms clean and available we could not check in early. We pleaded as we had an event to attend. Nope, no exceptions. She even called the manager at home to see if we could (no manager on duty during the weekends - okayyyyy?). Nope. Ridiculuous. We ended up staying at a friend's which to tell you the truth was a lot better as the place seemed really shady anyway. And did I mention the parking was a good ten minute walk?

<Content>Poor ratings for the Shawmut Inn We just visited Boston on August 28th. We stayed at the Shawmut Inn.BIG MISTAKE !!! The rates for the rooms were so high for one night.We had to park our car 3-4 blocks away from the hotel. The parking lot charged us $28.00 for parking there for the night. This $28.00 was not included in the price of the hotel. I really think that since the Shawmut does not have a parking lot, they should include the $28.00 for the room.The neighbourhood was dirty and disgusting. Homeless people were laying on the next street, and begging for money. When I went to pick up the car the next morning, I got lost (because of all the one-way streets) and when I pulled over to ask for directions, the man told me to bug off and leave him alone. He was in a business suit :(I would never go to the Shawmut Inn ever again.

<Content>Enjoyed our Stay We Stayed at the Shawmut Inn for a long weekend, not a fancy hotel but very satisfactory. The rooms were clean and a nice size, with refrigerator, micro and sink in the kitchen area. All of the staff were very helpful and friendly. Additionally the Continental Breakfast was quite nice, with plenty of options. The Milk could have been colder. It is in a good location steps from the North Station T stop. The prices were very reasonable for Boston. We would stay there in the future if available.

<Content>A little more would push the Shawmut to 3 stars I have stayed at Shawmut 10-15 nights in the past few months. I think the value proposition there is good. The price is very reasonable relative to other places. The location was very good for me. It's around the corner from Fleet Center and North Station (commuter trains and the T), and there are several good places for lunch and dinner on Canal Street one block over. Italian places are only a few minutes away. Government Center parking (huge!) is about 5 minutes away by foot. There are always lots of cabs cruising on Causeway, which is the corner street. Room has always been clean. Bath is plenty large. HVAC has always worked fine. Bed is very comfortable. I get a suite which is larger than a regular room, because I like the separate sleeping area. Remember that Boston is not a very large city and a key to its tourist appeal is the walking experience; so why not save a few bucks and stay in a place that is not in the central business district, when you are not going to be at the hotel all the time anyway? Negatives: The included breakfast is weak; no pancakes or eggs, just some juices, cold cereals, bagles, and croissants. The lobby is on the 2nd floor and you enter what appears to be an apartment house doorway into a hall and onto the elevator. There is a security camera. Friend Street has a few sports bars that get noisy on game night and Fri and Sat nights. Try for a room that does not face the street. There are some finish errors in the rooms that are annoying, but not fatal; eg, the baths are not tiled, and my each of my rooms has been missing some small section of baseboard, and there is an inexplicable gap betwen the saddle and the entrance doors into the rooms. There is no gym but the Boston Athletic Club is directly across Friend Street, and you can work out for $10, which is a good deal. BL

<Content>If you don't mind being awaked by mice... The first impression was nice, the room was large and comfortable, the bathroom was okay and clean and the location was good (1 block and a half from the subway, 10 minutes by foot from the city center). The breakfast was good, but the staff was a bit rude. But when the night came, the nightmare began... At 6 in the morning, my girlfriend woke me up coz' she heard a noise coming from her bag. When we lighted, we saw a little hole in our bakery paper bag: a mouse has tried to steal my bakeries!! Then we were unable to fall asleep again because the teeny tiny mouse was making so much noise runnig around in the ceiling... We complained and the hotel gave us a discount of 10$ (for a 60$ night) and offer us a bigger room for the same price the next time we would come.They also told us they knew that there were mice in the hotel because of subway works and even if they were trying to, they couldn't manage to get rid of them...To sum up, this hotel would be a great bargain if there were no mice! Anyway we talked to other customers and it seems that if you do not have a room on the last floor (5th), you may have the chance not to have mice to play with!

<Content>Locked out... My mother and I were planning to stay at the Shawmut Inn for one night in May. I chose the hotel because of its proximity to public transit -- we had plans early the next morning in Somerville. I checked the late check-in box on the Expedia reservation form, and called the Shawmut in the morning to confirm our booking for that night.When we arrived at the hotel in the late evening, hoping to get into our room and to sleep quickly, the front desk staffer told us to wait. He stepped into a back office and audibly made a series of phone calls, evidently asking other innkeepers if they had any vacancies. For 20-30 min., we sat in the lobby, the employee waving off our questions. He eventually told us tha the Shawmut had overbooked and was full, so they'd arranged to put us up elsewhere. He gave us a cab voucher and shipped us off to the substitute quarters, which turned out to be a bed-and-breakfast in Charlestown (far north Boston, over the river). It was a rather nice place--just totally wrong for the circumstances.The whole affair cost us a couple of hours' sleep, plus it felt very fishy (other than the taxi voucher, we got nothing in writing to document what had happened). We also came away with the impression that overbooking is a routine practice for this hotel.I never got to see the rooms at the Shawmut, but I can tell you that making a reservation there involves taking some degree of risk.

<Content>Canadian traveller My wife and I stayed at the Shawmut for six nights in September. We were in Boston to see Jimmy Buffet and Phil Collins. This was the second time we'd stayed there (in 2002 - Elton John/Billy Joel). The location cannot be beat - literally a 45 second walk to the Fleet Centre and within walking distance of just about anywhere you'd like to go. Its about five minutes from Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market. The hotel is not in the best of neighborhoods but after walking for a couple of minutes you're in a fine area. Of the thirteen nights I've stayed there I've never had a problem. Rooms are clean, decent sized, the staff is friendly and helpful and the continental breakfast, while basic, is a nice start to the day. After checking out a number of Boston hotels I'd be very surprised if you could find one better located at a better price.

<Content>Mouse In The Room................Stay Away From Here! Unless you like sleeping with mice, stay away from this place! It was not our choice to stay here, we were part of a small group, but upon returning to the room in the early morning hours, we discovered a live, wriggling MOUSE attached to a glue paper in clear view on the floor!! The question is: where was that glue paper when we arrived in the room that afternoon? We were given another room but the damage had been done. My wife was traumatized by this, and needless to say, we did not sleep at all. We left the hotel as soon as it was daybreak. Also, the vents were very dirty and the venilation was horrible. The shower head in the second room had the ring hanging loose, and there was a large hole in the wall, plenty big enough for a rodent to enter the room. The neighboorhood is not very nice at all, although convienent to the T, North Station and the Fleet Center.

<Content>Shabby room, but nice staff I recently stayed at the Shawmut Inn for three nights. My total stay, with the various taxes, was less than $375. The hotel is not in the more touristy areas, but it is not a bad neighborhood. Not very enticing, though. My room, though far from deluxe, was serviceable, and clean. I wasn't there much, anyway, and as long as the sheets, towels, and bathroom is clean, I am OK with it. I liked that there was a small microwave and mini-fridge in the room, and plenty of cabinet space. The staff were very nice to deal with, and one night, when the housekeeping staff had forgotten to give me clean washcloths, a staffer got some for me right away, and apologized. Not a big deal.I am still unsure if I'll stay at the Shawmut Inn again, more because of the location then anything else, but I can recommend it.

<Content>Dwntwn Boston Hotel for under 150? Hard to believe but true. Upsides are that it is a good location right by North Station and are one of maybe two hotels in downtown Boston that are less than $150 a night. We had a king suite (with sink, fridge, sitting room) for $125/night. Downsides are that it is bare essentials, shabby and the view is of the old elevated green line. Bottomline - for a cheap, clean and convenient place to stay I would choose Shawmut Inn again for a short getaway not so far away.

<Content>Shawmut Put the 'Friends' in Friend Street I stayed at the Shawmut Inn in April 2004, before deciding to move to Boston. It was a great little hotel in many many ways. It's perfectly located off of the (former) North Station T Stop, which allowed me to get to and from the airport without a cab, car or bus. Also, being next to a T made it easy to get anywhere else in Boston, and rail passes were sold in the Fleet Center, right across the street. The staff were younger, energetic, friendly and above all else - professional and accomodating. I didn't expect the room to have a microwave and refrigerator, which was an added bonus. I am a die-hard fan of the Copley Square Marriott, but (BIG BUT) I highly recommend the Shawmut for any lightly packed, short-term Boston visitor who wants access to the best of Boston, along with airport ease.

<Content>Great Place for Baseball Road Trip! Came out to see Fenway and for the price the Shawmut was great. North Station right across the street and direct train to Fenway - no need to transfer. There is street noise, but it did not bother me. Lots of bars in the area as well as walking distance to Fanueil Hall. Would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>50/50 The Shawmut Inn is located in a not so great part of town. Yes, there is a Hooters and Coyote Ugly down the street and a couple bars in the surrounding area, however this doesn't make up for the stay. When I arrived there were trash cans and garbage all over the street. There were several homeless people on every corner. The street lighting was terrible and it just didn't seem like a safe area. As far as the hotel goes, you got what you paid for. The room was clean and it was a good size. I didn't think the staff was as friendly as stated in the other reviews. The air conditioning in the room did not work and the television only had about 4-5 channels. If this hotel were located in a different part of town I would consider staying there again, however for my next trip to Boston I think I'll dish out the extra $30-40 a night and stay at a nicer/safer area where the actual entertainment/nightlife is located.

<Content>Not a bad place to stay. The sheets  the bathroom was clean. The staff was friendly  they let us store our bags the day we checked in  the day we checked out, which was nice because we didn't have to carry our bags around while we were site seeing. They also asked if we needed help with directions. This is NOT a fancy hotel by any means. There is a bit of noise from the street that may or may not bother you, but, just behind the Shawmut are 2 very fancy hotels  I am sure they hear the same noise we heard at the Shawmut. They only complaint I have is the bathroom fan did not work, also they had us booked for 7 nights not 1 night when we checked in. But I would reccomend this hotel to others who are staying, you can't beat the price or location.

<Content>Great deal  I thought the Shawmut Inn was a great deal! It's in a VERY centralized location - within walking distance to Fanueil Hall  Quincy Market and from there you can walk to a lot of other parts of Boston. I also thought the staff was wonderful! My boyfriend and I took a redeye from SF and landed at 7am. Check-in wasn't until 3pm, so we were just going to leave our bags in their storage area. HOwever, the concierge was very gracious and allowed us to go to our room early and we got a great power nap in before we started sight-seeing! They also have a continental breakfast - nothing fancy, but it's enough to get you started in the morning. I thought the staff was nice - there is some street noise, but I didn't think it was too loud. Overall - a great deal in a good location - I would stay there again!

<Content>Great Place, Nice staff Stayed for the Boston Marathon. Staff was very helpful and went the extra mile in helping us with many incidentals. Room was clean, breakfast was an unexpected plus. Couldn't figure out the phone set-up. The location is convenient, but will be noisy due to the surroundings. Be prepared to use ear plugs (Fleet Center, Biker Bar, lots of things going on at night). In all honesty, friends that stayed by Copley paid three times as much and got no sleep due to street noise too. Boston is just a loud place. Walk to North End for great food and a quieter atmosphere.
