<Content>Friendly and Helpful Hotel Staff This is a great place to stay in Florence. We stayed there for two nights in mid-december. The room was pretty much what you would expect for a 3-star hotel (there's TV, safe, etc, but nothing very fancy) but it's all very neat, clean and spacious. The room looked fairly new as well. There was also a breakfast included in the stay which was simple and very decent. Best of all,the staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. The counter staff gave us a ton of restaurant recommendations (which all turned out to be very good) and were happy to provide directions, check train timings, etc. Location of the hotel was very good. Its about 2 blocks from the train station (which we took to Pisa), 1 block from the bus station (which we took to Siena), and about 10-15 minutes walk to the main sights of Florence.All in, we had a very enjoyable stay at the hotel. We booked online and rates were good compared to similar hotels. Great value for what we paid and we would definitely stay here again the next time we visit Florence.

<Content>A gem of a find Fantastic Hotel - Tuscany style motifs with great staff, comfortable rooms, free wireless and a sumptuous breakfast at prices that are hard to beat (around $90 a night for a King non-smoking) - We landed at the hotel quite early in the day on a cold December morning with a baby in tow and stayed 4 nights - the staff welcomed us with a smile and checked us in.. the rooms are spacious, well-lit and very clean; Over our stay, we had to bug the front desk staff a few times daily for hot water (to prepare baby food) which they ALWAYS provided us with a smile! Oddone and Verena @ the front desk are true stars - Oddone in particular is extremely helpful with great recommendations for places to eat and things to see. Breakfast is a nice spread and Guisi (breakfast wait staff) works hard to please...Two things that can improve - the shower stalls within the bathrooms are a tad cramped and wireless is a little slow.

<Content>great hotel Booked this hotel after reading other reviews, Cannot fault the hotel at all, good location, nice room, lovely bathroom all very clean and tidy and the breakfast was more than adequate. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. Advice to anyone travellling to florence by train you must get you train ticket validated at the yellow ticket machines before getting on the train. Luckily we had read this on the internet but other people even though they had train tickets were fined 20euro each which we thought was terrible and very unfair on tourists who do not know the system

<Content>Excellent hotel We stayed here for a night and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a reasonably priced hotel in a good location.Since we were staying only a night , and travelling by train, we wanted a good basic hotel within easy walking distance of both the station and the sights of Florence . The Alba is only 5-10 minutes walk from the railway station, and about the same distance from all the main places we wanted to see on our whistle-stop visit to Florence, so was perfect for us.  When we made the booking (direct through the hotel website) it seemed amazingly cheap (115 euros for 2 of us) given the photos on its site, so we were prepared to find that the reality did not match the photos and descriptions! But no ... it really was as good as the site suggested ! The hotel looks as if it has been recently decorated. Our room was lovely - quite large and with a very good bathroom. The breakfast is in a light -filled, covered central courtyard and was probably the most extensive breakfast of anywhere we stayed.The front desk staff were extremely helpful and were happy for us to leave our bags before our room was ready on the day we arrived and until we left mid afternoon the next day. The only slightly disconcerting thing was that the place bags are left is in an alcove off the foyer open to anyone - but they were quite safe.

<Content>Comfort, service and Friendliness My family (party of five) and I stayed at the Alba at the end of Sept to early Oct. and would stay here again if we return to Florence. The service was wonderful and the staff were friendly most of them spoke English; Maria our cleaning maid who does not speak english but her big open smile and her efforts to understand you with gestures makes up for it, the lady who serves in the breakfast room during the week and Sara the front desk person to mention a few made our stay a pleasure. We had rooms 101 and 400, which is on the 4th floor, elevator only goes to the 3rd fl but the walk up the short flight of the stairs to the 4th was worth it. Both rooms were very comfortable, lots of space and hot water. Room 400 is a triple and being 3 girls sharing it, the double sinks were heavenly. We had a bird eye view of the Duomo from the window and the bathroom also has a window and the sunlight streaming in makes it bright and cheery. I cannot find one bad thing to say. Initially we had a room on the first floor that did not have a bath, just a shower with a curtain round it and very high toilet seat which makes me think it is for handicapped persons which if it is, is wonderful. We asked for a change and the very next morning we were given the spacious room on the 4th floor. Everything is within walking distance and the train/bus station is just around the corner. There are lots of places to eat and little shops where you can get the basic such as water, wine, grocery, etc.

<Content>Great Hotel for Families Taking a Family to Europe on holidays required us to undertake many hours of research into suitable Hotels for our Children. Hotel Alba is a fantastic Hotel and if we travel again we will stay here once more. The Room rate is reasonable as well when comparing to other Hotels in Firenze. We stayed in Room 001 which has a split-level design accessing an outdoor patio. A very good Hotel and I would recommend this for any family. Close location to train station which is 5-10 minute walk. Breakfast is good too. Free internet access that was popular. We can not write of any negatives.

<Content>Well positioned for train and bus travelers in Florence When you are traveling by train it is great when you can walk your suitcases from the station without getting a taxi. When the hotel is also walking distance of all the main tourist sights this only makes it better.We were three ladies travelling together but our room was designed for this and although the bathroom was tiny it had everything we needed. Our room opened onto the courtyard and I would recommend this as the street seemed quite busy. It was very clean and freshly decorated - we were happy to come home to it each night.The staff were helpful, the breakfast was good, there was free internet .... what more could one ask for.

<Content>great hotel alba Smashing hotel, very near to all of the amenities, reception excellant and they booked us to see the statue of David, which was free as we were over 65, if we'd booked it on the web it was 拢75 for 6 people. breakfast was nice typical continental breakfast, but there was enough to eat. Overall I would say that everything about the hotel was excellant. Location, good restuarants, clean rooms and bathrooms, loved the lovely fluffy towels, and nice bed linen I can't wait to return, and would recommend this hotel to friends

Great free breakfast with many breads  cakes, cereals, cheeses  cold meats, coffees, cocoa, juices (buffet style, but slow helpers). Friendly staff. Free wi-fi internet. Very good value for Italy.

<Content>Excellent Accommodations near train station The Alba is a gem! It's a short walk from the train station, although ongoing construction made it a bit longer. The lobby is pleasant, the dining room (breakfast included) is lovely, and the rooms are spacious by Italian standards: comfortable, clean and well-appointed. The desk clerks speak reasonably good English and are pleasant and helpful if you have questions. I really can't fault the Alba in any way. You can walk to the Duomo in about 10 minutes, and some fine restaurants (I recommend Buco Mario) are within 5 minutes. The complementary breakfast is nice enough; the usual assortment of croissants, yogurt, cereals, juices, coffee  sweet rolls. No hesitation recommending the Alba, even for pickier travelers.

<Content>Great Location The Alba Palace represents good value for money in a city (and country) where hotels tend to be over priced and of lesser quality. The location was great (minutes from the train station and all the major sights), the rooms were clean, a bit dated (except the televisions where were new and offered many channels), but the bathroom was a bit small (again typical of a small family hotel in most of Europe). Breakfast was ample and sufficient and the coffee nice and strong as good Italian coffee should be. The staff was friendly and offered good dining suggestions. The Alba is not luxury, but fit the bill and would be on my list for a return to Florence.

<Content>Good hotel in a good location My wife and I stayed here during a three day visit to Florence.Location is good with only a short walk to all the main attractions yet near enough to the railway station.The room was clean and although basic, it had everything we needed at a very affordable price. We booked direct and found this was cheapest. The room wasn't too small and was quiet even though we were at the front.The breakfast was fine, the location in the conservatory like room was very good. The staff being attentive and replenishing food and drink very regularly.Some people have mentioned the area as making them feel threatened? Neither of us felt at all uneasy and there are many restaurants in easy distance to wander to. Overall a good hotel and we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Helpful Staff I stayed at the Alba Hotel for 4 nights. It's a excellent hotel, really convenient from the station or the bus from Pisa airport which also stops at the station.( Make sure that you leave the station at the right as you look at the departure board). The walk to the the main attractions is only about 15 minutes, longer if you stroll down the lovely interesting back streets. The hotel staff were really helpful and friendly would stay there again. I was worried that Florence would be too hot in August but it was fine, when wandering the little streets and in and out of museums one doesn't notice the heat. If going to the Uzzifi make sure you book or if you don't there is a smaller queue at door 3 where you can book tickets for later in the day to save queuing for 3 hours.

<Content>sleepy traveller single travelers beware rooms are so very small but it seems comfortable at first but ask for a room not facing the street or you will no gett much sleep. Its not a great bargain if you dont even have space for your suitcase. staff did not care and or helpful in any way breafkast average terrible coffee and moved out after the second night. I booked 5 nights.

<Content>Good location Just returned from a trip to Florence. Hotel is clean, good location and was a cool haven in the heat. Staff very friendly, excellent venue if arriving by train. We found the location quiet and our room was overlooking the main street. I agree with other reviewers there are plenty of good value places to eat in the immediate area.

<Content>Above average hotel in a great location We stayed for 4 nights in Alba. It's in a great location, walking distance from the main train station (turn right and head for the Santa Maria Novella church) and also to the Duomo etc.Rather than trudging around all day looking for decent reasonable restaurants, turn right at the hotel entrance and make your choice from any in the street!! virtually opposite is a great pizza place with no cover and rip of charges.I was aware of street noise in the evening, one of the downsides of having street cafe's on your doorstep but it wasn't really a problem as such and I wasn't kept awake.The hotel was clean, air conditioned, fridge, tv.Nice breakfast in a lovely breakfast room. Staff were pleasant and helpful.The hotel does have internet access but the computer was so slow we gave up and used the internet cafe's around the corner.All in all a pleasant experience and would have no problem recommending to other travellers

<Content>Great Hotel We found this hotel online and it looked ok and seemed quite central. When we got there it surpassed our expectations. The hotel is really central near the main train station and is within easy walking distance of all the attractions in the centre of Florence. Our room was quiet with a view over the central courtyard. The breakfast provided was good and all the staff we very friendly and really helpful. I would certainly recommend this hotel and would definitely go back myself.

<Content>great family room The location of this hotel was perfect. Very close to everything you would want to see. You can walk everywhere.We had the family (quad) room that sleeps 4 people. It was awesome! The bathroom was huge, it was 2 stories with a double on the bottom and two twins on the loft. It had a lovely balcony facing the courtyard with the breakfast room down below.The breakfast was good.The only problem we had was navagating the one way streets to get there and we asked the staff for ice to chill our wine and they did not want to give us much at all. We felt weird having to keep asking for more and the man at the desk told us no. But we asked the maid and she gladly gave it to us.Overall a really good deal for what you pay for. I would definitely go again.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! The Hotel Alba is a fantastic hotel that exceeded our expectations! Very close to the train station and within walking distance of all major sights, the hotel was a great find. We were most impressed with our large room that included an upstairs loft and outside patio. The spa bathroom was extremely well-appointed with features that offered a nice respite after a long day of sightseeing. The free internet access and the hardy breakfast were an added bonus to our already enjoyable stay. Additionally, the staff were so courteous and accommodating, even assisting with museum reservations prior to our arrival. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend the Hotel Alba to my friends.

<Content>The Best Service The Hotel Alba is small, but charming in a convenience part of town. The rooms were clean, but sparse and the breakfast was certainly passable. What made this hotel special was the service. The front desk staff recommended the best restaurants, the set us up on a great Tuscany day trip that was much more unique and affordable than the usual tourist trips and most impressively they even found me a dentist. I would definitely recommend this property to anyone visiting Florence, especially for the first time.

<Content>Nice hotel, great locations This hotel is a stone's throw from the Florence train station and within blocks of the heart of Florence. Fine breakfast offerings, close internet use, easy to manage all tours. The street isn't gorgeous and of course the rooms are a bit small but clean and nicely appointed. There is an elevator!Staff was polite and helpful. Price reasonable.

<Content>Would recommend the Hotel Alba My husband and myself spent 5 days at the Hotel Alba and we were very pleased with the Hotel. The room had a spotlessly clean bathroom and the bed was very comfortable with the exception of the pillows which were replaced upon request. The Hotel has a great location very close to the train station which was close enough to walk to even with luggage. The breakfast room was charming with a lovely glass ceiling and the selection of breakfast food was decent, the friendly breakfast lady would even make you a cappacuino. I thought the hotel was good value for your money with a good location to explore beautiful florence

<Content>Great Hotel, would stay there again Hotel Alba was a great hotel and I would definitely stay there again. Florence is such a small city, you can walk to everything so this location was perfect because it was right by the train station and made getting in and out easy. The hotel room was very big for European standards and extremely clean. The shower was very relaxing and the bed and pillows were very comfortable! Continental breakfast was great too. Only small negative was that we went in April and they did not turn on the AC yet and there were no screens so the first night we left the window open and got attacked by mosquitos.

<Content>Will be returning to the Alba Hotel in Florence We thoroughly enjoyed every minute spent in Florence and Alba Hotel contributed to our fantastic time! Located on Via Della Scala, it was the perfect location, central to everything Florence has to offer. The staff were very polite, breakfast was the perfect start to each day and the rooms were beautiful! We will be returning to Florence and will definitely be staying at Alba Hotel again!

<Content>great price and convenient. We stayed at the Alba five nights in Oct. 2007 and we were very pleased. It's a ten minute easy walk to the duomo, and maybe another ten to the Uffizi. It was around the corner from both the train station and the bus station, so handy for trips to Rome and Siena. Took one cab from Pontevecchio/ Uffizi area to hotel which cost six euros.Our room was clean, a lttle noisy late at night (ask for court side)but we kept the windows open slightly, even in late October. The windows, when closed, kept most noise out. Buffet breakfast was great: nothing hot, but a variey of bakey, cheeses, cereals, juices, fruit, wonderful coffee. Free internet in a little room off the lobbey. The breakfast room has a glass ceiling and was really pleasant.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Stayed here in March 2008. I highly recommend this hotel. Staff is wonderful: friendly  helpful. Breakfast was more than adequate for our needs (fresh rolls and breads, jams, juice, fresh fruit, yogurt, meats and cheeses, cereals and milk, coffee, tea, etc). The rooms were small but spotless. We had two; one overlooking the courtyard (quiet and nice view) and one streetside (a little noisy at night but not bad). Close to the train station and walkable to all the sites.

<Author>Brit_USA_Traveler
<Content>Wonderful place to stay First let me say that this is a clean, convenient and very friendly hotel and if I went to Florence again I would definitely stay there. We stayed in two types of rooms. For the first two days we had my daughter with us and we were in a triple. The room was large, looked over the courtyard, had a lovely new bathroom (small) with heated towel rack, and a flatscreen TV. We were delighted. We then went off to Venice for 3 days (stored our luggage at the Alba) and came back to the Alba for 3 more days, but this time staying in a double. This room was also clean, lovely new bathroom, no heated towel rack, flat screen TV.... BUT it was on the road and it was very small. If you have ever stayed in a cruise ship cabin, it was about that size. Still, it was fine for us and the friendliness and position of the hotel, along with the nice breakfast in the morning, made up for a small room (we weren't there to sit in the room anyway).I keep saying the hotel is convenient and that is because it is a short walk to all the major site-seeing places and also just around the corner from the railway and bus station. The front desk staff were all very helpful and spoke very good English. The late-night desk man was incredibly friendly but didn't really speak English, but we always managed to get ourselves understood and ordered an early morning taxi and a wake up call with him, using broken Italian and English. The Alba has been totally refurbished, it is safe and provides a great ambiance. Highly recommend it to you all.

<Content>Give the Alba a try Lovely hotel. Very good value for money. Excellent location, approx. 5mins from the train and bus stations and 10 mins from the main sightseeing areas of Florence. We had a large, spotlessly clean, room at the back of the hotel on the 3rd floor, which was very quiet. The bathroom was a little small but was well equipped and there were plenty of soft white towels.The furnishings were attractive and there was the added bonus of a plasma screen t.v.Breakfast was served between 7 - 9.30am - a cold buffet with plenty of choice.The staff were very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Lovely place for a honeymoon We stayed at the Alba for 3 nights as part of our honeymoon. Great location, minutes from the train and bus stations. Lovely cheerful furnishings. Our room was on the top (3rd) floor and although the window faced the street and was above the main entrance, no noticeable noise. Bathroom not exceptionally large, but more than adequate. We had a laugh when I mistakenly pulled the lever to run the bidet (which is integral to the loo) rather than the flush - water everywhere so beware!. For breakfast, cold buffet was plentiful including cereals, yoghurts and various cold meats/cheeses and bread/cakes. Would definitely recommend this to older couples or those just looking for a base.

<Content>Excellent!! Would definetely stay there again! I have been to Alba this November. It has been an excellent experience. The location is very convenient, 5 minutes walk from the train station (SMN) and even less from the bus station (if you want to veisit nearby cities by bus). Also, my wife and I were able to walk to everywhere in Florence from there. During the night some people walking by may not seem so friendly but that is nothing to worry too much about. The room is great, new furniture, a plama tv, and excellent bathroom. We have booked in advance, getting a low rate so I assume this room was the standard one. Breakfast was equally good. Diiferent kinds of breads, juices , yogurts, besides the option to ask for a capuccino.They have a computer with free internet access in the main floor, that can be helpful if you want to check your emails quickly or simply browse the web.Finally, staff was very friendly since the minute we arrived, drawing us a map for the main attractions. They speak good English, what always helpful.If I visit Florence again, I will surely stay there and have already recommended this hotel to 2 poeple that are visiting the city in the next months.

<Content>Florence in November The hotel Alba is fully deserving of the praise given to it on Trip Advisor.Located just 5 minutes from the Central Station the Alba is in an excellent location both to arrive to and use as a base for sightseeing around Forence.The hotel is spotlessly clean, has helpful staff, has been recently refurbished and offers a good continental breakfast.Although rooms do not have a tea making facility, drinks can be obtained from a reasonably priced mini bar, or from the staff on reception (at a price).A free safe in the room is an added bonus.Florence is a Renaissance theme park with everything the serious artist, historian and tourist could wish for.Prices are higher than some Italian cities but meals etc are still good value. and there are several good informal restaurants near to the hotel.Try also the San Lorenzo market, good food and good fun!One tip , use a map rather than your instinct, despite everything being centrally located the streets are narrow and the buildings high making navigation by landmark difficult.

<Content>Lovely but Loud Alba is very convenient to the train station and to the sights. The hotel was lovely as was our room. The glass lift is fun, and the breakfast buffet was plentiful. But, there was no help from the staff with our luggage, the night staff spoke no english at all, and worst of all, there was raucous laughter and shouting until 2 am every night from the tavern right across the street. That really ruined things for us.

<Content>Just OK - but good location The Alba hotel was one of 4 hotels we stayed in on our 2 week trip to Italy. It was just ok.To begin, our room was on the first floor, right by the stair well, so the noise of fellow travelers woke me several times our first night (Wednesday). Our shower door was also broken and leaked water all over the bathroom floor. Thursday morning I asked the staff at the hotel if they could switch our room (prior to the weekend rush) and they would not accomodate us, nor offer any sort of apology. We even had VIP in our booking because our travel agent friend who booked our room there has stayed there before, and booked many other travelers there.While the capuccino was delicious the breakfast was very average. The breads etc. didn't even taste freshly baked. Honestly, the two things mentioned above wouldn't have mattered so much if the staff had been friendly. The only member of the front desk that was accomdating was they young man (I forget his name). The two women at the desk were very rude, and not helpful. One morning we had to take a bus to the airport to pick up a rental car, and the woman at the front desk didn't even know where the bus station was- or wouldn't tell us. We had to ask someone in a coffee shop nearby! When we came back to the hotel on our first night there to tell the desk about our shower door the older gentleman (who didn't speak english) handed my husband a mop and bucket as if he expected us to mop the water off the floor!The good thing about this hotel was its location, price, and the cleanliness of the rooms. I don't think I would stay there again, but if you are looking for a central hotel in Florence that doesn't cost a lot of money (comparitively speaking), and you are willing to deal with some quirks, this hotel is an option.

<Content>Love this hotel! We stayed at three great hotels during our Italy visit, but Alba Hotel was our very favorite. The location is fabulous, right in the middle of the city. It's a beautiful old hotel with great rooms, all kept spotless. Staff was welcoming and warm. We truly loved it here.

<Content>Don't judge this hotel from the outside! This hotel looks very average from the outside but don't let that fool you. On the inside the Hotel Alba is wonderful. We stayed here for three nights and it was great. There were four of us and we stayed in one the the hotel's quad rooms. It was beautiful! All brick and wood beams on the inside with a wonderful wrought iron staircase leading to the loft. There were two beds upstairs and two downstairs. The bathroom was in one word HUGE. Two sinks and a marvelous garden tub. The staff was very friendly and more than helpful in directing us to some local restaurants.The hotel is easy to find and only about a block from the train station. We had no problems getting over to Pisa for the day and shopping in the straw market is tons of fun! You can't go wrong by choosing the Hotel Alba for your stay in Florence!

<Content>Fantastic hotel Having read the reviews of this hotel on TripAdvisor they were some what miked. Don't be put off by the negative comments. This hotel is great. It is in a very central location, very close to all the main sights and very close to the train station. Myself and my wife stayed here for 6 nights. The room was good, maybe a little small but not bad. Cleaned everyday, the bathroom was quite large. Our room was on the back and very very quite. Breakfast was ok, never going to win any awards but if you don't fancy it there is a cafe 2 minutes away (turn right out of the hotel) which has wonderful food and coffee for breakfast. we even booked tickets on the Eurostar and went to Rome for the day (approx 2 hours) it was great. The staff on the reception desk all spoke English and were very helpful, I couldn't fault the place. Overall Florence is a great city and this hotel is in a great location. I woudl highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Nothing Special! Great if you're looking for convenience and nothing else! Hotel Alba is a very mediocre hotel. If you are looking for the convenience of being near the train station, then this hotel is ideally located. It is also close enough to the more charming parts of Florence to walk easily to the Museums, Duomo, etc.However, aside from location, the Hotel was a bit disappointing. The rooms were clean but small (even by European standards). The bathroom was tiny. A 'larger' person would not have been able to fit in the shower in our bathroom. We weren't bothered by the street noise. However, you could easily hear people in other rooms. The bed was uncomfortable. The TV 'sort of' worked.Breakfast in the morning was served in the Atrium. The Atrium was nice - but the breakfast was so-so. The staff were friendly. We mostly interacted with a gentleman who worked at night. He didn't speak a word of English - but seemed welcoming.Therefore, if you want to stay in an average, nothing-special, hotel near the train station, this hotel is a good choice. It didn't work for me because I do expect a tad bit more comfort staying somewhere.

<Content>The Definition of Average Stayed for 1 night to catch a train the next day. Room was on first floor facing street but street noise was not an issue. However, you could hear everything inside the hotel so we did not sleep well. Room (105) was tiny but this was not a big issue as we were only there for one night. I'm guessing the rooms above are much bigger and quieter but also much more expensive. Check in person not the friendliest at first but was helpful. The night desk person spoke as much english as I spoke italian but was much more friendly. Breakfast was good and dining area was very nice. The location from the station is the main draw to this place but considering the price you could probably do better.

<Content>Noisy area, paper thin walls The Alba Hotel is pretty easy to get to from the train station but I had a single room facing the street and it was hard to get sleep sometimes. One day I woke up early in the morning and looked out the window and a prostitute was trying to make a proposition. Also, the walls were so thin that I could hear a guy in the next room snoring and coughing! Single room is small and I think I have bruises from the shower. The breakfast was pretty good and the gal that makes the coffee was excellent. When I go to Florence again I will stay somewhere else.

<Content>So convenient We stayed several nights at Hotel Alba on our 25th anniversary trip. Our room was in the center of the hotel...window looked out onto central atrium. For this reason, it was VERY quiet, which we appreciated. The AC was also nice since it was warm, and we were near the stairs, so never took the lift. Our bed was very comfortable, we had reading lamps, minibar, tv, safe and good closet storage. The bathroom was very nice and well appointed, except that if one closed the pocket door all the way, one was trapped inside - I think it just needs a new roller! Judging from the sound I heard from upstairs one day, I think ours was not the only problem one.Breakfast very complete, with a lovely server. We especially appreciated the front desk staffer, Odoni, who spoke good English, gave great directions using a map, and had a lovely sense of humor. He also makes a great cappuchino. Yes, the area in general is VERY busy. The hotel is next door to the Pharmacia which was once owned by monks and the church. You can tour it and buy natural products there also. The several soaps, creams, etc. that I purchased are lovely.The hotel is only sort of around the block from trains and buses. This station felt a bit intimidating the first day, but not after we got our bearings. And...it was so easy to grab a bus for outlying areas such as Piazza Michelangelo, and the train to Siena. There is a tourist information center on the other side of the block from the train station too, next to Santa Maria Novella, which is well staffed. It is about 15 minutes to the Uffizi, Academia, Duomo....nothing too difficult. There is a laundromat just down the block, and a pharmacy two blocks away.The street was a bit busier than I would have liked, but for convenience and comfort, it can't be beat.

<Content>Mediocre Location was fine for access to all the sights. Our room overlooked the street which can become quite noisy in the evening and early morning. We put it down to the hustle and bustle of city life but one is sure that it could potentially annoy those less tolerant.The room itself was quite small and sparse. The yellow rag rolled walled was quite appalling as was the picture over the bed. One could see that the hotel was trying to achieve a rustic feel but it just did not work.All in all it is not a bad hotel to stay in. It is clean and the staff are friendly. Breakfast is fine and the atrium is quite quirky. It is however a hotel that you book with a view to being out most of the day.

<Content>Lovely Hotel Alba The Hotel Alba in Florence is right around the corner from the train/bus station. We arrived by plane and the bus to Florence is an easy and cheap way to get into town. It's easy to roll wheeled bags the two blocks to the hotel. Our room was ready and very pleasant. The bathroom was compact (to say the least!) but manageable. The entire hotel has recently been upgraded, so our room was fresh and well appointed. Small by American standards but large by European with good storage space. They have a large lobby with a bar that is well used in the evenings, Hotel provided a great breakfast buffet with a server constantly replenishing the meats, cheeses and coffee. It's an easy 10 - 15 minute walk to the main museums (Uffizi, Accadamia) and about 5 minutes to the River Arno, about a block to Ponte Vecchio.

<Content>Hotel Alba deserves rave reviews! Our party of 4 stayed in the first floor suite with 2 beds on the first level and 2 beds in an upstairs loft. The suite was extremely spacious by European standards, and came complete with lots of extra pillows and blankets.The bathroom was amazing. Double sinks, marbled tile, and a large jacuzzi tub with a spacious closed off shower. Very nice.Hotel Alba is extremely close to the train station, about 5 minutes walking distance for those coming in and leaving by train. Although this placed the hotel on the outer rim of the main part of Florence, everything was still within 15-20 minutes walking distance. The area is extremely safe and all 4 ladies felt comfortable here even at night.The continental breakfast was a grand start to each day and was laid out in a lovely atrium courtyard. The food was delicious and plentiful and the cappuchino was to die for!This was probably our favorite hotel of our 3 city tour that included Florence, Venice and Rome. We highly recommend this hotel for even the pickiest traveler.

<Content>Reccommend the Alba Just got back from our city break in Florence where we stayed 3 nights in the 3 star Hotel ALBA. It's an ideal place to stay for a few days. The hotel has undergone a complete refurbishment. Our room on the first was immacualate, well fitted and well equipped. The breakfast room is delightful. it sits in the courtyard of the hotel with a glass atrium overhead and a glass elevator to the upper floors sited in one corner. The hotel is about 3/400 yards from the station and all the main sights are walkable. We paid 拢153 for 3 nights(mon,tues,wed) and including a good continental breakfast table. Great value for money, highly reccommended.

<Content>Beautiful Florence We were originally booked into the Porta Faenza, but they had over booked themselves, so we were shunted into the Alba (even though we had booked in November for March, with little way of an apology, avoid, avoid The Porta Faenza).In the end we were very happy to be in the Alba, with an amazingly helpful concierge desk.The rooms are clean and plenty large enough, the breakfast room is gorgeous and the food and choice is lovely.We also loved the lift - you will see when you get there!The location is also really good, we were recommended by friends a couple of resturants across the river for our evening meal, and the hotel was close enough to the river to pop across and walk back via the Ponte Vecchio, beautiful in the evening.The hotel is in a very safe area.If you are planning a trip to Florence try and make time for a trip inside the Palazzo Vecchio next door to the Uffizi, it was by far the quietest place we went, so seems it is often overlooked, but is well worth a visit.

<Content>Great Value For Money Myself and three other ladies have just returned from spending two nights in Florence staying at the Hotel Alba, i spent alot of time on this website looking at hotels in Florence trying to choose one that would best suit our needs,cheap but cheerful. I wanted a hotel within walking distance of the Santa Maria Novella Railway Station as this is where the Terravision Coach drops you after catching it from Pisa Airport, excellent service which runs regularly, then a short walk to the hotel which was easy to find.Check in was quick and the staff were polite providing us all with maps and guides of Florence, first impressions of the hotel was clean and comfortable, we all said the lounge would be somewhere we would come back for a night cap and how right we were.A lift took us to the second floor, unique in that you travelled up the outside of the building with views over the covered courtyard where breakfast is served, not what you expected from the front of the hotel.Both rooms i had booked had twin comfortable beds, fridge, safe, lovely hot showers and double glazed windows not that noise was a problem and heating which was most welcome in February all for less than 85 euros a night per room, this also included breakfast which was ample to start the day which included cereal, juice, cold meats, rolls, lovely capuchinos, cakes and as much as you wanted, we thought it was wonderful and it set you up for the day in this lovely city.The hotel is within walking distance of all the major sites and more besides, we did not feel apprehensive about walking anywhere, it felt very safe.One recommendation i must give is for a restaurant we ate at called The Il Latini Restaurant which is not far from the Hotel Alba, recommended on this website it certainly lived upto all expectations. Typically Italian we couldn't understand the menu so the owner chose everything for us, wow my mouth is watering now just writing about it, the meal was perfect, the ques outside proving this is a popular place but we were not rushed and ended up staying for four hours and taking our time over every course, a hidden treasure, oh and the wine just made the night flow even better.All in all we couldn't have asked for a better base for our trip to Florence, good priced hotel, within walking distance of everywhere, even though it's not rated highly in the hotels of Florence please don't let this put you off as it's a little gem and we had a wonderful stay, we will definetly be going back.

<Content>463 steps a day but still made breakfast Thanks to Ryanair, my girlfriend and I arrived at Florence Station courtesy of the Terravision Shuttle at around 11am. The Hotel Alba was just a 5 minute trundle with our bags away and I arrived with the White Stripes' tune 'Hotel Yorba' playing on my mind's MP3 player. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by the English speaking receptionist who gave us a map of the city and relieved us by advising us our room was availabe in spite of our early arrival. Our room was satisfactorally spacious with a comfortably hard double bed, cavernous wardrobe, telly (with BBC World as well as CNN and MTV Italy) and bathroom. The bathroom had a shower rather than a bath, but that was nothing to quibble about. Our room overlooked the Via De La Scala but we couldn't see the perfumerie where Dr Hannibal Lecter bought the fragrance he sent to Clarissa Starling in the book/film 'Hannibal'.The room had a heater/AC and loads of extra bedding and the cheapest mini-bar in the world. The decor was yellow and would probably look better in the summer, but not off-putting at all. Florence is not the biggest of cities and all the main attractions were in good walking distance. Unfortunately on our first night it chucked it down with rain so we made a dash for the nearest trattoria, which wasn't the best, but the hotel provided courtesy brollies. On our return at night there was a genial old chap manning the reception/bar/front door who delighted in telling us the James Bond film he was settling down to watch was called 'Goldfingerie' (Goldfinger, I think) but Sean was sadly dubbed into Italian. The breakfast was a traditional Italian buffet, guaranteed to fulfill and proper coffeee was made freshly. The sun shone brightly on our second day, making this glass roofed courtyard a joy to sit in.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel with just one footnote. We were on the 3rd floor and the only access was by lift. It just made me wonder what the procedure would be in case of emergency.

<Content>Lovely Little Hotel We stayed at this hotel from the 3rd Feb for 2 nights after booking ridiculously cheap flights to Pisa with Ryanair. We checked tripadvidor reports before booking the Alba through lastminute.com for 拢100 BB.The journey from Pisa to Florence is easy and cheap - train or coach (we took the coach there, and the train back) both take about an hour and the scenery is beautiful, even in winter.The hotel is literally 2 minutes away from the train station (which is also where the coach terminates). The street isn't one of the prettiest in Florence by a long stretch and the area has a slightly insalubrious reputation - we didn't see or hear anything to confirm this though, and felt perfectly safe walking round late at night. The street contains numerous hotels so there are lots of other tourists around.The staff at the Alba are lovely - perfect English speaking which helps when your Italian is as poor as ours (although we did try!). The hotel is exactly like its published photos! Our room was ready from midday so we checked in nice and early. We were on the 2nd floor overlooking the street but it was quiet - we never heard any noise from outside or from adjacent rooms. The bathroom was small - no bath, but that's not a problem for us, especially on a weekend break. The hotel has recently been renovated and the rooms  common areas are impeccably clean and smart. Our only slight issue was the seeming lack of fire escape, although there was a boarded over doorway where it should have been - we came to the conclusion that we could have kicked it down easily in an emergency!Breakfast is served in the covered courtyard next to the foyer - simple but fairly extensive continental - ie. croissants, pastries, cheese, ham, yoghurt, cereal  fruit.Whilst in Florence, we walked through the Boboli Gardens, browsed the jewellery on the Ponte Vecchio, went to the Uffizi, visited the Santa Maria Novella, Duomo  Santa Croce churches, climbed the Camponile... and watched the 6 nations rugby...!! a stunningly beautiful city and the locals are every bit as chic as Paris - not surprising with the wealth of lovely clothes shops. The Hotel Alba is only a very short walk from the centre of Florence and its easy to find your way around. For food, we can recommend both Tre Marli and Baldovino's - lovely Tuscan food and great service at each. Baldovino's do a particularly tasty organic local Chianti. We also found a nice little cafe on the river near the Ponte Vecchio - great for a lunchtime panini in the sun.We took the train to Pisa before our return flight - apart from the religious quarter (leaning tower) there is little we could rave about here. We couldn't even find a nice restaurant to have an early dinner in and ended up eating at the airport (5 hours before our flight) out of preference.The only thing we didn't do that we had really wanted to on our weekend was see Michelangelo's David - note to all - the accademia is closed on Monday. Its just a very good excuse to go back to Florence though, and we will definitely stay at the Hotel Alba again.

<Content>great place Stayed at the Alba for two nights 3rd and 4th feb 07 with my wife. Having read the favourable reviews we were both very much looking forward to staying here. We werent to be dissapointed as it was a lovely hotel, very quiet, clean and friendly. The room was tastefully decorated with a large modern bathroom. the hotel is very near to the central bus/train station and is very easy to find. lots of good places to eat nearby with some good pubs too. we would definately stay here again if and when we return to this wonderful city.

<Content>I'd definately recommend it! What a fantastic hotel! Close to everything-we didnt use public transport of any kind for the entire stay. A literal 2 minute walk around the corner to The Santa Maria Novella and the main bus station. We arrived to Pisa airport with Ryanair and got a bus straight to the bus station with Terravision. We had no problem finding the hotel and checking in despite it being 1.30am.The staff are friendly and helpful. The breakfast was lovely, lots of cold meats, croissants, scones, cereal, yoghurt, juices, fruit etc. 7.30 to 9.30 ( a bit early for us but we managed it one morning) The room was a real surprise, we had been expecting something teeny but the second floor room we were in was gorgeous. I think it's actually the one that's in the website pictures. (Room 207 in case anyone is wondering) The perfect temperature, plenty of spare pillows, blankets and towels. Also the lift is beautiful and quite possibly new. We were a bit confused as to where the stairs was though. An overall excellent hotel. No faults at all.

<Content>Alba was great! We stayed in a four person suite for three nights in December. It was a perfect room for two adults traveling with two teenagers. The suite is located on the main floor. It was nice not to have to climb stairs or use an elevator. It was also close to the front desk and internet room. (Very convenient for homesick adolescents) The bathroom was very nice with modern fixtures. The beds were very comfortable. The girls loved the stairs up to the loft with two twin beds. The room was very quiet even though we were close to the breakfast room. Our king sized bed sleeping area did not have a window which made it very dark. The staff was very kind and helpful. We also liked the proximity to the train station as that is how we traveled to Florence. Yet, we also walked only a block to our car rental agency to head out of town. It turned out to be a great location for us. The walk to the Ponte Vecchio and Duomo were not far. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fanatastic little hotel Stayed five nights. Room 108 (opening onto street). Staff great. Cleanliness great. Breakfast great. Location brilliant. Would recommend it to others. People complaining about this hotel should go back and give it a go since the renovation work has been completed, they would be pleasant surprised. The city is marvellous.

<Content>nice hotel for the price Paid about $125 CDN per night via expedia. Close to the train station (walkable distance). Staff is very friendly and helpful. No free internet. Free continental breakfast was very good... with meat  cheese, fruit, cereal, buns. All tourist sites (markets, museums) are all walkable distance... bring good walking shoes! Rooms were very spacious, we had a newly renovated room and the colours were nice and everything was clean.

<Content>Great location, good hotel An very nice hotel. We stayed a week and found the location to be excellent, close to the bus/train station and an easy walk to restaurants and the sights of Florence. The hotel has recently had an update so the rooms, bathrooms and breakfast room are all in excellent condition. The rooms, while small, are clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and very helpful in recommending local restaurants. The Il Latini restaurant is close by and should not be missed. The hotel provides an excellent breakfast with a wide variety of cereals, breads, meats and cheese. Considering the location, rooms and price this hotel offers very good value.

<Content>Alba is Ace ! I stayed just for 2 nights at the Hotel Alba in May . However , I have stayed there on 2 previous occasions , December 2005 , for 3 nights , and December 2004 , again for 3 nights , this time with my [ then ] 10 year old daughter . The hotel is superbly situated being just 2 minutes walk from the bus station and only 300 yards along Via Della Scala from Piazza Santa Maria Novella . All the major sights are within easy walking distance and there are numerous good Osterie and Trattorie in the vicinity . [ I recommend Osteria Belle Donne for some authentic Tuscan fare and ambience ! ] . There are also some nice friendly pubs nearby - my favourite being Fiddlers Elbow  in the Piazza .In some guides you read that the area is a bit seedy . I have not found that to be accurate . I have been 7 times to Florence , often socialising in this area and have never felt unsafe or threatened in any way . The hotel itself is excellent value , not posh  but clean , comfortable , and with a friendly and helpful staff . [ Out of season it is worthwhile e-mailing to ask for prices as the hotel will often accept reduced rates ] .

<Content>Not What I Expected We stayed at the Alba Hotel in Florence for three days. I was very disappointed. It was not at all like the pictures shown on the Expedia website. The room was very shabby, the bedspreads were worn and torn although the linen was clean and the bathroom was also clean. The bathroom was so small you could not close the pocket door without feeling like you were in a small closet. The shower was so small you could not move around in it comfortably. The breakfast was the same thing everyday and the food was not very fresh. They did not have room service and everytime you needed something, you had to go to the front desk to get it. We kept running out of toilet paper because the rolls were so small and we had to go down to the front desk to get it all the time. The area of the hotel was convenient to all the sights and shopping and restaurants but you did not feel to safe at night since it was right near the train terminal. I will say that the staff of the hotel were very nice and helped with whatever questions we had. I definitely would not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Hotel switch in Florence We had originally been booked at another hotel in Florence but when we arrived to check in we were told that the hotel was full. Another room had been booked for us at their sister hotel: the Hotel Alba. The Alba turned out to be about 1.5 kms away but in a more central location in Florence and closer to the main train station (about a 5 minute walk). By the way, this train station is probably the ugliest building in Florence. The public areas and the rooms in the hotel are very clean. The room was not large but big enough to be comfortable. There are no views of the city centre from the hotel so you want to get out and walk around to see the sites. The staff was polite but did not seem knowledgeable about the local attractions, restos or shopping. In general, this hotel reminded me of a regular 3-star North American chain hotel. It lacked the individual charm of many other hotels in Italy. On a travel note, we were very disappointed with the Uffizi gallery. The entrance fee is expensive, the line-ups are staggering and the information about exhibits, artists and works are confusing or incomplete. I have been to many galleries and this was not one of the best in my opinion. On the other hand, the Pritti Palace is well worth the visit. The admission price is under 10 euros and the displays are well laid out and clearly marked. The gardens around the palace are superb and extensive. Also, there were no lineups and one could take one's time to visit the museum and the grounds.

<Content>Three positves, one negative Booked all of our hotels, based soley on trip advisor reviews. Proved to be highly reliable source. Alba Hotel --was our first hotel experience in Italy. 1) We were so pleased with the old world charm of this hotel Our two story room totally reflected its Tuscan location..2) Convenient location could not be beat, with affordable eateries just one minute walk's away. We felt safe.3. free internet -- our teenage son loved this!Negative: Very foul smell from plumbing one morning of our stay; however we plugged in room freshening gizmo thoughtfully placed on our desk (my engineer husband knew what this device was; I did not.) Problem solved. This olfactory problem would have caused some travelers not to recommend this hotel; however, it takes much to dishearten us..

<Content>Superb hotel in a lovely city We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Alba. The staff were very friendly and gave whatever assistance we asked for. We were given a free map and explanation of where to find things in the city.The large well appointed room had a balcony over the coutyard/breakfast room, with ample lighting, cupboards, drawers etc. the bathroom was superb with a double ended bath, shower, bidet, basin, loo and hairdryer.The housekeepers kept the room extremely clean every day.We experienced no smells or anything that would make us think twice about staying there again.

<Content>Good but be prepared We stayed 4 nights mid october. Although an airconditioned hotel the system is turned off when outside temperature is lowering. As the rooms are small (but efficient) and soundproofed the air gets stale rapidly and the room heats up, even when the fan is working. Opening the window is the solution but when your room is on the street side you will not sleep because of the noise.Ask for a room with window opening on the courtyard. In October mosquitos are present. Repellant is provided.Very friendly personnel, nice refurbishing. Hard beds as everywhere in southern europe. Good continental breakfast, good location.

<Content>Very central hotel The Alba is wonderfully situated for walking to all the sites in Florence. Staff are very helpful, but are not very up to date on transport queries, although they will look up information on the internet for you and print it out. The bar was very limited and local bars were not very friendly for 2 women travellers. Two very good restaurants in the same street more than made up for this.Rooms were clean and cosy, with a good bathroom, although the air conditioning did not seem to work.I would recomment that you ask for a room at the back, as the street noise was very difficult to sleep through. I would definitely go there again and would recomend it to anyone on a medium budget. We found all the bars and cafes as well as the museums in the city very good value.

<Content>Great place! We stayed at this great hotel for 3 nights at the end of Sept 2006. As other reviews have stated, the location is perfect....a few minutes walk from the train station, close to the major sites, Ponte Veccio and also had free internet access. We had a triple room (003), loft style with a huge jacuzzi tub in a room outside of the bathroom, great shower etc. The only negative was a musty smell in the room but we didn't spend much time in there anyway. We didn't find the staff to be overly helpful but we made do. I would also highly recommend the little resturant outside the hotel for lunch (La Grotta di Leo).

<Content>Utterly Wonderful! While most of the reviews for the Alba have been positive, I feel that none have gone far enough in its praise! I stayed here last week for three nights, and was completely charmed. As always when traveling alone, I fear the worst with single rooms, but mine was spacious, gorgeous, and immaculate--I mean, INSANELY clean!! I had a street-facing room on the 3rd floor which was completely quiet at night if the windows were closed. I heard nothing from anyone next to me or beneath my room--and I have extremely acute hearing.One of the best things was the bathroom, which is beautifully tiled and actually had GOOD light PLUS a magnifying mirror PLUS a wonderful shower. The walls were ragged or stippled yellow, giving a wonderful effect, and it was very light. The whole place felt much more spacious than your typical European hotel, including the breakfast room, reception area, and hallways. The glassed-in elevator would easily accommodate 10 and a boatload of luggage.No more than a 15 minute walk to practically anyplace (5 to the Arno)--and the wonderful Trattoria al Trebbio is 2 blocks away!I paid well under 100 Euro/night.

<Content>Scots in the Alba We recently visited Florence travelling from Scotland. The hotel had a good location, near to the station and a short walk to the Duomo. We had flown with Ryanair to Pisa, then bus to Florence, so it was great that the hotel was so near the station.The room was on the first floor, and overlooked the courtyard. The lift was absolutely tiny, big enough for two or one person and a case. The room was pretty big, with a large bathroom but no bath. The air conditioning was good and kept the room cool enough for our needs - being Scottish we're used to the cold! The room was kept spotlessly clean and towels changed each day. The only downside was the noise levels. The floors were laminate wood which meant noise travelled easily from floor to floor, and the walls must have been quite thin too. Facing the courtyard meant there was no noise from the street which was good for those who like a good night's sleep.Breakfast was in the covered courtyard and was pretty good. My husband loved the pots of coffee and steamed milk each morning and said they were very good. There was a great selection of meats, cheese, rolls, croissants, cakes, cereals and juices - just what you need to fill you up before a hard day sight-seeing.The front desk were very helpful, and provided a map with good information on what to see if you have a short time. All the staff were very friendly. We liked the piazza at the covered market, it was an ideal place to people watch over a drink or some lovely food. The market itself is also good for food gifts - packeted pasta etc, or for some nibbles for your room.The shopping is very good in Florence - better than Rome, so ladies bring an extra suitcase for all the leather products. I would reccomend the market at St Lorenzo which has lots of stalls selling leather bags, gloves etc No need to haggle as the prices are fixed, although do ask for the best price as you may get an extra 15/20 euros off like I did!!We enjoyed our trip and would return to the Alba which was good value for money

<Content>Wish we had stayed longer! We loved Hotel Alba!!! It was difficult to find as we had never been to Florence and drove from the airport. The signs listing where to turn for groups of hotels were no help as the text is too small. But we eventually figured out how to get on that one way street. The hotel is very close to the train station and a few blocks from the Arno River. There are many other hotels in the area and always lots of people around. One word of caution, if you go to the laundromat down the street, do your own laundry or be prepared to get a bag of wrinkled clothes back. Hotel Alba has a parking agreement with a garage 1 block away for 20 euros per day, but you can park for less at the train station. The hotel appears to be getting upgraded, there was construction in the courtyard. The room we had seemed brand new, was huge by European standards (especially the bathroom) and had a small terrace that faced the courtyard which was great since we were not there during the day to hear the construction but were not awaken by street noise in the morning. There is central AC which worked very well. The breakfast was good and plentiful. Staff is very nice and allowed us to leave our luggage there even after we checked out. We ate at Maso restaurant a few blocks away, and they have the best spaghetti carbonara I've ever tasted! The Ponte Vecchio is around the corner for a nice stroll after dinner. Of course, there was delicious gelato everywhere. We would have stayed longer but they were booked due to a fashion show in the city. It is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel to major attractions like the Duomo, Piazza della Signoria, and Santa Croce. We would highly recommend Hotel Alba for its comfort, location, and value.

<Content>quiet and lovely in the heart of Florence! I have been trying to remember the name of this hotel and was so happy to find it on this site! I stayed here with my two daughters a few years ago. I had read about it in a travel book. It was reasonable and close to the train station. I thought we'd just stay there one night, then look for another place. I was surprised to discover how quiet and peaceful it was! I'd always heard how noisy Florence was in the city and was advised not to stay there. Our room opened onto an interior courtyard, so the only sound we heard was the tinkleing of silverware as they prepared for the morning breakfast (which is included). We ended up staying there the entire time. It's not a super fancy hotel, but it's very nice with high ceilings and velvet drapes, tiled floors and nice antiques. It's pretty centrally located (about 800 meters to the Duomo and Ponte Vecchio) and very reasonably priced for Florence! Enjoy!

<Content>Good Hotel, Remeber your Key! Hotel Alba definitely met our needs in Florence. It was a great value for the price, although the location was not as convenient as we had expected. It's about a 10 min walk from the major attractions, but conveniently close to the train station - we didn't want to try to find a taxi. The room was small but clean and comfortable, and the breakfast was excellent. One thing to remember - turn in your room key! The hotel is locked after a certain time (10pm?) and if you take your key with you, they assume you are in your room! We had to wake up the bellman one night. They were very understanding, but I felt terrible about it!

<Content>Great Hotel! We stayed at the Alba for four days in May and I honestly can't fault it. It's on a quiet road within easy walking distance of all the major sights and plenty of restaurants. The staff are friendly and helpful, it's spotlessly clean and there's a good selection for breakfast. It's also prettily decorated, it was very refreshing to come back to our cheery yellow room after a hard days sightseeing. Add to that a safe in the room and a reasonably priced mini-bar and I can definitely say that we'll be going back to the Alba if/when we return to Florence.

<Content>Does the job well Just returend from a extended trip to Italy. Stayed in Florence at this hotel. It was great. Clean, safe, breakfast was good if you like cereal, yogurt, juice, etc. and the staff was fantastic. Easy to find from the train station and location is great. The room was well done. We'd return.

<Content>alba the greatest We thouroughly enjoyed our stay of five nights at the Alba. The staff were very courtious and gracious, all spoke english and were more then willing to help in any way they could.The rooms were spotlessley clean with a lovely bathroom and very comfortable bed.We started each day with a very good breakfast and went on to explore this beautifull city. The he hotel is situated on a quiet street, which is like an oasis of calm after the bustling city centre.All the major tourist attractions are within easy walking distance of this great little hotel. We would highly recommend this hotel and we will most definitley return there.

<Content>Good Value for Money We stayed for three nights and were pleasantly surprised, by the services received from the hotel.Breakfast was a cold buffet and had a good choice.Staff were all very pleasant and friendly.The room was a good size and clean and looked like it had been recentley refurbished.The window was very good at keeping the noise out from the busy road, but not all the rooms are street facing.Over all i would recommend this hotel as it was clean ,friendly and well situated for the station.

<Content>Fabulous hotel! I stayed at the Hotel Alba with my boyfriend, Mother and Brother in March 2006. This hotel was fantastic! All of our rooms were spotless and very comfortable. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the location was perfect, less than 5 minutes walk from train station and 10 minutes to Il Duomo. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, it was fabulous!

<Content>Excellent Value This hotel is very central, right next to the Santa Maria Novella station (5 min walk). The room was clean and the bathroom was immaculate. We hired a car from Pisa airport; the hotel offered a valet garage parking service for about 21 euros per day for a small car. This meant that we didn鈥檛 have to spend ages trying to find a non residential car park space. Plus they brought your car to the front within ten minutes of requesting it. Breakfast isn鈥檛 great but for the price, location and friendly staff. I definitely stay here again.

<Content>Here is Help We regretted leaving this simple hotel for Villa Casagrande because it represented what we were looking for, indeed, expected in Italy.The hotel was casual with clean rooms. Yes, the bathrooms are immaculate.The staff was gracious and friendly. It was a pleasure to greet them for breakfast in the morning. They made it seem as if they were genuinely pleased to see us.Tip: The rope in the shower is to pull in case one becomes ill in the shower. It is not a vent rope as I thought it might be. The staff, to my embarassment, checked it out.

<Content>Satisfactory for a Basic Hotel I had reserved my three nights at another hotel but was bumped upon arrival to the Alba due to supposed mechanical problems. The Alba is completely satisfactory for a basic tourist hotel but seemed somewhat bland, with few distinguishing characteristics. The room was clean and well-serviced. The buffet breakfast was typical and adequate. The hotel is a bit on the edge of tourist Florence so a walk almost anywhere is required. But Florence is a small city and this was not a problem. If other preferences were not available I'd consider staying there again but with no great enthusiasm. I don't think you'd be disappointed with the Alba but neither do I think you'd be bowled over.

<Content>fantastic hotel I think that compared to other three star hotels the Alba is very good value for money. The rooms were very nice, clean, comfortable and not too small. We didn't have any trouble with loud noises as other reviewers commented. We particularly liked the courtyard area where they served breakfast. At first glance the location may seem slightly out of the way but it is actually in a nice area, not in the really touristy part of town but not too far away from the centre. It was also near some really lovely restaurants, our favourite was the Tratoria 4Leoni. Above all though the service was the best part of this hotel. The receptionist was incredibly helpful, giving us suggestions on what to do and telling us which restaurants were closed for the summer season. Thanks to his suggestion we even had a day trip to the beach which we hadn't thought would be possible. I would definately stay there again.

<Content>Fantastic Service with a Smile The service at Alba is superb. From the moment we walked in, we felt welcome. The receptionist provided us with extensive information about the city and was there to answer all of our questions. He even recommended excellent, non-touristy restaurants in the area and gave us tips on avoiding the lines to museums. The room was clean and decorated nicely, just as it appears in the pictures on its homepage. The hotel is close to the train station, but it is in a clean neighborhood, and a 5-10 minute walk away from all of the attractions. Overall, I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>good value - would recommend For the price ($115) it was definitely a great place to stay. My wife and I stayed there with another couple traveling in Florence for the first time. We were extremely pleased. The breakfast (I'd describe it as continental) was a good way to start of the day and helped save some more money.The location is average. Its close to the train station if you're arriving/departing via train. We were there only a couple of days, but it seemed most of the sights were in the center and eastern side of the city while Alba is more on the western side of the central area. Don't get me wrong though, its ALL within walking distance and we didn't take a single cab or bus.Bottom line - on a budget, its a great place to stay with a friendly staff.

<Content>Great Value I was a little leery about the Alba because it is so close to the train station, but my husband and I were pleasantly surprised and would stay there again. Very clean and quiet with a helpful staff. They booked us a day trip to Siena and San Giminiano, which was wonderful. Hotel Alba is a short walk to all the sites and near some excellent restaurants. Be sure to try 13 Gobbi, on Porcelana. It was awesome!

<Content>I would stay here again. I enjoyed my stay at Alba. It was very convenient to bus and rail transportation and only a short walk to all of the sights. Several internet and telephone shops are right down the street. Yes, there is at least one noisy Irish bar on the street nearby. Earplugs would be recommended for light sleepers. The room was kept tidy by the house staff and the bathroom was clean and cozy. The desk clerks were very helpful during my stay and all spoke English. The Italian breakfast was a treat to wake up to. Each morning I started my vacation on a full stomach courtesy of the Alba. They are doing a lot of renovation next door and it appears as if the hotel will be expanded in the near future. I would stay at Hotel Alba again.

<Content>Average Considering how expensive the hotels in Florence are, this one was decently price for what it was. (Keeping in mind how much more expensive all the other ones are). The staff was very nice and helpful. It was walking distance from many places. My sister and I walked everywhere. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The bathrooms were surprisingly spotless. The walls were a little bit thin however, so we were able to here a man coughing himself to death every night. The night guard was an extremley sweet man, he opened the door to us when we would get in late. I would say to just bring some ear plugs because there is one or two noisy bars on the street, and bringing ear plugs will help you sleep better. And dont forget to go to Vivoli, they are famous for the Gelatto and trust me, you want to go there.

<Content>Great little bolt hole We found it to be very clean and friendly. Perfect location for doing the sites around the centre of Florence. Not the newest or swankiest hotel around, but great value for money given the location. There is also a very good value little restaurant a few doors down.

<Content>Not bad for the price We only stayed one night in 11/04 but the location was very convenient. The bathrooms are tiny but it's a clean hotel with friendly staff. The stairs are freakishly narrow and the elevator holds 2 people so getting your luggage up and down requires some planning. Throw the luggage on and push the button, then climb the stairs and meet it at the top! It's a small place but I'd go back.
