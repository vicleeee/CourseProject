<Content>Nice stay in Sydney Had already checked in in another hotel but it was so bad that we decided to check out, Tired and disappointed we found Holiday Inn and went to the front desk to make enquires. The staff were attentive and very nice, and we got a room with a harbour bridge(and operahouse) view. The rooms are a bit old-fashioned but OK. As everything else is good as breakfast , location etc, we walked a lot and it was very easy by train and bus to Bondi beach, and the great staff I can highly recommend this place.

<Content>Very pleasant stay I recently returned from my Sydney trip and want to write my review while the experience is still fresh in my mind.After more than 20 hours of flights, I arrived in Sydney in the early morning jet-lagged and tired. After inquiring, I was directed to a bus outside that took us to the Central CityRail station free of charge. From there, I took the CityRail to the Kings Cross station. It turns out the Holiday Inn is less than a 30-seconds walk after getting out of the station. Really could not be closer or more convenient.It was 1030 in the morning and I was expecting to just drop off my luggage and returning later to check-in. Kimberly, working the front desk, immediately checked and told me that my room was ready for me. What a surprise and without prompting on my part. Also without any prompting from me, she asked if I would like a late check-out as late as 2 PM. Wow! Then I was asked for my newspaper preference in the morning. Maybe from a 5-star property but I didn't expect this from a Holiday Inn.So I checked in to my room at 1030 AM. Even though my room was only on the 2nd floor, I had a nice view of the Harbor Bridge and the Opera House. I imagine the view from the upper floors would be even better. Definitely get a room with the harbor view rather than the street view. Later that night I heard noises and looked out the window to see a fireworks show near the Harbor Bridge. Another nice bonus surprise.The room itself was spacious and clean with modern furnishings. If I want to nit-pick, the carpet had some stains. O/W I was pleased with everything else.I went downstairs to look for the business center and could not find it. Went looking down the wrong hallway and asked a cleaning lady who then walked me all the way to the computer terminals, she didn't just give me directions or point to its location. How's that for service. It costs A$5 for 15 minutes (or 30 minutes, I can't remember now).There was a small gym in the hotel but ask for the free pass to FitnessFirst that is located kind of kitty corner from the hotel. It's part of a chain of fitness clubs in Australia and has a nice variety of equipment. It's less than a minute walk from the hotel if not for the slow signal at the intersection.There was a restaurant in the hotel which I did not try but it looked nice. There were plenty of eating places nearby and with the CityRail station essentially right underneath the hotel, you could get all over the city easily.The hotel is close to the club area of Darlinghurst but I felt very safe. It's a bit more crowded and rowdy at night. Families with young children would likely avoid that area anyways. The immediate area surrounding the hotel and the short walk from the hotel to the CityRail station is perfectly safe for families.Every one of my multiple interactions with hotel staff resulted in prompt, friendly, courteous service.Overall a great experience and would definitely recommend.

<Content>great location We were quite pleased with the location - easy access to trains downtown and walking distance to restaurants, shops, pubs, and cafes. Knowing very little about Sydney when we booked the trip, we were drawn to the good reviews and views. Since we were staying for over a week, we were upgraded to a room with a view and what a view it is! We frequently grabbed a quick breakfast with coffee at Joe's on Victoria. Great coffee less than a block away! The restaurants in Potts Point are close enough to walk to and the food is excellent - try Opium Den for some really great Thai! We walked to Newtown and the Mall on more than one occasion. It's a lovely walk through Hyde Park. We will likely stay here every time we go to Sydney. It's such a great location and we didn't find the Darlinghurst area to be sketchy at all. It's a nightclub area so it attracts a rowdy crowd on weekends but it didn't seem dangerous. The hotel is bright and clean with excellent amenities - a gym, laundry, and adjoining cocktail lounge and restaurant. A great deal!

<Content>Beware of the noise! The location of the hotel is fantastic. Right on a train line, Kings Cross. It sits at the intersection of Victoria and Darlinghurst. These streets cross in a X fashion. The south part of Victoria has quaint restaurants that will satisfy any taste buds. As you cross over passed the hotel the street turns more into backpackers paradise with cheaper accommodations but is really nice. Darlinghust is another story. It has nightclubs, strip clubs and fast food. The doors to all these places are open and the music blasts out onto the street. It gets quite seedy in this area and one that I found unsafe. Young people flock to this area for nights of drinking. The noise was incredible which starts at 9 and ends about 4 in the morning. For some unknown reason, I never saw any police in this area, which it surely needed for crowd control.I was one of the unlucky hotel guests that has a room facing the street. I couldn't sleep because of the noise. It just went forever, regardless of the day and I stayed for five days. I asked the staff to move me to the back of the hotel, which they did and I then had the greatest time. The new room was practically silent and I had a view of the Opera House and Harbor Bridge. The view was a ten out of ten. The hotel is clean, the staff were one of the best in the hotel business but maybe because Australians are extremely nice and friendly. They truly make this hotel a great place to stay. The bed was great with lots of pillows. Heating and air conditioning worked great (we needed both during our stay.) I never went to the restaurant but it looked very nice. All in all the hotel looks renovated and is quite stylish. The room rates were unbelievably good which is a plus. If you are young and like crowds and clubs, this would be a great place to stay. If you are passed that stage in your life and want a quieter stay, make sure you ask for a room with a view and this will ensure you are far from the street and the noise. If it weren't for the noise, which is not the hotels fault, it would be getting a much higher rating.

<Content>Caring staff Stayed at hotel on Halloween eve. Although was noisy outside, quiet in room as was at back of hotel, looking out on to courtyard. Very nice room, good quality furnishings-- much better than I had expected.Exit from Kings Cross station is just a few steps from the hotel, so very convenient if using train. A lot of places to eat down Victoria Street, but Darlinghurst Rd around the corner can be a bit daunting if you are not expecting it!! But it is not unsafe.We didnt arrange breakfast at hotel and decided to have breakfast at a cafe along the street. After receiving a coffee and waiting 30 mins with no breakfast appearing we returned to hotel as thought had to check out 11am (now 10.30). Had a look at breakfast at hotel but they were starting to clear buffet. Maria at bar very helpful. Offered to stop clearing buffet for us. When we declined, she suggested a good place along the street, suggested we ask at desk for later checkout (which we did - 1pm) and was really helpful. Staff at desk also very helpful. We felt they went beyond the usual help. Would stay there again.

<Content>Ecellent Location and Accommodation We stayed for 5 days in October and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves - it looks like the hotel has been upgraded with a new bright entrance, comfortable rooms and helpful staff, We found many good breakfast places nearby (the hotel breakfast is reasonably priced but we wanted to experience Sydney as much as possible) and lots of good restaurants nearby for the evening. We would definitely stay here again..............

<Content>Queens Birthday Weekend We stayed here for 5 days during the Queens Birthday weekend decided on this hotel because of the excellent reviews it had received and the location. I had requested a city view room when I booked but we arrived so early in the morning all they had available was a room on the first floor, clean and comfortable but with only a view of the neighbours tin rooves I went back to front desk and informed the attendant that we had booked the room a couple of weeks in advance and that my wife and I were having a bit of a get away so we'd really like something a few floors up with a nicer view. They were a little reluctant at first (Queens Birthday weekend so they knew the bookings would be coming in) but with a little pressing Sebastian the attendant came through for us with a room on the 5th floor. Again very clean and comfortable, even the matresses were comfy.Had breakfast and great coffee at La Bouvette a chiq little cafe just over 5 mins walk down Macleay Street from the hotel. The barista there is an Austrian bloke and he makes the best coffee. There's a Coles supermarket across the road from the hotel which was good for our bottled water. Hotel is close to the train station it's only 2 stops to Town Hall which takes you to the heart of the Sydney CBD and shopping district but if you're in a walking mood it's an easy stroll to the city and you can take in the sights of Woolloomoloo harbour and the Botanic Gardens along the way. If you get hungry while walking stop at Harry De Wheels cafe and have one of his famous pies topped with mash, peas and gravy or hot dogs with chilli con carne and hot sauce ... awesome. Lots of great cafes and restaurants nearby as well as pubs and clubs for the party goers. Don't forget to try Anderson's ice cream it's in the Cross.Also recommended Il Barretto Italian restaurant Surry Hills, check out Newtown a cool and funky place with a slightly alternative edge ... and if you see him say hi to my cousin Steve hehehe.

<Content>Conveniently located and great views if you are in Sydney for a week If you're going to be there for a week or so they'll probably give you a room with a view. If not I recommend you make sure to ask for one. Internet is ridiculously expensive and slow but the rest is cool, close to downtown and Potts Point. Don't be fooled by the name, it's actually in Kings Cross. I will be back though, it's a nice place and breakfast is good and the price is almost ok if you're spending Euros.

<Content>Very Comfortable Hotel I have stayed at this hotel many times and have always found the rooms very comfortable with great beds. The Harbour view rooms generally provide an great view of the city, opera house and harbour bridge. Excellent buffet breakfast available. Easy access from airport on the local train service with Kings Cross station directly below the hotel.

<Content>I enjoyed my stay here Stayed here for just one night, but enjoyed it. Check in staff very nice, rooms basic but comfortable, no views to speak of but oh well. Right next to the metro station at Kings Cross, but the neighborhood is nothing exciting. The restaurant at the hotel is good and has a nice wine list, there are also a couple bars across the street if you want a nice cold beer at a good, non-hotel price. I would stay here again for sure, but there are still other places (and areas) I would prefer.

<Content>Excellent location. Holiday Inn has a great location. It is in the centre of Kings Cross. So if you like the nightlife then this is the place for you - so convenient and easy to get home to. If you're after relaxation then I would skip this place, despite being quiet. The rooms are quiet, large and the clean. A very pleasant stay. Staff are extremely pleasant and helpful. The hotel is secure and has many facilities. Breakfast buffet looks good, but being in the middle of Kings Cross you have so many options. There are plenty of small cafe's close all offering full breakfasts. So spoilt for choice. The prices range, so there is a good selection for all types.

<Content>Great location Great value Top spot, right price, nice place.I've stayed here a number of times over the years and always found it to be a well-run hotel.In about 2000 it was where the top bands for the Big Day Out stayed so it's a decent place.One thing I would watch out for - if you check in after midnight the staff seem to make you pay well above the advertised rate.One night I went to the desk and asked the price. Two hours later I came back with my bags and the price for a room had jumped $60.

<Content>Great location, good value We stayed here for 2 nights in July 2007. Our room was on the first floor of the (older?), low-rise wing, facing onto Victoria Street, but we were not disturbed by traffic noise. The room and bathroom were comfortable and appear to have been recently updated. While some previous reviewers have commented on the salubriousness of the area (or lack thereof), we found as long as we ventured south down Victoria Street (turn right when you leave the hotel) we didn't come across any sights unsuitable for our 6-year old.We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, but on Victoria Street I wouldrecommend Malabar (Indian cuisine) for dinner, and the excellent Tropicana Caffe for breakfast. With our jet lag, we really appreciated that they could serve us delicious 'flat whites' and hot croissants at 6am!

<Content>Good value Arrived here at 6 am after 36 hours travelling fully expecting to wait until 2pm to get a room. However, we were given a room immediately. Unfortunately, the room was on the top floor underneath what must have been the air conditioning system the noises coming from it were loud and persistent! We asked to change rooms and this was done with the minimum of fuss and were were upgraded to a room with a view of the harbour for the rest of our stay 17 nights! It appears to be one of the cheapest Holiday Inn hotels but doesn't lackin quality. For us as walkers the location was near enought to walk to anywhere in the city but if you are not it's right next to the station. Kings X can be quite sleazy but we never felt in any danger here.

<Content>Great Hotel We travelled with friends and requested rooms with a view. Our rooms were good and had fantastic views of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. The area around the hotel is 'interesting' with a good choiceof places to eat within walking distance. It's just around the cornerfrom Kings Cross rail station and within walking distance of all major tourist attractions. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and if I was lucky enough to visit Sydney again I would headstraight back to this hotel.

<Content>Good value for money, great location We have stayed here before and this time were given a city-side room. At the price we paid it is luck of the draw but the city-side rooms are slightly larger than Victoria Rd side I think. And the view was pretty good (higher floors are better). Hotel seemed lightly booked, given it was a public holiday long weekend, probably due to the wild weather, which may be why we got city-side rooms for the lower price. A lot quieter this time - previously we got a room near the lifts  it was noisier.As others mention, location is a big plus for this hotel. Right above Kings Cross Railway Station and within easy walk of lots of restaurants. We didn't walk far this time due to weather but used trains. Of course, not far (50 metres) from the start of theentertainment strip of Kings Cross, which is either a plus or a minus depending on your perspective - easy to avoid if you aren't interested.We left our car in their garage until 1pm after checking out (no additional parking fee - just the fee for the time we had been booked in), went back into city for some additional shopping time.Check in and check out was uneventful, staff helpful and friendly.The value for money of this hotel, proximity to CBD, access to trains and ease of getting there from main expressways make it a regular winner for us.

<Content>Good value, location, but not kid friendly area I would recommend this hotel for everybody except those with small children. The area immediately around the hotel is not child friendly--homeless, pan handlers, adult oriented businesses, etc. No big deal, but it should be taken into consideration. Very mild by red light district standards, but it might make some uncomfortable.Spent 4 nights with a city view which is great. Study CityRail website (Sydney's light rail system). I used it to and from the International Airport--great, but realize it is very crowded during rush hour. I was OK with my bags, but can I can imagine some might be challenged manuvering their bags during rush hour.In room HiSpeed Internet access via LAN cable was AU$29.95/day. Being expected to pay is not unheard of, but that is about 3 times the going hotel rate. I did not pay. Room was great. Suprised there was no international news broadcast channel (CNN, BBC, etc) offered. I like to walk, so I was able to walk to Sydney Opera and all major tourist areas within 25 minutes. If not, CityRail is accessible via Kings Cross station which will take you to any major location but will require at least one transfer.

<Content>Enjoyed our Stay at Holiday Inn After 10 days of camper van, this Holiday Inn was a welcome luxury at a reasonable price. The Hotel is just 30 meters from the train station exit (Kings Cross). We were checked in early into a very clean, roomy and well appointed room. No hassles, everything went smoothly. The bathroom was nice and large which is very helpful since there were 2 adults and 2 children. Lots of TV channels to keep our 3 year old occupied for a while. The beds were outstanding, very comfortable. We loved the location. Steps from Kings Cross Rail station, near many cafes and restaurants of various prices. We did not find the so called 'red light' district along Darlinghurst Road a problem. But if you wish to avoid bums and backpackers simply don't walk down that street. Walking Victoria street was a beautiful way to see the local neighborhood.

<Content>harbour views were good The hotel was ok and staff were efficient. It is a typical chain hotel - little character. the rooms have all you would expect to have for the price. I was shocked when asked to pay for internet access. even the backpackers places were offering free internet access. The hotel was asking for 5-10 aus dollars - thought that was over the top. also hotel location is right over Kings Cross station. However Victoria Street is fine and can recommend Roy's for eating in!

<Content>Perfect for me I stayed 15 nights at this hotel for a business trip. I recommend that you do everything you can to get a harbour view room as, like a previous reviewer has written, the view is stunning and is a great way to wind down after a days work by drinking a cold beer looking at the view and watching the sun go down. Alternatively, sit in the bar and watch the Virgin Blue cabin crew checking in for a different kind of view! Facilities wise the hotel meets all the requirements and I found the staff very helpful for any question. It's ideally suited to get to the CBD and the shopping areas (20 minute walk or 5 min train journey to Martins Place an Town Hall (Kings Cross station is right next door). I will definitely stay here again should I return to Sydney.

<Content>Stunning view We spent 2 nights (2-4 Dec) in one of the Grand View Queen rooms. You cannot put a price on the view of the Opera House/Bridge whilst sipping a drink in bed!!! The location of the hotel is about a 20 min walk into the parks and main attractions of Sydney. There are some good eateries along Darlinghurst Road. The train station is in front of the hotel. The room was well presented and kept very clean. The buffet breakfast was ample and a good start to the day. The staff on breakfast duty were amongst the friendliest we had come across during our stay and paid our young daughter alot of attention. This was our second time staying here, our first being several years ago whilst on the backpacker trail, we just needed to spoil ourselves with clean sheets back then! We did notice a difference between this hotel and the Old Sydney, particularly the staff overall, the 'Can Do' attitude and overall atmosphere was missing here. The hotel cannot be faulted but the Old Sydney is the one for us.

<Content>Holiday Inn great view Its pretty well close to all attractions,we walked to the Sydney Aquarium its about 2 kil.but very scenic,throu Hyde park and on to Market street increidilbe shopping and plenty of food to choose from.KIngs cross is at the corner on Darlinghurst st. an amazing street to walk,tourist shops,pizza,ice cream ect..The hotel can be noisy at night,do not stay on the side were the train station is,ask for the restaurant side.The music was so loud the first night we were there,did not sleep at all,after an international 21 hour flight.the next day they upgraded us to the other side,its like 2 different hotels,it was great!The food is very good in the restaurant,breakfast is tasty buffet and reasonable.They make great flat white coffee.The train station ,well, is very close like I said,so travel is easy,Bondi beach is not far,nor is walking to Market street a good twenty min. .The airport will cost you $35. by taxiregardless of what is written,shuttlebus is the best option $8.00.There ia a cheap internet cafe close by$4. an hour,rather than the hotel is alot more.I stayed there with my son and found it to be safe area,even at night,for the money its worth it,compared to other hotels,it would been nice if there was a microwave in the rooms.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at Holiday Inn Potts Point I stayed at the Holiday Inn in May this year with my husband and son, at the start and end of our holiday. We had an enjoyable stay. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and our room was spacious, even if it did not have such a good view. We were given a room at the back of the hotel away from the busy road. We ate out locally the first few days and then tried out the restaurant in the hotel for the last few nights. We were pleasantly surprised as the food both for breakfast and evening meal was very good and reasonably priced compared to some places we have stayed. Children eat free for both breakfast and evening meal, there is a childrens menu in the evening which you can choose from. They are also given coloured pencils so that they can draw on the paper tablecloths that are on each table, meaning that they do not get bored inbetween courses - a brilliant idea! Our son had great fun drawing all the things that he had seen that day. I would just mention that the hotel is not in Potts Point. It is in Kings Cross, right next to the station. Luckily we did not have any noise from the station, and it was very convenient for getting into the sights. It was also not far to walk with sore feet after pounding the pavements all day! Would recommend that you take a taxi from the airport - approx $35 for us, as the train cost about the same and involved a change of line, hassle you can do without when you are dragging suitcases around!If you wish to use the internet would advise you go to the backpackers travel agent across the road to the left of the hotel. Cost $1 for 20 mins, whereas the hotel was $5 for 15 minutes.

<Content>Fantastic service - beautiful views Walking out from the adjacent underground train station into the leafy Potts Point was a delight. There were plenty of restaurants and great shopping just a short walk away.The hotel itself is a very clean, smart hotel. The staff were very friendly and really wanted to help. (A very rare trait for some hotels) However the great feature of this hotel were the views of the Opera House and Harbour from my room. In the daylight they were spectacular but as the lights came on into the city night the views were just beyond amazing. I have lived in Sydney for a little while now and have never seen it like that before.I truely recommend this hotel for its service, facilities and most of all its views!
