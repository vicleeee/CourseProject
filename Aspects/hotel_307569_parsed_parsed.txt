<Content>Heaven on Earth My wife and I spent three nights at the Komaneka Monkey Forest prior to our charter flight to Wakatobi Dive Resort. I wish it had been three weeks instead of three nights. When you enter Komaneka from busy Monkey Forest Road its like you go through a transportal on Star Trek as the noise melts away and you enter the garden of eden. Every person I interacted with at the resort was as nice and gracious as anyone I have ever met.Having arrived late on our first night I grabbed the ice bucket and made the short walk to the restaurant to get some ice. Because of the hour I didn't want to wait the 15 or more minutes I am used to in the US for room service to bring it. The employee at the restaurant said he would bring the ice to us. I went back to the room and told my wife that they insisted on bringing the ice so it would be awhile. 30 seconds later there was a knock on the door. In comes the waiter with the ice. When I tipped him he replied with a huge smile you are so very kind. I relay this as an example of the way that you will be treated by everyone during your stay at Komaneka. I won't repeat all the other embellishments of the other reviewers except to say that I concur with all the good reviews.I do want to emphasize that you should visit the Komaneka Spa. Though a Balinese massage can be had for half the price out on Monkey Forest Road I was more than satisfied at the price and quality of my Komaneka spa experience. In fact, I think I had some kind of spiritual epiphany during my second massage. A gentle rain was falling on the semi outdoor massage terrace contributing to it being one of the most relaxing massages I have ever experienced. If this spa is not in heaven I don't want to go there.Stay at Komaneka if you are in Ubud!!

<Content>Service, Ambience and Location (and Bebeks) We booked this Hotel after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. On arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded to a Pool Villa . Our friends were also upgraded to the Villa right next door We all spent many hours watching the ducks (bebeks) and their keepers go about their daily work in the rice paddies. What a wonderful, unplanned experience. The staff at the Hotel were brilliant, nothing was too much trouble for any of them. Privacy was respected when they attended the villa, ringing the bell at all time before they actually entered. Staff arranged for a late check out for us at short notice as our flight did not leave until the early hours of the morning. We have travelled extensively, but nothing compares to the experience we had at the Komaneka. Thank you one and all, we will return.

<Content>An beautiful oasis We've just returned from 10 days in Ubud; 5 days at Komaneka Monkey Forest  5 days at Komenka Tanggayuda. Both hotels were superb  offered different experiences. Monkey Forest is in the heart of Ubud with the excellent Cafe Wayan literally just outside your doorstep; the hotel offers beauty  serenity amidst the bustle of central Ubud. Lush gardens, gorgeous pool  beautiful villas; everything is aesthetically enchanting. But best of all is the staff who made our stay truly memorable; we met so many lovely people who were incredibly warm, friendly  welcoming.

<Content>fantastic hotel and location we have just had four nights in this hotel. our experience was fantastic and the staff could not do enough to help us. a couple of examples are when i wanted some stamps for a postcard they just said we will take it to the post office for you,did all our daily excursion bookings for us,booked and delivered us to the local restaurants. in fact everything we asked for was delivered every time. it is a small hotel and quite personal so you tend to be given more service than in a large hotel. the meals were good and infact we had one served pool-side at our villa one night which was brilliant. the pool villa we had was large and roomy with great views of the rice paddies. another great thing about this hotel is you can walk to the monkey forest or the main market in 5 mins and there are lots of local restaurants right out the front of the hotel.would i stay there again, yes any time.

<Content>Every time I close my eyes I can se Ubud I really think that everything I write is poor comparing to how I felt and how I still feel when I think about our stay at Komaneka in Ubud. Everything was absolutelly perfect. Location, rooms but most of all al the amazing staff working at the hotell. Nothing was to much trubbel and everything was done with a smile on a face. Iéº“m still owerwhelmed by the generosity and humanity of people living on this island. So the last thing I have to say is just go there and experience everything for your selfe, you wont regrett it. This was the best holliday in my life, and belive me I have traveled a lot. Lejla

<Content>Serene Komaneka This was our second stay at the Komaneka Resort and we enjoyed our stay as much as our first stay there about 4 years ago.The location is very central and easy to get to places in Ubud. The hotel layout and design is quite home/village like so it has a lovely boutique feel. It is surrounded by rice paddies which is just gorgeous. The Deluxe Room we stayed in is spacious and clean. The staff are all lovely and so helpful. Have to say though breakfast food was below average. The 5 days we stayed there we ordered all the breakfast variety on offer (American, Continental, Indonesian etc etc), none of them were quite right some was a bit odd. Even the Indonesian breakfast wasn't the best Indo food I've had (you'd expect they can make local food best at the least). The only other slight downfall is that in some of the room, you can hear the noise from nearby bar playing live music. It doesn't go on too late but can be a nuisance if you want an early night.Komaneka is definitely a lovely quaint hotel and we'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>Disappointing! On the face of it the Komaneka looks great! However we stayed for 10 nights and it became apparent that the hotel could not maintain the levels of service that you would expect from a 5* hotel. E.g. late turndown, cleaning of the room not done until the afternoon  poor trips offered by the hotel that represented bad value for money!The last irritation was the fact that when we came to pay our final bill we were told we could not pay in US dollars with a mastercard but only in rupiah this added approx. æ‹¢100+ to our bill owing to the exchange rate. If you do stay here please take a visa card so that this does not happen to you.The Komaneka was certainly nice and staff were polite however compared to some of the small boutique resorts we have stayed at in Thailand it is lagging behind!

<Content>A Pampered Experience From the moment we stepped into the beautiful lobby we received friendly, personalised service. The cold towels and cool drinks after travelling for 16 hours was a greatly appreciated touch.It only got better. Our room was wonderful and beautiful decorated with fresh flowers. We stayed in a villa which overlooked our own private plunge pool. It was extremely spacious, spotlessly clean, quiet and private. Every touch you would expect of a 5 star resort. The private outside sitting area with frig and mini bar facilities was inviting. The bowl of fresh fruit and jar of biscuits was a nice touch.The food is tasty and well presented. The staff are very friendly and attentive. Nothing is too much effort. We did enjoy a Balinese massage at the Komaneka Spa. A stay at this resort is a delightful experience and certainly worthy of a repeat visit.

<Content>Excellent Hotel  My husband and I stayed at the Komaneka for six days at the end of June, beginning of July this year. We had stayed in Seminyak for the six days prior to going to Ubud, but when planning our trip thought we would like to experience more of Bali than the beaches. I am very glad that we did decide to spend a few days in Ubud, as I think if we had only visited it on a day trip we wouldn't have got nearly as much out of it as we did.The Komaneka is very centrally positioned, although once inside the hotel grounds you would have no idea that you are in the middle of a busy town.The standard of accommodation was excellent, with lovely attention to detail. The staff couldn't have been more helpful or pleasant.I would highly recommend that you visit the Komaneka, but do have two criticisms. Firstly when we arrived we were given a pool villa overlooking the rice paddies. This sounds idillyc. However, you have little to no pricacy, with the rice paddy workers being able to see straight in to your room unless you keep your curtains closed. The room was lovely so we did try to stay there, but on two occassions in the space of a few hours the paddy workers tried to beg from us.This made us feel very uncomfortable, and we decided that it would ruin our stay. The hotel were very good about it, and moved us to an alternative pool villa, which overlooked a valley and was almost completely private.The other criticism is the price of the wine. The restaurant was fine, and we would certainly have eaten there, but a glass of wine (not particulary good wine at that) was at least twice the price of having a stong cocktail. Although I appeciate that wine is expensive in Bali, this seemed very excessive, and stopped us from eating there. However, there are so many others places to eat near by that this shouldn't put you off from staying there.I would recommend the Komaneka, but ask for a room which does not directly overlook the rice paddies.

<Content>absolutely heaven We went to Bali for two weeks in June and stayed in 3 different areas. The first please we stayed was at the Komaneka for 5 nights and didnéˆ¥æª› want to leave. We arrived into Denpasar around 7pm and arrived at the Komaneka around 8.30pm. We were impressed as soon as we got off the coach. The entrance to the lobby was stunning very open and welcoming feeling. The staff were very friendly and efficient. We were offered a seat a wet towel and a welcome drink which was very refreshing. After doing the paper work for checking in we were escorted to our room and the layout of the resort was explained to us. The grounds were immaculate not a leaf out of place. We were shown to our room which is very private almost like a villa, it was stunning. The love heart flower arrangement on the bed was so fantastic that we didnéˆ¥æª› want to remove it. We were than shown the room layout where the light switches were, the complimentary water, biscuits and fruit. The room had a great bath (including bubble bath) which after a long flight we took advantage of. It would have been around 9.30 10pm and we were still able to order room service and the food not to badly priced. We had a few massages as well and by staying 5 nights we actually had a complimentary 60 minute massage per person heaven. The location is great walking distance the Monkey forest as well as restaurants right outside our door. The only thing that was average was the breakfast but with restaurants almost open 24 hours who is to complain. Nothing could be faulted at the wonderful place. Staff were fantastic including the garden staff who were quiet willing to take our bags from us and help us to our rooms. Will definitely be going back.

<Content>Rustic luxury at Komaneka We stayed at the Komaneka for 4 days at the beginning of July. We have 2 children (15 and 8) so we booked a standard room for them and a luxurious pool villa for us (Its our money after all!). The hotel organised transfers for us from Denpasar. The young driver was fabulous. Bintang and cold towels arranged to de-stress us from the money grabbers at the airport (that's just the immigration guys). The drive to Ubud is pretty short but transport in Bali is very slow so be prepared for a longer than anticipated journey....everywhere.The hotel reception is beautiful with a water theme. We were given drinks on arrival by young, attentive staff. First impressions were excellent. It was dark when we arrived but the beautiful hotel grounds were apparent. The kids room opened on to a rice paddy and our pool villa opened on to a gorge with coconut palms and banana trees. The bathroom of our villa was ostensibly open air and had a pond surrounding our bath inhabited by Koi and a couple of toads. Quite fabulous! Add to this the grass roof of the villa and it was a unique feeling. To my mind there is no point traveling half way round the world to stay in a corporate, western hotel chain room. The house geckos completed the picture.Ubud is a working, vibrant town, so be prepared that no matter where you are there is noise. Cockerels, mopeds, cars, farm workers etc. A lie in in Ubud may not be possible if you are a light sleeper like me. Exit from the comparative tranquility of Komaneka and you hit the maelstrom of Jalang monkey forest! At one end the monkeys and the other the market. In between there are wonderful shops and a thousand taxi drivers looking to take you around Bali. The market is an assault on your senses and not to be missed, and a word of warning, never come between a monkey and its banana! They do bite and scratch and steal.We only breakfasted at Komaneka but this was very good. Remember, you are in the far east, so don't complain that the eggs benedict isn't up to standard! Go for local food. Tropical fruit , nasi goreng and Balinese kopi, all wondeful and accompanied by live Gamelan. I remember being dismayed by a couple of Americans who complained that the Balinese didn't know how to mix a bloody mary! Get a life!The staff were excellent at booking excursions and restaurants for us. I recommend treking up Mt Batur to see the sunrise and the Elephant safari. Casa Luna was a fabulous 'fusion' restaurant and Katut's Place offered a truly unique mix of Balinese food and cultural commentary.In the words of Dorothy 'this sure isn't Kansas'. Once you accept that, you'll appreciate the wonders of Komaneka and Ubud.

<Content>Blissful spa This is a fantastic location for a small spa hotel, right in the middle of Ubud, but peaceful and overlooking rice paddies. Really enjoyed the spa and the small pool, great breakfast (included in the price). There is a great restaurant over the road and a multitude of shops outside. Its five minutes walk to the flea market and the temple where the big cremations are going to be in July. Booked direct for $150 for double. You can always find a taxi outside and the tours they organised were good, particularly the treks.

<Content>Just perfect This is an excellent hotel that lives up to all of its very high standards. Rooms are impeccable, large, luxurious and clean. The four-poster beds are good (as Balinese hotel beds go), the bathrooms are stunning, the terraces perfect for outdoor dining. The swimming pool is a treat, especiailly at tea-time.Breakfast was good, we skipped the restaurant for lunch and diner given the large number of dining places nearby. The hotel staff was the most attentive we met in Bali.Komaneka is ideally located: smack in the centre of Ubud, all major sights and restaurants are within walking distance.One minor flaw is the sound isolation of the rooms - the hotel premisses are calm enough but the neighbours can be rowdy and noisy, thus disturbing the idyliic atmosphere.We would most definitely come back here. At 170 USD per night (tax incl., booked via the hotel directly), this was the most expensive place we stayed in in Bali, but it was worth every cent.

<Content>Great location, Impressive staff My husband and I travelled to Ubud, from Seminyak for a few days - and chose the Komaneka Monkey Forest b/c of it's location. We were able to walk to Monkey Forest and tons of restaurants. There's also a great reflexology place right outside of the hotel entrance ($4 for a 40 min foot rub)The hotel itself is very well kept and the staff are very friendly. They're the kindest people I've ever encountered.Nice pool area. If you choose reserve a room with a dipping pool, ask if its in a shaded spot. Ours was, so it never warmed up, and we didn't get to use it...It was pretty though next to our private veranda.The room we reserved was in a thatched hut, with no ceiling, so we had the occasional guest in our room (newts, frogs, geccos) - but considering this hotel is in the countryside, next to a rice paddy, we were fine with it.

<Content>Enjoyed the Komaneka The staff at the Monkey Forest Road are friendly and considerate. They make every effort to meet your needs. The resort on Monkey Forest Road has an excellent location. It is in the center of Ubud. Set back from the street, you walk out of the resort directly onto Monkey Forest Road. The market and palace are a short walk (3 blocks) away. The Monkey Forest Sanctuary is 3 to 4 blocks the other direction. Excellent restaurants such as Cafe Wayan (great chocolate cake) and Three Monkeys (wonderful salads and gelato) are close by. It is very convenient for shopping and eating yet feels private and remote. We had the standard room, which had a beautiful outdoor shower with a large, sunken tub. It also had a small garden where we could sit and read, having our afternoon tea. We enjoyed using the swimming pool which was usually empty (some of the rooms have plunge pools). They offer some free classes (learning to make offerings) and activities which were a nice bonus. The spa has a free steam shower and jacuzzi which I enjoyed but I didn't do any of the paid spa activities. We would love to return again.

<Content>A hidden gem Having read some really positive feedback about this hotel on Tripadvisor, we decided to take a couple of nights out of our planned hotel stay in Nusa Dua and head inland. We weren't disappointed. It was an amazing place, tucked away just off Monkey Forest Road and within walking distance to restaurants, shops and the Monkey Forest. We chose a pool villa, as it was our honeymoon and it couldn't have been more perfect. It is a small, quiet 'boutique' style hotel. Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean. We had a sunken bath, shower, private plunge pool and veranda with private dining facilities. The breakfasts were excellent and they provide complimentary afternoon tea either by the communal infinity pool, or in your room. We especially liked the private dining experience. On returning to our room from a day out, we found the bed turned down, clean towels, candles lit around our pool and our veranda made to look like a restaurant. We truly can't recommed this place enough.

<Content>Good Hotel but Skip the Spa We recently stayed at Komaneka Monkey Forest in one of their 2 suite rooms. Overall, we had a restful time and the room was modern and very comfortable, with a great view of the rice fields beside the resort. The service was also very good. Everyone we greeted was cheerful and polite and efficient. What was most impressive, however, was their attention to detail. Every night, they laid out freshly washed pajamas for us on the bed alongside a small pamphlet with a bedtime story. One night, we had to move the small 14 or 15 inch TV closer to the bed so that we could watch TV while lying in bed. The next day, when we returned to our room after a jaunt outside,we noticed that housekeeping had replaced our TV with a much bigger one! We booked the honeymoon package which included a spa treatment for the 2 of us. We decided to enjoy this on the last day before we flew off but, unfortunately, this was the only thing that left us with a bad impression of the resort. To begin with, the spa changing room had no doors and was accessible to both men and women. As the changing / bathrooms were wet due to the rain, we had to change in the main area of the changing room, during which the staff (both men and women) kept walking in and out. We were then led to a semi outdoor spa room which was small and sparsely furnished. As it had been raining before that, the floor was wet and the kimonos they issued us and the batik cloth they used to cover the bed and us were musty smelling. Without asking us before hand, they assigned us a male and female masseuse. During the course of the massage, which I felt was mediocre at best, our masseuse kept chatting with each other, which disrupted the peace. They also committed the cardinal sin of massages, they did not wash their hands before massaging our face and heads after they massaged our feet and bodies. I felt pretty disgusted by this and declined to have the masseuse massage my face. The prices charged by the spa are at least 10 times more than that charged by neighbouring spas within walking distance of the hotel and I felt that the service and facilities should have been commensurate to the premium. Given a choice, I would probably stay at Komaneka again, mostly for the wonderful service and great location but would steer clear of the spa.

<Content>Amazing! I can not speak more highly of our stay at Komaneka in Monkey Forest Road. We were fortunate enough to stay in a Pool Villa which was absolutely amazing. The staff are simply divine  the location is second to none.We were trying to choose between 2 hotels before we decided on Komaneka and I am so happy we did. In fact, I am planning to return again later this year. I urge all of those contemplating a visit to Ubud and Komaneka Resort to definately do it. You wont regret it!

<Content>Absolutely Perfect --however, beware of billing methods We stayed at Komaneka Resort from 2/9-2/14/08 and we were completely impressed. Even though it is on the main street in Ubud---the minute you step foot into the resort, you could be a million miles away. The service is awesome and the rooms were wonderful. I would definitely stay at this place again and again....IF, they would change the way they conduct billing. Here is the deal: When I called to book a room, I was quoted in American dollars. When I got to the hotel, they converted that Amerian dollar figure into a Rupiahs (bad exchange rate) and then billed Rupiahs to my credit card and then the credit card comapny changed it back into dollars. In addition, my card charged me a fee for doing this. The room ended up costing about 10% more per night. Not a huge deal, but, it all adds up when you are traveling for a long time. You can request and demand that a hotel not do this and after we left Komaneka, we made sure that it didn't happen again.

<Content>Komaneka lived up to reports After reading about Komaneka on trip advisor we contacted the property directly after arriving in Bali. We wanted a week in Ubud and hoped they would accommodate with some discount off rack rate for the week. They did, and we were delighted with our splurge -- we stayed in the 'deluxe room' which is their most affordable option and it gave us PLENTY of room. It came with the extras like the flowers decorating the bed (see other reviews) and lots of details we haven't seen elsewhere -- a rack for umbrellas outside the front door, extra umbrellas in the lobby in case you forget to take one and it is obvious the rain is coming, the ability to take breakfast (or afternoon tea) in your room for no extra charge, among other things. They also were just kind staff, and we felt they were actually interested in us as people -- not always expected from higher-end places. If we ever go back to Bali, we'll stay here.

<Author>A&A=soulmates
<Content>Honeymoon We were chauffered along a narrow road, slightly tar which is just wide enough for only a lane of traffic and occasionally requires bigger vehicles to come to a halt inorder for traffic travelling on the opposite direction to pass.Little wooden houses and cottages 'curtained' by the most unusual pieces of art releasing colours, talents and the artistic abilities of the people in Ubud possess. A true infusion of art and humble civilization! This inate talent is displayed in the most humble manner one would imagine and may put some famous artist to shame!My soulmate and I were breathless when the staff of Hotel Komeneka gave us a short but informative tour around the hotel. Imagine landscape, waterscape and artscape in an oasis of tranquility, serenity, peace and harmony. The kind that would normally be seen in programmes eg 'World 10 Best Hotels' or Most Romantic Getaway'. Exactly what one would expect in a dream paradise.Our guide politely told us that there are only 20 esoteric, intimate rooms with villa, padi field and garden themes and views that fused together through exquisite natural Balinese landscaping.The spa is my favourite spot coz I felt an immediate rapport, a haven of enchanment, drowning in the aroma of sweet and natural fragrance of essential oils. So soothing and relaxing; one may just need pampering almost immediately especially when its so cleverly designed just next to the padi fields with birds, bees, insects and butterflies chirping and flapping without compromising the privacy of the luxurious santuary of relaxation. Sheer beauty!It was at this very moment that I realized my soulmate had done a superb job coz this is a true paradise for 2 persons so deeply in love!We almost wanted a dip when we saw the swimming pool. It's really a sight to behold! Although not too big but it etched against the sky among the trees and overlooking the lush greenery and enveloped by cottages and padi fields over the other end of the horizon with intermittent sunshinge piercing through the trees above us.Inspired and for many, even inspiration itself........a small garden and with a neatly designed brick and stone pathway surrounded by honeysuckles coiling naturally on the beautifully constructed wooden shed and a surprisingly cute pond with lively colourfulfishes swimming so freely in it. Is this the way to our room?.........and so we both thought.AND IT IS!.........Our whole lives were further lifted....... we were on top of the world when we saw our room for the first time! Its really the kind that any lonely heart would fall in love all over again. Everything in the room is designed with superior finishes, fixtures and fittings. Its absolutely a romantic getaway with the pole-side bed with pure white bedding and laced with the most flowy white curtain surrounding it. Immediately we were in each other's arms when we saw a big heart intricately woven (frangipani) in the middle of the pure white bed and to our surprise, we were there were 2 sets of night gown flawlessly ironed!We save the best for last!............the aroma and the sweet natural scent of flowers finally brought us to the most romantic bath I've ever seen! We had our first floral bath which was pre-prepared with lots of petals of flowers floating on top and also the various beautiful fragrant soap and lotion being generously placed around us. We had the longest bath that anyone would have and I'm glad all these had further cement our love for each other even more......

<Content>Very Good Boutique Hotel When we go to Bali we like to stay in the town of Ubud for a few days, then outside of Ubud in the countryside, and then the beach. After having visited Bali twice for a month each time, we have decided that our favorite place to stay in Ubud town for luxury and value is the Komaneka. We have visited the other luxury properties there (I love checking them out) and the other two that come close are located walking distance to town: The Uma Ubud and The Pita Maha Resort  Spa. The Komaneka is so convenient for shopping, dining, and cultural activities and has lower rates than the other two hotels. We have only stayed in a villa at The Komaneka so I am not sure about the rooms, but I imagine they would be very nice as well. The Villas have their own plunge pools and look out to a rice field and other hotels in the distance. There is some privacy, but occasionally the farmers come to the rice field with their ducks and you wouldn't want to go skinny-dipping. The design of the villa is tasteful and luxurious. I would call it modern balinese. The bedroom looks onto the plunge pool with an infinity edge and the spacious bathroom looks into your own little pond with lotus flowers and fish. There is also an outdoor dining area. At night the staff add some magic and hang a lantern by your pool which lends to the wonderful ambiance. They do this at the beautiful common pool as well. The sounds of the frogs in the rice field are wonderful and it really does feel peaceful even though you are in town. The complimentary afternoon tea is a nice touch and it's fun to try the Balinese treats. The breakfast is quite plentiful and enjoyable. Not as fancy as the Four Seasons Sayan of course, but it costs significantly less and you can usually get it included in your room rate.The service is very good for a boutique hotel, though a couple notches below the Four Seasons' Sayan where service is over the top (some of the best in the world). One minor complaint is that the lovely pool was missing a few tiles. Other than that we felt that for the price we were paying we got great value and a great stay. We booked our villa directly with the hotel and negotiated a rate that included breakfast. This is what I recommend doing in order to get the best rates unless your stay is part of a package deal. If you want more formal service rather than very good casual service then look at the Uma Ubud in town. Outside of town I recommend looking at The Four Seasons Sayan, The Como Shambala Estate (formerly The Begawan Giri), and The Chedi Club.

<Content>Komaneka - First Class Property This place rocks. I stayed here over a weekend during biz travels. I was accidentally booked at Tangayudda location, but wanted to be near the Monkey Forest/City Center. The manager (Swabawa) had arranged transportation and provided a room within hours. The bathroom has sunken tub, bed/linens comfy. The SPA was excellent, a true SPA experience. Pool picture perfect. Lastly, location is central to everything, 5 minute walk to Monkey Forest. If this doesnt sell Komaneka, not sure what will...

<Content>First rate service To start, Komaneka Monkey Forest has an excellent location right in the centre of town. It so convenient staying there as everything (shopping, dining, etc) is literally at your doorstop. At the same time, it's an oasis of calm as the rooms and villas are located deep within the property so one hears none of the traffic from outside.The service is first rate - staff are extremely attentive and receptive to all your possible needs (or wants). There is free wifi, which is excellent for those who need to work or just want to surf. Point to note is that it's only available at the lobby and restaurant - not within the rooms. The rooms are large, well-appointed. Bathrooms are large as well. I've only got a few gripes ( but I'm just being pedantic ) - the linen (towels and sheets) could be a little thicker - it would then be truly luxurious. The mattress isn't first-rate and the toiletries they provide are average. These are small touches that separate the good from the really best of hotels. However, in summary, fantastic value of money - definitely go-backable.

<Content>absolute perfection! the komaneka resort is absolutely magic. my husband and i go to ubud every year and we stay in upscale places, and this choice was the best ever! it is right in town, yet when you go into the hotel and into your room, it is in privacy and seclusion. it overlooks the rice paddy field and it was a hollywood production, watching the workers in the field. the pool villas face this view and it is awesome.the first night we stayed in a normal room and it was total magic too. the tub was filled with fresh plumeria flowers and the bed was decorated in hearts and flowers too.the staff is so sweet and so helpful in every way. it is a real treat to be there! when we came home after some time out and about shopping, we did not want to leave again. we stayed in and had dinner outside under the stars! the food was the best too.we were looking and looking around on the internet, and making ourselves crazy with so many options, and i want to say, make it easy now on yourselves and look no further, this is it. it could never be better than this! the room and the villa was decorated in the finest taste and everything is pristine.we also stayed at their other hotel outside of ubud, less than 15 minutes away. it was also a dream! there was a car with their drivers that would take you in and out so easily! if you are really looking for seclusion and romance, stay here. it is wonderful.

<Content>An Amazing Oasis - Strongly Recommended! Komaneka Resort on Monkey Resort Rd is simply amazing! My husband and I stayed there for our honeymoon in Oct and we were absolutely impressed by the lovely staff and beautiful resort.From the moment we arrived, the very pleasant receptionist welcomed us with a refreshing cool towel and welcome drink. She then took us on a small tour around the hotel grounds which I must say is very well maintained. They had upgraded our room to an amazing private pool villa (not sure if this is the norm or whether it was because we were on our honeymoon and that there was some availability). From the moment, the doors to our villa opened, our jaws had dropped because we werent expecting to be upgraded and the first thing my husband said was that he never wanted to leave this place! And I totally agreed straight away. The villa has a gorgeous infinity pool overlooking a small waterfall and river. The huge bed had flowers arranged in a heart shape. The bathroom and marble bath was overlooking a privare pond with nice fishes and 3 cute frogs! The hotel had so many special touches to it. They had thought of EVERYTHING for their guests. We were provided: a huge straw shopping bag to take for our shopping trips; a different bedtime story to read each evening; differnt pyjamas to wear each night; a weekly weather report; electric and traditional insect repellents; free musuem tours including free entrance fees, flowers in the bath, etc. The food was a real surprise for us......real 5 star quality food. The breakfast was good variety and quality, room service was divine and they also provided yummy complimentary afternoon tea which included samples from their main menu to try. We also tried their full moon dinner (by the main pool which was decorated with candles and local decorations) and private BBQ dinner at our own villa (where they had put candles around our pool and decorated our table, also had our own waiter and chef). We also tried their spa which was divine and it was very pampering and luxurious!The service was fantastic throughout our stay. The staff at Komaneka did everything to make us feel so happy and comfortable. They even helped us to bubble wrap our handicrafts and package our paintings so that they wont get crashed on the plane. We felt so spoilt that it was so hard to leave such a beautiful resort with such accommodating and welcoming staff. This is truly an amazing place to stay and strongly recommended. You cant go wrong with Komaneka and we look forward to coming back again and again. We've had our own share of 5 star hotels around the world but Komanka beats everyone hands down. You'll see what I mean when you get there!

<Content>Highly Recommend Komaneka, Monkey Forest, Ubud HIGHLY RECOMMENDED hotel in Ubud. While one can find many hotels in Ubud at all price categories, the Komaneka Resort on Monkey Forest offers service and style above the rest and certainly the most for your money. The convenient location makes it a perfect place to rest and explore all Ubud has to offer. The staff is exceptional, especially reservation manager I Ketut Ariana who will go above and beyond for a fabulous stay. Prices are negotiable during off season which makes this hotel really a GREAT place to stay. The rooms are well appointed and in all categories special and have great views. Have fun!

<Content>Fantastic family holiday Our family of 12 had the most magical holiday at the Komaneka Resort. It was a family reunion as my siblings and families flew in from different parts of the world to gather in Bali with our aged parents. The location in Monkey Forest Rd was fantastic as there were so many restaurants and shops to keep all happy, but at the same time within the hotel it was so tranquil. Perfect! We had an assortment of rooms which had different views and sizes. The standard rooms facing the rice fields were smaller but the view made up for it. The ones without much view were larger and had better bathrooms. Then there was the pool villa next to the spa... Definitely the best, if you can afford it. The service was impeccable, rooms were clean and atmosphere was charming. I have visited Bali several times and am one of those who check out hotels as my holiday program. I have seen several top-knotch hotels and find that the Komaneka has a charming architecture (not too heavily traditional and not too modern); is reasonably priced; is convenient if you want to be able to walk to restaurants and shops; is tranquil because of neighbouring rice fields. The beds were heavenly. We had a magical dinner at the poolside which we had specially requested for the staff to arrange as it was my brother's birthday. The seafood was very good but nothing could beat the atmosphere as we were under the moon and stars with subtle lantern lights over the pool.

<Content>Wonderful place to stay We stayed at the Komaneka for 5 days in July 2007. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. Our deluxe room was stylishly furnished in a traditional Balinese way, with many thoughtful touches, eg fresh fruit and homemade biscuits. We enjoyed reading the books about Bali and its crafts that were in our room. The staff always had a welcoming smile and many would greet us by name; nothing was too much trouble. We particularly enjoyed the lesson in making coconut leaf offerings; good fun and well worth a try. On separate afternoons the hotel offer lessons in wood carving and balinese dress and dance - although we didn't have time to go to these ourselves. We decided on our last evening to have one of their special dinners. It was so romantic - a table was set by the pool which had candles and flowers all around the waters edge and floating in the middle. There were lanterns hanging from the trees and ceremonial umbrellas over the table. The food was served on banana leaves cut in pretty designs and the waitress was dressed in the traditional costume. The service was attentive but discreet. It made a very memorable last night at the Komaneka.The hotel is ideally located for exploring the town - the monkey forest one way (about 10 mins walk - but there were so many shops to look at on the way down!) and temples and palaces the other way (plus lots more shops!). It is worth seeing at least one of the evening dances at either the Royal Palace or the Water Palace - the surroundings add to the atmosphere.There are plenty of restaurants nearby, however we regret not making more use of the hotel restaurant.In summary we would say that this is a superb hotel in an ideal location which enhanced our stay in Ubud.One word of warning when you step out of the hotel - don't expect the delightful service to continue - be very careful which taxi driver you choose. Across the road from the hotel we made the mistake of selecting Wayan Dupa (at least that was the name on his card) to drive us for the day, but he was only interested in taking us to places that might earn him commission. His mood got less friendly when we refused to buy at the outlets he selected. We also asked him to take us to the Elephant Safari Park at Desa Taro, North of Ubud, however he actually took us to Bakas Elephant Tour near Klungkung. This park was inferior and very expensive - a 40 min ride on the elephant was US$66 per person. Don't let this put you off hiring a driver as there are many excellent ones about - just take care.

<Content>Idylic Retreat in the middle of Ubud My family and I have had the pleasure of staying at Komaneka (both resorts) on over 5 occasions over the last 7 years. The hotel is truly an oasis in the middle of Ubud. The staff are wonderful and the food is fabulous. It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel each dayt o go sightseeing etc . We have stayed in several different room types over the years and all are gorgeous (great views out over the rice paddies next door) but our favourite would definitely have to be the pool villa's.The main pool is lovely, as is the hotels' spa. Our kids were 5 and 9 on our last visit and they found plenty to enjoy at the hotel - the staff even taught them wood carving one aftrnoon!Overall I would say this is probably my favourite hotel in Ubud and I have stayed at quite a few! It has the most convenient location if you want to wander around the Ubud Village area but it is so quiet you wouldn't even know what was going on outside the gates. The art gallery is fabulous (and we have puchased quite a few interesting artworks too over the years and are still enjoying them now).

<Content>where everyone knows your name booked through balibarongtours.com and we were absolutely satisfied! this place is intimate and every room looks great. we had a pool villa t(104) that overlooked the rice paddy field (honestly, we didn't have time to use the pool but the resort pool is fabulous!) the room was big with marble floors and the ac worked really well! we were there on a honeymoon and the room had flowers on the bed and in the tub when we got there. the staff is worth noting because they knew our names and always asked us what we were planning to do and how to make our stay better. stayed there 4 days and did lots of sightseeing. the hotel is in the middle of a busy street but once you walk into the resort you wouldn't realize it at all. it's true that at night the resort is so romantic. the room rate came with breakfast and that was served in either in your room or patio or in the restaurant which is outdoor overlooking the well kept grounds. we spent one afternoon at the pool and there they served tea with traditional appetizers. needlesstosay we did not want to leave. --a note about the staff--i went shopping and wanted to go to lunch across the street (cafe wayan is across the street and awesome place to eat) but didn't feel like walking back to my room and one of the ladies at the gallery that is attached to the resort simply took my packages and had them delivered to my room later. service is impeccable even the gardeners stop and say hi as you walk by. two thumbs up and i will definately come back.

<Content>Exceptional Hotel I absolutely loved Komaneka. Actually, it's one of the finest hotel experiences I have ever had. It's very centrally located, but once you step inside, it's an absolute oasis of serenity and completely removed from the street noise of central Ubud.I had a suite room, which was really stunning - modern but warm, with Balinese accents. Large patio with daybed. Room-length windows with built-in window seat overlooking a beautiful rice field. Lots of nice amenities including a collection of Bali photo and design books, and a jar of homemade cookies.There's a small restaurant, spa, gallery and very lovely infinity pool. Free wireless internet in the restaurant and lobby. The grounds were beautiful during the daytime, but at night they became magical, with hanging white paper lanterns and torches lit along the walkways.The hotel is small but has a high staff-to-guest ratio. The staff - from checkin to housekeeping to restaurant - were consistently excellent. The GM stopped by my room on the first day to make sure I was happy with everything. I really can't recommend this hotel highly enough and would stay there again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Best Hotel we have ever stayed in! Wow! We stayed in a pool villa for two nights whilst in Bali. It was a special treat for our wedding anniversary.We were like giddy children when we saw the villa. There was an outdoor living area with a day bed, mini bar, and dining table. Next to this was the plunge pool surrounded by decking and a and balcony overlooking the stream and small waterfall. Sliding doors opened out onto the decking were we had two sunloungers. Inside, we had a four poster bed, dvd, cd player, seperate wardrobe area and huge bathroom complete with a sunken marble bath directly next to a lotus pond seen through the glass panels.But it wasn't just the room which made this special - the service was second to none. Nothing was too much trouble. You could have your breakfast on the patio at no extra charge. Every member of staff greeted you with a smile. They also arranged the hotel transport for us to go and see a local legong dance.The hotel was located in the centre of the village - near loads of restauraunts and some excellent shops.Overall - excellent.

<Content>Royal treatment at the Komaneka From the moment we arrive at the Komaneka in the heart of bustling Ubud we know we are somewhere special (and this has been a constant of our seven stays at the Hotel). The 60 smiling staff service 20 rooms, a ratio that ensures they know and greet us, often by name. The airy creamy-white rooms with polished limestone floors feature traditional wooden furniture. Their terraces are the perfect place to have a rest or afternoon tea or a pre-dinner drink. But most importantly the rooms are set in a tranquil garden with rice paddy views bordered by a stream best viewed from the end of the pool while watching the squirrels play in the trees. It is a haven in the midst of this royal town, yet perfectly placed to explore the temples, market, arts and crafts shops and restaurants. At night it is easy to venture out to a dance or musical evening in the town or the surrounding suburbs.In the garden the restaurant pavilion is just large enough to accommodate the hotel guests. The tropical breakfast helps start our day, while afternoon tea features Balinese favourites, and at night the Indonesian specialities are an extra treat. Of course, there is a spa for pampering and a gallery where guests are encouraged to learn about Balinese culture.We have been and will continue to be very happy here.John McPhee and Jim Sait

<Content>Komaneka Resort: outstanding I can't recommend it highly enough! We stayed for 2 fantastic nights at Komaneka in a superior room overlooking the Padi fields. The rooms are really beautiful, with a sunken bath, lovely furniture, very nice toiletries. The staff are just lovely and the food is excellent. The location is perfect- it's so close to the heart of Ubud but so peaceful. The pool has wonderful views and between 3pm and 7pm they do a complimentary afternoon tea. They also include a complimentary trip to the Neka Museum, which is well worth a visit. You can even try free balinese dancing and wood carving!We asked the hotel to arrange for a driver to take us to the volcano and within 15 minutes they had it sorted - a charming and patient driver and a comfortable car including a coolbox with cold towels, mineral water and an ipod - try listening to Gamelan music while your ears pop as you ascend the winding roads! On our last day we were leaving very early, so they brought breakfast to our verandah which was a perfect end to our stay.

<Content>My second home Komaneka Resort, Ubud I travel very often to Bali, to have a break after hard working, always choose to stay in Ubud, as it is very peaceful and lovely. The most convenience and best resort is the Komaneka Resort. Komaneka is a cosy and romantic resort in the heart of Ubud, with only well-thoughtfully designed rooms and villas, some with private pools. Staff are excellent well trained polite and helpful, . With details for guests, room, facilities and room -amenities compared with the rate is rather cheap than reasonable. Will always stay at Komaneka, as everytime something changed and improved...Congratulations!!!
