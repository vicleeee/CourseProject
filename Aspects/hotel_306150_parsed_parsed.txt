<Content>Nice hotel but quite business like The hotel has a designed feel to it, and was very minimal in appearance. The staff at the hotel were friendly and our room had great facilities and a view of the river. Location wise this hotel is also good for walking around Singapore. However as we were on the first leg of our honeymoon, I would say that this hotel had rather a sterile feel to it. Not very relaxing and rather formal.

<Content>Good hotel to stay at Hotel is great, room was a little tight but well planned out, bathroom is small but really nice, modern. I think we had a bookend supieror roomRoof top pool is great.Breakfasts are not great, but they try to do a european breakfast.Nice coffee shop just out side the hotel.Taxi's were easy to get from hotel and in and around the city.We found them to be really great, super helpful, especially for little saving tips and better places to go.We did have to change lifts to get to out room, it really was not an issue, they right across from each other.We enjoyed it and will stay again.

<Content>Too bad service was so bad I liked staying at the Gallery Hotel because it's located in a nice area of Singapore (within walking distance to one of my company's partner's office) and the internet is free. The rooms are almost kind of modern, or at least they probably were when they first opened. But this last stay at the Gallery Hotel really soured my experience and I don't think I'll ever stay there again.When I checked in I didn't get the room type I wanted. I requested a non-smoking queen/king bed through Agoda and they were out of them when I checked in. I asked them if they could upgrade me to the next sized room with one bed, and they said they'd check. But when they found out that I had booked my room through an online service they said sorry, no. They did offer to upgrade me with $60++ SGD more per night which I declined. I really didn't know that booking through an online service would mean that would be less motivated to keep a loyal customer happy.Anyway, the stay was fairly uneventful until I got stuck in one of the elevators. The elevator had not worked for over an hour (it wouldn't open on the 5th floor) but there was no sign for it warning guests. When I took the elevator up it got stuck and I had to call for help. They admitted that it wasn't working but only for the 5th floor. So they asked me to go up to the 6th floor and then walk down the stairs. I was really shocked that they would keep an elevator operating knowing that it wasn't working and with no warning to guests. In fact, the engineers didn't even tell the manager (he didn't know) until I made a fuss.I think sometimes you get a sign to not stay somewhere anymore, and the elevator incident was my sign. I hope that the management at the Gallery changes because it's too good of a hotel to be performing so poorly. It's really too bad because the housekeeping staff is excellent and very helpful, but they have these kinks that shows inflexibility and lack of concern for guest welfare, which so damages the hotel.

<Content>Not outstanding, but probably unique and definitely nice Saying it first, I do like the Gallery Hotel. We've stayed there three times now, always on a stopover from/to Europe to/from Australia. The hotel is somewhat differentto the typical main brands, It is within walking distance to the Chinatown and other interesting things, but not in the center of it. The service in the hotel is somewhat improvable which doesn't mean it's bad, butit's not good enough to be outstanding. The rooms aresomewhat small, and probably not everyones style. The bathroom has a blinded glass wall, which is somewhat strange but fancy at the same time. The pool is grandious, on top of the roof just over the street. Overall, the Gallery hotel is a nice place to stay and an experience for itself, Just try it. We'll come back again.

<Content>Good exterior, common room No wow factor except the exterior design.Interior is normal. Don't like their room service as they came knocking on the door to check on mini bar at 10am! I am still in bed!Stay in an excecutive club. Nothing special. The breakfast is normal.The location has not much place to roam about.Not worth the money.

<Content>Fine for the price, but nothing special I spent one night in this hotel whilst travelling home from Indonesia. I was told I had been upgraded beacause there were no non-smoking rooms available for me - whilst I appreciated this, flattery would get this hotel everywhere! Tell people they've been upgraded because they are special!!!! The location of the hotel was fine for a night, but it is not near public transport, so not a great place for trying to travel around Singapore, as taxis are notoriously hard to find.The room was comfortable, with twin beds, wide screen tv, mini bar, bath robes, slippers, toiletries, etc. The hotel markets itself as 'stylish', with rooms interior designed by award winning designers. From the pictures in the brochure, I was perhaps fortunate not to be in one of these!Breakfast was very ordinary - buffet style combination of local and American. Overall, fine for an overnight stay, but I wouldn't want to stay here for a holiday or honeymooon, etc.

<Content>Not worth staying. There are other hotels at the same area. Was staying in the hotel for my honeymoon which my company booked for us. We have higlighted is for our honeymoon however nothing has been done specially for us therefore it didnt impress us at all. There is no view from our rooms. We are surrounded by condo. Small bathroom. The basin was rusty. Front office service was very average. We even see a manager in spagetti top standing at the counter. Is this the way hotel staff should wear at work! Overall i find the hotel below expectation.

<Content>very average chk in was pretty long... with like 8 staff at the counter... 3 staff servicing one chk in pax.... very unproductive. not greeted by smiles. staff seem unhappy at work. requested for comp upgrade, but didnt manage to get it. gallery room, ok, clean, but disappointed no bathtub. with the rate, im expecting at least the bathtub. overall hotel is clean... but not that chic. 9 staff out of 10 come in contact seems bored abt their job. breakfast = abf, noting to shout abt. very basic. but edible.chk out in a mess. same, 8 staff at the counter. i was queueing and the staff actually did not see me and attended to someone who came later than me. it was in a total mess. here and there. not productive. no smiles. unhappy. staff are mainly foreigners, cheap labor, thus poor service? to sum it, not worth paying to stay.

<Content>Okay design hotel does not quite hit the mark I stayed here for one night en route from Australia to Europe in July 2008. We got a good rate through the SIA Singapore Stopover program, but I do think the usual advertisted rates for the hotel are a little high for what you get.This is very much a hotel populated by young and beautiful guests. The room was of minimalist design, very small but perfectly comfortable, and the small bathroom had been laid out very well. The bed was comfortable. The overall design of the hotel reminded me very much of the Adelphi in Melbourne - right down to the glass-edged rooftop pool cantilevered over the street - but it comes off as a slightly pale imitation of that hotel. There is an awkwardness to the design: for example, you have to catch two elevators to get from the ground floor reception to the guest rooms. There are a number of bars and nightclubs located in the hotel, but my sleep was not at all disturbed by any noise whatsoever - the room was completely quiet. The hotel is also just a short walk along the river from the popular Clarke Quay dining and nightlife area (Singapore's main nightlife area for the young people, according to the taxi driver who took me to the nearby Asian Civilizations Musuem) and many other riverfront dining options on both sides of the river. We enjoyed drinks and tapas at the hotel's riverfront EM Bar in the evening, where you can watch the joggers puff past you and enjoy very reasonably priced happy hour drinks in a relaxed garden setting. In fact, this was the only relaxed part of the hotel - and the most enjoyable. A downside is that the hotel is quite a walk from the nearest MRT station, although taxis in Singapore are of course quite cheap and there are always several outside the hotel.In summary, it is an okay hotel but I think they are trying a little too hard for the artistic ambience that it claims to have. Worth trying once if you can get a good online deal.

<Content>So what? Needed a weekend away so decided to spend it at the Gallery as i have dined @ Zenden (for dinner) before.Check in was horrible. Trainee was doing my check in and two senior staff were chatting in the corner.Room was glazzhouse..felt like a very basic accomodation. Tiny room with wannabe cool touches. Bathroom is mosaic and steel.. very cool. Thank god for the QUEEN bed (not king).. Breakfast was horrible. Yucky, basic, and dont be surprised if the staff dont acknowledge ur presence.Check out- the dude undercharged us by about three dollars and then he had to charge again.. Hassle. His mind seemed to be a millon miles away.Bellman SMILES from his desk and continues to read something while i try to locate a taxi.Only reason why i wld stay here- cheap compared to the other hotels in Sg.

<Content>Lack of service I used to stay at this Hotel a couple of times and found the Hotel and the service received pretty much alright. As usual the rate was right, breakfast a little boring and not much to choose from, but free internet, a relaxed atmosphere and a good location as it is always nice for me to go for a walk by the river. The style is different indeed, but not hip!Nevertheless on my recent stay there was a total lack of service offered by the front office staff. Tried to Check In but they lost my reservation and ask to charge my credit card with the rack rate besides it was prepaid! I denied and pushed them to solve the problem. It took them 1 hour to solve their mistake until I got my key card. They never excused!As prices went up and there are many more options in Singapore I will never stay at this Hotel again!

<Content>Clean and Comfortable The hotel was comfortable and clean. The Zenden staff helpful and the breakfast delicious. In relation to the price of everything in Singapore the hotel isn't cheap or expensive just pretty much standard. Good location but not signed that well which is a bit difficult to find on arrival. All up we enjoyed our stay at the Gallery.

<Content>Not recommended The Gallery is neither unique nor redeeming through the extras it seems to promise. The design is generic steel-and-glass, indistinguishable as uniquely Singaporean in any way. The staff seemed to carry a holier-than-thou attitude for the duration of our three day stay, and we were nickel and dimed endlessly for our charges. Laundering a shirt or pair of socks at the hotel costs about 3 SGD per article of clothing. Ridiculous. When I checked in, I was told three nights stay was 618 USD including tax. When I checked out, I noticed the amount was higher. I was charged 24 SGD for each room service over three days. Extra charge for basic room service? Ridiculous. Our beds were made and little more. Our bathrobes were not laundered or replaced, and since the hotel is perpetually humid (our sheets always felt slightly wet), they grew mildewy after a short period. Please avoid the entire Clarke Quay area if you are visiting Singapore. It is a trap for clueless tourists who are too scared to venture out of their familiarity zone, and hotels like Gallery help foster this ugly attitude even more.

<Content>Average Hotel Trying Desperately to be Chic and Trendy Whether or not you'll like the Gallery depends on what motivates you to love a hotel. I appreciated the free internet and inclusion of breakfast in my room rate. But the rest of the hotel left me rather uninspired.The Room In their attempt to be hyper-architecturally cool they're missing basics. The closet doors are on ceiling tracks so that they 'float'. Nice looking. But they don't slide far enough to actually allow access to the drawers inside! The Bathroom: The heavy glass swinging bathroom door, which again looks very cool, is hinged only to open inwards rather than swinging in both directions. This means that when you want to get out of the bathroom, you have to back against the basin to do it. And to flush the toilet you need all the strength of either your back/feet or shoulders/arm as the wall-mounted button is too low for hand pushing and too high for foot pushing unless you kick. And you need to hold it in for quite a few seconds to get the desired effect. What a palaver. Nice toiletries...The Bed: AWFUL. I stayed in a standard room and the queen sized bed was harder than the worst rock-hard Asian beds I've experienced in my many travels. Thank god there were lots of pillows to try and soften the blow, but I did not get a comfortable night's sleep, which made my day at the office and flight out the next night quite tough. The Logistics: As other reviewers have mentioned, the two-lift system is a huge pain. Dragging luggage in and out of two lifts to check in-out is a huge nuisance, and there are not enough lifts to service the number of rooms at key times, so you wait forever at each juncture.The Food: The room service menu is very limited, so plan on going out for lunch and dinner. Breakfast is fine, and was included in room rate. The Staff: Staff are not particularly polite - too hip to provide any real service, I guess - but you should have little cause to call on them as the hotel is pretty self-explanatory.The Spa: I can highly recommend the Ayuthaya Thai Spa at the hotel - decent value and fantastic Thai massage/spa treatments. i had a 2.25 hour package that included a back/shoulder/neck massage, thai foot massage and facial for SGD188. Of those, I'd recommend you stick to the Thai Massage and don't bother with the rest - the massage was superb. The rest was a bit pro-forma and lacking in care.All in all, I'll definitely come back to the Spa next time I'm in Singapore, but I probably won't bother actually staying at the Gallery Hotel.

<Content>Nice location We stopped over in Singapore at the beginning of our honeymoon, and our travel agent recommended that we take the Singapore Airlines stopover package, and we picked the Gallery from the brochure of hotels we were given to select from. We picked the Gallery because it looked a bit different from your average hotel - both on the outside and in terms of some of the theme rooms (which weren't part of our package).When we arrived, we found it to be a nice enough hotel, but really, nothing special. We were warned by our travel agent that a double bed wasn't guaranteed, and that we might have to have twin beds - but we didn't anticipate that there would be no possible way of pushing the beds together, as they were attached to the bedhead, and with a bedside table in between - nice start to the honeymoon! We asked if we could move to a room that had a double bed since it was our honeymoon, but were not lucky enough to be upgraded like other lucky reviewers - we could only move on payment of an extra $75 per night. To be fair to the hotel, this was their policy, and it was really our travel agent who should have told us that there was NO possibility of a double bed!!There was nothing really wrong about the Gallery, but really, if you're in the cheaper rooms like we were, you're just in another hotel.It was great being near the Clark Quay area, an area I hadn't visited before.

<Content>Clarke quay area We asked to be moved from our previous hotel as it was sub standard so we were accomodated here at short notice.This is a nice hotel- very Japanese in set up,  very boutique in style.Breakfasts were fantastic.The biggest draw back with this property is how far away from an MRT it is.Everything is quite a walk- (for Singapore).They were putting in a closer access to the MRT while we were there, so it should be better now.Clarke Quay had really changed compared to when we last visited- all the old buildings had been torn down or spruced up- It was really nice hanging out in this area.

<Content>Odd coloured Theme Room This hotel has different theme rooms. Unfortunately mine was painted all BLACK and had glitter thrown over this, maybe to emulate Space?? Well I didn't quite get this..well the good thing about this hotel is that it is very close to Clarke Key...you can walk there in about 15 mins and also it is 10 mins away from Chinatown as well so for location you can't really fault it.The Staff here are very friendly and I would advise if you are in a hurry to get the staff to order a taxi for you rather than wait...you could be waiting a long long time! The food here is actually good as well so give it a try.

<Content>Overated and Over Priced Hotel Have just returned from 3 day stay in Gallery Hotel in Singapore and would rate it as an experience to be avoided at all cost.It is a poor ,faded imitation of a quality hotel with smoke smelly floors and obvious attempts to be architecturally sharp without the core requirements of adequate space, good fittings and the usual services you expect from a complete hotel ( is everything outsourced in this hotel??). On top of this they run some stupid chit system for breakfasts so that the outsourced kitchen makes a living and the customer still pays as if it is a proper hotel.Weird and very unpleasant ;like the owner has his hand in your pocket the whole time. We had 2 very tiny rooms for 3 days with 2 breakfasts and 1 initial evening meal that cost in total S$3,300. Don't use this place!

<Content>Great Pool but Overpriced We stayed at this hotel in August 2005 for a couple of nights. I was really intrigued after seeing photos of it on the internet and liked it's funky styling so thought we'd give it ago.Initially I hated it! The rooms are tiny and it's value for money is very low. We had stayed at the Merchant Court Hotel on a previous trip to Singapore and that was much more impressive, cheaper and in my opinion in a better location. It's also a bit too cool to provide good service. However, an afternoon and evening in the pool changed my mind! What an amazing pool. Our room was right beside it so we could nip in at any time.If it wasn't for the pool, I would never stay in this hotel again but because of it I would consider staying again,

<Content>Vision not shared We stayed at this hotel for one night and were glad it was no more than that. Whatever they write about inspiration and visions in their leaflet, we defiinitely did not share theirs.We had a glazzhouse room (652) which was in desparate need of renovation and the carpet should have been exchanged! Can only share the opinion of previous reviewers, this hotel is not hip and needs a make-over.Could not understand the idea behind integrating a control panel in the headrest of the bed which was hidden behind pilllows. Total lack of user-friendliness.Also, the need to change lifts on the 4th level is unnerving. As noted before, there are building sites around the hotel, but this can happen anywhere along the quays. Once this end of the quays has been finished, the location might be more attractive, now it's not close to anything that a visitor might want to see.

<Content>Overrated We booked this hotel based on the Lonely Planet review which listed it in the Top range hotels section. Part of my disappointment came from this - it is not by any means a Top range. But for the price you pay (about GBP65 per night) it seems to be a good enough value for Singapore.Now facts on the table. The hotel is not very spacious, lobby has a reception desk, taxi desk and two benches and that's it. Club dancing music is played there at any time of day. You have to change lifts to get your room, 2 lifts bring you up to the restaurant level (over-air-conditioned - I felt like putting a jacket on every time I transferred from one lift to the other), and 2 other lifts on the other side of the hall take you up to the rooms. The corridor leading to the room was like an industrial building's one - feels like being in a factory (oldish decoration is partly to blame).The room was cramped (we had a Glasshauz room), barely enough space to go around the queen bed. Musty smell that some other people also mentioned. Aircon was too strong even though we put it to +25, so both of us woke up next day with throat pain. Towels seemed to be sitting in the room for a long time as they also had the same smell, which was gone once they were changed the next day, but wiping yourself with hte first set felt pretty disgusting. Also, they left lots of small fibres on your skin, and being a contact lens wearer I suffered some issues with that! Bathroom was OK but quite small.

<Content>Very modern with trendy bars We stayed in the Gallery Hotel in December 2005, having spent a week with family in Singapore. We chose it because we wanted a boutique style hotel without all the grandeur of some of the international chains. The hotel is definitely cool with relaxing chill out music in the lounge/restaurant area and the swimming pool, although small was interesting with its clear walls overhanging the building (not for the vertiginous).We found the rooms to be ok if a bit small, clean, but perhaps they could have been a bit more plush for the price being paid. They were nothing special - the corridors in the hotel were in need of a coat of paint too as you could see marks on the walls.Breakfast was not very impressive, you are better off going to the food stalls in town for some of the cheap local fare.A plus definitely had to the be the cool bars in the hotel, which attract a younger crowd. One opens out on to the river side and is a good place for a drink away from all the touristy places like boat quay. Having said that, there are several watering holes around the corner from the hotel if you fancy a change of scenery.Overall, it was ok if you are looking for somewhere a bit quirky to stay in Singapore, but don't expect 4* comforts!

<Content>Not worth it We stayed here for our last night in Singapore as we were ending a 2 week trip through Thailand. The most prevailing memory was the intense musty/mold smell in the elevator and our room. We had to leave the aircon on as we went out for the day just to air things out. Additionally, the bathroom was very small and it was difficult to get in and out of the shower (and we're in our 20s so it wasn't us being unstable). The location is nice - we enjoyed the bakery across the street for brunch and walked down to Clarke Quay for shopping and a drink. If we're in Singapore again we'd choose one of the many other hotels in this price range.

<Content>Style and Value, but Some Quirks This hotel has stylish rooms, clean and in good condition, for a comparatively good price in Singapore, but you'll need to know some quirks. In November 2006, we got a Bookend room with a bit more space, and the price of about US$109 per night was good for downtown Singapore. We liked the glass-wall rooftop pool. The big plasma tv was nice, and breakfast had plenty of variety. But some things to consider - mainly location. The hotel is on the river, a 15 minute walk from the Clarke Quay restaurants/night life - but not a short walk to most tourist areas, and the nearest subway stop is about a 20-25 minute walk. While our room was big, the bathroom was tiny and cramped - you have to close the door to get to the toilet - and the only light switch for the bathroom was on the headboard of the bed, artsy but inconvenient. When we checked in with a lot of heavy bags, there wasn't a bell clerk in sight. And finally, guests for ALL ROOMS must take two different elevators (changing on the 3rd floor) to get from the lobby to their rooms. If you don't plan to use the subway (the most convenient way to get around Singapore for tourists), and you want a good price for a clean room, this hotel is okay, but don't expect everything to be simple.

<Content>An Unique Hotel I stayed at this hotel on 2 -6 Jan 2007 at Gallery Room. This hotel have an unique building including the room decoration. The room and bathroom are very clean, comfortable and spacious. The staffs are friendly and helpfull. The corridor along way to the room is also nice and bright. Just one thing, I didn't like the bed because the bed has wheel...so the bed is liitle bit noisy and unstable. If you sit on the edge, the top of the bed will moving up.

<Content>Arty but not comfortable This is the last hotel I stayed in during my most recent trip to Singapore. Although it is very arty if you like that type of thing it is far from comfortable. As in a previous review the beds are rock hard and you may as well sleep on the floor. The steel girders passing trhough the room are also quite bizarre. The was no desk so not great if you need to get some work done. Also if like me you want to go and put your feet up in the bar and have a beer or two then you will be dissapointed as they have tiny plastic stools for you to pirch on. Food in the restaurant was OK.It is ideal to walk down the river to Clarke Quay and dine out in the open air but if I were you I owuld stay on the opposite side of the river in the Copthorne Waterfront

<Content>Trendy hotel that has lost its sheen My normal hotel was full due to the IMF conference so I found the Gallery on Expedia. It looked interesting and was in a part of singapore I have never stayed in before. Though once you are there it looks like it is a stage set or themed area in a big theme park. Getting there from the airport took over 40 minutes by taxi. The decor is very minimalist with lots of stone, marble, steel etc. To get to your room you have to take one lift to the fourth floor (where the resturant is) and then get another to the bedrom floor. On opening the bedroom door the first thing that struck me was the ingrained dirt around the keycard holder inside the room. The bedroom door also needed a good clean. The room was very stuffy and smelled musty, as did the corridors. I got the impression the carpets have never been cleaned. The room has a central control panel for the aircon, ligts, tv etc. This was not working and i had to call reception who sent up an engineer who took about 30 minutes to arrive. This later malfunctioned again at 1am and started switching the TV off and on at random. Also the aircon went off and I couldnt switch off the bedside lights. After a call to reception they sent someone up who couldn't fix it so offered to call out an engineer but i insisted they get me another room, which they did.I was on a business trip and so had reports to write. The rooms have free broadband connection which is a very nice and rare feature. I only wanted a sandwich to eat so i went to their cafe. They said their kitchen closed at 6pm but they could get me something from the upstairs resturant if I wanted. I said I would just go up their myself. I had to wait about five minutes to be seated as the only waitress was on the phone. The menu is a bit sparse and unimaginative but the tenderloin I had was very good. I only ate in the resturant on one of the three nights as there were private functions on Fri  Sat. Overall the hotel is ok if you like that sort of thing, I have stayed in a lot worse but there are better hotels in Singapore for the same or not much more money. Very young and inexperienced staff.

<Content>Good value option for business or leisure Stayed in this hotel for 10 nights and grew to love its simplicity. Modern European-style design touches and a quiet location next to the river but in easy walking distance of many bars and restaurants - e.g. at Clarke Quay. Free broadband in all rooms (wired, not wireless). Stayed in all 3 basic types of room and there's not much between them except size of the bed - all are compact but well thought out and clean. Room service menu and restaurant/ bar area are fine and reasonable value for a hotel - but of course you can do much better dining out of the hotel. Highly recommended if you're on a medium budget (internet rates start around 158++ SGD) and good for the busiess traveller. Not near Orchard Road but cabs are plentiful and cheap. Will definitely return - business or pleasure.

<Content>Worst hotel experience anywhere! Precious time wasted in return for frustration! Its slogan reads The hotel that inspires. But it's more like the hotel that messes things up.ROOM: I had the same problem with the double bed room. We made a request for a double bed room and were told that they were full by the time we checked in. We repeatedly asked the manager to tell us how the higher-grade room is different and the only thing he could tell us was that the bed was bigger and the price was higher. Our only option was to upgrade for some SGD35 a night, which we reluctantly did. A front-desk girl (who spoke poor English) then brought us up to our room. We opened the door with the room key we had just been given only to discovered it was ALREADY OCCUPIED. Someone's luggage and shoes were in the room. A lot of embarrassment was already saved because those people were not in the room at the time, but it's very scary to think that someone can just walk into our room the same way when we were out. We had to go back down to front desk, where the manager told us that he had marked that room for us at the same time that another front desk staff did for someone else and the record had not yet shown the room as occupied. But that was clearly a lie because the people that occupied that room had not just checked in, they were already out of their room. Finally we were given another double bed room. The same girl brought us up again, then when we reached the 5/F the manager popped out or the backstairs and led us to the other side of the hallway saying he's arranged another room for us instead and will waive our upgrade charges becasue of the incident that had just happened. We finally settled down in the room, which was very small (I reckon it's a room of the original grade, they had just said the double bed rooms were full so we'd get an upgrade) We were in the room for a few minutes when a bellboy rang our doorbell and brought us three pieces of luggage that DID NOT belong to us!OVERALL: I believe there's a lot of better hotel choices for this price. I personally believe the Gallery Hotel deserves a rating of no more than three stars. The hotel (lobby, rooms, restaurants, swimming pool) is a lot smaller than its website would have you believe. The room was not at all clean. We found a couple hairs on the bed before we even opened the cover. As another reviewer here mentioned, the shower curtain was moldy. Our room had the view of a construction site right across the street, which is the same view they have at the restaurant where breakfast buffet is served. And by the looks of it, that construction will go on for a lot longer.LOCATION: Don't believe anyone who tells you the Gallery Hotel is 10-minute walking distance from the MRT station. The closest station is Clarke Quay but It's way too far to walk. There are bus stops behind the hotel that would lead to most popular destinations, but if you plan on relying on the MRT, this is not where you want to stay.GOOD: ONE concierge guy was very helpful when we asked for bus information. But just that one.

<Content>Does it really inspire? We stayed here for 3 nights and although we booked a double room we were given a twin. We were informed we had to upgrade if we wanted a double (which we reluctantly did). What was more annoying was that the room was smaller even though it was advertised as being larger. For two people we really struggled with the limited space (not enough storage for cloths).To top it off the staff were really unhelpful, and suggested that as it is a boutique hotel, room size doesn't count. If the staff seemed interested in you we would have been happier, but no one here was willing to do anything out of the ordinary to help.Secondly, the room was in need a decorating. The shower curtain was mouldy, the carpet stained (incidentally the twin room we were orginially offered had a awful musty smell - this too was a reason for upgrading). The electrics (lights/aircon) were unpredictable.Would I stay hear again? Most certainly not. There are far better hotels in the city. Would I recommend this hotel? No!On a plus side, the bed was confortable, and the conceirge very helpful.Their logo is The hotel that inspires. Unfortunately they have a long way to go to achieve this.

<Content>Style Over Substance My wife and I stayed at the Gallery for two nights in Nov. 2005.The hotel is situated along the river at Robertson Quay, a pleasant ten minute walk from the Clarke Quay development or a ten minute taxi ride to the shopping area on Orchard Road.Our stay started poorly. Having arrived in Singapore on a late-evening flight from Hong Kong, we arrived at the hotel around 1 AM and were informed that our non-smoking 鈥淏ookend Club鈥?room, booked through the hotel鈥檚 web site and confirmed with a credit card, was not available. Fortunately, a lovely smoking room was available. So then what was it that was guaranteed? Oh, just the room, not the non-smoking bit. Hmm, it didn鈥檛 mention that in the confirmation email, and their web site lists 鈥渘on-smoking鈥?as an option when you book. Apparently that means at their option.One whiff of the smoking floor had us upgrading to whatever available non-smoking room they had, which turned out to be an Observatory Suite. Our suite was a pretty big room on the corner of the building looking southwest over the river, and though visually interesting was very cold. Not cold as in lacking visual/emotional appeal, but literally cold as in 19 C (66 F) despite setting the thermostat to 30 C and setting the fan speed to minimum (there鈥檚 no way to turn it off completely). Their fix the next day brought the temperature up to a balmy 21 C (70 F). The desk kindly informed me on check-out that yes, the air conditioning was too strong and that it was probably due to the weather, and that other rooms also had problems with their air conditioning, some being too hot, others being too cold. Right, and I won鈥檛 be paying because my credit card is maxed out, I鈥檓 unemployed and I don鈥檛 have any cash. At least that鈥檚 what I should have said.The hotel and rooms are attractively designed, but other problems crept up in our room. One non-opening window wasn鈥檛 well sealed and allowed lots of traffic noise in. The glass bathroom was annoyingly small, especially when there was plenty of room to spare in the Observatory Suite. The attractive tub didn鈥檛 work well as a shower stall being raised above the floor level and curved at the bottom.On the upside, the included in-room internet service worked perfectly, and the breakfast buffet was varied and tasty. The pool looked pretty nice.Staff was friendly enough, if a bit young and giggly at times. The front desk staff appears to be well practiced at deflecting complaints and giving excuses.We probably wouldn鈥檛 have felt so ripped had we gotten our original Bookend room at SG$168, but at SG$238 for the Observatory, this was a pretty bad deal.

<Content>Great design, poor staff My wife, brother-in-law and myself stayed at The Gallery on route to NZ from the UK for 3 nights in Sept 05. First impressions of hotel were not good - reception staff were hopeless took around 30-40mins to check in (not what you want after 20hrs travelling!!!).Thought rooms were above average, clean and quiet - was impressed with bathroom but I also spent ages looking for the lightswitch!!The breakfast buffet restaurant was excellent - fairly good choice but all very tasty (both western and asian). Also there is 3 iMacs in the restaurant (handy for checking that days weather in Singapore)Location of hotel is good as well, 10-15 mins walk along the river to Clarke Quay and 20-30mins walk from Orchard Road. Althought I would suggest taxis as they are really cheap. Avoid the MRT at all costs - trains are clean and efficient but trying to buy a ticket is another matter!!!Pool area at hotel is good - contruction work going on across the road from the hotel which slightly spoils the relaxed atmosphere at the pool. Also, to get to the pool you must walk along a floor which is a designated smoking floor :-(After a refreshing stop at The Gallery we were ready to move on to NZ that is after we had to deal with the reception staff again...... My wife and I were booked into a Bookend Room - which included a free mini-bar (as advertised on thier website at the time) but when we checked out we were told that this was not included as we had booked through an agent. This left us with a S$50 bill to pay!!! After much hassle and protesting we were let off without having to pay the bill. All in all the hotel was above par, except the staff who where very unprofesional and for that reason I would advise looking elsewhere before staying here.

<Content>Not bad, but could be better I just stayed at the Gallery hotel this Fri and Sat.The breakfast and swimming pool were very good. Overall, I think this hotel offers great values. I thought the FREE internet connections at the business was very good. I will probably stay there again.I did have some problems with my room. First of all, there were no sign at all for the bathroom's light. I had to call the frontdesk to ask. Amazingly, no one answered the phone. There was water dripping inside the elavator. The bathroom on the ground floor was a mass. wet toliet paper on the floor, the sink was leaking. They also hire lots of rookies at the reception. They were very slow when I checked out.The location is cleary bad. You need to walk for a long time to get to the MRT.

<Content>A hip hotel The hotel was very modern especially the glass sided swimming pool which never got busy. The hotel has a few eating places and I found the food to be excellent. A pleasant 10 minute walk from the hotel brings you to Clarke Quay which is full of restaurants/bars and where the nearest MRT station is located. The hotel staff were very helpful whenever I needed their assistance. The hotel could do with abit of a repaint but this did not spoil my stay at the hotel.

<Content>Nothing Special - Good Price I did stay one night at the gallery hotel in Sept 2005.The hotel is good. Definetely not the best hotel in singapore.The design is definitely nice and the room interior is interesting.It is not an expensive hotel and the quality of the materials is not top.But architecturaly it is a very interesting hotel.The hotel is old though and not as clean as one would expect.There was dust in the bathroom and furniture (unacceptable to me).Service was very good. i did not have breakfast so I can not comment on that.I believe a better maintenance and cleaning would make it much much better.I was lucky enough to get wifi connection from different sources probably around the hotel.A week later I did stay at the Carlton Hotel and I could say that it was much better/cleaner and the location was better. But I also did pay 15 USD more.

<Content>Can have a try To be frank, my stay in Gallery Hotel is fine. The hotel is bit away from the MRT station. To give you all a rough idea on how far it would be from the MRT station, if by walking, it would take approximately 20 minutes. However, during these 20 minutes, you would get a nice view on the riverside and walk pass the famous clarke quay.And if by taxi, it would take approximately SGD4.50 to go from the hotel to Orchard Road and SGD2.50 from the hotel to Suntec City.If someone is travelling in small group (2 persons), I would suggest to take the airport shuttle when you arrive Singapore. It would cost you SGD7 per head and it is a door-to-door service. But if you are travelling in three or more, better take the taxi.The hotel itself is neat and hip. If you want to try something called boutique hotel. Try this.

<Content>Perfect Getaway for Locals  I'm a local.. Stayed for a night on our anniversary, and wished we could have stayed longer! Decor was Hip  Funky, very unique. Stayed in Glazzhaus corner room, just above the swimming pool. I believe it was the best room anyone could have, although no nice city view, it seemed more spacious than other rooms. Services was excellent, they even let me surf the internet as they try to get me the room i requested. Only little flaw was that the controls of the lightings  aircon which was inbuilt into the bed-head was slightly faulty (and i had to bath in the dark), but the friendly maintenance team repaired the controls TWICE for us without any signs of grumbles. Buffet breakfast was excellent and wide spread, and we could even request how we want the eggs done. Located at the hotel are popular clubs called Coco Latte  Liquid Room. Noticed many other young couples staying over too. I highly recommend it to everyone! you wont regret it.

<Content>Not as good as we had hoped This hotel initially looked good, was modern, popular with the singaporeans and had all that a young crowd would enjoy however during our stay it did not live up to our expectations.We paid for the higher end of room and for what we paid for the room was tiny! everything in the room was smaller in size - could not fit two people in the bathroom, the cupboard could not fit our one standard sized suitcase. The room was worn and same with the hallways.Normally what a hotel lacks it makes up with in other areas but we didnt see this during our stay and unfortunatley would not stay here again.The hotel lacked service and when we needed things we often had to ask twice! There was no room directory and after asking we never got one. Alot has gone into the modern building design - so much that in order to get to our rooms we had to take two lifts every time.The pool was very nice however funnily enough sticking with the modern design the deck chairs were uncomfortable. There is also a pool bar.Breakfast was nice and a great variety.Location was great, being right on the river. Taxi's were always nereby to catch at the hotel. Although their isnt an mrt this did not bother us. At night we would walk to clarke quay - only 10 mins whihc was great. there are lots of building of new bars etc nearby and it looks like the area will be fairly trendy soon.I always hate reading the bad reviews but i have tried to think yes i had a great stay but it was only okay.This hotel has some much potential and with the right management and refurbishment of the worn down rooms and hallways it would make such a difference.overall we paid a little bit more than normally you would in singapore and did not feel we received our monies worth.
