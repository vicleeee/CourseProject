<Content>just very good situated Date: december 11, 2008Reviewer: A TripAdvisor Member, Roosendaal  We have just returned from 2 days at the Hotel V frederiksplein Amsterdam. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before. It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel to go to the city at all. It was so cold and busy there, we couldn't wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of the hotel. We stayed on the secondflore room 308. The room was nice romantic but not spacious. Breakfast was very lovely and you can get coffee,thea and fruit the whole day for free.The music is great and they have a nice fireplace where infront you can lounge and see the fabulous life of Amsterdam.We paid éˆ§?9 per night for a room incl. breakfast which we thought excellent value if you want to mix a little luxury with the possible trips then this is an absolute mustOverall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holiday and I am extremely fussy!

<Content>Could have been perfect! This hotel is a sample of what you can do right with a hotel... it is almost perfect in style, friendliness, and even location (although it is on the outskirts of what you would consider the pure center)... if it weren't for the size of the rooms it would be one of the best I've stayed in... It is true about the basement rooms, where you can touch the grass outside if you put your hand out of the high window...The rooms are really cool-looking modern style but matchbox sized, the toilet is surprisingly decent sized and not worse decorated than the room and the beds are very comfortable. Breakfast is just average, bread, snacks, fruit... nothing really special about it...Business services are great! you get free internet, a wi-fi connection that actually works (and fast) plus you get a free drink and free coffee and tea.Overall it was a great experience!

<Content>Excellent Location / Friendly Staff / Great Time After arriving at central station it was short tram ride to the hotel. It is in a great location to explore the city with all the main attractions a walkable distance (or just grab a tram pass if you want).The hotel staff were all really friendly and gave us some great tips on where to eat and go out- invaluable local knowlege to keep you out of the tourist traps! The rooms are compact but perfectly acceptable and very well designed with an amazing rain water shower. We were treated to a free drink at the bar on arrival and complimentary tea and coffee / internet throughout. Plus tyhe breakfasts were fab.I will definitely be returning to the Frederiksplein on my next trip to 'dam.

<Content>Relaxed Luxury I visited some friends in Amsterdam recently and opted to stay at the Hotel V... primarily because of its location and stylish ambiance.I was not disappointed. The price quality ratio was on par and the personal attention (especially from Marlon who seems to know ALL the good places in Amsterdam) made me feel right at home. If you are looking for a nice, cosy, friendly, stylish, centrally located hotel with a personal touch, you cant go wrong by staying here for a day or three. Rick PS: Auping beds... heaven!

<Content>Not worth the money I stayed at Hotel V in October 2008 during a weekend trip to Amsterdam. I had read the reviews on Tripadvisor and it sounded like a decent hotel. I was, however, disappointed by the hotel and do not recommend it.I booked a single room for 79 euros, which plus tax really costs 83 euros. While the hotel has a nicely decorate lobby-restaurant area, my room was located in the basement of a building behind the main building. The room was tiny, had no more furniture than a bed and a little side table, and had no windows. The sheets of the bed were dirty, so I had to ask the reception to get them changed. The building is very old, so one can hear everything from the other rooms and the floor above. The positive things of this hotel: it is centrally located, at walking distance from most sites, with several tram stops right across the street; internet is free and breakfast is included, although it's not great. The girl at the reception was very nice.If you decide to stay here, it is worth paying a bit more for a decent room. There are better options in Amsterdam. Hotel Piet Hein is nearby and is a nicer hotel.

<Content>Awesome hotel, funky  This hotel's service is truly unique and stands above the rest. I travel about 40% of the time for my job  this hotel is the best one I have stayed in for the past three years from a customer service perspective.Objectively, the rooms are small, but who cares as the room was neat, clean, bed was big, comfortable, shower was great  it had everything I needed.More importantly the staff guided me around Amsterdam after work hours to make my stay truly memorable. They have bikes to rent (suggested), free coffees, a free drink when you arrive, a funky bar area, free Mac internet access. Wow.This place truly sets the bar high for others to match - I have already emailed my network to say this is the place when in Amsterdam  it is a GREAT VALUE!

<Content>Falling below advertised image We booked our stay via the hotel's website and then had to change our date. When we arrived the booking had not been made. Fortunately, there were still free rooms available. The weather was cold but there was no heating in the bathroom. The shower, on the other hand, was broken so that one could not use it without scalding oneself. The friendly girl at reception apologised but that was that éˆ¥?Overall impression: great location but painting everything black does not make a boutique hotel

<Content>Anniversary in A'Dam Found Hotel V through Splendia hotels website. Emailed the hotel to tell them it was our wedding aniversary, got a reply within the hour saying that their concierge would contact me by phone - what service. Marlon (concierge) was very helpful, making suggestions to fit around what we liked. We went to the Supperclub and had the best seat/bed in the restaurant/club. We recommend the Supperclub though save up a little before going, the bill might take the edge off the perfect evening - its pricey.Hotel V (Frederiksplein) was great. We had a small double room, stylishly done, it was small but I chose it because Amsterdam has so much to see and do that you only need a comfortable bed and a good shower to put your head down. The staff were all very friendly. The service was good, the free tea and coffee and internet all add to the vibe. The styling of the hotel lounge / bar / dining room is great too....the crescent sofa around the fireplace was our favourite very funky.I didnt want to spend a great deal on accomodation in A'dam and was very pleasantly surprised at the standard of service we found for our pound (buck / euro / etc). I'd like to recommend it but we dont want it to fill up with package tourists stopping us going and pushing prices up, so don't go to Hotel V its ours !!!!Thanks to all the staff there especially Marlon (next time JWoo for sure).

<Content>Loved Hotel V We stayed at the Hotel V for 3 nights this past long weekend. We had a great time.The hotel is new, and clean. The rooms are a very reasonable size. We stayed in an XL room on the top floor, and it was a decent size for European hotels.The hotel staff, every single one of them, was super-friendly and helpful. They man the desk 24/7, and were always cheerful and fun to talk to. They helped with our requests and gave us other ideas. They also recommended cool local places.The hotel lobby is nice, featuring a semi-circular comfortable couch around this modern fire that is warm and inviting.We did not try breakfast, since we slept in on most days.The noise level is good. It's pretty quiet much of the time. You still do hear occasional noises, like the tram, in the morning. The blackout shades are effective and the room is pretty dark.The location is good, but not amazing. That's probably why the prices are so good. It's really a decent deal.You're a 10-minute walk from most places. Not bad by any means, but not right there.Overall, we enjoyed the hotel a lot.

<Content>NIce hotel Hotel is not expensive. Rooms are very very small but comfortable. Lighting is not a +. Nice to have free internet. CI was not very efficient. I asked if there was internet in the room. Agent confirmedand could hve givenme the code straight away avoiding me calling the front desk (line was busy for a long period). When you have a shower the WC gets all wet. Did not try breakfast.

<Content>Lovely stay at V.. we arrived in the afternoon at hotel V Frederiksplein. Location is perfect right in the city center close to the trendy districts éˆ¥æ¸„e Pijpéˆ¥?and éˆ¥æ·¯trechtsestraatéˆ¥? We were over well med by the astonishing interior and design of the hotel. We were pleased by the nice and friendly staf that gave us a warm welcome at the front desk. I have to say that all the staff (housekeeping, bar and front desk) in the hotel were very friendly and helpful to us.The room was very clean and tidy and also nice and trendy decorated. Most of all we enjoyed the extremely comfortable Auping bed! The only thing that was missing (for the time of the year, summer) in the room was air-conditioning or a ventilator, because it was so hot in the room that we could barely sleep. .The next morning we enjoyed a nice extensive breakfast in the lounge. We were entertained looking at the large see trough window , were the people of Amsterdam were walking around on the street in front of the hotel..We really enjoyed our stay at hotel V Frediksplein, and hope to come back some time!

<Content>Well Worth The Money We stayed here for 5 nights in August, very close to the city centre, you can catch a tram from outside the hotel to all areas. For a good night out head into Leidseplein on the number 7 tram or 10.... the pub the Last Waterhole is a great spot if you want to hear live bands  theres lots of different places to eat - Hotel V staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was very clean - only downfall was the stairs leading to it...... be prepared to climb - but for the time we spent here it was worth it, would definitely stay here again, you get what you pay for - well worth it, once it's clean  staff are nice that does it for me :)

<Content>Great First Impression I stayed at Hotel V for 4 nights in March. Iéˆ¥æª“ pretty sure that the hotel hadnéˆ¥æª› been open for long, but I didnéˆ¥æª› notice any lack in service or facilities. Quite the contrary, Hotel V was a very welcoming and comfortable experience.I stayed in room 310, which included two single beds. While the room was typicallyéˆ¥?snug, I still found it to be comfortable. The bedding was great; I slept well every night. My only complaint was the heating in the room. There was a heater next to the window that sometimes kicked out heat. However, it fell behind the large heavy curtains that needed to be pulled to block out external light for sleeping. The curtains served as insulation to keep the heat from the heater OUT of the rooméˆ¥?but the window was kept warm! I was also nervous about having a curtain rest against the heateréˆ¥?like it would melt or catch on fire while I was asleep. Oh welléˆ¥?thatéˆ¥æªš why I was thankful for the down comforters that came standard with the beds!The lobby of the hotel is the most memorable part of the hotel. Since it is set up in the éˆ¥æ·Ÿiving Rooméˆ¥?style of other hip boutique hotels (or like the W hotels), I was immediately comfortable when I arrivedéˆ¥?tired from long flights. The large couch that encircles the fireplace was a great place to sit and relax, perhaps sipping tea and reading a bookéˆ¥?or eating a herring. I did both. The meeting room had computers set up for internet access. The facilities were just about always available, which was nice. The lobby also includes the breakfast area. Being a big fan of Dutch hotel breakfasts, I can say that I was both excited and pleased by the breakfast options. I donéˆ¥æª› think that things were ever set up on time (breakfast was supposed to start at 7am, maybe? more like 7:30éˆ¥?, but no worries there.Overall, I had an excellent time during my stay at Hotel V. The location was perfect, the staff were friendly, the atmosphere was welcoming, and the room was a tiny cocoon of comfort. I look forward to staying there again in the future!

<Content>Would stay again During seveal visits to Amsterdam previously I have always tried to stay in and around the famous Red light Area. This is the first time we stayed at a hotel a little farther out, but was indeed surprised to find it isn't far out at all, it was very central for all the main tourist areas, Leidesplien and Rembrandtsplien as well as only being 10min from Central Station by tram.The hotel it's self was very clean and modern and although the rooms were quite small they served the purpose perfectly for a three night stay. The buffet breakfast was presented well and was the perfect start to a long day of walking ahead.Hotel staff from the minute we arrived were warm and friendly, and any requests made of them was dealt with efficiently and always with a smile.The whole experience staying at V Hotel was very enjoyable and would be my first choice on my next trip to Amsterdam.

<Content>Great stay in Hotel V My boyfriend and I decided (at the very last minute) to go on a city-trip to Amsterdam, we just had one small problem to conquer and that was to find a hotel room, everything seemed to be booked! Via a friend who lives in Amsterdam I heard about this new hotel, Hotel V, which opened their second hotel in Amsterdam just a few months ago. Browsing through their website I found a very good deal and so I booked. Hotel V is perfectly situated in the centre of Amsterdam and easy to access with public transport (we came driving with our car from Gent, parked it outside Amsterdam and took the tram which stops right in front of the hotel). The hotel has a very nice lounge bar/reception which makes you feel welcome from the moment you enter. There is a nice fire place where you can sit and read (or just watch people passng by on the street) and the interior is trendy and hip but also comfortening and warm, so you don't get this cold feeling which a lot of trendy places give you. Our room was also perfect with a very nice walk-in shower and a big flat screen hanging in front of your bed. The personnel working at the reception was very helpful in finding a restaurant to have dinner in the evening. Hoetl V is situated close to the Utrechtsestraat, a large street full of nice restaurants and cosy bars, you can go on foot and drink as much as you like!After a big and delicious breakfast we headed into the city again and left our luggage to be picked up later in the day. Anyway, we had a great stay inHotel V and I can recommand it to anyone who wants to visit Amsterdam!

<Content>Don't Stay Here! Stay here only if you like living underground with one very small window, no way to cool an extremely hot room, no daily room service and inaccurate bills. Checked in and was put in a basement room with one window at ceiling level that measured about 1' x 2' and opened onto the ground. The room was over 90 degrees and no way to cool it as the hotel doesn't offer AC. Opened the window onto the ground but was afraid rats might climb into my room. (The next morning all the guests were complaining to the front staff about the roomséˆ¥?heat so I know it wasn't just my room.) Although advertised as offering daily room service my room never got cleaned during my stay. At checkout they tried to charge a rate 30 Euros per night more than the reservation. I had to produce an original of my reservation to get the correct rate. Don't stay at this hotel if you like to sleep in a comfortable, clean and relaxing room.

<Content>reVistalised at Hotel V I would recommend Hotel V to anyone trying to search out a hip hotel, minus the crazy price tag. The location in Amsterdam is great, just a stones throw away from all major attractions. yet at a good distance from other over crowded tacky tourist areas.The staff were super friendly and on hand 24 hours.Not the most spacious of rooms, but all space is maximised to its fullest potential and decorated in a simplistic yet chic manner.Hotel V was a great place to reVitialise your energy.Sarah Rank - UK

<Content>Cool hotel We spent 2 nights at the hotel for a weekend in Amsterdam. Booking was simple and efficient and we received a warm welcome upon arrival. The staff were always friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The double room on the top floor was very tastefully decorated, with carefully chosen colours and expensive fabrics. The bed itself was extremely comfortable. An added bonus was the absence of carpet.Breakfast was copious with warm fresh croissants and served in the attractive open area near reception. The whole atmosphere of the place was calm and relaxing - a real haven after the buzz of the city. The location is perfect at the edge of the town centre with a frequent tram service in all directions.

<Content>Perfection exists We spent an excellent weekend at Hotel V. Ideally situated, the hotel has a beautiful lobby with open fire, where the generous breakfast is taken in the morning. The rooms are nicely furnished and comfortable, especially the Auping beds. The staff at the reception is exceptionally friendly and the Internet stations are free. Absolutely recommandable place to enjoy a stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>Great breakfast We had a long weekend here on a budget so were in a standard double room which was small but very comfortable. The bathroom was of an exceptional standard  the only complaint I could make was the lack of storage for clothes, although our room had enough space for a small chest of drawers. The staff were very friendly, the free internet access was a bonus, the breakfast was superb  the transport links to the centre were very handy. All in all, a great choice!

<Content>For me a perfect hotel I travel 130 days a year for work and I need a hotel that is high on comfort and friendliness but low on ceremony and overbearing staff overkill.As a traveler, those 5 star hotels drive me nuts. I prefer to be left alone and not nickled and dimed to death. 5 dollar bottles of mini-bar water and 12 dollar nuts from a crew of people with their hands out for a tip for their fake smiles are not my idea of a comfortable stay.I truly love this hotel. From the time I arrived to the time I left, the staff went out of its way to help me with everything. Imagine a 3 star hotel with the willingness to help you with train tickets, restaurant recommendations to places with great food instead of places they will get commissions for, and a true warm greeting every time you walk in the door.Breakfast was served each day with a nice selection of fruit, pastry, and more. The Internet was wifi and included in my hotel rate. (unlike other hotels that usually stick me for an additional 25 to 20 bucks a day.)I had the smallest room in the hotel in a downstairs part of the hotel. It was plenty big for me though and really comfortable and cozy. The bathroom was clean and the bed was comfortable. I asked for a stand for my suitcase and I was at home.I would say that if you come to this hotel expecting a 5 star hotel with all the amenities and extra costs, you will be disappointed. If you come expecting the friendliest, cleanest and most inviting hotel I have ever stayed in Amsterdam, you will join me in loving this place. From now on, this is my home when I visit Amsterdam.

<Content>hell personified to make it short it was by far the worst experience in my travel both in india and abroad. we visited 8 different countries during our european tour and the only moment we regret is when we choose this hotel to stay. the front office had only people with very little knowledge of english and very little IQ. sorry to say our rooms were vacated without our consent when we were sitting in their own internet place just in front of the reception and they suddenly say that they do not have a room for us. completely taken off guard they could not even find an alternative room or place for us. we had to call india and book a room in amsterdam. the rooms less said the better. if you havent seen concentration camps you can see one here. booking room on the internet has its own disadvantages as the rooms shown on the pics are different from the ones you are going to stay. any body over six feet will not be able walk in the room without hitting the doors

<Content>Skip it Nice try at design, but incredibly unpractical. LOTS of sharp edges in the rooms. Very THIN walls. The doors in the hallways are always slamming. Average breakfast. Nice staff. GREAT beds. CLEAN room. Unfortunately, this place is overpriced for what you get. Wow... how can the doors slam so hard? Is this the 90th time since 06.30??? No need for an alarm clock

<Content>Fabulous Frederiksplein in Amsterdam You have got to try this place when in Amsterdam! Very chic property with a staff that is absoultely fabulous in helping your stay in the city be an awesome experience. This hotel is an easy 20 minute walk from the Central rail station right through the heart of the city. Puts you a stones throw away fom the heinken brewery and museum. Your right on top of a Tram stop and the Metro is a few blocks away so moving around is easy. But the greatest part is that being south of the Central station and not in the actual downtown actually puts you in a better central location to explore in all directions and discovery shopping, site seeing and eating places that far exceed the travel guides. Don't get me wrong, you are also in a perfect spot to see the big attractions too, by foot, bicycle, Tram, Metro or bus. The hotel breakfast is top notch. The bar is even better! You will absolutely love this place!!!

<Content>miles away and tiny.com! This was booked thru a friend of a Hen party I went with. I have stayed in Amsterdam six times before and for ease (and less expense) try to stay as near to central station as possible!The problems started when our cab drivers didnt know where they were going, however the hotel being fairly new it was prob expected! There was 10 people in the party and two cabs cost us 40Euro.Upon entering the Hotel you are blown away by the modern way the decor is and how welcoming and friendly it looked! I was more than pleased even if I didnt have a clue where we were based!We got our 5 sets of keys and just picked them from the table randomly, the guy on reception didnt advise us as to how to get to our room and we had a bit of a run around looking for it...The lift struggles to fit 2 people over size 16 in it with luggage (alot of hilarity though for us still at this point!!).I was sharing with my gay friend and requested a twin room, we asked were it was and we were shown a seperate building down a ramp at the back of the main entrance area!The Bed appeared to be a small double but we soon discovered was 2 (small) singles pushed together. To emphasize the size of the rooms all i can say is if you are built like Kylie and staying in a double on your own you will be fine!!!!Absolutely beautiful decor but nowhere to put our cases, no mirror, no dressing table or drawers, the wardrobe was a recess in the wall with no hangers or shelves in it and a white curtain! The bathroom was even worse! There was a black plastic stool with 4 (equally small) towels and a hairdryer (the only normal sized thing in the place!!)placed on it, this prevented you being able to sit on the toilet! Once we had reasssembled our room so we could actually fit in it, going to the Loo still proved a chore asyou had to slide your legs under the sink to sit on it!!the shelf over the sink (presumably for your toileteries) was about 3 inch deep by 12 inch long! Just about held our toothbrushes and toothpaste!. The shower was really funky and based on a wetroom feel, again tiny and inappropriate as no door, so the whole bathroom got soaked (and anything you took in there too, which wud have to sit on the toilet seat!Yuk!)The windows were long sash ones and had black out blinds to pull down, if you didnt totally pull these down people checking in and having breaki could see you in bed! The blinds also let bright daylight in the sides defeating the object of them! The ramp outside the room was like decking and was on two long levels, you can imagine the noise from people arriving with cases, coming home after night out and staff back and too with trolleys of rubbish and laundry!Back to first night, we asked the lovely guy at reception how far we were from red light district, he told us approx 40min walk?!?!?The trams 25 and 7 stop outside but finish at 12.30am. We wanted water for our room and with it being midnight the bar was shut, we asked were we could get some refreshments (always available in red light area and surrounding) He looked quite perplexed as he told us it was 3 tram stops away?! And then he didnt know if it would be open!!!Two of the ladies with us were the Hens mother and Auntie and their room was a single (three quarter bed!) it was in the basement with tiny box windows atthe top of the walls and was even smaller than ours!! These ladies are touching 60 and were told in no uncertain terms that their rooms could not be changed (no apology!) They ended up topping and tailing!!! (bloody good job me and Christopher didnt end up in 007!!) The stairs everywere are extremely steep and usually spiral with no handrails.Second night we got back approx 10.30 and asked about any snacks, we were offered a choice of prepacked anchovy sarni, chorizo sarni or stilton pear and veg (??!!??) sarni! No ta! Ill eat most with the best of em but made do with a mini box of pringles!.Breakfast room was in the foyer on iron chairs and you have guessed it, tiny tables! Beautiful continental though and staff so lovely.I think this hotel has early teething probs and maybe should have concentrated on space rather than cowskin hide and pebbles, its extremely overpriced for the size of it and the location ( 104 shiny pounds per night!) maybe half ofthat price would be more suitable based on other hotels.Have stayed in all sorts from hostels to 5 star in The Dam but this is the first time I have felt compelled to write in!We made the most of it and came home shuntin sideways like crabs but would reccomend you to find somewhere nearer to town and bigger (unless your a size zero!!) will maybe laugh about it in a few week!!

<Content>Cramped and Cold Rooms We stayed at the hotel when it had just opened and advertised being a four star design hotel, so we expected a funcky design, cool new clean rooms and nice bed. The floors in the room were black looked well worn and so cold, my partner hardly feels the cold and could not walk on the floors in bare feet. The rooms were so tiny, there was no desk or table to put bags or anything ion in fact, you could not even walk around the sides of the bed. No draws or any space to hang or put clothes and jackets. No robes or Slippers or toiletries (except soap) on offer. In the bathroom we had to put the toilet seat down to have somewere to place our towels and toiletries while we showered, It fell below the ranks of a cramped and tiny room. Lift could only fit one person at a time and the hallways were all black, showing every mark and looking worn already. Staff were friendly.

<Content>So So... Very trendy looking  modern but I was a little disappointed. The hotel is quite a way from the city centre, it took us about 20 mins to walk to Dam Square. I recommend taking the tram, number 25 goes from Centraal Station to right outside the hotel and runs about every 15 mins. The staff were relatively pleasant, however my requests for an iron went unanswered and the room was only cleaned once in our 3 night stay. The 'breakfast' consists of bread, ham, cheese, jam, cold eggs and some mini pastries. All in all I would say that there are other three star hotels in Amsterdam that would provide a much better base for exploring the city.

<Content>Clean, cool, Dutch design at an affordable design, with a great location. Pretty good balance of design and value located within easy walking distance to Rembrandtplein. Rooms are typical Dutch small, but very well designed with a cozy lobby area for gathering with friends in front of the mod fire pit and comfy sofa. If you like cool, clean design, you'll like it here.
