<Content>This hotel was a dream come true! My sister and I are in our early twenties and decided to take a trip to the United states for the first time, stopping in Boston 5 days and then onto New York for another 5 days. We were very nervous about booking this hotel, I was worried we would be far from our friends who we were travelling with and who had decided to stay in the Howard Johnson, but Hotel 140 was more than we could have hoped for, it was wonderful, the staff so helpful and the room so lovely and clean, we had a great time, and after a busy day exploring the city, we looked forward to coming back to it, cannot recommend it more! Through booking with expedia it wasmuch cheaper than staying in the howard johnson and right in the middle of Boston City, we were right beside the John Hancock building, so once we found the hotel we never lost are way.

<Content>Hidden Treasure in the Middle of Boston! Fantastic stay! Everything was just perfect and the price was even better. It was a what we wanted -- a quiet, clean, non-chain feel and a great price. The pristine new lobby with old building charm was a great welcome. The front desk was very helpful and knew their stuff! It's just steps from Copley Place and Newbury Street! Wonderful experience and a great weekend getaway for me and my husband. We highly recommend it. Kudos to the staff!

<Content>Only consider if under $120/night. While the location is great and the staff friendly and helpful, the room was all Y and no boutique. A permanent (I assume) resident next door had a home stereo that sent booming bass and techno pulsing through the walls beginning at 7:20am. The room had a linoleum tiled floor, basic oak dorm-like furniture and the shower was too tiny to work very well. If you get a super low rate (under $120, maybe), this location may be enough enticement. Otherwise, I'd skip it.

<Content>Great Location, Price and Staff! While the accomodations are not as spacious as the Marriott Copley, you are definitely not paying Marriott prices. For its amazing location (next to the Amtrak station, right off the Mass Pike and one block from Copley Sqaure), the rates that this hotel charges are well-below market value. The room was spotless, and the staff were warm and welcoming.

<Content>Sleeping fully dressed on top of the bed, while listening to next door's music I was sure I was in the wrong place during my first trip around the block. When I stopped to ask a fellow who was cleaning the front of the YWCA if he knew where the hotel was he answered.. RIGHT HERE.. I should have kept on walking. The front desk was pleasant, but that is where it stopped. Up the lift to my floor I felt something was wrong. The lift's doors open to a hallway that could have come out of an 80's school horror film, which in turn lead to a door that did not look like it should lead to a hotel room, but to a cleaning closet/office. The room was sparse to say the least. First things that I noticed were:a) no carpet anywhereb) a tiny double bedc) ceiling tiles that reminded me of an old officeThe washroom was large, but I did not feel that anything was clean, even though I did not want to be in the room without shoes on. In fact I slept on top of the bed fully dressed for the duration of my stay. If you are looking for affordable lodging in Boston, and are not looking for anything above 2 stars this might be a fit for you. If you are used to something above these standards move along!

<Content>Hotel 140-worth a try We stayed at the Hotel 140 for 3 nights in early October. We first read about the Hotel 140 in travel books and then read the reviews. We decided to give it a try. Our experience there was just the opposite of some of the other reviewers.. We had trouble locating the hotel but just called and they guided us right to the front door. We checked in on a Saturday and had the nicest staff (man a woman) check us in. The rooms and bed are small but the room was very clean. The location in the Back Bay can't be beat-public transportation is close. Any questions we had for the front desk were answered thouroughly. This isn't your 5 star hotel with a pool and spa but if you are looking for affordable accomodations in the heart of Boston this the place. If you plan on spending all day in your room this isn't the place. If you plan on being gone and seeing Boston and have a limited budget, this is the place. We would stay here again.

<Content>Cheapest room but it shows I used all the big name online travel discount sites and this hotel came back as the cheapest for that weekend with decent reviews. It was difficult to find, as the hotel is unmarked since it shares it's space with a YWCA. I kept walking in circles because I could believe the YWCA was the correct location. I booked a 2 bed suite, but when I arrived, they informed me that none were available so I had to settle for a single bed. My cell phone didn't work in Boston that weekend, so I could call expedia.com about it. The room was extremely cramped, basically just fit the bed, the dresser/tv and a nightstand. The bathroom was tiny. These things didn't bother me that much since I'm from NYC, so am used to tight quarters. My main concern was that I saw and killed at least 3 bugs (not roaches...maybe bed bugs?) on the bed. I asked about using the internet and there was only one, so you needed to keep asking if it was open. POSITIVES: It was very centrally located and I could walk to everywhere I needed easily. They did have a cafeteria style breakfast in the morning.

<Content>Never Again This hotel is lacking in every way. The hotel is unmarked; I had to ask a meter maid outside if this was the right building. It is shared with a YWCA; I'm here on a business trip, but instead of being around other business people - or even families - I'm sharing space with a youth hostel.The hotel room space is adequate for a business trip, except that the bed is too small, the desk' is too small for even my modest laptop, the ironing board is a tabletop model (but there's no table!), there is no carpeting, and there is insufficient lighting. Walking back to my hotel at 10:00 at night - not that late, on a weeknight - I did not feel the least bit safe.I will ensure that my company, who booked this room for me, never send another employee to this property. For only a few dollars more, any other option would be preferable.

<Content>Good location but not a hotel .... We picked this 'hotel' predominantly because of the price given that Boston hotels are notoriously expensive - not to say it was a cheap option.Please be aware this place is not a hotel, it is part of the YWCA building that has been converted into for want of a better description nice ensuite dorm rooms. On our floor there were definitely people living in their rooms not just visiting.Saying that the place is very clean, if perhaps a little clinical in the corridors, it feels like a school or office block. There are no real guest facilities apart from a cafe down the stairs that is officially part of the YWCA. Biggest pain - the bed a 'double' which was effectively a big single bed so it is a little cosy to say the least is travelling with your other half .. saying that the small bed was very comfortable.This is an ok place if you are after clean accommodation but the bed and lack of any real hotel service would put me off from going back.

<Content>Not a pleasant experience Just got back from a trip to Boston. We were supposed to stay here 3 nights but it was so terrible we moved. This place is not a hotel - it is a glorified rooming house. There is not a menu of services in the rooms, because the hotel offers very little in the way of service. The rooms are small. The largest bed they have in the hotel is a full. The TV's are small as are the bathrooms. The showers are so small you can hardly get the shower head arranged so the water actually goes over you. We had to change rooms multiple times because the AC wasn't working, then they put two of us in a room with a single bed. They finally moved us to a floor where loud music was playing until 2 AM. The only scenario in which this might be a good place to stay is if you are staying in Boston for an extended time and need a cheap, conveniently located place to sleep. It is far from luxurious - the linens were cheap and not in good condition.

<Content>The very basic Hotel 140 Last summer my boyfriend and I spent 2 nights in the Hotel 140 and I'm sorry to say that we didnt enjoy our stay there. The location was great, very central to everything, however the hotel was like an old hospital or something that had been converted into a very basic hotel. Our room was tiny and the bed was more like a single than a double, and was very uncomfortable. We were very disappointed with the lack of staff available to take our queries, on a number of occasions we went to the front desk, looking for safety deposit boxes, tourist directions to different attractions, etc. and we either found the front desk empty or with somebody who hadn't a word of English and who couldn't help us at all. This 'hotel' seemed more like a hostel to us and we were glad that we had only 2 nights booked to stay here. On the plus side it was clean and very convienient to the local attractions. We had to depend a LOT on our guide books and the good will of locals in the street for things to see and do in Boston as the staff at the Hotel 140 were very unhelpful.

<Content>Great hotel! I thought this hotel was great. For the price and location, you can't beat it. We stayed on the 7th floor. It was a smaller room, but ample enough space for everything. We had a double bed, which wasn't bad and a nice bathroom. Great location, right by the T and close to Boylston St. I was actually impressed with the hotel. Considering it was a chain, I thought it would be rather hokey, but it was great. The beds were comfy, there is a restaurant downstairs that serves breakfast and lunch, and you are walking distance to just about everything. If you prefer a luxory hotel I suppose this isn't for you, but it sure beats a Hampton Inn or other typical chain hands down. We had a great time and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone heading downtown Boston. Back Bay is a really good area.

What makes this hotel worthwhile is it's location and the cost; it is half the cost of the next cheapest hotel in the city center, and this location allows you to walk to Boston Common, Copley Square, Theatre district, Fenway, and much much more.The room was clean; staff friendly; we did not find it noisy but, we travel with a noise cancelling machine.The shower (no tub) is quirky in that there is NO shelving anywhere to put shampoo, soap, whatever??? The trick, for not flooding the bathroom is to turn the volume all the way down, then adjust the temp, then get in before readjusting the volume.We stayed at the Hotel 140 two nights and figure we saved over $300 to spend on other aspects of our vacation. We would stay here again.

<Content>dreadful choice Tiny rooms, even smaller beds ( a mere double between two people) and absolutely no service. This is more a rooming house than a hotel. Avoid.

<Content>Ok Basic Hotel So we stayed here for about a week and it was a so so experience. The room where we stayed, on the 8th floor, was VERY tiny. I'm willing to admit that this is somewhat normal for moderately priced hotel rooms in the Northeast but this room was smaller than my freshman dorm at college and that's saying something. The bed was not much bigger than a twin but moderately comfortable. The pillows was average and the towels were very scratchy. My room had a small carpet but otherwise linoleum flooring, wasn't very comfortable on the feet in the mornings. The bathroom was extremely small, the shower was barely big enough for one person and the showerhead was completely caked over in calcium deposits. The shower doors also leaked quite a bit which soaked the floor. The shower also has not where for you to place any toiletries so you have to place them all on the shower floor and bend over to use anything which is extremely uncomfortable. Showerhead caddies would be very beneficial. Was somewhat quiet and conveniently located. It was $20 a day to park a car in the adjacent garage. It was just a so so experience. I think I might look for another option if I go back to Boston.

<Content>Don't stay here Don't be fooled by the suggestion that Hotel 140 is a boutique hotel. It is a YWCA that has converted several floors into an over-priced, badly-designed hotel. The beds and pillows are uncomfortable (and tiny), and the walls are paper-thin. We heard EVERYTHING overnight, from the loud people next-door, their toilet, their shower, the elevator, the maid's cell phone ringing the next morning (salsa tones). I got NO decent sleep. Also, the rooms are simply not comfortable. On our floor, at least we had a carpet. But no comfortable furniture, a tiny shower that soaks the bathroom floor when you turn it on... I could go on. We paid over $200 dollars (incl tax) for the room. That price is frankly offensive for what we got. I'm embarassed I paid it.

<Content>Good Value, Great location We arrived early but were the receptionist was very helpful and let us book in early as our rooms were ready. The rooms were clean and comfortable (the beds are only average size doubles) . The hotel is really close to 2 'T' stations and so the city is easily accessible even if you don't like to walk. In the evening a second receptionist gave us some excellent advice regarding eating. The hotel's history makes it an interesting building in its own right and its convenience and price makes it a good place to stay. The staff were all extremely helpful. Boston has great food - enjoy it.

<Content>Higher room rate doesn't mean better, cleaner or quiet Was statying at the Omni Parker House and was very unhappy with the room. Tired, Very Small, Noisy, Noisy, Noisy - After two nights could not take any longer and checked out. Checked into the Hotel 140 after seeing a room - Rooms are small but extremely clean and was very quiet. Staff was helpful and location is great. Parking next to hotel is only $25 vs. $38 at Parker House. Business Computer Room available and free as a bonus. Omni rates were $269, 289, 299, 499 on consective nights. 140 was $169 per night and was larger, cleaner and much quieter. Small but adaquate breakfast/lunch area with excellent food and prices. Great ValueWould go back and plan on doing so in the near future.

<Content>Cheap and Reasonable - nothing special I found Hotel 140 to be distinctly average - it had the basics of bed/TV/friendly staff. The price reflected this. The location was great, especially if you're coming in at South Station.Recommended if you're just looking for a bed for a few nights.

<Content>Horrible Room-Deceptive Hotel First off, if you stay here, don't expect more than a YMCA with a face-lift. I'm writing this as i could not sleep, laying in bed in this boutique hotel.I'm a business person on my first trip to Boston and enjoy staying in boutique hotels to get the full experience/culture of a city. Hotel 140 is in the same building as the YWCA....not good. I believe the property manager for the Y is the owner of the hotel.Here's the list of what I was surprised of:Upon pulling up, there's no parking in front of the hotel, no valet and noone to help you in with your bags. If you do double park, you could get a ticket, as it's a no standing zone. You can park in public lot, short walk from hotel. After I checked in (after waiting for an angry YWCA guest complain about the laundry room not being cleaned for a week) and took the private elevator up to my room, my room key did not work. I then proceeded to wait 15 minutes in a non-air conditioned hallway (80 degrees outside day) for the front desk to figure out a solution. They had to switch my room, since the first room was locked from the inside??After I got into my room, there was not closet!! The only closet that exists is VERY short (height-wise) - could not even hang my suit or a shirt, without it hitting the ground.Room size is ok, but no desk and some ikea looking furniture. I'm pretty sure these were rooms from the YWCA that they converted to a boutique hotel.There is no lock on the doors from the inside - bizarre.There is no turn-down service and there's a sign in the elevator that states the continental breakfast is no longer, as of Aug. 1.In one of the hand towels in the bathroom, there was a long blond hair (I'm a man with short brown hair).There were stains on my sheets - looked like ink. I wondered when the last time the room was cleaned.That's about it - DO NOT RECOMMEND staying here for the price. For $20 more per night, go stay at a reputable chain.

<Content>completely unacceptable I booked with this hotel because of the rate compared with other hotels in the area. The old adage you get what you pay for describes this hotel to a tee.I am writing this review as I *don't* sleep at hotel 140. Why don't I sleep? Well, for one, about once an hour I get treated to some unexplainable noise, roughly akin to a sledgehammer hitting a shotgun shell. Then, with about the same amount of frequency, I'm treated to the groaning of pipes.There are some other things about this hotel, in addition to unexplained and loud noises, that cause me to seriously warn folks about staying here: First, there is no interior lock on my door. That's right, no way for me to lock my door from the inside. Anyone with a master key could walk right in. I could've sworn that was a legal requirement. Secondly, when I turned down my sheets, I found two neatly placed hairs...neither of which were my own. I honestly believe that these sheets were not changed. At the very least, those changing the sheets aren't being very sanitary.Finally, the term boutique is really a deception. It's not trying to define the hotel as quaint...it's a warning term that these rooms are very, very small. You want a desk to work at? Forget about it. A closet for your clothes? Not at this hotel.Ok. You've been warned. If you book inspite of all this, best of luck to you.

<Content>Good budget hotel, basic, basic, basic First of all, we have to start saying that Boston Hotels are quite expensive. So finding a place to stay an average of 120 is a good deal. 140 was very good within this context. It's basic, basic, basic, but they seem to be good at that. Very clean, great location, nice people in the reception. . .it is convenient no doubt. But, basic, basic, basic.

<Content>Great Location This hotel is located in a very central area for the attractions in Boston. It's an easy walk to the beginning of the Freedom Trail and has some beautiful streets close by with plenty of cafe's and shopping. The hotel itself is nothing fancy, small beds, no great views from the windows - but it's very clean and has modern looking rooms. The price was good in comparison to other Boston hotels in the area and the staff was polite and helpful. You park in the parkade right beside the hotel and it costs $20.00 a night - bring in the parking ticket to have it validated by the hotel for the parking discount. We'd stay at this hotel again without a doubt due to the locale, the price and the fact that it was very clean.

<Content>Will Come Back Yes, the shower is as small as others have written. But I found Hotel 140 to be a hip, refreshing change from other hotels. What's right about Hotel 140? The location is certainly ideal, but there's plenty more to appreciate. The hotel's staff--from those at the front desk to those who prepare your room--are kind and friendly, as if they enjoy their job and appreciate your business. Probably because the rooms either have only a single or double bed, the hotel was void of children, so there were no little feet running up and down the hallways or little ones crying out, giving me the feeling that I wasn't in a hotel. It was so quiet that I couldn't hear the heavy construction going on across the street. Kudos to the manufacturer of the hotel's (large) windows. Breakfast is served at a cafe on the first floor that is open to the public. The free breakfast for hotel guests consists of one hot drink (and the coffee is delicious), one cold drink (from a selection that includes expensive bottled fruit juices) and one pastry from an array of pastries that looked like the handiwork of a high-end bakery. If that isn't hearty enough for you, one can buy very inexpensively eggs and such from the cafe, whose employees, like Hotel 140's, could not have been more considerate and welcoming. So what's wrong with Hotel 140? Frankly, the small shower didn't bother me, but I did wish the room had had more wall hooks to accommodate clothes on hangers. The closet in our mid-priced room was an estimated 30 inches tall, too short to handle dresses, skirts, even my husband's shirts. We had packed many of our clothes on hangers and found ourselves struggling to find enough space to hang them on the short bar of wall hooks that was mounted next to the bathroom door. Small complaint indeed.

<Content>Budget not Boutique We booked this hotel for 2 nights in May as part of our honeymoon based on the review on Expedia, touting it as a boutique hotel.It definately doesn't warrant the title of boutique, however the room was pleasant and clean and the location was good - especially if you're arriving from the Back Bay Train Station.On the downside, yes the heaters were noisy, there was zero atmosphere (no communal areas or bar) and the breakfast was very poor. Never saw any staff apart from when I checked in and the whole experience was rather strange as the hotel is in a shared building with offices, the YWCA and some charities/volunteer groups.I have to say I was slightly disappointed bearing in mind we were there for a special occasion.

<Content>Not luxury, but clean and adequate I was in Boston for a dental convention, not for visitng. I needed a room near the Hynes just to sleep. I didn't need anything fancy. I got a geat price of $99/night for a Thursday and Friday night. That is incredibly cheap foe Boston. Parking was $18/night in the adjacent public garage. The room was small. Somewhat of a cross between a twin and a double bed. This bed would be a tight squeeze for two people. The room was small, but clean. The bathroom was small but clean. The showerhead was in a peculiar position. It faced the shower door so you had to open the door, get soaked when turning the water on and then jump in the shower stall. The floor got soaked. There was a hair dryer, and ironing board. There wasn't much of anthing that can be described as a closet, just some hooks. This is definitely NOT the place for extravagence. It would be cramped for two people. The location is great, right in the heart of Back Bay. Easily accessible by train or MBTA. You are right in the middle of Copley Square. Tons of restaurants nearby in the Westin/Marriott/Sheraton complex and on Newbury St. There is a spartan cafeteria downstairs open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A continental breakfast of one hot drinK, one cold drink and a pastry is included in the room fee. A full breakfast is served if you wish, along the lines of a Denny's. Prices are very reasonable. Food was waht would be expected from a cafeteria. The staff was very helpful and attentive. No bellman or anything like that. There is a computer room on the 6th floor with free use of the computer, printer and internet. A very small fitness room is there, but only 2 or 3 pieces of equipment. The hotel is a renovated YWCA so the configuration is a bit peculiar. This ain't the RItz, but the place is clean and convenient. I would definitely stay there again under the same conditions. This place is not for a wife and kids.

<Content>A good base I booked this hotel on the basis of favourable reviews in the press and on TripAdvisor. I liked it a lot. The staff were very friendly and the room well furnished and of a decent size, although the one time I put the heating on, I thought the hotel was going to take off. Breakfast was fine once you got the hang of it and avoided the instant capuccino which was the sweetest drink I've ever had. The only drawback I would say is the combination with a YMCA. In itself, this is not a problem but there seems to be some reticence on the part of the hotel despite the huge sign on the outside (which incidentally is a good landmark if you get lost), such that you almost have to guess how to get to your room, ie use a card in the lift, and so on. All in all, it is a nice place and the location is excellent. I would certainly consider staying here again.

<Content>great location, nice stay my husband and I stayed in Hotel140 for 3 nights. The location of this property is great. Near Black Bay shops and restaurants, T subway. There is free internet and 2 excercise machines. Tthe staff was very helpfull and friendly. The only negative thing: every thing is small: breakfast, bed and room.The one full size bedis much smaller than a king bed. But the staff helped us out with a roll away(free of charge). And okee the room is small, but what do you need in a great city like Boston. Hotel 140 is not a standard hotel. There are many other activities in the Claredon 140 building. Makes you feel like your a part of local Boston. For 170 $ a night inclusive tax and breakfast, great value!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Staff rude and unhelpful We were really not very impressed with this hotel. It鈥檚 a YWCA, part of which has been transformed into a so-called hotel. We were certainly paying hotel prices (over $200 per night) but felt like we were staying in a youth hostel still. For instance, there was no carpet in our room, instead it had the sort of yellow linoleum floor tiles you鈥檇 find in a school classroom. The shower cubicle was also like something out of a school changing room; there was absolutely nowhere to put your shampoo container in the shower, apart from on the floor of the cubicle and after a few minutes you鈥檇 find the shampoo bottle floating in the water which was accumulating happily at the bottom of the shower. The shower head was fixed in place, and the only way you could switch the shower on was to place your arm underneath the shower head and get it soaked in freezing cold water. Despite a sign in the bathroom telling us that the room was 鈥榥o smoking鈥?and that we would be charged huge sums of money to 鈥榙eep clean鈥?the room if the room smelt of smoke after our stay, our room absolutely reeked of smoke when we arrived, and only receded by the third day. The furniture was all veneered plywood, and there was a conveniently placed shelf just above the bed to bang your head on when you sat up.The worst aspect of our stay was the palaver we had with our room keycards. On our third day, after we鈥檇 spent hours walking around Boston following the freedom trail, we went all the way up to our room on the eighth floor to refresh ourselves and have a bit of a rest. But when we arrived at our room, our keycards wouldn鈥檛 work. We went all the way back down to reception, and the man at the desk fiddled about with his computer for a bit, muttered something about our room being supposedly 鈥榲acant鈥? and then reprogrammed our key cards. He did all this without any sort of apology, and he reprogrammed our key cards without asking for ID to make sure that we were the people who were supposed to be staying in that room! We were made to feel like we were just an annoyance. Then exactly the same thing happened on our fourth day, and then again on our fifth and final day. Even though we told the woman at the reception desk that this was the third time it had happened, there was still no apology forthcoming, and we were made to feel extremely unwelcome and undervalued. We felt more welcome when we turned up at the Marriot Custom House Hotel one day to go up to their viewing observatory. We weren鈥檛 paying them a cent, but we were treated courteously and felt welcome. We certainly would not recommend this hotel, as it was the only aspect of our stay in Boston which wasn鈥檛 absolutely wonderful.

<Content>Location, location, location We booked the 140 based on the TripAdvisor. And you were right! It's a very new hotel, in a wonderful location. You can walk to anything in Boston. And if you get tired, you can always return by subway - the station is just one block from the hotel (btw, the T is excelent!). And there is a enormous mall just around the block, across the subway station. The room is well furnished, the bathroom is impecable. The only thing missing in the room is a refrigerator. For a complimentary breakfast, they are not bad at all (you're allowed two beverages, one hot and one cold, and a pastry. You can always buy everything else you want - and they even have hot dishes, done just for you). All in all, an incredible value for Boston, in a very nice location!! We'll definitely return!

<Content>Wouldn't stay here again My husband and I have just spent two nights at the Hotel 140, which ruined what was otherwise an excellent holiday. If our experience is anything to go by, you won't get a good night's sleep here. The whole set up came across as very unprofessional. The hotel itself was previously the YWCA (part of it still is) and although it posits itself as a boutique hotel, it hasn't really made the transition. The hotel reception staff were particularly unhelpful, and appeared to have zero interest in making our stay an enjoyable one. Having allocated us the wrong room (i.e. for one person) they refused to change it when we complained. We were finally moved to another room, with a single and a foldaway bed, at 4.30am. The foldaway bed was necessary as the hotel only has single or full size double beds, which are smaller than queen size i.e. just larger than a single. For this reason, guests should routinely be offered the use of a foldaway - at additional charge - upon check-in, though in our case the reception staff forgot to do this as well. If you're a light sleeper, bring your earplugs - the heaters look fancy, but are really noisy. You get what you pay for, but at almost 200 dollars a night you could probably do better elsewhere.
