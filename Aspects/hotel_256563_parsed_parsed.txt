<Content>Small and Understaffed, but Convenient Location This was my first trip to Australia, for a conference, which took place at the nearby conference center. The hotel was a disappointment though. I had to wait quite long before I could check in (not something you are hoping for after a long flight from Europe), because the hotel is understaffed.The rooms were clean, but quite small and the interior is very basic. Same for the bathroom. The breakfast buffet was okay, although again understaffed (which seems to be a long-term problem, as other reviews have also noticed).The hotel doesn't offer you much extra, no pool, etc.The location was quite convenient for me, lots of restaurants and bars in Darling Harbour and you good discover the city quite easily from this hotel.But, in the end, the price of the hotel was by far not worth the quality you get. I would stay somewhere else next time.

<Content>You get what you pay for I stayed for three nights in Nov 2007, and the hotel provides exactly what you pay for. The rooms are clean, functional and small. The location for Darling Harbour is great; I didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on the restaurant.

<Content>Well its clean and the location is good I suppose Very small rooms (think cabin in a caravan park). European travellers don't be fooled - the rooms should be larger in Australia. No pool - not even a bath. There was a single blanket, but only a queen bed. Understaffed hence long reception wait (so didnt appreciate being told they only had single blankets when I questioned this). Pay the extra for the view. The reception area smelt of cigarette smoke despite the non smoking sign but that could have been all the smokers outside the door.On the plus side the bed was very comfortable when we sorted out pillows and a grown up blanket. Location was great. The bathroom was clean. Airconditioner and noise wasn't a problem for us.

<Content>Disgusted - ridiculously overpriced We only stayed here because a group that my husband was working with were staying here. After arriving quite late, I was disgusted to find that the room was about the size of a shoe box. It was so cramped that one side of the bed was pushed against the wall. This would not have bothered me if the room had been cheap but I paid $180 to stay. On top of that we had to pay $25 just to park the car. The bathroom was tiny - my husband and I couldnt fit in there at the same time and the entire hotel had a very moist damp smell. The only thing included in the room was tea  coffee facilities, having said that - the only place to plug the kettle in was in the bathroom. I was even more infuriated to find out the rather nice Novotel was next door and only $20 more for the night.Also, when I went to check out the next day (at the advised checkout time), there was only one staff member on reception and about 30 people waiting to check out so it took FOREVER. Will never ever stay there again - choose the Novotel pay the extra $20!!!!!

<Content>Convenient Location, Modest, Clean, Modern Rooms. The hotel room was the size we expected, having stayed in other Ibis hotels. It was clean and modern. We didn't have a harbor view and were told it would be $30/night extra, so we abandoned that idea. The worst problem is that only one lift/elevator was working, so it took FOREVER to go up and down and the lifts were CRAMMED with people as everyone knew that they didn't want to wait literally 10 mins for the next one. I asked the receptionist if there was a stairwell and she replied 'No'. I prayed for no fires. We ate an evening meal and 2 breakfasts in the buffet and it was good and quite well priced in compared to some we'd encountered in Australia. The bed and pillows were of poor quality. The location was very convenient. Check out was slow. The bedroom doors are impossible to close quietly which tends to wake people up.

<Content>Small, cramped and Slow reception Booked with Accor Advantage plus at a Good price3 nights pre paid, (A harbourview room was at an upgraded cost and its only redeeming feature)had it not been pre paid we may well have left for something else,Staff were friendly and the view was awesome but the rooms are small and cramped and bordering on dirty,Chewing gum on Bathroom door,Hairs in bathroom and on bed,Cheap Cane blind apparatus-almost impossible to reach to pull down if you wanted to- No problem for us we enjoyed city lights at nightIron burn on suitcase seat- not surprising an iron may drop as the room was so cramped that I became irritable with my husband getting into my limited space.the bed was small with 2 skinny pillows and slanted down from the middle so you felt you could easily roll out- cheap and uncomfortable.Tv channels limited and volume way down.It was like being in a cell for 3 nights and made you grumpy.Fortunately the location is good and close to monorail so it pays to get out through the day.I found staff pleasant and helpful but at reception there was always a queue and it would take ages to get assistance as tthere was only ever 1 person on duty.The colour scheme is dark and oppressive and everything seemed cheap- it was more like a backpackers than a hotel.There were NO safes in the hotel rooms,Towels were skinny and more like hand towels than bath towels.The cleaners were nice and gave us extra milk as policy is that 3- 4 long life capsule thingies are left-Hardly enough for 2 cups of coffee.Based on the experience I will never book an Ibis Hotel ever again

<Content>Loved the breakfast Stayed her as a place to crash from a big night drinkingStaff were all niceRates were pretty good considering it is a big weekendI stayed with a friend in a twin room and got a complimentary upgrade to a darling harbour view which was cool but it didnt matter too much as it was just me and a friend staying.Breakfast was probably the highlight (maybe because I was still a bit hungover) but there was an abundance of food and the staff seemed pretty well intact for a sunday morning.All in All was good for a place to sleep with a mate after a big night out. the rooms were small but at least it was clean and the beds were comfortable

<Content>$50/day "Bond" - A total Rip Off!! Disappointing stay in a superior location.Another hotel that the website states it has had a full refurbishment in late 2007 Where?? The walls in the corridors are all badly marked, and to my eyes the hotel is very tired looking.As I checked in behind an African gentleman, the receptionist told him that he had to pay a $350 security deposit on top of his room rate. He was naturally quite shocked, but I thought this was perhaps a risk management strategy for Africans.But I too got stung with a $50 per day charge as a security deposit...maybe their mini bar selection is just too tempting?The receptionist assured me it was just a 'hold' for this amount and not a charge, however, this money certainly DID get taken from my Debit Card account - and you would think that you would get it back on the day of departure? Oh no, it takes FIVE DAYS to do that!!Oh and is the mini bar too tempting - no chance - there isn't anything in the fridge, not even milk when I checked in.ACCOR - you have really hit the lows here!

<Content>Tired  Although this Hotel is close to the Convention Centre in Darling Harbour it is more like a back packers hotel. The entrance foyer is so outdated and the corridors are dark and dingy. The hotel rooms are also small for the price paid. My room had a very noisy bar fridge if you call it a bar fridge at all. There were 3 tiny Long Life milk containers in it!! I got up during the night and turned it off so I could get some sleep. The hotel room smelled of cigarettes even though I had asked for a non-smoking room.Don't even stay for breakfast - there are cheaper and better restaurants on the waterfront. I queried the price of my room after hearing on checkout someone getting a cheaper rate. I definitely would not bother staying here ever again.This hotel needs a huge revamp immediately.

<Content>Not satisfied We have recently returned from our holiday in Sydney. The rooms in hotel Ibis are very very small - very unpleasant feeling. No good service and we had also bad experience with the staff on reception. Unpolite and very slowly working. By this hotel is excellent only his location and nothing more.

<Content>The heart of Sydney The Ibis Darling Harbor Has a great location! Although we did not have a room with a view and the rooms are not large, they are comparable in size to many hotels that we have visited in Europe. We did not really find this to be a problem considering the room rates are very good and the location is superb my husband and I would definitely recommend it. We spent most of our wonderful 4 days exploring Sydney, which was sadly just not enough. We will return to the Ibis at the end of our trip around Australia, and hopefully have some more time to spend in wonderful Sydney!

<Content>Sample life in a cell If you would like to experience life in a cell then you can't go far wrong by staying at the Ibis at Darling Harbour.The rooms are tiny, the beds are made for midgets and the furnishings are meagre.The doors seem to be on sprung hinges so that every time a cell mate enters or leaves their room the noise of the banging door reverberates around the hotel ensuring that everyone has a sleepless night.This is quite simply the worst hotel I have stayed in - its only saving grace being that it's central and alongside the attractive Darling Harbour.But believe me, that's the only thing going for this prison-style establishment which is over-priced and totally lacking in character.

<Content>Great location, fantastic view We arrived at this hotel for a 4 night stay at the end of a 6 week holiday. The room was by far the smallest we have ever stayed in.The location and view make up for it and at 拢120 a night you wont beat it. The staff were helpful and friendly and the room although basic was clean. Would stay here again for that view.

<Content>Great view We arrive at the airport and got a bus directly to the hotel which was great. The rooms were a little small, but i did not come to sydney to stay in my room!. The view was excellent, had a great view of darling harbour well worth requesting. The hotel was good value for money and good location. The City tour bus ( connection to Bondi Beach at the station) stopped 5 mins away. When we arrived the harbour had its xmas celebrations and we had a lovely view. Plenty of places to eat around the harbour  the Imax cinema is a must. City shopping area about 15mins walk and boat trip frequently leaving for sidney harbour  the opera house.

<Content>Comfortable but basic. This hotel is in a great location for a family holiday. Having said that, all of those we saw checking in or out were senior citizens and the English one in the next room was the first to demonstrate the paper-thin walls, waking us early every morning as he remonstrated with his wife.Somehow, our booking had been lost as a 'no-show' (possibly not the hotel's fault) and was happily rectified with an upgrade from a suburban (Pyrmont) view room to a harbour view one. Staff at the front desk were always helpful, but seemed undermanned... there was always a queue.Otherwise, the rooms were basic and not overly spacious. The bathroom was well appointed, the beds were comfortable and the room was clean. The small fridge (unstocked) lacked a freezer compartment which we would have used to freeze drink bottles every night in the humid weather of Spring.The buffet breakfast was limited but good, and as the only option in the downstairs cafe was somewhat overpriced at $17.50. The in-room internet was outrageously priced at $0.50 a minute, but there were three cheaper public computers in the foyer.There is an airport minibus that stops at the hotel ($12/head) and a minimart across the road. The view and the hotel's walking proximity to the CBD, ferry stops, monorail and Darling Harbour attractions are it's selling points. If you plan to be out most of the day, then this is a reasonable place to sleep.

<Content>Worst Hotel Ive stayed in This hotel is horrible. The rooms are small and dirty and I felt like I was in a prison. Very basic and for the money you can get much better deals in Sydney. Try The Metro on Pitt. Will never stay here again

<Content>Very Dirty and Poor Service I have recently returned from a three night stay at the Ibis and have no intention of ever returning.  Our hotel room (pokey and a twin rather than the double we requested) was dirty and had vomit up the walls. We very politely asked three times for the vomit to be cleaned up but it remained there throughout the stay. Although the beds were made each day the rest of the room remained unclean and we were only provided with one bath towel and two face cloths between the two of us. The maids clearly took offense to our request for the sick to be cleaned up and tipped the contents of our dirty laundery bag on one of the pillows (which seemed particularly unjust in view of the fact that we asked so nicely). Two days into the stay and with a previous guests regurgitated food still spread across the bathroom wall, we did request to be put in another room but were told that this was not possible.  Unfortuantely the hotel did put a dampner on what otherwise was a fantastic trip.

<Content>Great value After reading all the bad press on here we were very apprehensive about staying here. The hotel had a makeover recently and some floors were still being finished off. For the money, this hotel is fantastic value. Darling Harbour is a great area in which to base yourself to see Sydney. The monorail and ferries ensure it is well connected to the CBD.For 拢70 a night you're not going to get absolute luxury - after all ,we didn't travel all that way to stay in a hotel room for 10 days. the room was small but it had everything we needed.Do stay here - it's not as bad as the reviews would have you believe.

<Content>Makes a good tourist base. We stayed at the Ibis for a few days midweek. You certainly pay for the view- the room was tiny, but for the amount of time we spent there it was fine. And what a view! We were on the 9th floor so nothing obstructed the cityscape and the harbour. The rooms on the other side have a view of Pyrmont. The room was clean and freshly renovated. Our waiter (Willis?) was lovely.On the downside only one out of three elevators worked while we were there, front desk staff were rude (not a big surprise) and the tiny flatscreen TV was mounted so high you couldn't make out the picture unless you were standing. On the whole a pretty ordinary hotel but a fantastic location and even better view.

<Content>Very good value, like a motel in the city cente I stayed at the Ibis for 2 nights while attending a conference at Darling Harbour and found it good value for money. Yes, it was fairly basic and the room was small but it is perfect for value conscious single travellers and couples who are out most of the day. The room was clean but the shower was the smallest I have seen in for a while. I stayed in a harbour view room and think that this made a huge difference - I had a great view on the 4th floor of the city of Sydney and it is easy to get into the city on foot or monorail. The walk to Sydney harbour is only about 30 minutes.

<Content>Looks nice from the outside..... Looks nice from the outside, and the lobby is nice....but the hotel is TERRIBLE inside. The room was dirty. 2 people staying, one face cloth. The shower had mold in the grout on the side and the floor, the thing reminded me of a glorified motel 6. Asked for a room with a view of the harbor, got a room with the view of 7-11 across the street. 3 pay internet computer terminals in the lobby which were always full, even at 7 in the morning. Don't waste your time! Pay a little more and get something better!

<Content>Lovely time here After reading some of the reviews I was a bit apprehensive about staying here. When we arrived we were told our booking was for May 23rd. Which it wasn't but they found us a nice room on the 9th floor overlooking the harbour. It had 2 single beds, this we didn't mind. Yes it was small, but we went to Sydney to see the sights, so we really only used the room at night. We found it clean except for stains on the floor and chair.But most hotel rooms are like this anyway. The staff in reception were very helpful and friendly. For a couple on the go this is an ideal place to stay, As Monorail and lightrail are on the doorstep, with easy access to all other forms of public transport. Didn't see any children here which from our point of view was great. though there are family rooms on the 1st floor.

<Content>Avoid, Avoid, Avoid! Please just look elsewhere. But if you need convincing.... I was on business in Sydney and trying to keep the costs down so I chose the Ibis since it was in a decent location. And it is a good location, but that's where the good points end and the rest quickly degrades from there. The room reminded me a lot of the cells that I visited in alcatraz, small, narrow and confined. Amenities just don't even come in play here, your talking a bed (small and hard), a tv and a bathroom. Bathroom was really, really small and shower had the mold factor going on. The hallways feel like your in a rent-by-the-hour hotel. The breakfast area and breakfast itself were average. The rest just felt VERY run down and VERy cheap. I moved to the Swissotel after enduring a night at the Ibis. WOW, talk about money well spent and it wasn't that much more than the Ibis! Just please avoid having to come back here and write your story of disappointment about the Ibis. Sydney is much too nice of a destination to have it spoiled by a bad hotel!

<Content>Fantastic location What can you really say about the Ibis? I've stayed at many Ibis hotels in the UK and Europe and they all provide the same basic accommodation you come to expect.This one is no different. A small lobby with a bar a few paces away. Friendly staff, even though they were clearly under pressure on the morning we checked out. The room we stayed in was on the tenth floor, but our view wasn't the best as we faced onto the street to the front of the hotel. The rear faces onto Darling Harbour and I'd imagine the view from those rooms would be tremendous.The room itself was small with two single beds. An absolutely tiny wardrobe area which could only hold about four hangers. Needless to say our suitcase remained packed for the 5 days we were there! The bathroom was also small. Breakfast was available, but we didn't use these facilities as Darling Harbour is only a two minute walk away and provide plenty of options for eating.The location of this hotel made up for it's basic facilities. Darling Harbour is a fantastic area. It's full of bars and restaurants and has a ferry terminal which takes you to the bridge and opera house. At night it's beautiful with the lights of the skyscrapers and around the bay turned on. The hotel is easy to get to too. From either the domestic or international airports a train connects to Sydney Central. A tram then connects you to the Convention Centre which is directly at the rear of the hotel. Transfer from airport to check in took about 50 minutes.All in all a basic hotel with the advantage of a fabulous location.

<Content>Checked out 10 minutes after checking in Was booked to stay at the IBIS, Darling Harbour for two nights as part of a business trip. I should have gone with my instinct at the reception desk when they could'nt find my booking and received no apology once they found it. Once I exited the elevator on level 9, the first thing that hit me was the smell of cooked meat! I was in for a bigger shock when I opened by room door and the smell of damp carpet and cigarette smoke (for a room with a large no smoking sign on the door, this was not a good start). I then discovered that the toilet had paper in it and that there was a large damp patch on the carpet. I rang reception and explained that it was unacceptable and wished to be moved to another room and was told (with no apology) that the hotel was full, so my choices were limited. I unpacked, then called a friend and decided to move to his hotel. I grabbed the phone book to call the other hotel and then discovered it was mouldy from damp!At reception I advised them I was leaving and I was told I still had to pay for the room for the night! To add insult to injury, I asked for a cab to be called and was told that they pass the hotel all the time! At this stage, I was willing (and did) pay for the other hotel from my own money - if that is not an indicator of a bad hotel, then I don't know what is.If you are after a room that should rent by the hour, then this will please you no end. If you are looking for a hotel that welcomes it's guests and listens to their concerns, then try the Holiday Inn in Darling Harbour, or the Sheraton on the Park in Elizabeth Street (my favourite for treating their guests like royalty)

<Content>Average, considering the location Our check-in was probably the worst part of our 3-day stay, so that is part of why I put average. We checked in Jan 2nd, post-NYE to get the cheaper rates. We even checked in fairly late in the evening, and still ran into issues at check-in... There was quite a wait to even get a clean room (others were also waiting in the lobby with us to get one), and then we went to the room assigned and it smelled AWFUL! They are smaller rooms, so it was fairly evident that someone had vomited in the room/bathroom over NYE, and they were still cleaning up two days later.... The smell was so overwhelming that we requested a new room, even if it meant waiting all over again! The other party that was waiting for a room when we checked in was still there, and finally left for another hotel because they were so fed up with waiting. THey gave us another room, in which we found someone else's complimentary honeymoon bottle of champagne, and had to call the front desk to make sure they didn't give us some poor honeymooners' room!! After the first night, everything settled down and we had an enjoyable stay. Rooms are small, and some have good views (we had to give up our good view to get rid of the vomit room...boo!) but the hotel seemed average to me, considering where it was located within Sydney. I have to give the staff credit for taking care of all our issues, albeit slowly. One poor front-desk gentleman had been there for 14 hours without any breaks, and still went out of his way to help get people checked into the rooms. Hope you check-in is better than ours!

<Content>Fantastic Views,Average room ! I usually stay at the Radisson in Liverpool Street when i visit Sydney but because of the Australia/England Test Match on it was fully booked. For about the same money i stayed at the Ibis. The hotel is in a great location and I had a fantastic view of Darling Harbour but to be honest the room was very average for what i paid which was about 拢80 per night. The bed is good enough but it is in a tiny room which feels like a prison cell, there is only a tiny area to hang your clothes and unbelievably no draws to put clothes in. The air conditioning was also noisy and didn't work very well, it was far too hot in the room and i just couldn't get the temperature down. On the plus side the bathroom was very good and had obviously just been re furbished.All in all ok ish but the Radisson is far far better.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel I was very pleased with this hotel. The size of the room is very much suitable for 2, but deluxe for 1 person. There is one chair in the room, with a desk, telephone/alarm clock/radio and lamps on each side of the bed. Light swiches for the main ceiling light are located next to the room door, and on one side of the bed. A kettle is supplied, as well as tea, coffee, sugar and milk. Windows are not open-able, but the rooms have air conditioning, with a swich where the room temperature can be set. The television has 6 channels: 7, 9, 10, ABC, SBS and a Tourist Channel. Pay per view movies are available for $14.95 each as well as 4 adult channels. The bathroom has a small shower, with a clothesline which is placeable between the walls of the shower. There is also a regular sized sink and a hair dryer.A small fridge that is empty (no mini-bar when I stayed there) is located under the TV.Then the usual you would expect from a hotel: About 5 towels of different sizes, 2 small bars of good quality soap, 1 packet of shampoo, 1 packet of conditioner, shower cap and a sanitary bag. An iron and a large ironing board are also supplied as well as an extra blanket.I loved this hotel and I would definately stay in it again in the future.

<Content>Not too bad - not too good! I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. When I arrived to check in they did not have any record of my booking for two rooms, a twin and a double. This despite the fact that the rooms had been booked and paid for prior to my arrival. Although this was done through Expedia therefore I should perhaps not blame the Ibis. This hiccup was quickly rectified although they did require an imprint of my credit card as security whilst they cleared the situation up!The rooms were very small although they were clean, fresh and bright. Location was perfect, right beside the hustle and bustle of Darling Harbour.Bar facilities at the hotel are limited - it opens at 5pm and closes at 10pm each evening. I did sample the buffet breakfast which was simple fayre. The usual array of fruit, cerals, juices, breads, tea and coffee along with a cooked option as well.Staff were pleasant, polite and efficient.Overall I would say a good budget hotel in an excellent location. Would I stay here again? Perhaps not, I would most likely take my chances with another option!

<Content>Budget hotel in a good location My husband and I spent six nights at the Ibis for a conference. We selected it based on price and proximity to the conference center. This is definitely a budget hotel!The rooms are tiny; the bed fills the room and you must squeeze around it. The bathroom is even smaller with a shower designed for a very small person and a shower door that won't stay shut. Only one person can go into the bathroom at a time. Amenities were two packets of shampoo, two shards of soap, a shower cap and sanitary bag per day. The room could have been cleaner and the staff would not change your sheets unless you left them a note. On the first three days, each time we returned to the room in the afternoon, the key would not work. The desk staff would apologize but offer no compensation. One staff member promised that the key would work the next day. When we asked what he'd offer if it did not work, he said, An apology which was a poor response. We eventually had the key re-keyed each time we left.On the good side, the harbor view was beautiful. The room had a refrigerator and coffee/tea-making facilities. The location is excellent, smack in the middle of Darling Harbour with access to Harbourside (a shopping mall), the visitor center, the Chinese garden, the IMAX theater, Wildlife World, the conference center, and tons of shops and restaurants. Most are high-end and it was difficult to find a meal for under $15.Breakfast at the Ibis was $15/per person for a good buffet. Typical fare was scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon, roast tomatoes, baked beans, do-it-yourself waffles, cereal, pastries, yogurt, fruit, and an espresso machine. Judy at the cashier station always had a smile.The Ibis is fine if you know what you're getting into. Don't expect luxury and enjoy Sydney!

<Content>Worst experience ever My partner and myself didn't receive a harbour view as requested, and they put us into a twin room instead of a queen. The beds were terrible, one rolled in at the middle. Phone, TV and fridge did not work. We couldn't sleep that night so left the hotel late that night. Will never stay at this hotel ever again, a bad experience overall!!!

<Content>the worse hotel I've ever stayed at Check in - I'm a frequent traveller and this is the worse hotel I've ever stayed at. I booked a 6 nights non-smoking room through their website, while I checked in, they gave me a smoking room by mistakes, and it took them about 30 minutes to find me a non-smoking room (how difficult is it to switch a room? and of couse, I received no apology, no smile). $100 security deposit - Yep, they charged $100 to my visa card as a deposit in case I stole anything during the 6 night stay. (there was nothing to steal in the room.. OK? a very small old TV and very small old fridge with a door couldn't be closed properly). In the room, there is a little card saying that they provide a 100% best service guarantee. How can they provide best service if they don't even trust their valued customers? Elevator - There are 3 elevators in the hotel buliding and only 2 were used at the time even during the most busy check-in hours. I've never waited so long for an elevator anywhere else. Parkade - When I tried to park my car in their parkade, my key didn't work. I couldn't open the gate and I have to buzz someone to open the gate for me. Of couse, I coudn't use my key to get out either. Guess what? the 2nd and 3rd nights, their hotel parking lot were full so I was told to park my car at the public parking lot. When I checked out, they tried to charge me the 2 night parking fee even though they didn't even have a space for me to park.In general, the receptionist provided no servise, no smile, no nothing. It is a 3-star hotel, but I felt it was like a half-star no-name motor-inn.

<Content>bad services, no smiling and they don't trust in anybody I travell frecuenly and this is one of the worst experiencies that i have never had in hotels.first they didn麓t have my booking in the check in ( and I booked from their web site [--]). They have an ad in reception with this meaning  we will recive you will with our best smile for your pleasant days in ibis  but in fact i had a very umpleseant argue with the reception manager because she said that I wasn麓t in his check in list ( finally of course they found it but I didn麓t recive any apologise about that.After saw that the don麓t have the usual baggage storage when you check out ( so if your flight is in the afternoon be ready to have your baggage with you during the hole day) OR to pay their small locker ( is this a backpacker? or a large hotel company? The room is a backpaker furnished ( no picture, no table, no nothing) bealive me just a white walls and a bed.But the worst experience was in the check out. Ibis has a great business the take a $50 off from your credit card as a deposit during 2 days after you check out as a security in case you stole something ( the bed theare nothing else in the room ).Of course i wrote a complaint but after one month I don麓t have any answer from Ibis.Last time in Ibis of course!!

<Content>No frills on the harbor I write this review in a room on the top floor of Hotel Ibis on September 20, 2006.This is a no-frills hotel. You get a room and in it is a bed, a television set (not too small, not too big) with 4 local channels, and a toilet with a shower (not too small, not too big). That's about it.When you check in, get your key from the receptionist and then, taking your luggage with you, go to your room. That's about all that the staff does for you. O, I forgot: they will sell you, if you ask, a bottle of wine or beer, a cup of soup, and newspaper. Ask anything else beyond that and you put the staff programming into overload.There is a coffee shop of sorts that serve breakfast only and across from it, a bar for an afternoon drink. If you are looking for more service and more amenities, take your luggage across the bridge and check in at Four Points Hotel (a different review in its own section).Happy travels!

<Content>Wonderful Location As this was our first trip to Sydney, our travel agent recommended this hotel to us. The location was absolutely wonderful - very pleased!We arrived around 3pm and the hotel reception desk staff were very friendly and efficient. The hotel room itself was rather small but that didnt bother us as we were only there to sleep! There was a small fridge in the room and a kettle to make yourself tea or coffee which suited us fine.We ate at the hotel bistro Saturday and Monday nights, which served excellent food at a reasonable price. The bar also had happy hour from 5-7pm Monday to Friday which was good too.Right at the footstep of the hotel was the shopping complex, Harbourside (5 min walk if that). Very nice shopping complex with a good food court.I would definitely stay here again, the location was absolutely wonderful and everything was close by. It only took us 15 minutes to walk to the city and Centrepoint tower.

<Content>We Were Very Satisfied This was our first visit to Sydney. Our travel agent recommended the Ibis at Darling Harbour and we followed her advice. However after the booking had been made etc we surfed the net and read the comments of the Ibis. We therefore had mixed feelings and braced ourselves for the worst (small rooms bad service). Although the rooms are small it is quite adequate. Our room (812) had a fantastic view on Darling Harbour. We found all the staff to be very helpful and friendly. Location 鈥?perfect 鈥?everything is so close to the hotel. The restaurants, the ferry stops etc. We only had one bad night that was not really the fault of the hotel staff 鈥?rowdy neighbors acting as if they own the place playing music and obviously under the influence at 03:00 until 05:00 on Saturday 8 April. We somehow got our revenge at 06:00 when we got up to get ready for our day. The US Masters commentators really know how to elaborate a specific point 鈥?we made sure our neighbors were kept up to speed on what was happening during the 3rd round of the Masters. Apart from this 鈥?will we go back to the Ibis at Darling Harbour ?鈥?most definitely It is fair priced and we think it is a great hotel.

<Content>Good Location - Accomodation Basic but adequate We stayed in the IBIS over the New Year period as it was the cheapest hotel in a good location that was available. Had reviewed tripadvisor so was prepared for the small room.The room was small but it was clean and the staff were friendly and very helpful. We arrived mid-morning but were able to get access to the room early which was great considering we had just arrived from the UK.The floor we were on (4th floor) did smell a bit funny, as though the carpet were damp - the room was fine.As people have said previously - this is a 3 star hotel and the accomodation was as expected for this type of hotel. Probably would stay in a different hotel next time if there is one available.

<Content>Got what we paid for Stayed in the Ibis over the new year period. The hotel was basic as we expected. The rooms were clean and bright although there was not much cupboard space, and the bathroom was adequate. The room had a fridge which you needed to stock up yourself which was better than paying expensive mini bar rates and there was a little supermarket 5 mins away, as well as a launderette just along from the main entrance which was much cheaper than the hotels expensive laundry service.The staff were friendly and the checkin was efficient.The only problem we had was trouble with our air conditioning but this was soon fixed.We only ate at the hotel once, the hangover breakfast on new years day, of which the food was as good as any other breakfast we had.If you want a luxury hotel dont stay at the ibis!. If you want a reasonable value hotel situated in a good location this was fine.

<Content>Relatively cheap and cheerful Ibis promotes itself as a 'no frills' hotel - and that's exactly what you get. I'm surprised by some of the very negative comments here - especially those complaining about small rooms, cheap furnishings, basic appearance, lack of staff, etc. The fact is that you get what you pay for. It wasn't exactly cheap at $159, but the alternatives were not much better. The location is excellent (opposite the city centre) and I had a room with a slight water view, which was nice. It was just a 15 minutes stroll to the city. I also did a little exploring of the suburb Pyrmont and found amongst the modern apartment blocks a surprising village atmosphere around a square surrounded by shops, restaurants and gorgeous old sandstone terraces. Not sure of the street names, but it was on top of a hill up from the old bridge across Darling Harbour.The staff were perfectly friendly and down-to-earth. I didn't notice that the hotel was particularly dirty and my room was clean. There were a few marks on the carpet, but so what?I guess some people are just whingers who pay a minimum amount of money and have ridiculously high expectations that are never going to be met.

<Content>Never again!! Arrived in Sydney on New Years Eve. Very excited to be in Australia for the first time, until..........we arrived at the hotel IBIS!! When we arrived we were told that someone the previous night had set off the sprinklers so all the carpets on our floor were damp. The smell was horrendous, and the room was dirty (hairs in the shower, dirty towels, etc).We stayed at this hotel because we booked fairly late on and the other hotels in Sydney were either fully booked or way way overpriced. Looking back, I would definately have paid more to stay somewhere else. AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!

<Content>Never Again Checked into the hotel late at night - if it had been any earlier I would of have left immediately for $165 you can get a nice hotel room usually - not here. the YHA youth hostel has larger and better rooms (have stayed there previously as also at Novatel). There are no facilities, and if you want to access the internet it costs you 50c per minute!!! Walk 5minutes and you can check your email at the supermarket for $1.50 for 15 minutes. The reception people are just not interested and check out is 10am - most hotels here offer 12noon for weekends. If I wanted to stay 2 hours longer in the morning it was going to cost me another $20.

<Content>You get what you pay for Only stayed one night but it was very clean, the view was pretty darn good the receptionist was very friendly. Nothing to complain about. Who wants to spend their holiday actually inside a hotel room. Get real people - you only want somewhere to sleep, shower and yes well...You want resort style - stay somewhere swish and pay the big bucks!

<Content>Fantastic location Stayed at the Ibis in October and found staff to be helpful and friendly. Room size wasn't enormous, but adequate and we had a harbour view room which was really nice. Location of hotel is really good, lots around the area to do and see and water taxi across to Opera House and Bridge wasn't expensive. Didn't eat in hotel, lots of places 2 minutes away for breakfast. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Room not big enough to swing a cat in This is the worst Ibis I have ever stayed in. The room was so small, it was ridiculous. We were put next to the maintenance/housekeeping laundry room and from 6am every morning there was nothing but banging doors, washing machines going, dryers going, etc. We asked to be moved but the management said they couldnt help us. We even tried moving hotels, but everything in Sydney was booked up that weekend for a football grand final. The price is LUDICROUS for the accommodation you get. Definately would never stay here again. And hard to complain about the service, cause THERE WAS NONE!! We asked for towels to be bought up to the room - they arrived 1hr and 45mins later!!
