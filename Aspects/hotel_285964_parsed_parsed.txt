<Content>First stay at Rookies Just finished a 6 day visit to Amsterdam and stayed at the Rookies Hotel. We found the hotel to be clean and fine for the price paid. We have stayed in Amsterdam twice before, once at one of the big hotels on Damrak and the other time in a canal house at the seven bridges. The Rookies Hotel was nothing like the either of these two places, but then we didn't expect it to be. For the price paid it exactly what you would expect. The rooms are small, but it is Amsterdam. The room was always clean, sheets were changed regularly and the managers at the hotel were very kind and helpful.The location of the hotel is very convenient. Be aware that this part of town can be noisy late at night. We were there in early October, so the noise wasn't as bad as other times of the year. If you are looking for a good budget hotel to stay in, we would recommend the Rookies Hotel. If you want upscale lodging, you probably want to keep looking.

<Content>How would you describe your personal hell? Then if you would like to experience it, book a room at hotel the Rookies. The worst place where I have ever stayed, rooms are very tiny, breathless and the receptionists are completely mad...I would not even recommend it to my worst enemy!!!!

<Content>Great Holiday - Again We stayed in Hotel Rookies in July of this year for six nights. We visited this hotel in August of last year. This time we had requested a room at the back of the property as we had found on our previous visit rooms at the front were very noisy. We were delighted when they had met our request.Our room was cleaned each day and fresh towels provided, there was also a TV which had an assortment of channels including BBC1. The breakfast provided was typically continental, but sufficient enough and we were able to enjoy breakfast outside most mornings.On our previous visit, the hotel owned the restaurant over the street, however, this has now been sold on. Their coffee shop has made some adjustments to accommodate tobacco smokers, there are now few establishments that offer this facility.The location of the hotel is superb, it is in a nice area of Amsterdam, there are plenty of restaurants, bars and shops around and within walking distance to Amsterdam Central. There is also a small shop next to the hotel which is open to 10.3/11.00pm each night, which is handy when you have a hunger attack. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay again and will definitely be returning to Hotel Rookies on our next visit to Amsterdam. The staff (especially Rob) are extremely helpful and pleasant.

<Content>Average - Beware of the Bed Bugs My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights at the weekend. First impressions where the very steep stairs up to the reception on the first floor. Easy check in with John very friendly. Then we where informed of the bad news our room was on the fourth Floor...yes again that meant walking up them dreadful stairs. The room looked clean and well presented on the first look...but look deeper...The room was very small...enough room to walk around the bed though. The sheets looked clean, as they where white..Bathroom was very very small, but we managed to cope for the 4 days. On the 2nd day, I started get these red lumps (very itchy) turns out there was bed bugs!!! Yuck. I am covered and so is my boyfriend. That put me off immediately. Plus one evening we where walking about in our bare feet and my fella screamed, and there was a rusty nail sticking up out of the floor. The location of the hotel is excellent. It took less than a minute to walk to the main square of Leidesplein and about 15minutes walk to Dam Sqaure.The hotel would be fine for those wishing to make alot of use of the local coffeeshops, but for those wishing to have a nice weekend away, stay in a nicer hotel.

<Content>Fantastic! I stayed here in May with a friend of mine, he had stayed before and recommended it highly. The location is fantastic, the room was immaculate and the staff were great - slightly crazy, in a good way (to be expected given the kind of hotel it is)!We had a deluxe twin with bath, the beds were very comfortable, towels and hairdryer provided, tv in the room, digital safe.. everything you need.My friend is vegan, and they got us both fresh fruit smoothies every morning for breakfast. Delicious! There was plenty of toast, jam and cereal too. There was a carnivore there at the same time, they were cooking him omlettes and he was tucking into the meat and cheese continental breakfast too, so everyone is catered for. Coffee was nice too!The decking out the back is a great place to sit in the afternoon, and downstairs, Rookies itself is a lovely place for a coffee :)The stairs up to the hotel are a bit intimidating at first, but after 2 days I was not even holding into the handrail, they look worse than they actually are. I'm one of the clumsiest people ever, and I didn't have a problem!I loved it so much that we have already booked up for New Year, can't wait! I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in Amsterdam.Go to Amsterdam! And stay at Rookies!

<Content>Good Value This is the second time I have chosen to stay in the Uptown Hotel, main reason is because its a good value hotel in Leidseplein and this is my favourite area in Amsterdam. There is such a good selection of restaurants, bars and coffeeshops. Trams 1, 2 or 5 will get you to Leidseplein square from Central Station and then the hotel is just a 2min walk from there.When we stayed at New Year we had a room facing the street which was noisy but this can only be expected especially at that time of year. As we stayed in June this time the room was very hot during the day even with windows open and fan but it was okay at night.Staff are friendly and always help to carry luggage up and down the very windy staircase. Breakfast is between 8 and 10, consists of usual continental style bread, ham, cheese and scramble eggs.

<Content>rookies review stayed at the rookies hotel and found it to be exactly what I expected. It is a great value for the money, just do not expect 3 or 4 stars. The room was a tad small(but very clean) for a single, but it is amsterdam and I expected that. The staff was very friendly and helpful. This hotel is geared more to the under 50 crowd. It is on a very lively street so don't expect peace and quiet. The entrance is very very steep!! so if you over-indulge and try to navigate the stairs be warned, I can just imagine the number of folks that have taken a spill !!! The coffeeshop was just terrific, very friendly and reasonably priced. Its worth the trip just to shop there. Overall great value just not the place I would take someone special for a romantic getaway.

<Content>Really good experience 10 of us stayed at the Hotel Rookies (Hotel Uptown as it used to be called) for a stag weekend. The hotel was quite far out, probably about 30 minutes walk from Centraal Station but with easy access to Trams and Taxis its not a problem, in fact I'd rather stay here than closer to the Centre. Our rooms were a good size and pretty modern and most importantly very clean. The people running it were extremely friendly and helpful. The price is very reasonable and includes a nice breakfast. Overall I'm really pleased we chose this hotel, its on a pretty lively street and close to the Museums. Very much recommended and I look forward to returning

<Content>Darling Hotel Uptown is a darling little hotel with very friendly service, very clean rooms and a perfect location. If you're looking for lavish and spacious quarters, this is not the place for you. If you are looking for a clean, safe place to unload your luggage and sleep/shower, this is perfect. The staff was extremely friendly and offered to help carry bags up the tiny staircase. Breakfast was limited, but enough to start the day. It's a perfect little place to rest your head.

<Content>Amongst many stays in the Dam The stay at the Hotel Uptown/Rookies was typically great. I have staryed here no less than 5 times and have had excellent service every time. The staff remembers me by name and addresses me every time I arrive in a very cordial manner. Especially helpful is John, who always goes the extra mile for me. This is the best value for the money that I have found in Amsterdam. I have stayed in the Grand Krasnopolsky, and have stayed here. Stay here and save your money

<Content>Second Stay - Still Recommend It! This was our second visit to Hotel Uptown/Hotel Rookies. We stay at this property specifically because of their liberal smoking policies. We will continue to return because of those policies, the rates, the value and the location.This is an easy ride from Centraal Station to Leidseplein or back to Centraal Station on the 1, 4 or 5 trams. From the tram stop, it's no more than a 5 minute walk to the Hotel. Check in/out was easy, and the desk staff helpful.Breakfast is across the street in its restaurant, and is adequate.Wi-Fi is free, but you will need to give the staff your computer ip(?) address for access to the signal. We had the luxury double, and it was clean and comfortable and quiet (last time we faced the street during world cup - not so quiet in the summer). The location is excellent if your goal is the museums and Vondel Park. The location is just fine for us for almost everything else - but we generally walk at least 5 miles a day, and usually more like 8 miles a day. But again, tram service is readily available if you aren't inclined to walk. Get a strippenkart for the tram and everything is within an easy distance.The patio in the back is one of my favorite features - we like to sit out there and smoke and check e-mail, update our website or write out post cards.

<Content>Great Stay at the (Uptowon) Rookies Very nice hotel situated in the Leidseplein area, with plenty of bars and restaurants. The location is perfect to visit the city, a walking distance from all major sites. We had a nice Luxury Twin room overlooking the beautiful hotel's terrace. The room was nice, larger than the Amsterdam standards,quiet and clean. There's a desk, a cupboard with a safe, and the beds are comfortable. Large bathroom with a tub, wich is rather unusual in hotels.The owner was friendly and helpful, and being a small hotel, there's a family atmosphere that makes you feel at ease. A great experience, we will definitely stay there next time we visit Amsterdam.

<Content>free wi-fi The Hotel Uptown or Rookies Hotel as it now called is a small hotel with the usual steep stairs. The rooms are not a bad size by British standards but Americans will find them a bit on the small size.Free Wi-Fi in the rooms is a bonus as some of the other hotels I have stayed in charge up to 30 euros per day. The Rookies coffeeshop downstairs is one I would visit even if I was not staying there.So another bonus smoking weed in the hotel room is permitted.Small shop next door for stocking up on munchies and beer. So many places to eat,drink and smoke with in a couple of mins walk. I have booked 11 nights over xmas and new year so could be another report to come.

<Content>Shhh. Keep it as a secret! Amsterdam is not exactly a cheap place if we talk about hotels so finding a little gem like the Uptown is wonderful.Is almost perfectly placed just next to Ledseplein but as far as you won't be disturbed. Rooms are quite basic but even more clean than 4 and 5 star hotels I've stayed.Breakfast is also quite basic but enough for my taste. A couple of cold cuts, cheese, corn-flakes, toats, milk, coffe and orange juice. Fried eggs and omelettes are prepared at the moment.There is also a nice patio on the back where you can relax.The staff is a must. They are fun and very kind, always trying to help you.The only bad point I found was that my room (102) was just on of a table of the coffeshop, so in the summer could be really noisy.

<Content>Good position, nice price, but.... For a crash pad for a weekend in Amsterdam this is a good choice. The location is very handy - just a couple of hundred yards off the Leidseplein so close to some good bars, restaurants and clubs but not so close that you are too disturbed at night. Rookies coffeeshop on the ground floor is one of the nicest ones in the city with a real pub-like atmosphere and a pool table. It wasn't a bad price and compared to where some other members of our group stayed it was like a Hilton or something.The only real downside was returning home to find myself covered in flea bites. I can't say for definite they came from the hotel though which I must point out seemed really clean on the whole, but no-one else I went with suffered and I was the only one to stay at Uptown.

<Content>I would definately go back.... Last time I went to Amsterdam, I paid the same amount and ended up in a really grotty room I was scared hadn't seen a clean in months!! This time I went to Amsterdam I was overjoyed with the Hotel Uptown. The first thing you find upon checking in is the beautiful little terrace they have out back, a perfect spot for breakfast in the morning or an afternoon coffee if just wanting some chill time. The rooms, although not huge, are really clean and tidy and anything not found in the room (i.e iron, hairdryer) can be provided by the staff. The location is perfect...is is in one of the busiest night-life spots in the city, so is great if you need to stumble home after the bar. However, it is stumbling distance enough to get you away from the main noise of this area, and the room remains quiet and peceful even at night. You are right by the main canals so a stroll up the Princegraht towards Jordaan is the perfect thing to do during the day, stopping for a few yummy beers along the way. The Hieneken brewery is around the corner too. Overall, I advise anyone looking for a cheapish hotel in a really good location, with friendly staff and clean, basic rooms....choose the Hotel Uptown - now the Hotel Rookies! The coffee shop downstairs is a fun place to hangout too!! ;0)

<Content>Uptown Upbeat We stayed at the UPTOWN hotel a while ago and whilst it is not the HILTON The rooms are clean and tidy but fairly basic, but this is made up for by the friendliness of the staff. If you want good porterage forget it but they do tell you with a smile the light buffet breakfast was a joy to behold as we all waited until the receptionist was woken up and he then put the coffe and eggs on You can find little fault with this charming hotel as you only ever get what you pay for and we had a great few days there and smiled all the time ,though the reason for our cheerfullness may have been that we where above a big COFFEE shop and as it was summer our bedroom windows where open all day
