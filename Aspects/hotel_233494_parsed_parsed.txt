<Content>Amazing honeymoon Amazing experience. A second honeymoon to chill out following 3 weeks exploring in Peru. From the arrival and upgrade into an executive suite, wonderful soaps, chocolates each night, fruit in the room on arrival and canapes each night on our way out. Breakfast was a stylish affair and staff were really friendly throughout. Nothing was too much trouble. It was a really personal holiday experience. It wasn't in the heat of summer so we didn't use the roof top terrace much but its definitely somewhere we want to return to in the summer. The perfect end to our wedding. Eager to return!

<Content>Perfect Florence Hotel Perfect hotel located in the Oltrarno area (1 block from the Arno River) . If you are interested in staying in a beautiful palace in the somewhat less traveled area where most restauarants are supported by locals  there are craft shops etc this would be an ideal choice. From the moment you enter the palazzo you know you are in for a first class stay. Monika  her staff make sure that you lack for nothing the entire time. My wife  I were fortunate in that we were able to stay in the junior suite (the walls  ceiling are covered with beautiful frescoes) that has a private terrace, large bathroom  you walk through a garden to enter it from the lobby. Our room was the smallest  it was still the largest room we had in our 15 day stay in Italy. A first class breakfast is served in an exquisite room on an upper floor. There is a rooftop terrace that has views of the entire city of Florence.Being lucky enough to stay in a 15th century palace with all rooms being unique,well furnished  very large helped make our stay in Florence perfect. We could not imagine returning to Florence  not staying here.

<Content>The BEST Hotel I've ever stayed in...in the entire world! This review is long overdue....My wife I and I stayed at the PMF in August of '05 while on our honeymoon. This is not only the best hotel we stayed in during this trip (which included the 5-star Westin in Rome and other great hotels in Italy), but it's the best hotel I've ever stayed in and I've stayed in hotels all across the US, as well as the UAE, China / Hong Kong, Australia, etc. This is THE HOTEL by which I compare all others.To say the rooms are well appointed is an understatment. The rooms are decorated like little museums. We had floor-to-ceiling bookshelves w/ pictures / paintings and BUSTS on the shelves - unbelievable.There are only 11 or 12 rooms in this hotel and they're all suites. They're not even numbered, they are named after the family members; we stayed in the Livia room.On entering the room, we had to take time and tour / enjoy the entire room. There were 3 separate rooms w/in our room: the sitting room / ante-chamer which itself had to be 300SF and had big comfy chairs, a couch, a table w/ more chairs and the bookcase; a bedroom w/ a nice comfy bed (might've been a queen, but I think it was a king); and the bathroom which was HUGE, especially for Europe. The bathroom included a separate, glass-encased shower and plenty of room for my wife and I to do our grooming / cleaning in the same bathroom.After the tour, we reviewed the soap choices (no kidding)...the hotel had a box of FRESH soaps and encouraged us to select the 1 or 2 we liked the most and they'd have those kinds sent up to our room for our use - nice, right?So, long and short of it, the room was great! Not a great view off the small balcony, but the room itself was spectacular. The rest of the hotel was just charming, very well decorated and it had fresh flowers everywhere. The rooftop lounge itself was just fantastic and reason enough for visiting this hotel, even if you're not staying there. We got lucky and visited during a full moon under which we sat, listened to nice music and could look out over Florence's famous Duomo and Bapistry, as well as another church tower closer to our hotel. Talk about a ROMANTIC honeymoon!!! Also, the hotel is a 15-minute walk from the Ponte Vecchio and about 30 minutes from the Galleria d'ella Acadamie where Mike's David is located. So it's not in the heart of Florence, but it suited me just fine.Breakfast was served in a common room every morning and while it probably wasn't the best breakfast spread we had during our honeymoon (that honor would go to the Hotel Villa Ducale in Taormina, Sicily), it was certainly good and abundant, with fresh fruit, cereals and GREAT Italian coffee.The last and most important item is about service. This anecdote typifies the service we received while at the PMF:Our first day there, we stopped by the Front Desk and enquired about 2 things:1) Did they have a recommendation for dinner?2) We heard there was an Italian outlet mall nearby not to be missed...could they get us more information on that?- When we returned, we found two typed memos in our box, which the desk clerk handed to us, the first told us they'd made a dinner reservation for us at their recommended location and a car would be at the hotel to pick us up beforehand (for a fee, but we could cancel the car if we wanted to, with no penalty). The second memo informed us about the outlet mall nearby and again, a car had been reserved for us and would pick us up whenever we wanted to in the morning.Two typed memos....all arrangements handled by the hotel...cars, dinner reservations, whatever...just fantastic. I have never received more personalized service at any other hotel, bar none.That's it..if / when we get back to Europe, we're going to Italy, we're going to Florence and we're staying at the Palazzo Magnani Feroni. IT IS NOT TO BE MISSED!

<Content>Double Wow!!! If the price fits your budget . . . do not look any further. This hotel has captured all the service of a large chain hotel, all the comfort of a small bed and breakfast and all the size of a wonderful villa.Although we had the budget room, it was the size of a 2 bedroom apartment, complete with full kitchen and living room. I kept imagining what it would be like to actually live there, as it was so comfy. We were only there for one night, and believe me, I wanted to stay longer!The negatives . . . the bathroom did not have a tub, we had to carry our luggage up one flight of stairs, and there was a very odd odor that permeated the suite. Our suite also faced the street, so there was noise in the living area of the suite. However, the palace is so delightful and different, that these negatives cannot overshadow the wonderful experience of this hotel. Beautiful public spaces, astounding breakfast area, museum quality paintings and artifacts throughout (including in the suite itself), and courteous, warm, pleasant staff.We received an excellent recommendations for dinner and although we really did not have a chance to truly enjoy the hotel, the team made every effort to make us feel extremely welcomed. You can tell that this is a well managed hotel, where each team member has a personal investment in it's success. From the GM to each Service Agent, there was geniune pride and enjoyment in their carriage. It was my husband's birthday, and although I briefly mentioned it in a quick conversation, there was extra effort made to acknowledge it, that was not a put on.I cannot stress enough how DIFFERENT this hotel is. After our stay, we went on to other famous luxury 5 star accommodations in other parts of Italy, and they paled by comparison. It was really not fair - like comparing apples to oranges - this hotel is that good. Generally, I enjoy travel for the locations as well as the accommodations. I try to experience all kinds of places to rest my head, and am constantly on the search for the best spot. In Florence, I have tried some of the best , including the Westin Excelsior and the Grand, and have thoroughly enjoyed them. Although this hotel has a wonderful 360 degree view, I have seen better views from other hotel rooftops in Florence.But . . . despite the competition, the view, and the negatives, I think I have found my future first choice when in Florence. It offers something unique, a perfect combination of charm, history, location, size and beauty and service to die for!!!! If it is in your budget, don't look any further!!!!

<Content>Lovely Palazzo with Caveat We stayed 7 nights at the Palazzo 12/24 to 12/31/07. The description of the hotel that other travelers provided is true. We had the Livia suite, our kids the Guilia suite. The rooms were enormous with 20 footceilings. There was a TV in the bedroom and one in the living room (Sky TV offered English and other language channels) We didn't watch much TV but it was fun to check out Italian game shows and imported American TV with Italian commercials) The rooms looked out on Borgo San Frediano, while not a busy street is like all Florence streets narrow so your view is of the building across the street. Some rooms face a couryard and some face south which has a view. You may want to specify. The housekeeping was good, lots of fluffy huge towels changed twice a day. Bulgari toiletries in 4 oz sizes replenished as needed. Our bathroom was huge, with 2 sinks, toilet and bidet in separate room.The kids bathroom was smaller, but their bedroom was larger. Nice tub and separate small stall shower. Shower pressure wasokay (we like it stronger). On checkin there was bottle of French chamagne in our room and scented soap to choose from.The rooms are not off a hall but a huge salon where tea and coffee andice are replenished several times a day (and sometimes great chocolates are set out.) The elevator is big enough for 3, but is cuteand it being a small hotel, always available. Large bowl of assorted fruit by the elevator, if you need a snack.Breakfast was nice, fresh fruitcups, wonderful crusty rolls, cheeses, hams, croissants, yogurt, fresh squeezed blood orange juice (among others) Capuccino came decorated with hearts made out of cocoa served by gracious staff with white gloves. (so retro) My son developed a liking for the the pancake (a baked huge pancake) and ate it 7 times. It was 5 euro extra. There were also eggs on the menu, but the rest of us were very happy with the continental offered.The hotel staff speak good English. They arranged our airport transfers to Pisa which were 175 euros. That seemed like much but the transfer was in nice Mercedes van with a good driver.There are many outings offered by the hotel for a steep price. We followe the advise of others on the board, booked independently and saved a lot.The staff booked all our restaurant reservations in advance. I gave a list. The location of the hotel is great. Though we were there in the winterthe center of Florence was still crowded beyond belief. (We are from New York City and know crowds) This part of the Oltarno is less crowed, maybe a 10 minute walk from the center but has a neighborhood feel. There are great restaurants just down every street and local people shopping in little groceries, pastry shops where they don't speak English but the caffe is under a euro and you sit l with locals not busloads of tourists. (Okay so we're tourists too) The terrace hasa great view, the billiard room is always yours, there is a gym if you have energy after walking all day....Now the caveat......The beds are firm. No not just firm, rock hard with a few lumps thrownin. The comforter is filled with maybe cotton. It is heavy though warm. At first we didn't mind, we like hard beds. But after several nights we were definitely uncomfortable and grouchy.This was true of beds in both suites. Most hotels pride themselves on their bedding. This was just unacceptable in a place that was billed as 5 star and in all other aspects really is 5 star. Good mattresses, down comforters and down pillows would have put this place over the top. For all we know the linens were Frette but you can't enjoy Frettewhen you feel like a Medici lying on a hard tomb. I wrote a letter to the owner as when we left explaining the problem. Maybe if other travelers do the same, they will get the hint.So overall, a great place for a 2 nights, then better move on. (unlessthe beds have been replaced)

<Content>Leisurely Florence We were favorably impressed with the hotel. The staff was very helpful and courteous. We enjoy 6 leisurely nights. There are many good restaurants on the same street towards the Ponte Vecchio in all different price ranges. There are 3 bridges that connect to the main tourist areas and all are very close. The Altrano area is one of the oldest sections of Florence. The hotel helped us arrange travel to the airport and went out of their way by providing coffee, juice and rolls at 5:30 AM on the morning of our departure.

<Content>A palace with royal treatment This hotel was the highlight of our recent trip. Words or pictures cannot descibe how beautiful the rooms are. My wife felt like a princess at her castle. The breakfast room and roof top bar are amazing. The staff was helpful and friendly. The location was great. We would not hesitate to treat ourselves to this palace again.

<Content>More Than Just a Hotel WOW! What an experience. The PMF is beautiful, elegant, and a unique experience. Staff is wonderful. The rooftop bar is amazing, and if you get to stay in the Smerelda room, you will be surrounded by 200-500 year old frescos on walls and ceiling. If you can afford it and want something different, i.e. not just a fancy, upscale hotel, this is the place.By the way, the neighborhood is hip and artsy, and somewhat away from the main tourist beat, yet only a few minute walk across the bridge to the major shops and sites.We will never forget the Palazzo Magnani Feroni.

<Content>What a wonderful hotel This was our second stay at the hotel - we visit Florence each year and now prebook this hotel 1 year in advance. Its position is great - just a few minutes' walk from the Ponte Vecchio and all that Florence has to offer. The staff at this hotel are so friendly and professional, the suites amazing - the antique furniture, huge rooms and the welcoming touches of fruit and gift-wrapped soap are added bonuses. The roof terrace has wonderful views of the city.The staff will book restaurants, tours - and even booked our horse and coach for our wedding 3 years ago! Similarly, they welcomed our 1 year old daughter on our return trip.We unhesitatingly recommend this hotel!

<Content>It鈥檚 those special things that make a visit special and, more importantly, memor Whether it was the impeccable timing of the concierge opening the hotel car park in manic Firenze mid-afternoon traffic or the selection of wonderful hand-picked bath soaps, the Palazzo Magnani Feroni is welcoming and offers an exceptionally high standard of service and comfort.The hotel, or rather palace, with a rich history that spans centuries, has been open for around 6 years - you鈥檇 be forgiven for thinking it had been established significantly longer ago.From the opulent suites to the billiards room, the roof terrace to the 20 foot ceilings, the palace is steeped in history and style. Not wishing to be left in the past, all the suites have satellite TV and Internet connections in both the bedrooms and the lounges. The roof terrace bar, with its wonderful views across the city and excellent service leaves one the distinct feeling that asking for a vodka martini, shaken not stirred, would be entirely appropriate. The worst thing, due to the age of the building and no doubt the close proximity to many of Florence鈥檚 great treasures, is the absence of an iron in the rooms 鈥?something the historians amongst us would neither miss or, to be honest, use a great deal.

<Content>A gem in the Oltrarno, Florence-with a view!!!! My husband and I and my two daughters stayed here for a night and we loved it. We found it very easily by car and used the hotel's garage for parking(although there was a charge).The location is great, just a block away from the Ponte Vecchio on the Oltrarno (opposite side of the river from the Duomo for those who haven't visited Florence before -10 mins walk). This means the hotel is quiet at night.The hotel itself is exquisite and spotlessly clean. The public areas were covered in frescos, tromp d'oeil and furnished with antiques.The breakfast was plentiful and offered both cooked and continental buffet. The hotel has only suites which makes it perfect for families and couples alike. Our suite was huge with bathroom (lovely bathrobes and slippers,Bulgari toiletries) two bedrooms, lounge with Sat TV and dining room/kitchen. But it was the little extras like handmade soaps to choose from (free), and fine chocolates (chargeable) and fruit in the public areas which made the difference from other hotels we had stayed in.All the staff were simply charming and very attentive. They made the whole experience complete.My daughter's 4  6 years were totally transfixed with the vintage lift (pink panther /thoroughly modern millie style) which had seats inside.The hotel's clowning glory is it's roof terrace. After 6pm you can order a drink from the rooftop bar and watch the sun setting on Florence which offers a fine view of the Duomo and all the the major sites. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it and will definitely stay there again.

<Content>Amazing Hotel... Read this! We booked this hotel because of trip advisor reviews. When we booked we asked for a possible upgrade. When we arrived they showed us to our upgraded room called Smerelda junior suite... It was the amazing! A domed ceiling with drawing on every inch - we felt like we were in a museum. Waking up and seeing the drawings on the ceiling was a great way to wake up. Huge patio and large bathroom (tiny shower though). The location is great - walking distance to expensive shops but even closer to great restaurants and bars. Best part of our Italy trip!!!

<Content>Royal treatment at the Palace We have spent the last 2 weeks travelling through Italy. We spent 4 nights at Palazzo Magnani Feroni and it was one of the best places we have ever stayed. We travel first class around the world and typically stay in either Leading Hotels of the World and also Small Luxury Hotels.The Palace is an amazing place. We have stayed in many chateaux in France and other palace type accommodations and this was probably the best place of all. The furniture and antique pieces are from the original owners of the palace (the owners still occupy one of the upper floors). We are not big fans of antiques, and our preference is modern and contemporary, but this place is so amazing, the antique pieces contribute to the overall feel.We had a 1 bedroom suite (the Lucrezia room). It was beautiful, very clean and very spacious, in fact by European standards - enormous!!! The palace does those little extras, like providing the next day's weather forecast, and chocolates at turndown in the evening. The room was very comfortable and the staff were amazing! They were all extremely helpful and bent over backwards to help. We were meant to stay here 1 night and fly out of Rome airport the next evening, but I developed a middle-ear infection and could not fly. Our travel insurance company requested a doctors report so we could change all of our flights and accommodation for the remaining 3 weeks of travel, etc, and the hotel staff organized a Doctor that came to our room at the hotel so I didn't have to sit in a clinic. Then, they faxed documents back and forth, to and from our insurance company several times during the night. Our room was available for the next 3 nights, so we extended our stay. The next day, my husband lost a filling so they made a dentist appointment for him. The staff were unbelievably helpful and by far the BEST staff of any hotel we've ever stayed. We are frequent travellers and have travelled all over the world, many times. All the staff were a pleasure, but Valentina was extra special. She was very helpful!The breakfast is good also. There is an extra charge if you want eggs/omelette (5 euro). But, they provide FRESH fruit, cereals, yoghurt, freshly squeezed juice, a variety of breads, cheese, meats and good coffee.They restaurant and trattoria recommendations that the staff provided were really good! They made reservations for us. (Try Mamma Gina's which is a 5 minute walk along the same road, towards Ponte Vecchio - fantastic food!) Also the shopping along the same street - towards Ponte Vecchio, is fantastic! There are about 13 shops along the same road owned by the same man (whom we met, nice guy). Stylish clothing for men and women and great shoes! The beds are firm, but it was not a problem for us.Stay here - it's a great place!

<Content>Warning: early departure If you decide to check out early, as we did, management will tell you their policy is to charge your credit card for unused nights, no matter the reason. We had booked a very expensive 2 BR suite for a 4 night stay (reading reviews at tripadvisor) for our family. We found both beds to be uncomfortably hard, however, and unyielding. When we told the staff, they sent up a quilt to put on top of the mattress under the sheet, which did not solve the problem, and then even another mattress, but of similar design. After two nights of poor sleep, we told management that we planned to check out, but the manager charged our credit card anyway for one additional night claiming that the cancellation policy precluded early departure. Now the email we received at confirmation outlined the allowed cancellation period prior to arrival but specified nothing about an early departure penalty. This was an expensive penalty. We were happy with our change to the Westin Excelsior, however, where for about the same rate we had two comfortable rooms with excellent beds. We also had a view of the Arno, and preferred the Westin's quieter neighborhood. The palazzo is across the Arno ('Oltro Arno') right on a bus route with a stop directly in front of the hotel. The palazzo's strong points: a friendly staff , the fun of staying is place which has a history, and the exceptional breakfast t (included). However, there are many reasons why a stay in a hotel may be cut short, even if opinions about beds will vary. In this hotel, you may end up paying for nights you do not stay if for some reason you have to leave early. For this lack of flexibility, I would not return to this hotel.

<Content>Beautiful palace stay, kid-friendly too My husband, 17month old and I went to Florence for a 3day weekend in Feb 2007. We loved the look of the old Palazzo and magnificent rooms online and were not disapponted. The lobby was dark and cavernous but had a lovely, sun-filled courtyard on the side. The velvet seated, gilded cage elevator, though cramped, was source of great amusement to my son. The stting area shared by the rooms on the second floor was breathtaking with their murano glass chandeliers, and the coffee/tea amenities the hotel stocked was a nice touch. There is a rooftop balcony which is a long climb up the stairwell but which had the most amazing views of Florence. Definitely worth the hike up and it would be lovely on a summer's evening as there is a small bar up there to serve drinks.The breakfast room turned sleek, sexy bar at night (no, really!) had the largest chandelier I have ever seen; at night, the room turned into a place for a cocktail with a pool table lounge next door. Candles filled all the walkways and it was truly impressive.The area south of the river was a nice quiet section of Florence, which is easily covered by foot. A walk into the heart of the city would take 20-25 minutes. For dinner, we booked a babysitting service through the hotel (very easy and the sitter was lovely) and went for a great dinner at Borgo San Jacopo, a sleek restaurant overlooking the river and about an 8 minute walk from the Palazzo. We also booked a daytrip out to the outlets, which we arranged thru expedia but which the hotel can also arrange for you.A lovely visit, beautiful hotel, fantastic service and we would be happy to stay there again on our next 3day getaway to Florence from London.

<Content>Splendid! We stayed at the Palace two nights from 29/3 to 31/3. When we first arrived to the hotel it did not show that it was a palace but just as we entered the doors we had no doubts. Frescos, antiques and other old lovely furnitures. We found out that we had been upgraded to an excecutive suite(Vittoria). The suite was marvelous and we did not want to leave, but we had to eat sometimes and the receptionists helped us in every way when we wanted something. We usualy stay at 5* hotels but this was something more.. Perfect for a honeymoon or something. At night when we went to the bar candles were everywhere. We enjoyed the cd in the room with classic music. When we went out and came back late on the evenings we found out that we had new towels and choclates beside the bed and some notes about wheater and wishes for a good night. I could write a lot but this perhaps will help someone to choose the right hotel or palace!

<Content>The Palazzo is truly palatial! We spent three delightful nights at the luxurious Palazzo Magnani Feroni while visiting our son in Florence. Some friends from elsewhere in Italy joined us for one night, staying in another suite. We never needed a car, since all the attractions of Florence are just across the bridge within easy walking distance.The suites at the Palazzo are huge, lavishly decorated with period artwork, and extremely comfortable. The staff are friendly, English-speaking, and very helpful in making restaurant and train reservations for us. A nice touch was the International Herald Tribune the we found hanging on our doorknob each morning.Upstairs is a grand dining room where a sumptuous breakfast is served, and drinks are available there all evening. The 'piece de resistance' is the covered terrace on the roof with stunning views in all directions. We enjoyed it even in February, and in warmer weather drinks are served there during the evening hours.We recommend this magnificent hotel unequivocally to anyone seeking style, comfort, and luxury in the heart of Florence.

<Content>We felt like royality We celebrated our mother's 80th birthday and Thanksgiving by staying at Palazzo Magnani Feroni. We were booked for 3 days, but we loved our suite, the fantastic breakfasts, the pool room and the wonderful staff so much that we extended our stay another 3 days. The antiques, frescos, velvet seated cage elevator, secluded lounges make one loathe to even leave the hotel. The staff went above and beyond to assure our mother had a fantastic birthday celebration. The location is perfect, a 10 minute walk to the Ufizi as well as the Pitti Palace also a short walk to fantastic restaurants. Palazzo Magnani Feroni will always be my first choice when in Frienze.

<Content>Gem in the Oltrarno The Palazzo Magnani made our 6-day stay in Florence magical. We always try to find unique boutique hotels and we struck gold in Florence. The hotel is exactly as described --- a charming, antique-filled 250-year old palazzo. We stayed in the Esmerelda Suite and were delighted at how modern ammenities had been incorporated into the frescoed junior suite. The staff was excellent --- always friendly, helpful and low-key. The hotel's location in the Oltrarno was fantastic. There are at least a dozen excellent restaurants within a 5-minute walk of the hotel. And, the shopping along Via Santo Spirito and Borgo San Jacopo was fantastic. Best of all, we could be walk to the center of Florence in 15 minutes (which helped work-off all the food!). The only negative was the heating/AC system in our room. It had definitely seen better days. If you expect the latest 5-Star ammenities or a want grand hotel, the Palazzo Magnani is probably not for you. However, if you want charm and elegance in the best neighborhood in Florence, try this hotel. And, don't miss the Santo Spirito market on Sunday.

<Content>Old World Elegance The Magnani Feroni is a hotel is elegant, gorgeous and welcoming but slightly faded . It is exactly as you would imagine an old palazzo to be. The rooms are huge, with very high ceilings and tall windows. We had three people in a suite and there was more than enough room. The bathroom was a bit small, but new and well-appointed. The furnishings are a bit on the shabby chic side, but comfortable. The staff was excellent. Even before booking a room, they responded to my email inquiries promptly. They booked restaurants for us prior to arrival. They were always available and professional, yet warm. They even lent us a laptop computer - no charge.The location is great IF you don't mind a 15 minute walk to the center of town. It never bothered us, even at the end of the day, because the neighborhood is lovely and interesting. My only complaint was the noise at night. You could solve this by requesting a room away from the street. However, my teenage daughter loved watching the street scene late into the night.The view from the rooftop terrace is fabulous!

<Content>Beautiful Museum Hotel It is a rare and precious treat to stay in such a splendid palace. We stayed for 3 nights in the Beatrice Suite which is styled and furnished in the total opulence befitting the Florentine architecture of the 15th Century.Very friendly and well trained staff added to the enjoyment of the stay.Only two other guests also discovered the terrace bar on the top floor . Amazing views of Florence, wonderful cocktails and cool refreshing breezes.An almost faultless experience - just the antique aircon failed to earn it a 100% rating - just 99.9%!

<Content>A feeling of nobility My wife and I just spent 3 nights at Palazzo Magnani and can confirm the positive reviews already published. We would like to share our impressions of this marvelous establishment. The facade is unimpressive as seen from the road 2 bridges away from the Ponte Vecchio. However once you push open the front door you are entering a historic Palace. The entrace is as shown on their website, a long hallway with no reception in site. Actually the reception is off to the left in a discrete room where friendly faces will great you as one of the privilegied guests of the Palazzo, privileged as they only provide 12 suites. We were shown to our Suite across the hall and were impressed by the 2 room 60 - 80 m2 (600 - 800 sft) with beautiful antique furniture. Are they replicates or did some or all belong to the owners grandfather, a 19th century european antique dealer ? With a kitchen this would be a luxurious florentine appartment with 5m (50 foot) high curved ceilings. The early 20th century 2 seat elevator takes the guests up to the 2nd floor where a beautiful breakfast room awaits the visitors. From the sculptured wooden ceiling hangs a Murano chandelier. The order for eggs and hot beverages is taken by a smiling and discret philipino man who will serve you with white gloves. On the other side of the 2nd floor, walking through a large lounge with painted walls and ceiling, is a starcase leading to the terrasse. It is the equivalent of walking up 2 flights but the view from the 130 m2 (1300 sqf) terrasse is a knock-out. From 6pm to 12pm a barman wearing white gloves will serve you your favorite drink. Sitting in a comfortable wrought iron armchair and overlooking the city with a 360掳 view one feels like a noble. This is an unforgettable experience. Fortunately we only live 4,5 hours away by car and for our next (and fourth) visit to Florence we will definitely start checking the availability of Palazzo Magnani Feroni. JH, french Riviera

<Content>A great find My husband, myself and a teenage daughter stayed here last week and loved the hotel. It is a very quiet and comfortable hotel that feels more like you are staying at a friend's large house. The palace/hotel has lots of public lounge areas, but has only 12 rooms, so you feel like you have the place to yourself. The staff is very accomodating and helpful. Our Deluxe Suite was enormous--the largest bedroom I've ever had in Florence plus a large living room with seating for 10 people(I'm not kidding). The ceilings are at least 20 feet and the rooms are nicely furnished with comfortable beds, chairs, etc. The hotel serves only breakfast, but has a FABULOUS terrace bar on the top of the building that has a view to die for.The hotel is a little off the beaten path, but is only about a 5 minute walk to the Ponte Vecchio, so that is really not an issue unless you don't like to walk. This will be my Florence hotel from now on--my daughter liked it too, so it is family friendly.

<Content>opulence is an understatement My wife and I stayed at the Palazo Magnani Feroni for 4 luxurious nights. We were treated like royalty from the moment we checked in. The flowers as well as the small snack, I had arranged for arrival, were magnificent. The patio lounge overlooking the Duomo afforded magnificent sunsets. Our room was massive, consisting of a large sitting area (where one could intertain 15 to 20 people, quite easily), 1 and 1/2 baths, and a wonderfully comfortable bedroom were all over the top. The staff is top-notch (and as the Palazzo has only a small number of rooms, all staff members refer to you by name (including the cleaning staff). My wife and I have travelled extensively, and this is one of the most memorable places we have ever stayed.

<Content>Truely Home away from Home Yes our room, the one with the frescoed walls, only had a shower, (no tub), and it did leak a bit onto the floor, and yes the air conditioner was a bit noisy, but the building is 500 years old! Staying here is literally like sleeping in a museum, and yet the staff helped us to feel right at home. Our stay was four nights and we hated to leave. We will definately be back.

<Content>We were treated royally at the Palace We stayed at the Palazzo Magnani Feroni in March, as we had done last year. The same three young women ran the reception desk and they were as nice and eager to accomodate us as before. Since this is a small, all suites hotel, the service was personal and everyone on the staff treated us as though we were family friends. We were upgraded to a beautiful and huge suite. This is an historic building in Florence and has been owned by one family for several hundred years. It is furnished with antiques from the great grandfather's collections, but has all the modern amenities. Every room smelled wonderfully of parfume, but was not overpowering. My husband loved the perfectly appointed gym for his daily exercise. The bathrooms are modern and large. The staff made all of our reservations and made restaurant recommendations. The location is perfect, just over the Arno on the Oltrano side. We walked everywhere. We now know that last year wasn't a fluke and this place is consistently fabulous. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Florence!

<Content>Royal Stay We stayed here in April, and all I can say is WOW, what an amazing property and what makes it so special apart the beautiful and spacious Suites is the Service and the Staff that make it so special. We were spoiled every single day, the door men would carry my bags up to the Suite I felt like pretty woman, the front desk would greet us by name evey day and Mr. Kaupp the GM what a genious his little attention to everything and gestures such as greeting us at Breakfast every Morning made us feel so at home, he has sure put the word  hospitality  back into the hotel world, thank you. We will come back and will always be a great fan of this wonderful secret in Florence, thank you for an execptional stay.

<Content>The highlight of our honeymoon We stayed at the Palazzo Magnani late Feb 2005 and loved it. Our travel agent recommended it and we weren't disappointed. When they learned it was our honeymoon they upgraded us to a suite. The Magnani Feroni is not for those who want new furnishings and modern decor. Its for the traveler looking for a unique and memorable experience. We loved the 1900 style mirrored elevator, the leopard print lounge, the billiards room, the tapestries, etc. Its decorated in the Italian style; we felt as if we were staying as a guest in a friend's well appointed home. The rooms look just like the photos on their web site. Our room was on the second level (off the pale green colored gallery). The room had a king size bed and was very spacious. The adjoining sitting room was a welcome retreat after being out in the unusually frosty weather. Guests are treated to little touches like choosing their own soap and a collection of CD's which we enjoyed listening to in the evenings before going out. Our bathroom was very large by italian standards with a tub and separate shower and my favorite Bulgari bath products. The upstairs patio has a wonderful view of the city--we'd love to return and enjoy it in warmer weather. We loved the location, just 2 bridges away from the Ponte Vecchio on the Altarno side. We walked everywhere. The front desk staff (Annalisa and Lita?) were wonderful and very helpful, making reservations for museum tickets and dinner. Yes, its on a busy, noisy street but we just closed our double windows and shutters and drapes at night and we had no problem. There's also a good restaurant accross the street called Dante's, that surprising had some of the best pizza we had in Italy. The street has a good selection of restaurants, shops, gelateria, etc. We had a wonderful stay.

<Content>This is a great hotel. Actually I wish I could keep this place a secret. It's that good. My wife and I stayed there in September. The rooms are Huge! We travel extensively and our suite at the Palazzo was the largest in living area of any hotel we've stayed. The staff is delightful and exceedingly helpful. The rooftop terrace has a spectacular view and the bartender there makes a perfect Martini. I read the two negative reviews and wondered if we were writing about the same hotel.Remember, this is an Italian Hotel not one of the American chains. If you want a supurb Italian hotel stay here. If you want to feel like you're still in the USA stay somewhere else.The location is excellent. Two blocks to the Ponte Vecchio, 3 to the Uffizi Gallery. Great trattorias very close to the hotel. Coffee and Ice always available.If you pay the rack rate it's expensive. Maybe too expensive. Check for their specials. If you choose to stay there ask for the Angelica Suite.We're returning in the Spring.Palazzo Magnani Feroni 猫 un hotel meraviglioso. Recomend I questo hotel.

<Content>A little bit of Florentine Magic My wife and I stayed in the Palace for four days in September of this year. We married in Florence during our stay. The experience was magical helped in no small way by the Palace. The staff were most gracious and attentive as we had a large numbers of people visiting us over the weekend particularly on our wedding day. If you want a little bit of magic stay here. If you prefer a hotel then Florence has more than enough choice to satisfy all tastes.

<Content>Small luxury The best ever experienced - not sure if the negative review came from a gentlman looking for a some big hotel chain standard. The palace was an unique experience, maybe the best I ever had.The staff was great and most helpful, the service just excellent and the suites breath-taking.I will be back.

<Content>A gigantic disappointment Yes, the rooms are large. That's about the only positive thing I can say about this old fashioned, worn out and unpleasant hotel. The furnishings and service do not come close to justifying the high price. From the moment we arrived, my wife and daughter were so unhappy that they insisted we change accomodations. The air conditioning was very loud and didn't work, the internet service was non-existent, the beds were hard and uncomfortable, the bathroom was tiny, the breakfast room was dark and eerie, and the staff was indifferent. Indifferent, that is, until we told them we were departing for another hotel, whereupon they became downright surly. Although we advised them that we would be leaving first thing in the morning, we were charged for an additional night anyway, which is like setting $800 on fire. This hotel was a disastrous low point in an otherwise lovely Italian vacation. Our move to Hotel Lungarno down the street was well justified.
