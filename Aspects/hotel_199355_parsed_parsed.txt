<Content>Lovely place to stay We arrived very early (7:30 am) and asked to store our luggage. We were allowed to do so and then we were asked if we would like breakfast! When we said that we weren't to check in until later in the day, the person at the desk said - Its only breakfast - sit down and relax. The cabs and city tour were ordered for us in seconds. It was lovely to return in the afternoons and enjoy tea or coffee as well as nibbles - for free! The mini bar was free and helped with our daily water requirements.We stayed in the first evening for dinner. The food was alright; the service was ok. The location - across from the railway station (haufbahnhof) was incredible. The second night we picked up food from the station - Nordsee!!

<Content>Value for money Booked thru hotel.de. We had no problems with our reservation especially since I booked just around 2 weeks before our stay.We loved the free mini bar which they refilled everyday. Staying here during winter made me and my husband very thirsty so having that minibar was a definite plus. They stocked it with 1 bottle of water, 2 bottles German beer, 2 bottles orange juice, 2 bottles Pepsi, 2 bottles soda water. The room was old, but clean and spacious. They still used the old key system but the room had 2 doors so you can close both doors if you're worried about security. I didn't encounter any unwanted elements although we didn't really stay out late at night as it was very cold and most of the shops closed at 7:30pm. The breakfast offered included cold cuts, bratwurst, bread, rice, dumplings, eggs, cereal, salmon, fruits, yogurt, juices, coffee and tea. They didn't refill the items right away tho'. The hot milk for the hot chocolate ran out and it was just 9am. Dumplings and rice weren't refilled either.The problem we encountered happened on the second night when the guest on the adjacent room turned on his television at 1AM. It was too loud and we couldn't sleep. He did turn the volume down after an hour so we were able to sleep then. I don't know if the walls were thin or his TV was too loud but that definitely put a damper in our stay.The other negative thing was they had their own magazine with a sex feature right on the front cover. Definitely would not recommend this if you have kids with you.Other than that, I still believe this hotel is good value for money in terms of location, the free mini bar and buffet breakfast included. They also provided free snacks in the lobby that included cakes, orange juice and coffee.

<Content>Central Location and Free Extras! Recommended. The railway station is only really a few metres away and I must say that the background noise bugged me at first but I then got used to it. There was also disturbance from coaches in the early hours or the morning, and this was a nuisance but bearable.I took a taxi from the airport and it cost around EUR24, both coming and going. I was at the hotel/airport within 25 minutes on each occasion.Although the hotel and the rooms are clean it does require a refurbishment in my opinion, someone simply decide that a facelift was required a few years ago and painted the walls doors and ceiling with a combination of magnolia cream and whte acrylici or emulsion paint. I think this historic building deserves better than this! The room doors look terrible, appear to have five or six layers of paint. The elevators were very efficient but even these, unfortunately, got a paint makeover and aesthetically they are really horrible, a four star hotel deserves better, for sure. Hotel should also invest in a card access system, instead of the existing simple key system.The bathroom was clean but fittings in the bathtub/shower were broken and the whole room including the tiles and sanitary ware need replacing. Nice clean fluffy towels were supplied and all usual items/accessories also there.Extras...extras...extras...I found a complimentary basket of fresh fruit on arrival and a chocolate on each pillow, which I thought were nice gestures. All minbar items are free and this normally contains two orange juices, two softdrinks and two beers - no chocolates or other edible items though, just liquids. I would recommend Monopol include a TOBLERONE bar of chocolate.The bed and the pillows in particular were very comfortable. The room had no wall mounted or ceiling airconditioning unit, there was a radiator heater which we switched on during one of the nights when temperature was unbearable. The reception staff were not particularly friendly, although they answered every question asked, they hardly ever smiled or showed any genuine interest. On one particular occasion when we asked where best to go shopping ...one of them simply stated Zeile...zeile.... (duh! not really we've never been here before....so be nice!). We got to the Zeile (not sure how you pronounce this) and it was a wonderful shopping experience. We also found time to visit the Grotehaus and Musem of Modern Art, both come highly recommended. One hour for each location is more than enough.Another freebie offered by Monopol ...free coffee and snacks all day in the lobby. The breakfast offers a good choice of cereals, meats, yoghurt, jams, cakes, eggs, fruits and fruit juices. The Monopol has pontential to offer more and instead of the freebies should seriously consider upgrading certain features/facilities. Having said this I was pleased overall with the cleanliness, service and location, so I would consider booking again!

<Content>Wonderful Experience We were a littlle concerned as we read several reviews that mentioned a red light area close by, but we didn't see anything like that. Althought the railway station is only a stone's throw away we were totally undisturbed by the closeness of the station. In fact the station is right across from the hotel and the hotel is well signposted from within the station. If you take the train from the airport you could be in your room within an hour as the hotel fast-track registration for prebooked guests. We booked through Expedia because it was fast and hassle-free.The hotel was wonderful and the rooms, clean, warm and spacious. The bathroom had these huge fluffy towels and had the kind of soap selection found normally in hotels with a highrer grading. The shower was as hot as you want it to be. The bed was comfortable and the double door to the corridor ensured that any corridor noises were almost unheard. The reception staff were very friendly and receptive to requests. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The barman night waiter is a wonderful and friendly guy, full of good humour and tips about the weather and about things to see and do. The free bar in the room is free and stocked twice daily. You can get free coffee and snacks all day in the lobby. The hot breakfast was included and there was a vast choice of cereals, meats, yoghurt, jams, marmalades, cakes, eggs, fruits and fruit juices. You could have piping hot coffee and there is a huge selection of teas including herbal teas. The elevators were fast and the place was clean throughout. The lobby is a friendly, sunlit and comfortable place to sit and for those of us who had to drag ourselves homeward eventually, there is a safe left-luggage room. The place had an olde-worlde feel to it. It was full of charm yet modern. We had a wonderful time there and we are recommending it to our friends.

<Content>Excellent hotel, highly recommended Great銆€value for money, traveller friendly hotel (breakfast until 11am, check out 12, free tea / coffee and snacks). Staff were exceptionally helpful. Hotel is located near main railway station which can be seedy but is very convenient if catching trains etc. Highly recommended.

<Content>Nice experience Monopol hotel is centrally located, just opposite the train station and at 30 seconds from Bhor Bus Stop (which takes you to Hahn airport). From there you can easily reach the city centre (Zeil) and if you spend too much time in the pubs of the centre, you can walk back to the hotel on foot without any need to spend extra money for taxis (mind it's about a 25 minute walk, but you can still do it).Structure: the hotel is an ancient building with a very nice hall. Rooms are wide and clean. The bathroom is large and it's equipped with a large bath and shower. The furniture in the rooms is not very modern (it looks like those pieces of furniture from the 60ies), but there is a nice mini bar, which is completely free of charge and is refilled every day.Breakfast: breakfast is huge, there's a wide selection of everything, from Engish style breakfast (with German nuances) to the usual continental breakfast, including salmon (which is not very continental, but it's delicious).Services and Facilities: tea, coffee and a selection of cakes are always available at the hall free of charge.This hotel is connected from the inside to another hotel and they have a common PC room, which is free of charge (super, considering that I needed to check my email on a daily basis).Price is low: 64 euros per night (single room+breakfast), but I got to know that prices increase a lot during trade fair periods.My friend Daniel (who's German) visited me and he did not like it that much because of the furniture, however, I think the services and facilities provided made it a worth hotel where to stay (I think the price is lower compared to most same quality Italian hotels)

<Content>Good Value with Lots of Extras - Great for Train and Airport Access This hotel is rather dated which really does add to its charm. It is located directly across the street from the main train station which means you can make it to the airport in 15 minutes which was perfect for us who had an early monring flight.Our room (169) was huge with high ceilings. The bathroom was also large with two sinks. Furnishings and fittings are old, but have been cared for in a bit of a hodge-podge way.The hotel really throws amenities at its guests - hot breakfast buffet that runs from early to late morning, free min-bar with beer, water, and soda, free afternoon coffeee and cake.Nothing fancy, but a good value.

<Content>Nice stay at the Monopol Had a great stay at the Monopol Hotel. Check in was smooth and efficient and the staff were eager to please. The hotel is within walking distance of the railway station so location is superb. The rooms were spacious and clean and the free mini bar was a bonus. The only downside to our stay was the lack of air conditioning. The weather was unpredictably hot and it made the room quite stifling. That was the only negative though and I wouldn't hesitate recommending this hotel to anyone else.

<Content>Good Hotel We have just returned from a three night stay at The Monopol . Check in was quick and efficient and the guy on reception was very friendly and informed us if we needed any help/info about the hotel or the city in general that he would be happy to help us, he recommended a great restaurant in the old town and told us of a great neighbourhood in the north east of frankfurt, along the north of berger strasse that had some non-touristy shops and cheap boutiques. There are (from what I gathered) 4 male reception staff and 2 female staff One of the male staff is very unfriendly, as is one of the female staff, bith seem to be more interested in finishing their shift than dealing with clients. The room (twin room) was spacious, very clean and the beds were comfortable, free minibar was a bonus, (the door of the cupboard where the minibar was fell off when we opened it and we rang reception, within 15 mins the door was repaired.) Bathroom was very clean and there was an abbundance of hot water all day.The buffet breakfast was great (bread/rolls, cold meat, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages and tea/coffee/juice)The restaurant was ok. food was a bit pricey but of good quality. The only downside is that it took over 30 minutes for our starter to arrive (we would have left only we were very hungry and to tired to go elsewhere), but when it arrived it was fab.The location as mentioned in previous review has its pros and cons, its across from the south exit of the main train station but in the red light area, ( the main problem in the area is not actually that its a red light area but that its full of drug dealers and addicts so be careful at night.)Overall, The hotel was very reasonable for the level of service provided and I would recommend it to anyone. In my opinion its definetly the best within its price range.Ps. for anyone whos travelling by ryanair fron Hahn Airport (which is a 1hour 40 minute drive from the city) The shuttle bus for Hahn airport is located at the end of the carpark to the left of the hotel, It costs 12 each way.

<Content>Fantastic A group of 12 of us stayed here for two nights from the 23/2/2007 to the 25/2/2007. I have to admit I have stayed in many Hotels and I found The Monopole to be one of the best I have ever stayed in. The staff could not help you enough. The food and service were top class. I could not praise this Hotel enough. It is also very central and with easy access from both Airports. Well done to all those working there!

<Content>This is not a Four Star Hotel! Myself and 2 members of my family spent 3 nights in the Monopol which was booked through a travel agent as part of a Formula 1 package. The hotel is advertised as 4 star however this rating is very misleading. The room was clean and house keeping did a very nice job but there is no air conditioning in this hotel. The heat in the hotel was stifling, so much so that we abandoned the room during the day for the comfort of air conditioned shops and restaurants. The small electric fan they gave us did not provide much comfort at night time either and we had to leave the window open all night just for a little air! This is ok if your room is at the back of the hotel but the front of the hotel faces the extremely busy central station which, as you can imagine, is very noisy. The Monopol also boasts about their 'free cakes and tea available all day'. This consists of a table laid out opposite reception with a couple of plastic jugs full of tea which is always cold. Breakfast was quite nice but I would not eat at the hotel for dinner as there was not a good selection and the food was quite pricey. The area around the hotel is very dirty and we did not feel comfortable leaving the hotel after dark. If you are expecting to catch a glimpse of picturesque German streets you will need to take a train or taxi to another part of town. There is no atmosphere in this hotel and the front desk staff aren't particularly helpful either. If you want to see Frankfut on a budget, this hotel might be a good option but if you are expecting Four Star standards you will be very disappointed.

<Content>If you're coming by train, it's a great location! This hotel is right across the street from the train station, so if you are arriving late or leaving early, this is a good place to stay. The rooms were large and clean and we were very comfortable. The hotel was pretty bland from a style point of view, but we found the place an easy and accessable place to stay. As a plus, there was free internet access in the business center.

<Content>Hotel with no atmosphere We were really looking forward to our break but we had the misfortunate to stay in the Hotel Monopol for the Easter Weekend. On arrival, the man at reception was very unfriendly and unhelpful. Our room was very old fashioned and you couldn't turn the heat down. The pay as you watch t.v. was only in German and could not be changed to English. On return after our first night out we found the hotel doors closed and no one to be seen anywhere. Only for a taxi driver who told us that you had to go in throught the hotel next door we would have been left outside all night as this was never explained to us on our arrival. The restaurant was very quiet with only another couple having breakfast the following morning. I found the staff in general very unhelpful and uninterested in their residents. We were booked to stay in the hotel for three nights but checked out after the second and moved to another hotel. It was amazing the change in atmosphere and the friendly staff who made our staff as comfortable as possible. I'm afraid we could not recommend a stay in this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great Value! Overall value was great! The rooms were incredibly clean and up-to-date! It is extremely convenient since the hotel is located directly across the street from the train station. It costs 25Euros to travel by taxi and 17Euros by train to the airport.

<Content>beside central station Stayed for two nights. Good size rooms. free minibar and breakfast. Bowl of fruit also in room. Decor very old. doors to rooms looked very shabby and some had bits that were stuck on with tape which did not make me feel very secure at night time. you could hear a lot of noise in the room from the surrounding rooms above. some of the staff were nice. The restaurant was the few tables that you see sitting in the lobby which did not appeal to me ITs just across from the train station which was great because you could get on a train for the shopping district and five minutes you were there. there are a few restaurants about there. We went to oreillys pub which served nice food in a warm atmosphere. you also have mc donalds , burgerking and starbucks in the train station.

<Content>Nice hotel with pros and cons I stayed at Monopol hotel for 3 nights in January 2006, so here are my impressions.Positive:+ Location. It's exactly opposite the south exit of the Central Train Station (Hauptbahnhoff), so all trains, metro etc. are at your feet. Inside the station there's an amazing variety of food, snacks and drinks to heal your hunger and quench your thirst (incl. McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks and Haagen Dazs).+ Neighbourhood. Let's face it. Like in every major city, the areas around train stations gather all sorts of individuals and naturally they aren't the favorite places to hang out, so one should be careful and mind their own business as well. However I had no problems whatsoever, even when walking to the hotel past midnight. Also the main street is very well lit and outside the hotel's entrance there's a taxi rank with the cabbies waiting inside their cars.+ Check-in. Quick, professional and efficient, from 9 in the morning. This is a pleasant surprise, especially if you arrive with a morning flight. No need to wait till the afternoon for your room. Everyone in the staff speaks English too. You have to carry your luggage to the room on your own, but there are two elevators and no up and down stairs so no problem.+ Room. I stayed in a quiet single room with a view to the back of the hotel, but the daylight was still coming inside pleasantly. It wasn't very big but the ceiling was quite high so it didn't feel claustrophobic. There's also a 20 inch color tv mostly with german channels, cnn, mtv and pay tv (be careful here).+ Free mini bar. Soda, mineral water, orange juice and beer. They refill it every day and it's totally free of charge. Cool.+ Shower. Good water pressure and enough hot water day and night (though you have to let it run for a couple of minutes).Negative:- Bed. The bed was small, meant to be for one person only. If you move too much in your sleep, you're likely to fall down. The matress and the pillow were a bit too soft for my taste. There are no sheets, just a single duvet with a cover.- Bathroom cleanliness. Overall I can't say that the bathroom was dirty, however the toilet wasn't sanitized upon check-in and I found some pubic hair on the seat.- Room temperature. There's no air-conditioning, just a built-in radiator that you cannot adjust. I didn't freeze but sometimes it felt a bit chilly. The temperature outside was minus 15 celcius and I could use the extra heat. But the real problem has to be during the summer I suppose. I don't remember if the windows open.- Room safety. Nothing was actually stolen from my things, but I left a half-opened pack of chocolate cookies on the table and at least three were missing. Maybe the cleaning lady was hungry, that's fine with me, but this alerted me a bit and, since there's no safe in the room, I had to keep valuable things locked in my suitcase just in case.- Breakfast room. Although the continental breakfast buffet was nice, the room itself was FREEZING (I can't explain why) and you had to finish your food quickly if you didn't want to catch pneumonia. Also there are no designated areas and people are smoking everywhere. I'm a smoker myself, but even I can't stand people smoking around me while I'm eating, especially in the morning.- Check-out. They wanted to charge me 12.5 euros for pay tv that I didn't watch (honestly). Maybe the hungry cleaning lady was in the mood for a flick. I refused to pay and they made me fill in a complaint form stating the reason I wouldn't pay (I have to check my credit card statement about that though).

<Content>Fine for a night or two; nice amenities My husband, 8-year-old son and I stayed here on 28 November. We chose the hotel based on other reviews posted here. While it has worn patterned carpets and thin walls and doors, the management is obviously trying hard to make up for this with nice amenities. Our non-smoking room (a triple - 3 twin beds) was very clean, and the bathroom had been updated and had a great shower. As the hotel advertises on its website, the mini-bar is free, as are local calls. The included breakfast had a large selection and is served from 6 AM onward. The hotel shares its parking garage with the next-door Hotel Excelsior. It's a bit tricky to locate, so you may want to doublepark briefly to get directions from the hotel staff. (Taxis line the curb of the street the hotel is on.)Location-wise, not bad at all. While the neighborhood has been described as a bit seedy, it didn't seem that terrible, at least in November. Since it is near the central train station, there are all types of people around, but this is true of a similar area in any major city. After checking with tourist information in the train station, we took the #11 S-bahn to the Frankfurt Christmas market. It was very easy driving out of Frankfurt the next morning to get to the airport for our early flight - basically, just hang a right and go over the bridge and continue straight until you see airport exit signs.

<Content>Very good value for price Stayed 2 nights when going to and coming back from Switzerland in Hotel Monopol in June, with 2 kids, 11 and 13 years. We got really big room with bunkbeds for kids and a doublebed for adults, room facing Frankfurt trainstation. Were all very happy with the room witch incl. free minibar and breakfast, for 80 鈧? Nice decor, a little shabby perhaps, in the hotel but no complaints. Staff was also friendly. Lots of people from India and Japan staying.Booked this hotel based Tripadvisor, wasn麓t disappointed. Would recommend it, definitely.

<Content>Monopol Frankfurt - Great value for single or family Stayed here for 2 nights. Family of four with room price less than E100, Fantastic !Great value, large rooms with coffee table and small living area, clean rooms, free mini bar, free (and excellent) full american breakfast with huge selection, helpful staff. We really appreciated this place !Great location being right across from main train station - just find the south (if I remember correctly) exit and it is right across the road.Great location for catching the train to say Rudesheim (pretty little town) and then catching ferry down the Rhine to Braubach (to take tour of Marksburg Castle). That's what we did !Higly recommend this place for cheap stop-over, not 5 star but it is value plus.

<Content>Faded grandeur Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights from 16 October. The hotel is right across the road from Hauptbahnhoff so is very central if you arrive by train. It is also easy walking distance to the main shopping area, and right around the corner from one of the major day tour companies. My room was a single but with an enormous queen bed, 2 doonas, recently updated large bathroom, ample wardrobe space, small coffee table and 2 chairs in an alcove. This hotel has free minibar (orange juice, colas, water, beer) in room and free coffee and cakes for guests in the lobby. Breakfast was ample with cereals, fruit, breads, hot food and even an Asian breakfast. They do serve dinner, but you are better off eating from the many choices at the station. The outside of the hotel and the main reception area have seen better days but the service was excellent and the room was clean and fresh. The only problem I had was that they forgot to put clean towels in the room the 2nd day I was there. Yes, I would definitely stay here again as I only paid 79 Euro per night as a single.

<Content>No hot water?? Overall, the room was a great value for a one night stay. Larger than most, clean, comfortable, with a HUGE breakfast spread. However, we had no hot water (not even slightly warm) before our trip back to the US which made for a slightly uncomfortable flight home.

<Content>Good for Brief Stays Overall the room was quite good. Renovated bathroom however no screens on windows which proved to be a little dangerous with small children.Bedding provided for our daughter was quite good considering the cot looked about 50 years old.Reception area and dining facilities were all very good. Breakfast was amazing. The only problem we had was in finding the hotel. However being from a foreign country we were having enough problems just staying on the correct side of the road whilst driving.I think for a night or two this would be a good place to stop. Facilities are above average as is the service.

<Content>Great for Layovers I had a one night layover here last November when flying between New York and Chennai. What was really fabulous was that you can take the train from the airport right to the center of Frankfurt and the Hotel Monopol is literally across the street from the train station. No muss or fuss with cabs or anything else. It's unbelievably convenient if you need quick access to the airport and prefer not to pay a fortune for a car. Also, the river nearby is just beautiful. I liked the people working there and the hotel was kookily quaint and old world. It cost under $100 U.S. and was a good value, considering the strength of the Euro. Free internet, though all my messages came through garbled because the keyboard was configured for German. The only REAL downer was that my room was FREEZING. Management was very chintzy with the heat, I didn't have enough blankets, and wound up sleeping in my parka with my wool socks on. Also, there was no coffee in the rooms, which was kind of a drag. They have it downstairs, but it's just served in a pot so that's cold, too. Bring your little mini water heater! Happy trails, Sheila

<Content>Surprisingly good value The Monopol was surprisingly good value. The room was a good size, the bathroom was newly renovated. The breakfast was above average. Refreshments (tea, coffee, fruit, juice and cake) were available all day at no charge.The staff were friendly and helpful.It's location close to the rail station was a bonus.Overall it was much better than other hotels we stayed in, in Europe in a similar price range.

<Content>Great Value Monopol Hotel is located just 50m on the southern side of the Hautpbanhof Station. Booked through Hrs.de at a bargain price of 65 euros in March 2004 which included full breakfast, free unlimited internet access in the lobby, free small minibar, free afternoon buffet, free newspapers.Rooms were adequate, clean and functional. Great choice for the money.

<Content>good overnight before flight I have stayed at the Monopol one night before catching an early morning flight home to New York. Good price, good decent room and best point is extreme convenience for getting to early morning flight...directly across from the Frankfurt main train station. I arrived late and had no concerns about the neighborhood...outside is well-lighted and there are late-night food/magazine/book stands in the Frankfurt-Am-Main Hauptbahnhof (main station). Next morning, it was easy to catch any of several trains direct to airport. Left too early to try breakfast, but desk staff was courteous and breakfast would be available starting at 6am. Juices and water from the minibar in your room are FREE. In December, 2003, my room cost a total of 64Euros, a bargain.I plan to stay here again for last-minute overnights such as this, but looks like the price has risen a bit for 2004.
