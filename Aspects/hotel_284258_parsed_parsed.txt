<Content>Loved the thoughtful little touches We stayed at the Amora Jamison for 10 nights in December and loved every minute of it. We were upgraded upon arrival to a junior suite, with a separate living area and huge bathroom. Also we had a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates waiting for us in our room. All of the staff were friendly, helpful, and couldn't do enough for us. The location is brilliant, only a short walk to Cirular Quay, the Rocks, and about a 10 minute walk to Darling Harbour. I would also agree with the recommendation of the Barramundi Cafe across the road for breakfast, excellent value and lovely staff.On our first night we were shattered from our trip so just ordered room service rather than head down the restaurant, but the food delivered to us was delicious, and we also had a complimentary bowl of MMs!We were staying at the hotel over Christmas and woke up on Christmas morning to find a box of festive cookies waiting for us outside our room, another lovely little touch.We cannot wait to stay here again.

<Content>Fantastic value and a well-kept secret LOCATION: The hotel is located just off the north end of George St. It is closer to The Rocks and Circular Quay as well as the new Ivy complex and the nearest train station is Wynyard. ROOM: Upon arrival, we were informed that we had been automatically upgraded to a more superior corner room on the 25th floor. We were impressed with this, as we hadn鈥檛 even requested an upgrade. There was a wonderful view of the city from our room and it was well-appointed with a very comfortable king size bed, armchair, ottoman, work desk, lamp, TV (with various cable channels) and wardrobe, etc. There was also a mini bar and ironing board and iron. The design of the room and the whole feel was clean and quite modern. The only downside of the room was that the blinds were quite thin and therefore didn鈥檛 really keep the sun out the next morning. The windows are probably double-glazed but even that high up, it still didn鈥檛 stop some of the noise from the street below from being heard. The bathroom was very spacious and there was a bathtub and separate shower area. The hotel provided toiletries i.e. shampoo, conditioner, moisturiser, bath gel, hand soap. SERVICE: Everyone at the hotel was extremely friendly, willing to help and efficient. AMENITIES: The hotel has a small gym with relatively modern equipment as well as a pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. There is also an Angsana spa (wonderful service) with various treatments and massages 鈥?we were able to book at a moment鈥檚 notice and were very happy with the service there. DINING: There are a couple of restaurants in the hotel. We didn鈥檛 get a chance to eat at Charr but at the other restaurant where the buffet breakfast is held) on the same floor, just opposite Charr). Both the dinner and the breakfast were delicious and quite good value and the service was fantastic both times. This is one of the few hotels I鈥檝e stayed at that offers soy milk during breakfast 鈥?impressive and rare.

<Content>Mystery Hotel FANTASTIC My fiance and I booked a mystery hotel online and got this place! I had never heard of it but am glad I have now! not only was it in walking distance to the train station, rocks and circular key but the staff are lovely and they put us on the 28th floor in a corner room with veiws over the city! it was spectacular! We could see the harbour from our bathtub! Definately not what i was expecting for the price! What is also great about this hotel is that they spread their patrons around the hotel, in other words there was no lines at check in and we only saw one other person on our floor our entire stay and they were at the other end of the hall. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!

<Content>Classy hotel with great service I managed to book this hotel as a mystery deal on a popular hotel booking website. This hotel is located in a great spot next to Wynyard train station which makes it easy to get around and a short walk to Circular Quay and the rocks.I was impressed from the very beginning with small touches such as the concierge opening the doors upon arrival to the prompt friendly front desk check in staff.No issue was too hard for them - they brought up shaving cream (albeit in a small tube) when my partner forgot his and even found a European travel adaptor for the wall plug. The room was clean and modern, the shower HUGE and the king size bed was amazing. The only slight issue is that Jamison street is on a hill so you'll be huffing by the time you get to the door after a day of shopping or sightseeing. Will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Fabulous Stay- Yet again I just had to once again write about my stay at this hotel. I have stayed at this hotel 3 times now and on my last stay I was even more impressed.I had emailed the hotel requesting a nice room because it was a birthday/anniversary. Upon arrival at the hotel, I was advised that we were upgraded to a deluxe king room! Was so happy. The room was in a corner and so quiet. The view was spectacular on our 29th floor room!They even gave us complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates!Service is still amazing! Service is always polite, helpful and with a smile.

<Content>Perfect! Everything about the Amora Jamison is perfect, great location, the rooms are comfortable and well fitted out. (they even have a pillow menu) Staff are always very attentiveTheir restaurant is just as good, I had breakfast there and it was expensive but worth it. Freshly squeezed juice topped it all off.

<Content>Classy Accommodation Really nice hotel in fabulous location. 4 blocks to Opera House area, easy walking distance to all major attractions. Nice attention to detail. Very comfortable beds. Fabulous soaker tub. Internet is plug in for $30/day or $50/week. Buffet breakfast was disappointing.

<Content>wonderful stay I booked our stay via Expedia from the Uk based on much research and previous traveller reviews. We were not disappointed. From check in to check out we had a wonderful stay. Our rooms and bathrooms were spotlessly clean, well equipped and had fantastic views. Slippers and robes were a nice touch.Taking the club rooms and club lounge option was certainly worth the extra. A delightful haven to begin the day with breakfast or start the evening with drinks and canapes. Attentive and well informed staff. Parking was an issue but a valet dealt with that for us even though the rates were a little steep. I suppose it is right in the city centre after all! The location is perfect. Central for all the sights, rail and ferries. We will be visiting Sydney again next year and there is no doubt about which hotel we would use. J  A B UK

<Content>Good location/ Nice Staff We stayed at Amora over the October Long Weekend. Very easy to find, took the sky train- Off at Wynyard and about a 3 minute walk.. We checked in, were given our key card, went to our room- only to find it was occupied!! How embarassing, staff didn't seem at all surprised. Just gave us another room, however I was a bit nervous all weekend, that some one would appear in our room. The bed was really soft, sheets wouldnt tuck in properly so every morning we had odd lines from the loose sheets!! The bathroom is beautiful, may have been upgraded, but the rest of furnishings were a bit old and scratched.We mainly ate at Baramundi cafe across the road- as 39.50 per person for breakfast is a bit steep. HIghly recomend Baramundi- we had 2 Breakfast and 1 dinner there. As this was a last minute deal I think it was OK, all the staff are really lovely, just some of their procedures need updating. Great easy walk to The Rocks, Circular Quay and Darling Harbour.

<Content>attentive staff Hotel staff are polite and attentive. Room was above average.One of the few 5-star hotels in Sydney CBD that provides self-parking on the premises. This is a bonus if you do not trust strangers to park your car.One warning is that there is a beggar in the vicinity of the hotel. He was abusive and threatening as I walked alone to the hotel. When I mentioned it to the door-men they didn't seem to care, they just smiled at me... During my stay at the hotel, I saw this beggar hanging around and whenever I was leaving and arriving at the hotel I was constantly concerned for my own safety.

<Content>Good Enough For Us! I was booked to this hotel through a secret deal on a certain website.After reading a few reviews I was a little worried what to expect! I believe it comes down to what you expect in a hotel,and previous experiences in 5 star. I rarely travel,so the thought of a 5star hotel in sydney sounded good.My daughter (7) and I stayed overnight in a deluxe king room.We traveled by train to wynyard station and is only a street away walking.On arrival,the door was opened with a welcome to the amora the girls at front desk were polite and showed us how to use the cards for the elevator and rooms.Our room was on floor 17.I found the rooms spacious enough,HUGE king size comfortable bed,well stocked bar fridge,tv,robes,slippers,guides to sydney,very nice bathroom with deep tub,seperate shower,shower gel\shampoo\cond\hand lotion. Our room looked into the other buildings with glimpses of the water,but if you stay in the CBD you just expect that and being from the country it was fine with us to check out the city. We had a light dinner at the Gallery and was nice.Breakfast for a buffet is $33,but there is a food court practically underneath,with every kind of eatery you could wish for.Also a cafe next door advertising full breakfast and coffee for $12.50.Location - Perfect! A short walk to circular quay\botanic gardens\ferries\trains etc was excellent.We explored the hotel pool which we thought was nice with a sauna\steam room\spa as well,and the beauty room.Did not use these but seemed very relaxing.Other reviews say about times with this hotel.Yes the pool\restaurants etc are open certain times, so if this is important to you doesnt it make sense to find this stuff out before you go?Anyway we loved it,and the service,I think if you have a smile,they will too.

<Content>Very Bad Service Booked this hotel from the internet and everything looked fine on the web site. Unfortunately apon arrivial found that this hotel is in a real need of a wake up call i found all staff rude and unwilling to help with offering assistance, i always had to ask. I also ate in the Hotels Signature restaurant and found the food over priced and lacked any taste or style at all. I would recommend for anyone who does stay there to eat outside of the hotel. My last complaint of the hotel is that i wouldnt ask the door man for a taxi its quicker to get one your self.

<Content>Everthing was perfect! My boyfriend and I stayed here on a package on a Saturday, which included a quality 2 course dinner and breakfast and it was a wonderful weekend, could not have asked for more from this hotel or the staff. The Amora Jamison has reasonable rates and is great quality, not to mention within a very short walk of the Pitt Street Mall, and 15 minutes to Darling Harbour. Rooms have large windows and modern fittings, the lovely bathroom had a large deep free-standing bath, and there were robes and slippers in the wardrobes. There is also a sleek, long pool, spa, steam room and sauna, and day spa and complimentary newspapers provided each morning.Staff were EXTREMELY helpful at every step, from front desk, and concierge through to waiters and reservation staff. We were in Sydney to see Phantom of the Opera and the attentive staff were more than happy to work an early dinner in for us before the show. All up, the whole stay was perfect.

<Content>Huge beds! I stay at the Amora 4-5 times a year as my company's Sydney office is just around the corner. The rooms are very attractively furnished, although not huge. The bathrooms are also very nice. But my favourite aspect is the bed - I'm very tall and the Amora's beds are so big I can almost sleep sideways in them.Some rooms have fairly decent harbour vierws, although far from unobstructed.The TVs could do with being updated - 4:3 CRTs really aren't good enough these days.I usually pay approx $210-230, but it's booked through my company's travel agent, so rates are outside my control.In summary, for a place where I usually check in at about 9pm and check out at 7am the next morning, it's perfectly adequate.

<Content>An almost 5* experience The hotel is ranked 5 stars by many vendors, but I would say that a few customer service details could be ironed out.Location-wise (+2) for being 2 minutes walk from Wynyard station which has trains coming in straight from the airport. There is a foodcourt/mall next door (which I never visited) and is very convenient for the financial district.When I arrived at the hotel on a Sunday evening, I was greeted by a friendly doorman who held the doors open, smiled and greeted me (+1). While the check-in desk was clearly visible, pointing me in the right direction or offering to help with my bags would have been nice (-1).Check-in was really quick (+1); All I needed was to hand over my passport  business card (so I wouldn't have to fill in the form) and got my key in seconds. What I didn't get was confirmation if breakfast was included in my rate and where breakfast was served. (-1) obviously the receptionist was new, but another staff member who overheard us stepped in and sorted it out.While it is also very common for lifts to need a key card to operate, it would have been nice to have been reminded so I wouldn't stash away my key (-1).Room was clean and had most amenities ready so no complains there; TV came with a key board and PS2 control; but quickly found out that the keyboard wasn't working (-1) TV was also a 21 CRT mounted on the top shelf of a cupboard adjacent to the bed - which made viewing difficult (-1). TV volume came in 3 settings - mute, loud and deafening (-1).Bathrooms were large and modern (+1), additional amenities were available on request but I didn't bother.The bed was unremarkable, but in the dead of winter, one would expect that the beds be made with the blanket rather than have the blankets be stashed away in the cupboards wrapped in plastic (-1).Room service  dining options are limited but good. (albeit expensive) waitress warned that the risotto was quite salty  I was curious if she had ever told that to the chef! I had a $30 plate of pasta  mushrooms which I thought was over priced, but the $18 duck entree was a winner. Breakfast was mediocre but Conference dining was very good so overall it would have been a 0 (+1,-1,+1,-1 etc etc.)Check out was equally quick and the doorman ran out into the street to get me a cab (+2).There's also the Angsana Spa and a pool, but I never made it up to the 3rd floor. Also, I come from the land of $40 massages, so I wouldn't dream of forking out $210 for a rubdown.Would I stay here again? Well it was expensive and if it wasn't for the conference being held there, might have gone to the 4 points sheraton for my starwood points instead.

<Content>Great stay - think I scored an upgrade I spent 1 night at the Amora when on Business. I got a great rate booked through my office and I think I scored an upgrade in the deal - although nothing was said to me at check in. I had a room on Lv 32 on the western side of the building. Very comfortable King Bed with a large picture window. A big comfy lounge chair and a work desk were in the room. a big wall unit contained everything you could want - fully stocked mini bar and tea/coffee making, TV with internet and games, robes, slippers, etc the funny part was the big old boxy TV - still it had perfect reception.the bathroom was large with a big soaking tub up against a picture window - I enjoyed a great soak although you can't see out the window once in the tub. the best part was that there was a TV Volume / speaker in the bathroom. So I soaked away whilst listening to a program. The range of toiletries was great - soap, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, toothbrush and paste, vanity set with cotton balls, pads, shower cap, sewing kit etc etcHad good lighting for doing my makeup including a magnified shaving mirror on a retractable arm.I used the gym - which was pretty good - good quality machines in perfect order. the room was a bit small and there were no hand weights or fitballs. I had breakfast at the buffet the next morning and that was very good. a bit expensive but they did cook me 2 poached eggs and there was a chef making fresh omlettes to order. check out was very easy I wish I could have stayed longer - very comfortable

<Content>Very disappointed My husband and I stayed at the Amora Jamison for 3 nights. We arrived later than expected due to our flight being delayed and upon arrrival at the hotel (which was after 2pm) we found our room not ready. The check in staff apologised and asked if we would like another room to which we replied 'yes'. They then couldn't get the swipe keys to the room to work so gave us a couple of complimentary drink cards to go and sit in the bar whilst they sorted our room. We went to our room not long after and found a nice letter on the bed welcoming back another geust to the hotel, which we recieved phone calls throughout the entire stay (very annoying). We had booked the 'sweethearts package' and this package included sparkling wine and chocolates on arrival in the room. The wine was in the room but no chocolates, phone call was made to reception to ask for the chocolates. We received at the door a bowl of fruit, didn't ask for this but took it anyway. Another phone call was made to enquire about the chocolates, recieved another bottle of wine, another phone call and we had the chocolates. There didn't seem to be any communication between the 4 staff members we spoke to but all the extras was free of charge!! The package also included in room dining for breakfast which arrived on time each morning but the staff just pushed the trolley into the room and said the toaster is in the cupboard and left. We left our room the following morning at 9.30 to go shopping and returned to our room around 2pm. Our room had not been made up in this time so we phoned housekeeping to complain, floor manager explained they had 400 rooms to get through etc...This is not our problem and when check in is 2pm you would expect adequat staff to complete this task. Our room was cleaned and within half hour of the cleaner leaving we had another knock at the door to clean our room!! When we checked out they tried to charge us for the mini bar items that had been used (not by us). We had previously stayed here when it went by the name of Rydges Jamison and I think when the name changed all the excellent staff went with them. We will never stay here again.

<Content>Last Minute Treat My partner  I stayed at this hotel for one night after a tough week at work.. We both live in Sydney suburbia  decided to spend a Friday night in the city as a treat.. We actually booked this hotel on the wotif website, which is a lottery selection of sorts. We got a complimentary upgrade upon arrival to a larger room with a HUGE bed. There is a lovely view over the city lights which I always love to see. The bathroom was gorgeous with a fabulous big bath tub. The staff couldn't have been more friendly. The location is great, very central. The best part for me was the pillows though! (sad i know) I have never slept on a nicer, softer, more comfortable pillow in my life! So much so that I keep promising myself that I am going to ring the hotel to see if I can buy them!

<Content>very friendly place to stay My partner and I spent three wonderful nights at the Amora Jamison and we could not fault any aspect of our stay.The room was spotless, the bed was so comfortable and the bathroom very modern. We would highly recommend this accomodation to all our friends and family. The staff were Excellent, Friendly and the doorman was very well mannered and polite.Room service was five star. We have stayed in many hotels in Sydney and this one rated the best all round for us. In future we will only stay at Amora..Thankyou to all staff!!!!!! keep doing such a great job. We will be back soon

<Content>Nice hotel This is a nice hotel in a good location - it's an easy walk to the Harbour Bridge, the rocks and Opera House. The rooms are large, and the bathrooms are amazing.We got a really good deal on the hotel by doing various web-searches.

<Content>Great Stay I found this hotel to be excellent. I booked it as a Wot Hotel on wotif so I got a great rate. I arrived late at night and found check in easy and the staff were friendly for that time of night. The room was a good size but not huge. Great bathroom with bath and quality products. Has everything other 5 star hotels has but doesn't quite seem 5 star. Location is fantastic, close to shops and the Harbour. I didn't have room service, but had the buffet breakfast which I found be excellent. Friendly staff that continually walked around topping up tea and coffee which was appreciated. My stay was great but I was glad I got it at a reduced price, a little pricey at its recommended price.

<Content>Good if you get a cheaper price I stayed here for one night and conducted some meetings in this hotel. I wouldn't say it is up to five star standard, some of the staff seem to have trouble grasping english and the design of the rooms is a little weird. I had a room on the 14th floor with a balcony. The bed was huge and comfy and the bathroom was immaculate but for some silly reason the TV is at the side of the bed so you can't lay in bed and watch it without getting a sore neck or laying sideways across the bed. In terms of meeting facilities, they are good and the restaurant for lunch is fantastic but when there is a large conference on in the ballroom, it gets very cramped in the area outside the meeting rooms and noisy. Location wise it is an easy walk down to Circular Quay and the Opera House. There is a maccas across the road if you don't want to pay $33 for breakfast.

<Content>Not quite 5 star I stayed in a brilliant room on the 14th floor - it was large, well decorated, clean, very comfy bed, and unbelievably, a balcony!! It was great. So why wasn't it quite 5 star (as advertised on wotif.com)? Limited channel choice, in room breakfast was a bit on the stingy side, there was an out of date Vogue magazine to read, no map in the top drawer (as stated in the compendium) and my morning newspaper was nowhere to be seen.So, all in all, this is a lovely hotel in a handy location, but the attention to detail (those things that mark a great hotel from the rest) wasn't evident. I would stay here if you can can get a great price.

<Content>Average I had a mixed experience at the Amora recently. They wouldn't check me in, even though I was only 15 minutes early. My room was nicely decorated but the blinds had holes and frayed edges and the tv was very old and stashed in a cupboard.. Good selection of free channels though. Bathrooms were very nice too. Lift lobbies throughout the building were very nice, although the ground floor lobby and bar on the mezzanine were very dated. Service was slow, and often disinterested. All of this would have been fine but it was quite expensive, and I have had much better experiences elsewhere for less. It was ok, but I would definitely look elsewhere if I went back to Sydney.

<Content>Service is something that other hotels do! Poor check-in, unfriendly staff, didn't clean room well, 3 days without replenishing the mini-bar, complained and nothing improved. Poor location for getting a taxi, especially on a Friday night and don't expect much from the concierge or front desk staff who are too important and busy to concern themselves with their guests' welfare.Not worth the room rate. Starting to look a bit shabby in certain areas including the rooms.Room service food quality was quite poor. Breakfast elsewhere would have been a better option.I can't think of anything particularly positive to say about the hotel other than writing an awful review of it gives me some pleasure!

<Content>Beautiful hotel with nice amenties The Amora was a beautiful hotel - tastefully decorated, comfortable, with views of the city. They had lovely amenities - like a complimentary bottle of champagne on arrival (which I didn't know about) and a lovely breakfast and food/drink credit for the hotel restaurants - also, a nice gym/pool. The only drawback was some of the service in the restaurant was a little slow or confused, but I credit this with the Christmas week, skeleton staff. I thought the location and the value for money were outstanding!

<Content>Great Place to Stay! 1) Great Location: This is a great place to stay if you want to be right where all the action and transportation is! About 2 blocks from the train station, you can hop on and ride to many locations around town(and to and from the airport! Much cheaper than a taxi). Or just walk to Circular Quay and hop on a trolley to go to the zoo and other attractions across the Harbour. So convenient and we didn't have to rent a car. 2) Friendly  Professional Employees: First of all, they let us check into our room at 10:30 AM. Plus we got upgraded for free to a King size room with a great view. They are always willing to help with any questions or info you need- I wanted to use the internet for 15 minutes only and they didn't have cards for that short of time, so instead of making me pay extra for time I didn't need, he gave me a code for complimentary internet time. The concierge is right in the lobby and can book you to practically any tour in Sydney! 3) Decent room: Not exactly a US standard 5 star but.. Room was decent sized with big windows, no balcony. Bed was comfy and the bathroom had a great glass shower with plenty of hot water. There was also a deep old-fashioned tub that we didn't use. TV is old and in a strange location- behind doors next to the bed- but who needs TV when you're in SYDNEY! Also had mini-fridge and coffee/tea.4)Pool- didn't use so can't comment on that* One other tip- I would recommend avoiding GrayLine Tours. First they charged me 3 times for the tour because their website sucks- it took 3 emails and a phone call to get it taken care of. Plus they are very impersonal and the tour guides don't give much information- they're more like drivers. It was a vast contrast to our next tour with Activity Tours to the Blue Mtns. The tour guide was super friendly, gave us a TON of information (and jokes) we even learned some Aussie phrases. Check them out at activitytours.com.au

<Content>Definitely NOT a 5 star hotel The facilities, if they were OPEN, would have been good I'm sure! The Reception desk and welcome was basic, pleasant but definitely basic. Front door staff/valet parking staff were fine although Valet parking cost of $45 a rip-off. There are 2 bars in the hotel, the ground floor bar is only open Wed-Fri (ridiculous). There was a wedding reception in the hotel the night we stayed, which didn't allow anyone else but the wedding guests to patron the only other bar in the hotel (this is perhaps not the Hotel's fault, but alas perhaps if the ground floor bar was opened!!). Rooms very basic, but clean and tidy at least. We didn't enter the pool/spa area as it not only looked dirty and unclean, There seemed to be no air circulation or seating suitable for a short visit upon opening the Pool door for a very, very quick peek. Not good. Generally very poor facilities for a supposed 5 star hotel.

<Content>Reasonable Hotel My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights in December 2007 while hosting some overseas clients. In the past we typically take such clients to the Intercontinental or Marriot, both near Circular Quay, and on this occasion decided to try the Amora, being a 5 star rated hotel in a similar vicinity.Arriving at the hotel in our car, the Valet service was prompt, friendly and efficient. Check in was also quick, as we had to check in both for our room and for a conference room (Jamieson Club Boardroom) that we had booked for the afternoon, which was on the 31st floor.Room: The room was very comfortable, the bathroom including both a bath and a shower. The room was very clean, no signs of dust. As mentioned in previous reviews, the television was in a very strange location (in a cupboard at 90 degrees to the bed), and was and old CRT style unit.Conference Room: The conference room for 8 people (AU$550 for 6 hours) was a letdown. On the 31st floor, it had views of the adjacent buildings and a few glimpses of the water. The decor was dated, as was the furniture, which was looking tired. During the afternoon a number of flies were buzzing around the room, and I called reception to get them to send up some fly spray. I was advised that an engineer would be sent up immediately. 3 hours later when we left the boardroom for the day, nothing had been sent up. I complained to the reception staff who apoligised, I know this is not their fault however it represented a poor system for dealing with small issues at the hotel.Location: The location is good, but not 'prime' like many of the other hotels in the area. Several of the taxi drivers we used during the stay did not know where it was located, and we had to give directions. The walk to Circular Quay is short, but the hotel does not stand out as a 'landmark' like several of the others in the area.Dining: We dined out both nights, at Doyles at Circular Quay on Sat night and at Sydney Tower on Sunday night. We ordered lunch through room service to the board room during our meeting and it was prompt and delicious.Concierge: The booking at Doyles and a booking for a harbour cruise were handled efficiently through the concierge. On the last day I left my luggage with the concierge and it was also managed efficiently.Price: We paid AU$230 for the Saturday night and AU$205 for the Sunday night, so both nights represented a saving of between AU$60 and AU$100 compared to several nearby 5 star hotels. Valet parking at AU$45 per night was steep compared to others we have stayed at.Lobby / Lifts etc: The lobby was beautifully presented. To use the lifts, each person has to use their key to activate their floor. When the lifts are busy this is an unwanted imposition, as there is only one card reader in each lift, and they did not operate repeatably (with 10 people in the lift all trying 2-3 times to swipe their cards, this is a long process). We stayed in room 911, and when the lifts were busy often I had passed this floor before being able to access the reader and get it to work, which was an inconvenience. I have stayed in other hotels with similar systems but there have always been multiple readers and they have worked flawlessly.Overall impression: The hotel tries hard to be 5 star but seemed a bit rough around the edges compared to the Intercontinental and the Marriot, but then again comes at a lower price. For important overseas clients, I would book them in at these other hotels in future before the Amora. I felt it was good value, and if it was just my wife and I travelling, I would stay here again.

<Content>Top Location The Jamison is in a wonderful location and we were able to easily walk to shops, Rocks and Darling Harbour including at night to dinner! The room was lovely (corner suite) although we only had one wall of windows, whilst our other 2 friends that had corner suits had 2 walls with windows (not a major just unexpected). The bed.....Like other reviews it would have to be the most comfortable sleep we have had in a hotel without exception! Some hotel beds are SO hard, but this was just divine - no bad backs either!The bathroom is exceptional - large and roomy with a fabulous view from the large freestanding bath.We didnt have a great room service breakfast experience - things were cold, drinks and cutlery missing and having to eat one meal with a spoon as it didnt arrive in time! Seemed like communication was a bit of an issue although everything did arrive eventually!The concierge and desk staff were really friendly and helpful face to face but it didnt seem to matter what request we had i.e pre-ordering taxi's etc nothing was right! Not one taxi we pre-ordered arrived and our taxi order was given to other patrons and vice versa! A shame as it tainted an otherwise perfect stay.We would still however stay at the hotel as overall we had a great stay.

<Content>Xmas 2006 After reading through the various reviews on this website, we chose the Amora due to its location. 15min walk from Darling Harbour, less than 5mins to the Coathanger (bridge) and about 10mins to the Opera House. I wish I hadn't taken as many clothes, as the shopping around this area is also great.You're in the business district area, but the transport is excellent and the buses will take you directly to Bondi beach or to the suburbs.Back to the hotel, the views from the 30-somethingth floor were great, and you've got a huge window seal to sit on and admire the view. The bathroom is excellent, wetroom style shower and the bed was very comfortable and big!Staff polite, helpful and knowledgable, booked the Blue Mountain tour from within the hotel which is a must.We stayed for a week over xmas and were delighted with our choice of hotel.Tom  Natalie

<Content>Fabulous Hotel in the heart of Sydney My friend and I booked a deluxe room for 5 nights. Luckily, we received a free upgrade to a Club Jamison room. Staying in this room entitled us to a complimentary breakfast at the Club room and free wine and canapes in the evening. The hotel is in a great area - 5 minutes walk to Ciruclar Quay, The Rocks and Darling Harbour just a bit further. The food in the main restuarant, the Charr, was excellent - we had a wonderful sirloin steak for around $30 and top service from all the staff. The concierge staff have a nice touch of opening the main hotel doors for you arriving and leaving. The hotel has an indoor pool, jacuzzi and spa - heavenly after a day of walking around town and again lovely views over the city.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be near the shops and main tourist areas.

<Content>A real Gem! We have stayed at the Jamison for our anniversay the last 2 years. The location is fantastic as you have a 5 minute walk to The Rocks, as well as to Darling Harbour. We always stay in a 'club room' which places you on the top 2 floors, a King Bed, and provides you with access to the Club Room throughout the day. The Club Room offers free drinks (top quality wine  beer) and canapes (you can basically use these as a quality entree!!) for 2 hours each day, along with a complemetary continental breakfast each morning.I am a travel agent so i will give you guys a tip. If you are to book the club room, go to the site '[--]' 2 weeks prior and click on 'last minute' Sydney. This is when you can pick up the room for approx $220 a night (well worth it considering the evening Club Room!!).Hope you guys decide to give this hotel a shot, as it is a great place to base yourself to walk to the sites and experience that is Sydney.

<Content>Excellent service Thoroughly enjoyed my stay, would stay again and happily recommend. Excellent value for money when compared to other properties of the same star rating. Good location. Great rooms, soft sheets, and lovely bathroom with separate deep bathtub. Easy access from the train station around the corner.Concierge was extremely helpful, sorting out some luggage issues we were having with the airline. He was more helpful than the airline staff were. We were very thankful.We sent some laundry to the hotel valet, and unfortunately the clothing was lost. The management of the hotel were extremely apologetic, offered a full explanation of what happened, and re-imbursed us for the full replacement cost of the items without arguement. While it was unfortunate that this happened, we could not fault their response to the problem.When you travel, sometimes things go wrong -- its the response to the problems that really counts.

<Content>Staff were well mannered Bad points:No viewNot enough staff in the parking area-there were occasion where we parked our car and had to wait for the staff to turn up.Not a good locationGood pointsStaff were polite-opens the door for you everytime you go out.Convenient valvet parking-can enter and exit a lot of time.Had a iron, iron board and a dryer in the room which means less packing.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel, stunning views We stayed at the Amora in February 2007 for 2 nights, fabulous stay. We arrived and our room wasnt ready so we wandered around the city and saw some sights, left our luggage with the porter. We returned a few hours later, checked in and went to our hotel room on the 34th floor. Our luggage was there waiting for us. Unbelievable room. Very spacious and stylish, huge comfy bed and wonderful city views. The bathroom was wonderful. Double shower, marble floors also deep bath tub also with views, 34 floors up, bit of a strange experience! We headed staright for the Angsa Spa to chill out and cool down in the pool. Very quiet while we were in there. We went into the steam room and there was a vent hanging off which could have caused an injury, also the pol area was quite dirty, only complaint of the whole stay. We stayed in a Jamison Club room, this gave us access to the Jamison club on an evening which gave you free drinks and canapes, a wonderful way to start the evening in this amazing city. Also included with the room is free breakfast in the Jamison Club. I have to say this is the best breakfast I have ever had, huge array of different things to try, nothing was a problem for the staff. I really filled up on the breaksfast and gave us a good start to our busy day. Views from the Jamison Club were amazing too. We actually saw the QE2 and Queen Mary 2 come into the harbour from out breakfast table! Overall I would say this is probably one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in holiday and I am extremely fussy and do like my luxuries! Ideally placed for the Harbour and George Street from shopping and bus stops. Would highly recommend this hotel, we used Asia Rooms to book and it cost about 拢90 per night. Fantstci value, would deifnately stay here again

<Content>Pretty Well Flawless Hotel Stayed for 2 nights in corner suite. Arrived at 9 am and room was available by 11 am, checkin was swift and painless. Room was extremely comfortable, clean, and well prepared. Ate in the Char Restaurant that evening, almost empty but the food and service was excellent - during the next 36 hours used the hotel as a base for touring Sydney and for the price it was exceptional value and superb location, although the view from rooms is not the best (if this worries you pay an extra $100+ per night). Only real negative was the barman in the hotel bar, somewhat brusque and didnt have a clue about preparing a decent gin and tomic with ice and lemon! Rest of staff were as good as ever, which is why I will be returning to this hotel at least once per month on business and holiday trips to Sydney - it is exceptional value for my company's money!

<Content>Great Room - Bad Breakfast  Having first stayed at the Amora in June, we decided to stay again in August. While during our second stay we were welcomed back with a sensational room, however, this time around no carparking avaialbe in the hotel (had booked a package with car parking). We had to walk around the corner to the car park (in the rain!), staff weren't overally helpful regarding this.Also, the second car park took us over 20 minutes to get out, by time they find your car you then drive 1/2 way underway Sydney to exit the park. Again not fun early in the morning when you are tyring to get somewhere! Breakfast was great first time, but second stay not sure if we were up too early, but everything seemed to be cold and not fresh, which you think it would be at 7.00am.Room - great, excellentBeds - fantasticCarpark - pathetic - shoudn't offer as part of packages if they don't have them.Breakfast - average

<Content>An okay hotel..... My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel earlier this year and if I were to spend another $200 for a hotel stay, it would not be here.Our welcome at reception.....well lets just say that we could have received a warmer response from a chicken sandwich.The bathroom was beautiful and clean. The view was lacking. We could see a small strip sydney harbour and the opera house, with our main view being a big office block next to us.The restaurant downstairs was good- nice food at a decent price. The breakfast was the same, however, I suggest if you want it, you should include it in your stay-it makes it much easier. The location is convienent- near the Rocks and the harbour. (A must go place to eat is Pancakes on the Rocks- yum!).Despite this, there are many other hotels located nearby that I would go to next time, such as the Shangri-La or Four Seasons, which are much closer to the main tourist attractions and there would be no troubles in finding your way back to the hotel (which we experienced).

<Content>Don't believe what you are told About a month ago I booked two Jamison Club rooms so that my my wife would have somewhere pleasant to stay in Sydney to celebrate her 40th birthday with her sisters. I booked 2 x twin rooms (that is, two double beds in each room). Two days before the check-in date, a friendly member of the hotel staff called me to confirm my reservation of TWO JAMISON CLUB TWIN ROOMS. Also, having previously read some posts on tripadvisor regarding difficulties in obtaining parking at the hotel, I called the hotel the day before check-in to find out whether there would be any problem obtaining valet parking. I was told It won't be a problem at all because the hotel will be just about empty. Upon arriving at the hotel, two of the sisters that drove to the hotel were advised that valet parking was not available and that they would have to drive a block away to get parking. In addition, upon check-in, my wife was told that only one twin room was available and that the other would have to be a Deluxe King room (1 x king bed). These two significant failings are unacceptable, particularly because this hotel claims to be 5-star. Apart from these problems, the rooms were fine and represent good value.

<Content>Plesantly Surprised Well located in the middle of all things Sydney, the hotel is slightly hidden away but the service from the moment the door is opened for you is high quality. The foyer is well furnished and modern.The rooms are excellent. Large bathrooms with baths big enough to actually use, high quality fixtures and good shower head. The bed is extremely comfortable, the room has nice built in furniture and quite is quite spacious. Breakfast was great, large selection, and high quality.I would recommend this hotel for either a business stay or a short stay in Sydney city.

<Content>Great Hotel Amora Jamison Hotel 9 to 13 MarchExcellent service which it would be hard to fault. A nice spacious room with great view over the city. Ideally situated in the small business area and within walking distance of the shops and QVB and the Rocks, harbour, bridge and Opera House. Nice cocktail bar and two good restaurants. Many fine restaurants close by; try 1 Albert Street and Doyles on the Quay both are five minutes walk away. Clean tidy and a staff of well trained and motivated smiling and helpful people. Everything worked and everything we wanted was there - ironing board to Movies on Demand. If visiting would I stay here again - a very certain, yes!

<Content>Best sleep ever! We had a great time at this hotel. Staff were friendly and ok, although forgot to bring one of our bags up to the room, and the room was spacious and clean.The most fantastic plus was the scrumptious bed and pillows that gave us the best sleep ever. The breakfast in the Gallery restaurant was just ok, nothing to rave about and as breakfast was included in our package we felt we had to eat there. I would choose to stay here again but have breakfast elsewhere.Great location also but i agree with other reviews, the view is masked even on the tenth floor.

<Content>Dissapointing We arrived to find their carpark full and no valet service available and was told to park the car in a carpark under another hotel. This inconvenience was soon forgotten when we got to our Deluxe room we booked through [----]. The room was clean spacious and very large with a beautiful bathroom with a deep hot tub, we even had our own little balcony. As per other reviews, you are surrounded by buildingsbut at least we had glimpses of the approaches to the Harbour Bridge.The hot Buffet breakfast was excellent and the staff were very friendly. The pool was OK and the gym reasonably well appointed. I suppose the only letdown was when I had to pickup the car. Being from out of town and booked in for a knee op I had to walk for about 2kms in old railway tunnels which form the Wynyard Carpark to pick up my car then it took me half a our more to finally get back to my wife to pick her up in the Amora foyer. Not happy. I saw most people arrive at the hotel in cabs so how can their carpark be full??Sadly we won't be going back and left quite stressed. Sad because its actually one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in in Sydney with exception of the Mecure.

<Content>Great location, shame about the reception My wife and I stayed in the Amora for 5 nights during our extended Australian vacation. The plus points were its location, being only 5 minutes walk from Circular Quay and the main shopping centres, being adjacent to Winyard Station, thereby providing easy access to the airport and that it was clean and well furnished. However it does not have any views of the Opera House or Harbour Bridge, being a few blocks back behind equally tall buildings. However if you are on the higher floors you do get other views of the waterfront.We stayed in a Club Room which was clean, tidy and well-furnished. We also had use of the Club Lounge, which included continental breakfast and complimentary canap茅s and drinks in the early evening. If you intend eating breakfast and being around for the early evening snacks, then in our view the additional cost is well worth it. We cannot agree about the comments from a previous contributor about the Club staff. All the staff we met in the Club Lounge were polite, helpful but discrete. They were happy to converse with the customers, but only if you wanted to talk with them. Otherwise in our view they just went about there business. However we did chat to them at some length, which proved to be invaluable through them providing help and advice which meant we got the maximum benefit out of our stay in Sydney.The major criticism I have with the hotel was the attitude of the receptionist on our arrival. We had travelled on the overnight train from Melbourne, arriving at the hotel at around 8:30 a.m. We did not expect our room to be ready so early, but did expect on the basis that we would be spending in excess of AS$1600 with the hotel, that we would be able to make use of the Club Room facilities, including breakfast, before hitting Sydney. However the receptionist was adamant that whilst we could go to the Club Room, we would have to pay extra for breakfast. He could offer no other alternative. Consequently we simply left our luggage with the Concierge and eat outside of the hotel. On the basis that initial impressions matter most, the hotel started off very poorly, particularly when compared with the attitude shown to us by our previous hotel. In our view, Club guests should have a separate check-in, either at reception or in the lounge itself and your use of the facilities should commence from the moment you arrive, irrespective of when during the day that actually occurs. In summary a perfectly adequate hotel, well situated to the local facilities, only let down for us by a discourteous receptionist.

<Content>Not used to such luxury Perhaps I am easy to please, but I had an excellent stay at this hotel. We were a honeymoon couple, and so got to our room to find a bottle of champagne complete with choccies. I was in heaven. We sat on lovely chairs with foot rests and just looked out over sydney in bliss. The bathroom was huge and amazing, the bed was massive. The staff were polite and not at all snotty. We booked via expedia and got a really good deal which included access to the junior club lounge which meant free champers and nibbles all night. The only down side was having to converse with the club host who kept trying to tell us her problems/how great she was etc etc. The spa was good although the pool was a little cold. I really don't see how anyone could knock this hotel!

<Content>Ditto to review of 16 feb 07 We have just read review by ricardohk on 16 feb 07. and could not have put it better ourselves. Stayed in Shangri la on our previous visit to Sydney, this hotel compares favourably for alot less money. You only really miss the view. Would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location, perfect for tourists Very pleased with our stay here. We were on a 4 days first time visit to Sydney and chose the hotel for its location. This worked out very well for a number of different reasons. First, it's only 20mins from the airport in a taxi (make sure you ask to go through the toll tunnel) at a cost of A$40. Second, its less than a 5min walk to the circular quay piers from where you can take ferries to places like Manly beach. Also, its a 5min walk to the central shopping area of Pitt street and George street. Also, if you are on a business trip, its very close to the central business district.The hotel room itself is spacious and the bathroom is very large. No real view from our room, but this didn't bother us as we were out and about for most of our visit.Apparently, it is possible to pay for an upgrade which includes a great breakfast and a 2hr free drinks period in the early evening. Sounds a bit dangerous to me!

<Content>Fantastic - Highly Recommended! We were a little worried about staying at the Amora because of a few reviews on this site, but the price was just so good, we went ahead anyway - and I'm so glad we did!We stayed fo 2 nights over the Australia Day long weekend, and found the location to be perfect. It's a quick walk down to The Rocks and also to Circular Quay. We did have to wait 1/2 and hour for our room because we checked in early. No worries there. Also when booking, I requested a room as far up as possible because I'm a light sleeper. We were on the 29th floor which was perfect! We even had a little bit of a view over to the harbour.Our room was spotlessly clean, and the bed was super soft. Just lovely to spend a long weekend in! The best bit about the room though was the bathroom. I wanted to take the big, deep bath home with me. It also had a huge separate shower too which was nice.Breakfast was your usual hotel fare with the exception of the orange juice. The have a big machine there that freshly squeezes juice as required - delicious!All in all, I think the Amora is where we will be staying from now on. The only thing that I didn't like about it as much as some other hotels we've staying in before in Sydney is that because it's down in the financial district, there isn't an abundance of great restaurants at your doorstep. That being said, they are still only a 5 minute walk or cab ride away.

<Content>get your own taxi stayed 31/12/06 until 3/1/07.never again will we go near this hotel.upon arriving in sydney at 8am we freshened up in a freinds room at The Blue , after travelling fron SF over night. What a difference with service they couldn't do enough for you at the Blue , where, as after arriving at The Amora at 2.30pm to check in , there was no bellboy we were told to ask the concierge for advice.we left the bags with him and went to our room, ordered room service, ate room service waited a further 10 mins and then eventually had to ring down and ask where our bags were.It took in total 65 mins for our bags to be delivered to our rooms.On new years day our friend visited and wanted to get a taxi back to her hotel. We asked the bellboy to book one. After 15 mins one hadn't arrived so asked about it, to be told it had been doubled booked so they'd send the bellboy out into the street to get one.10 mins later he came back empty handed. So went to the concierge ,Nathan, to ask about what was happening, only to be told we should get our own taxi and turn his back on us. So I had to get the taxi myself which took only 4 mins.We would highly recommend The Shangri-La (which we stayed in, later on in Jan) or The Blue.

<Content>Ok for what it is... We decided to stay in the city after a function in December and, not having heard of it, decided to try the Amora out on an introductory package -- that made it much cheaper than many of the others. We thought it would be fine to stay there if you were on business -- the location is good and the beds very comfortable. Otherwise, it has no real view, nothing particularly interesting about it and the service was adequate rather than attentive.Like another reviewer we did find it strange that all of the restaurants and bars were closed except one, particularly when there was still something in the room saying how great they all were. (Although the food manager we met was excellent and very welcoming!). So, there was nothing wrong with the experience but if I was a tourist, or looking for a romantic weekend, I think that there are nearby hotels with more excitement. I guess it depends what you're looking for and what price comparisons you find.

<Content>Nice hotel, bad service I'm no expert, but I would like to think I know something about good service. On our way to the hotel, we were called by the hotel to check if we really wanted 2 rooms... We did book 2, for 4 adults. I don't know if it was because we booked them late notice on such a cheap rate, or if the duty manager was having a bad night. They tried saying that we had only booked for one night, our passes were locked and wouldn't let us up to the rooms. During the 2 nights we stayed there, we were told on more than one occasion that You can't stay longer than what you've booked, we're fully booked. If we did extend out stay in Sydney, we definitely wouldn't stay there any longer!! They tried accusing us of taking food from the mini bar, when it wasn't refilled before we went in there... OK, so the room was nice, I would like to take the bed home!! We had a view of an office building  a park... Overall, the location is great, 5-10 minutes walk to Circular Quay  monorail station, great shopping on George Street. Facilities were pretty good, pool, a bit of gym equipment, sauna... I probably wouldn't go there again though, only because of the service because to me that is a major factor in whether I enjoy my stay or not.

<Content>OK, not 4 or 5 star, though Like the Jan. 1st review of the Jamison, my husband and I stayed at this hotel over NYE. It was not our first choice, but since it was NYE, other hotels required either a 6 night minimum or were just insanely expensive for the event. All right, sure the hotel has a pretty convenient location, but it is no 4 or 5 star hotel and should not advertise as such. I'd say it's a strong 3 1/2 star, but that's about as generous as I'm willing to be. Since we paid 5 star rates for NYE, I felt we should have experienced at least a 4 star hotel. We stayed on one of the Club Floors and had access to the club lounge, which did offer a pretty good continental breakfast and evening cocktails. I would recommend staying on the Club Floors if you choose this hotel. Buster at the concierge desk also did a great job for us with our NYE reservations. However, like other reviews have mentioned, the furnishings and linens were a little worn, and there's no dedicated bellman outside. Also disappointing was that the supposedly cool bar and restaurant were closed during our 3 day stay, which was pretty inconvenient on new year's day when most of the city was closed down. I'd say that if you can get a good deal on this hotel, it's probably just fine. Otherwise, the Four Seasons or the Shangrila are a better bet.

<Content>Excellent Hotel - Would recommend to all Stayed here for 10 nights for our honeymoon in December 2006. When we arrived at the hotel we had been travelling for 42 hours from the UK (our flight had been delayed 11 hours in Dubai)So we were so jet lagged. We were greeted by a very friendly lady at the reception who booked us in very quickly!! We were on the 33rd floor (1 floor from the top)  the view was amazing. The bed was so comfortable  could have taken it home with me if i could have got it in my suitcase. The Concierge were so helpful  very friendly indeed. They knew so much about the city, the best tours  the best places to eat etc. The pool was small but not busy at all  went in the jucuzzi every day!! The hotel location is also excellent. Less than a five minute walk from the harbour bridge, opera house the rocks. Only 10-15 minutes walk from Darling Harbour. Hotel is on Jamison Street wjich is off George Street - which is the main shopping area  there are many take aways within a few minutes walking distance. The underground station is just 2 mins walk from the hotel also. We had a Jamison Club room which gave us access to Jamison Club Facilities (breakfast, evening canapies 5pm-7pm, internet access etc) at only which i would highly recommend. I can go on about how amazing this hotel is but you if you visit Sydney this is a MUST stay hotel.

<Content>Pretty Average, NOT five star We arrived in Sydney on short notice and being NYE most hotels were full. So the Amora, Jamison was not the first choice. But being five star and in the CBD, I thought it will do.Apon arriving I knew immeadiatekly it wasn't what you expect.No bell boy service. So carry your own bags to the room. When I asked about that the front desk said, oh you can go over there with your bags and see if they will help?!?!My wife and I have been traveling for over a month and have a lot of luggage, not just over night bags. So we were off to a bad start straight away.No one to take you to your room either - then the rooms were on the smaller side. Not very clean. Plenty of scuff marks and stains on the carpet.Dusty too.The television is small and in the wardrobe to the right of the bed, making it awkward to watch.Also the bathroom was ordinary and the towels small and light and ragged, as if they've been round the system for a few years. Arrrghhhh.This is just a few things I have mentioned. It's just not what you expect from a five star hotel.Perhaps four star hotel who isn't trying very hard, it might be that. But the rates for NYE and Jan 1st were out of this world...We will not be back.

<Content>A Good Place to Stay in Sydney I was a little leery after seeing some other reviews, but our experience at the Amora Sydney was quite positive. The location is perfect for easy access to Circular Quay, the Opera House, and the ferries. Front desk personnel were friendly and helpful, and our room was comfortable and clean. Prices at the hotel restaurants were very high, but we found many acceptable alternatives within walking distance of the hotel.I would not hestitate to stay here again and would recommend the Amora to anyone looking to stay in Sydney's central business district.

<Content>Good Hotel We stayed in the Jamison for 8 nights over the week the hotel changed from Rydges to Amora. The location is excellent, just 5 mins to Circular Quay/The Rocks and 10 mins to Darling Harbour. We found the staff to be very helpful, particularly the concierge team. Our standard room was very spacious and the bathroom was superb. If we were being uber-critical the tele was in a silly position but you don't go to Sydney to watch the tv.The only gripe is that the lifts have that annoying security system where you have to swipe your room card to access your floor and it doesn't work very well. It can be frustrating.Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Good hotel, great location I think the bad reviews are due to Rydges neglecting this hotel before they sold it to Amore. Rydges were a disgrace, do not use them - I had a confirmed booking and they failed to pass it on. I could have arrived in Australia and not had a room. Thankfully Amora honoured the reservation.This hotel is in an excellent location - you can walk to the Rocks, Circular Quay, the Opera House, the Aquarium, Darling Harbour etc.Our room was good with a great bathroom. Don't bother with a balcony as they overlook a roof, there is no view and no chairs on it.Concierge and door staff are good. They give you a free bottle of water as you leave in the morning which is a nice touch..Breakfast is good but a bit pricy at AUD 33. Go to Carnegies next door and get breakfast and coffee for AUD 12.One snag - the room keys are rubbish. We had to change our 4 times in 4 days. It's a pain as you then can't use the lift or get in your room.Overall though I recommend the Amora Jamison.

<Content>Good Tourist Location, pleasant hotel We stayed five nights at the amora as part of our holiday. The location was great and approx 5 minutes walk to most of the tourist attractions inc Circle Quays. It has the added bonus of being 20 mtrs from George Street from where you can hop on any bus including the tourist sightseeing bus to get around the city. We were allocated a room on the 5th floor which was adequate in size, modern and clean. There was however a shortage of storage space including drawers for emptying our suitcases into. Room service was lapse at times and we would find ourselves returning to the room at 4-30pm to find the room still had not been made up. An ice bucket from our room layout side the door for collection for two days prior to it being collected. Staff especially the concierge and door staff were helpful and pleasant. The main problem we experienced was from the building working from the ajacent building.Each morning we would be woken at 7am to the sound of a pneumatic drill lifting the paving on the ajacent open foyer area. This problem was exasperated by being on a low floor. Overall a good hotel in a good location.

<Content>Terrrible reception staff, good location. uk trip advisor member. We spent 5 nights here at the beginning of Nov. Arrived at 9am but understandably the room was not ready yet, took a walk then came back and waited in lobby area for room. Staff on reception said they would call us when it was ready. After waiting for over an hour I asked again - the room had been ready for over half an hour and we had been left sat in the lobby. The room itself (a deluxe on the 19th floor) was excellent. Was very impressed with size, decor, facilities etc. Also the pool, jacuzzi facilities etc were excellent. Again though the staff lower my opinion of this hotel; on more than 2 or 3 occasssions I could get no answer from reception, even though they had posted a note asking me to contact them to arrange to refill the mini bar - this was never done. We ordered breakfast in bed which arrived on time and looked great but was stone cold. Again when I tried to phone somebody about this - no answer. I couldn't even get the huge trolley it came on removed from our room (I got through on the phone later in the afternoon and told them I had left it in the corridor). It remained there for 24hrs. At check out I informed the staff that I had tried lots but had not been able to get the mini bar refilled and had used approx $45. They told me it didn't matter and I wouldn't be charged. Because of this I didn't complain about the breakfast (which cost approx $75). I paid for my phone calls (I had a faulty phone or something went wrong disconnecting a call at reception so lost 40mins on an international phone card), and left. When I got back to the uk I had been charged the $45 dollars too! I must say that not all staff were poor; the guys who open the doors, collect and deliver luggage were pleasant, helpful and a credit to the hotel. There doesn't seem to be any conatct details on the web page and I don't really want to be phoning australia to complain about my problems, so will just have to put this one down to experience. This hotel is really nice and could be one of the best in sydney, but the customer service side of things needs to improve greatly.

<Content>Enjoyed this hotel - quite contemporary! While travelling here on business, I decided to take a good weekend rate for a corner king room. The hotel is modern and has a very contemporary feel. Checking in was good, no issues or delay. I was assigned a corner room on the 25th floor which had a nice view of downtown. Reading the prior reviews, I was ready to see lots of dust. Somehow, this room did not have that issue. The marble bathroom with seperate tub and shower was a nice touch. The corner room had nice room to spread out. The only improvement here would be to equip the room with a tv that's larger than 20 inches. Then again, my purpose for coming is not to look at tv all day, but rather to take advantage of the hotel's central location. The gym on the 3rd level is average. I have scene better elsewhere, plus no ellliptical exercise machine. I'd stay here again in the future.

<Content>A long way to go Booked an Executive Club king room for $270 per night. For this, you get a room on a high floor and access to the club lounge with drinks and canapes from 5:30pm to 7:30pm and continental breakfast. The room had great views (32nd floor), and the view from the bath was a highlight. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've had in a top end hotel, and although the room was small, it was reasonably well apointed. However, there was a problem with cleanliness. There were smudges on the wardrobe and the room was dusty (including the bathroom - not very nice to think that some of the bathroom surfaces hadn't been cleaned in a while).The club lounge was ok, although extremely lacking in atmosphere, even for a hotel lounge. Canapes included a good spread of sushi, dips, cheeses, quiches/dumplings etc. Breakfast was good most days, with a comprehensive range of continental breakfast items, but on Sunday (when the hotel was busy) it was a bit of a disaster - nothing was being refilled so there was hardly anything to eat (this is a good hour and a half before breakfast ended), dish clearing was happening very slowly and there were no tea/coffee cups etc. The club lounge, located away from the rest of the catering facilities, looked like it was basically understaffed at breakfast. The pool, spa, sauna and steam room were nice (not as nice as some others in a similar class in Syndey), but again the cleanliness was iffy. The area looked a little neglected.The staff were generally disinterested, though not rude, and it seemed to take hours to get the room cleaned (we ended up only getting service 2 out of 4 days, even though we left the room for hours from late morning to mid-afternoon every day). My basic impression is that this hotel is understaffed, and also that many staff members are inexperienced - there should NEVER be smudges or dust in a 5 star hotel room. Having stayed in other hotels in the Sydney CBD for a similar price, I would choose those over the Jamison, although it does have potential - especially given the great views from the upper floors.

<Content>Very good service and location Enjoyed it very much. It is now the Amora but being my first visit I cannot compare to past owners, Rydges. It lived up to expectations and being a business traveler, it was quite perfect in location as I choose to take the train often to see customers. As the station is virtually under this building how could I complain. Stayed total of 5 nights under 2 separate stays as I went to Adelaide. I left my large suitcase here and took train to airport with small bag. Morning train rides take me to the food court/cafes that encircle this building and are found in the station tunnel. This means I have not eaten breakfast in the hotel although it is pricey by ckg the room service menu. So I saved a lot by getting a 'brekkie' in the food court. Location: seems just perfectly situated between Circ Quay, Darling Harbour and Rocks; just excellent. 8th floor room 818, has partial park view of area leading to Harbor bridge, otherwise I got the building across the way. Ask for view of Wynyard park, very pleasant. Concierge: I used them a lot for directions and they are quite friendly and young so it gives a nice youthful feel to the place. Stylish: yes, enjoyed the room decor and art decoish, BW tiled bath. Lobby is spacious enough without being overwhelmed; waiting area by windows and sidewalk with newspapers, comfy chairs, in sunken floor. Nice touch. Apples also avail in bowl by reception. Room: on the small side but I got a single on the short side of the building; floor map shows most other rooms are larger/longer than mine. Not a big deal. Internet is costly= $25 /day or $50 per week. Bed is most important and a good shower and they scored very well. Amenities are good quality.Summary: for me it was very good and good value as I got travel industry rate. I liked it a lot although I am not raving since I have come from 2 weeks around Asia where service is in the blood and 4-5 star hotels are truly exceptional. Would def stay again but I usually like to try different things; it is just me. I went to The Four Seasons and paid double of this one last Feb. and it is not twice as good.

<Content>NOT a fan of this Hotel This hotel was VERY dissapointing. Firstly we were not informed of the hotel's change of name and spent 15 minutes trying to locate it! The room itself (a large corner room) was spacious, but filthy. Stains on the chairs, duvet cover and floor, dust on the telephone and bedside tables. The only redeeming factor was the bathroom which was superb with a big deep bath. None of our power points worked and we were told to flick the trip switch to activate the room's electricity. Also tv and alarm clock were of a very poor standard for what promises to be a luxery hotel. The bed was not made very well - twisted sheets - what looked like a rushed job. Our bags took forever to arrive and the stink of stale smoke (even though a non-smoking room was requested) was disgusting. For the cost of the room (a reduced internet rate of $245) this hotel was definitely NOT worth it. I am just glad we spent minimal time in this horrid room - only staying 1 night, opting for somewhere else the following night. I would NEVER reccommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Neat, comfortable and good value This hotel is a city stop-over pad. The decor is modern and rooms are well-maintained with comfortable bed and excellent bathroom, albeit the room was a little small. The pool was not large but reasonable for a hotel in the CBD. It was pretty good value relative to other hotels nearby.

<Content>Good location, staff let it down We had 5 nights at this hotel. We arrived really early in the morning from London and not surprisingly no rooms were available at that time. The staff were pretty unhelpful, but we did get a shower in the swimming pool changing rooms. When we eventually returned to the hotel at 5pm we were given a smoking room despite having booked a non-smoking room weeks before. This in unnacceptable in my view, how can none be available when booked so far in advance? We had to wait an hour to have the bags brought to the room and it took a reminder phone call at that. The room itself was on the top floor and well appointed with nice views. The bathroom was good too. The gym was a disgrace and the equipment had not been maintained or cleaned in weeks. It was filthy and not a good recommendation. On the plus side, the location was excellent and within walking distance of everywhere in the city. Rydges was due to be taken over by another hotel group at the beginning of November. I hope they do better

<Content>Fantastic! This is a fantastic hotel which is in one of the best locations in sydney, just off george street, literally! The service is great and you get treated really well. The food in the restaurant is lovely and quite reasonable considering the quality and service. The room is a little small, but its very comfortable and luxurious. The only drewback is that when you open the blind, you are looking at office workers in the next building! We arrived after a 6 hour flight and got there at 10am, and there was no questions or problems about cheking in early, and when we checked out we asked for last check out at 1pm, again there was no problems or no extra charges. This hotel is known as being one of the best in sydney, and we would only stay here again in the future due to the location (10 minutes to opera house) and service.

<Content>Fab location-hotel just ok Stayed here for 3 nights after getting an excellent deal on expedia.Stay 3 nights pay for 2 so we opted for the Jamison Club Suite.Check in staff were very good, offering us maps and advice on getting around Sydney. Concierge were also helpful with directions etc....Yes, the location is fantastic-especially for first timers like ourselves to Sydney.BUT.....i fail to see what is SO special about this hotel. I am not ultra picky but it struck me as just being 'ok'. I have fortunately stayed in a variety of hotels and this is definately a standard 4 star establishment. Our room did have great views (except the bedroom which looked straight into offices), the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was a decent size.However the room was dusty (i promise I am not being picky! the dust was plain to see) I just dont think it has been used for a while! Room service was prompt but the food utterly vile-I could not even touch the potato and spinach cakes which arrived the size of large sausages, dripping in grease and smelling distinctly of fish-very strange......I hate to complain as this hotel serves it's purpose as a nice hotel in a great location but please dont arrive like me with high expections-you will be disappointed when it fails to deliver anything 'special'.I just dont think this hotel warrants an 'excellent' rating. Location maybe but thats all.To finish on a positive note we loved Sydney. The BridgeClimb was worth every penny, The Rocks had some fab galleries and the Botanical Gardens are a must!I

<Content>Fabulous!!! We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights from 10th August. Booked the hotel on the basis of reviews that we had read on this site and delighted to say that we were not disappointed. We arrived about 8pm after a flight from Hong Kong and the reception staff arranged for our luggage to go straight to the room whilst we went straight to the bar for an extremely welcome complimentary glass of champagne (and a smoke!). Sorted! we didn't get to the room till 1am but what a great start to our stay! We thought the room was perfectly appointed and spotless. The TV wasn't great but hey, we don't go on holiday to watch TV. The bathroom was fantastic. Only had one meal at the hotel - the seafood buffet on the Saturday night - excellent  the desserts must have been too 'cos my partner ate NINE!!!! The cafe next door was ideal for breakfast tho' unfortunately isn't open on the weekends but loads of other eateries in the area. Location of hotel ideal - walking distance everywhere and that includes Paddy's Market, Botanical Gardens and Darling Harbour etc. The hotel and area had everything we needed (didn't have time to use the hotel pool so can't comment on that), the staff were the most helpful and the friendliest we have encountered so far. In particular, the bar staff - Ngar, Laura  Laura who enlivened our nightcaps no end, so much so that we ran up quite a bar bill!!!! but it was worth it! We have already decided that we will always stay there whenever we are in Sydney which at the mo seems to be every 2 years! Can't wait!

<Content>Fantastic This hotel was the best hotel ever stayed in. We upgraded to Club deluxe room which are on top 3 floors. This upgrade was worth every penny, giving you best rooms, e.g. large bathroom with bath overlooking city, playstation, but best of all you get access to exclusive club lounge on 31st floor getting complimentary drinks ..champagne if you want + canopies(e.g.sushi, chicken skewers) 5:30-7:30 every night. You can use the lounge for breakfast also. Request corner room to give dual aspects of city. Concierge couldn't do enough. Sydney itself was fantastic, disagree with previous reviewer who said London by the sea. Sydney is much better, friendly, laid back  nobody is out to stuff you. I would recommend doing bridge climb 拢70, the aquarium, ferry to Manly (walk through town to Manly beach) turn right down to Shelly beach. Eat Barramundi takeaway from Manly fish market  eat on beach. In the rocks try G'day cafe for lunch  Zia Pina dinner for good food well priced. Doyles for special dinner. Rocks market sat/sun. Paddys market for very cheap clothes....chinese imports. Opera house tour was good. Hope this helps.

<Content>Very enjoyable stay. Highly recommended. We have just returned from a three week stay in Australia and spent the first week in Sydney staying at the Rydges Jamison. We chose this hotel partly because of the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor and partly because of the impressive hotel website. We used the hotel's own website to make the reservation - using a combination of a weekend rate and a weekday rate for the best deal. We booked a room with a balcony but unfortunely it did not have much of a view. It was handy to be able to open the doors for fresh air rather than use the air conditioning. The hotel is situated in the business district of Sydney and is only five minutes walk from Circular Quay where we were able to pick up ferries and bus tours. The staff were all very friendly and helpful - we used the concierge service to book a couple of tours. The rooms spacious and clean. Dined at the hotel restaurants on two separate evenings and used the dining room for the buffet breakfast at the weekend. No complaints. Plenty of excellent restaurants locally and on a week day a fabulous food court just next to the hotel served a great selection of foods/fruits and drinks for breakfast for under AU$10 for two people. All in all an excellent stay.

<Content>Great hotel!! Rydges was a great place to stay in Sydney! It is close to everything and everyone was very helpful. They set up all of our excursions and gave us helpful advice on what to do. It is only a 5 minute walk to the Quay. I stayed there alone for one night before my husband arrived and I felt completely safe walking around late at night. I would stay there again if I ever have the chance to return.

<Content>Great hotel Great location in the heart of sydney close to Circular Quay. Our room was big and has a great bathroom - absolutely spotless. Ate in the bar one night and food was good if a bit expensive but I guess you expect that in Sydney!!Friendly and helpful staff who booked restaurant tables for us etc. and checked us in early morning after a long flight!!!Small Gym but decent pool.Great hotel for the price.

<Content>Great hotel Great location...only about a 10 minute walk from the Quay. Nice rooms, comfortable beds, and very friendly staff. The views aren't that great, but then again, how much time do you actually spend in the room? A few words of advice. Skip the breakfast buffet. It's overpriced and is not that great. You'd be better off going out on the town and finding breakfast at a cafe or restaurant. Also..the seafood buffet that they have on Saturday nights is very good. A little expensive, but it is a good alternative if you do not feel like going out on the town for dinner.

<Content>A Fabulous Place to Stay! My wife and I just returned from a three-week vacation down under and this is where we stayed for three nights in Sydney. I will try to be brief, but it is difficult sometimes.Location is excellent. There are hotels closer to the Quay, the Rocks, the Opera House, etc., but none that I found in this price range. It was literally a 5-minute (very safe) walk to the Quay, the bridge, another 5 minutes from there to the Opera House. Also, you are one-half block from the train station (underground, no noise) that you can ride to/from the airport for A$13 one way.Staff was very young, very competent, very friendly, and very helpful. Enough said.Room was great. One comfy king-size bed, two chairs, a business desk, a very cool wall unit that contained your closets, TV, mini-bar, etc. Bathroom was HUGE with giant tub and separate glass-enclosed shower. The view from the balcony was good, not great, but that is simply because the buildings around them are so huge, it doesn't matter what floor you are on; my guess is that you are not going to have too many rooms in this location with stunning views of the bridge, Opera House, or whatever. As with most tourists, this isn't a huge deal to us as we used this hotel as a place to sleep in between our many touring activities. Also, we never heard another soul in other rooms the entire time we were there. Very peaceful!Overall, value was superb. We paid A$195 per night for three nights. I would stay in this hotel again in a heartbeat. Feel free to write me if you have any questions at all. TripAdvisor was very helpful for me in selecting hotels for this trip and I would like to help others with their decision making.

<Content>Yep, great hotel in an overrated city Stayed here as part of our world trip and whilst some time ago just wanted to add my thoughts. The room and bathroom were of a high standard and the service was of high quality throughout. Unknown to ourselves, some friends had arranged a suprise bottle of champagne and some other gifts with the hotel staff prior to our arrival and no-one let on, a great acting job by the bellboy who told us later he had been the one to set up the whole thing. Very nice suprise on entering the room and all just added to the friendly feeling we got from the hotel staff.The restaurant was very nice and had a stunning waterfall feature. Breakfast was enjoyed there throughout our 9 day stay.Couldn't fault the hotel, one of the best we stayed in thoughout our world tour. Have to say though that Sydney was a big disappointment, could have seen it in 3 or 4 days not 9.'London by the sea'.

<Content>Highly recommended hotel just off Circular Quay I stayed in this hotel for five nights in March. This is a boutique hotel with contemporary designs and the rooms are minimalist with their furnishings. The bedroom facilities were superb, with proper cartons of milk for tea and coffee rather than the usual single serve variety. I still haven't figured out why I'd want a toaster in my room though! The bathroom was to die for - huge shower, decent bath, large sink area with lots of storage. The hotel staff were really friendly and efficient. I had a friend joining me as a surprise to the others in our party and, although he checked in ahead of me, the staff kept the surprise by not letting on, right up to the springing of the surprise in the bar. The location of the hotel is excellent - 10 minutes walk from Circular Quay and down a side street so there isn't much through traffic. It's located above a metro station too. Highly recommended - I'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>For the jetlagged traveler! After many hours on the plane from Atlanta, GA USA...this is the place to stay while in Sydney! My husband and I arrived at the hotel around 8 am and they immediately checked us in! We then went to the pool, jacuzzi, steam and dry saunas! The indoor pool has a gorgeous floor to ceiling fountain...it made my jetlag seem to disappear it was so comforting! The hotel is only blocks from the Harbour, Rocks area, and shopping is everywhere. You do not need a car in this city...everyone walks and massive transit is available. Rydges offers a breakfast package and this buffet was exceptionally terrific...homemade yogurt, fresh squeezed juice (the juicer was a large free standing stainless steel one), western and asian options. The room was very contemporary with builtin closets/drawers. Perhaps a bit small but nicely done! The Matilda Cruise came with the package and was absolutely the best way to see Sydney Harbor! I also had a massage at the spa. I favor a traditional Thai massage so I selected an Asian vairety that included several Thai elements. There is also an open food court just downstairs outside the hotel which is great! My husband did the 4:30 am skywalk and absolutely loved it! We also took a Bondi Beach tour which takes you all around the coast line. It is a great way to see all the little towns around Sydney right on the water! We got off at the Bondi Beach stop to have lunch at the Iceberg cafe. This is a member's only club/restaurant for the locals to see and be seen. However if you are just visiting, they will let you into the waterfront restaurant. To become an Iceberg member you must swim in the huge pool(and I mean HUGE) 75 consecutive Sundays. The service at this hotel was just incredible. The staff was so very nice and accomodating. Would definately stay here again!

<Content>Great stay!!!! The Rydges was a great choice for my first (but not last) visit to Sydney. I stayed 8 days there. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms were very nice (boutique like but not too sterile), and the location was perfect. An easy walk to Circular Quay and the Rocks, easy access to trains, and close to a lot of good restaurants and shops. I stayed on the 21st floor and it was one of the quietest hotels I have ever stayed in. I was there during the week before Easter, so it may have been slow.Cons: Don't expect much of a view. The elevator card system is finicky. On the other hand the elevators were fast and very available. The in-room television internet never worked (there is an ethernet port if you bring a laptop).Pros: The staff is young but extremely helpful. Local papers are a nice touch. The business center is small but rarely crowded. The baths are absolute heaven--deep, quiet to fill (for those late night tubs), and separate from the shower. The amenites are all nice and the minibar is not too overpriced.I normally don't write reviews because I'm always afraid the places I like will become too popular and expensive. Since it may be some time before I get back to Sydney, I felt I had to give the Rydges a big thumbs up. I'd actually like to give Sydney a huge thumbs-up. What a fantastic city. I went there because I'm visiting all of the continents before I get too old to travel (Australia was number 5). Now I'm afraid Antarctica will have to wait because I only want to go back to the land Down Under.

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel I thought this was a great hotel...and in a great location. The hotel rooms looked like they had just been redone b/c it was new and sophisticated. The location is good as it's in the CBD...across the street from a great restaurant and bar...and within walking distance of the circular quay and harbour. The only thing to warn about is their taxi service...it can take up to 15 minute to get a taxi...so I recommend calling ahead.

<Content>Great Choice in Sydney CBD! I can highly recommend the Rydges Jamison as a great choice to stay in the Sydney CBD.The hotel is located close to George Street, within an easy walk to the great shops and restaurants of the historic Rocks district, Circular Quay, the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House and just two streets walk from Wynyard station to which you can catch an Airportlink train directly from the International and Domestic airport terminals for far less than the cost of a cab fare - too easy! The staff were friendly and helpful and the room itself was very stylish. It reminded me of a sophisticated bachelor pad. A great bathroom, with a large shower and a separate bath, which is far nicer than the shower/bath combinations found in most hotels. I also found the hotel to be very quiet, which was a pleasant surprise. The pillows and the bed were also very comfy. I would certainly stay there again on my next trip to Sydney.

<Content>Great hotel in great location We stayed here for 4 nights and would definately recommend it. The hotel is in a great location for all city centre attractions - 5 mins to circular quay and the rocks and 10 mins to darling harbour. Staff were firendly, spread of food in for breakfast was 1st class for a restaurant of this size. Rooms were clean and modern - only slight disappointment is that the bathrooms are ultramodern to the extent that they are almost a bit clinical but this is purely down to personal taste. If you're staying in sydeny stay here

<Content>Disappointing hotel - not recommended It is an anomaly that this hotel is rated so highly - and not because of any random and easily repairable bad experience (such as poor service or bad meals). My low rating stems from fundamental systematic errors in this hotel including:* Appalling in room television/radio/technology. There was an old, small, black, CRT television. The channel selection was minimal, picture quality average, and inroom movie options unimpressive. It was the position of the television which was the most disappointing. A hotel room (distinguished from a suite or apartment) should have the television placed in the corner of the room or immediately in front of the bed - not in a wardrobe, on a high shelf, to the left of the bed.* Bed and pillows uncomfortable.These are not small problems because they both combine to consume more than 80% of one's time in the hotel. Yes the hotel was clean, yes the service was good, yes the bathroom was fantastic. But all of that is insignificant when compared to bed and television facilities.I would not recommend this hotel and will not be staying there again.

<Content>Believe the reviews on this downtown gem We selected this downtown hotel because of previous reviews and ratings -- the largest number of stars for the money. The location can't be beat. It is a short walk to Circular Quay and the ferry system and the hotel is right on top of the underground mall leading to the Wynyard rail station. There are many good restaurants of all sorts in the immediate area, notably Est. (in the Establishment hotel building). The rooms are fine and the staff friendly and helpful. Best choice for a downtown stay.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay I have just returned from a 4 week trip to Aus and stayed here for my last night in sydney. We had booked it a month before on wotif and paid about 拢80 for a double room for one night. The hotel was in a good location, right in the centre of town, 5 mins from circular quay. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was great. Clean with all the facilities you would expect. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food, although drinks weren't cheap (but I wouldn't expect them to be!). The only minor criticism was the the hotel pool was very cold.

<Content>Good value and wonderful rooms. The Rydges Jamison Hotel has a fair location in the center of the financial district and not far from the much more posh Establishment Hotel. During the weekdays, it is in a good location for business. If you are a leisure traveler like myself, it鈥檚 not so great since you have to walk fairly far to get to open restaurants, laundry, or even convenience stores. It is, however, not far from the Rocks and Circular Quay, so for many that is a plus. The service at the front desk is efficient and friendly. To its credit, the rooms are spacious and functional with a large armoire on the side with loads of compartments with all you need. There are plenty of electrical outlets in the room. The beds are soft, very soft, but that seems to be the norm in Australia. The bathroom is gorgeous and modern, and lives up to the pictures on the Internet. Views are not good on any floor as buildings all around block them. The pool is small and I don鈥檛 think you could swim laps in it, but could be refreshing. Overall, very comfortable and clean with good housekeeping, but the location would make me think twice about staying here again as I don鈥檛 want to stay in the financial district on a leisure trip.

<Content>sylish just returned from a visit to Oz and can't fault this hotel. Staff were brilliant and upgraded us on arrival from UK as they could see we were shattered and the room we had booked would not be available for a couple of hours. Didn't eat in hotel as so many coffee shops nearby for breakfast and great restaurants at the harbour nearby for dinner. would definately reccommend - check this site for prices as hotel could not match our deal when we booked for another 3 days at the end of our holiday.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We have just returned from 5 nights here at the end of a trip around Australia.The rooms were excellently furnished and maintained, the staff very helpful and always obliging and polite. The hotel is well located for everything, especially the Circular Quay/Rocks/Opera house area and the shopping is a short walk up George street and adjacent Pitt Street.The only complaint I could have if I was really looking for one is that the bar closes quite early at around 11.15pm, but then that has happenend in other Sydney hotels so maybe that's the way things are. There are several bars nearby that open later so it's not really a problem.Rydges is more expensive than some hotels in the area, but is well worth the extra. We would stay there again and highly recommend it.Sightseeing tip: there are 2 companies running hop on hop off sightseeing tours. Make sure you use the double decker one. Their ticket ($30) allows you to do the city tour and the Bondi beach tour on the same day for the one price. The State run City tour is more expensive and you cannot interchange tickets from one trip to the other unless you buy a 2 day ticket, which costs $62. We found out too late, and even though the state run one allows unlimited use of the local buses for the 24 hour period the location of the rydges makes this small consolation for the greatly increased cost.

<Content>Disappointing staff Arrived early in ther morning after 20 hour flight and although we couldn't check-in, we were given the facilities to shower, change and store luggage which was good.Location excellent for access to Rocks, Circular Quay and all public transport, especially to and from airport.Room was tidy but carpet had heavy ingrained dust that you wouldn't expect from a hotel that is graded as top class. Also, we wore the two robes given on our first night and these were never replaced after we left them for washing/collection.We had little contact with staff but when we did finally check out early in the morning the reception staff were rude. He never greeted us or said thank you, goodbye or similar. He thrust a piece of paper into our hands without explaining what it was and appeared to be more interested in chatting to his colleague behind the counter. We were not asked whether we wanted assistance with our luggage/transport and it appeared this member of staff was quite content to see us struggling across the lobby with our bags.Generally ok but would not stay again. This hotels greatest asset is its location.

<Content>comfortable room and great location I just returned from a stay at the Rydges Jamison Feb 10-12. After reading good, but mixed reviews I chose this hotel becasue I wanted a nice comfortable bed and a separate shower and bath to rest after a long flight and the beginning of a l4 day trip. Typical of a higher end hotel everything was expensive and you had to call room service for all needs. I got just what I wanted, but at 176 USD the hotel was not the nicest I have stayed at in that price category in other countries. It was a great place to stay and I would recommend it. The location was also great. 2 blocks from the Circular Quay (and Circulay Quay Train Station), 4 blocks from The Rocks and one block from the Wynyard train station.

<Content>Perfect for Exploring Sydney We stayed at the Rydges Jamison from 27th December to 2nd December 2005.For location in Sydney you can do no wrong. This is slap bang in the middle of the city. The Harbour Bridge is 10 minutes walk max, and around the cove to the Opera House is another 5 minutes.The hotel itself was very nice. The entrance lobby is kept tidy and quite, and the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.You have to use your room key/card for the lift, which we had no problems with, but some people seemed to have trouble with this as their cards would not work.We were on the 29th floor, and although we couldn't see the bridge or opera house, we had a view of harbour and we had no sound from the road below. The bathroom was great with a large walk in shower and seperat deep bath. The room was complete with tv, hair dryer, iron, drinks (which weren't overly expensive) etc.There is a food court just down the road (literally 20 paces) which was great for snacks, and there is a 24/7 store and a McDonalds (should you wish) just down the road.The mattress on the bed was extremly comfy, but I felt the carpet looked a bit grubby. I booked an airport transfer through the hotel and they were there to greet us in a lovely new BMW 7 series which was great to slide into after the long flight.If we ever go back to Sydney I would definatley stay here again, the location is perfect, and the value for money was also very good.

<Content>great location, great hotel We stayed at Rydges on Jamison for 5 nights. The location is superb, 5mins to circular quay and the Rocks, and around the corner from George street, one of the main shopping areas. We arrived by airport train which stops at Wynyard Station, 2mins from the Hotel, although would probably get taxi next time as it is almost as quick. Staff are very helpful and even upgraded us to corner King Deluxe room when they knew our 21 year old daughter was to stay over a few nights. We all enjoyed the luxurious room,super king bed, wonderful bathroom, and especially on the 3rd floor the spa and pool. Each night we would have a wine in the bar sitting on comfy chairs and relaxing after our hectic day. I would reccomend this Hotel to anyone, and would definetely stay here next time in Sydney.

<Content>Perfect for 2 days exploring Sydney Stayed here with a colleague during a business trip when we had 2 extra days to play. We shared a twin on the club floor, and couldn't have been more pleased. The room was clean, bright, quiet, cool (even though the temps outdoors were extreme), and with plenty of space for two people. We had dinner at Charr, the expensive restaurant in the hotel one night and had a great experience. The wine and food were outstanding. The staff even sent our leftovers directly to the room with extra treats (more bread  olive oil, chocolates, and free samples of dessert wine). The location is fabulous for walking to any sights, and the club breakfast and cocktail hour were quite nice. I will be returning on a vacation in the fall, and hope to stay here again

<Content>Location, location, location Great location - Although no views of the Harbour areas The Rydges Jamison is ideally located within easy walking distance of both Sydney Harbour and Darling Harbour.Staff very attentive and helpful and foyer very grand. Lifts can be busy at check out times though.Rooms great and a huge queen size bed! Especially liked bathroom with black tiled floor, walk in shower and standalone tub - great for late night dips (for 2).Pool although petite was good and never very busy although on one occasion jacuzzi did not work and there were no towels available.All in all though great hotel and would strongly recommend.

<Content>Impressive on the outside, ok on the inside We stayed at this Hotel for 7 nights, and while initially impressed with the basics of the hotel, there are some obvious flaws. I tend to be optimistic, so let me start with the good. The staff, while young is extremely friendly and helpful. We were on the club level and the breakfast and cocktail hours were great. The minor issues were the housekeeping; basically the person in charge needs to go.. dusty rooms, some mold in the showers, dirty carpets,old towels, etc... We also made a complaint about our A/C, as there were record setting temps in Sydney and while the (young) staff tried to correct them, they could not. Not really a good idea to send a concierge to correct a mechanical issue. However, the location is ideal, the security tight (you must try to use your keycard to access your room via the elevator.. good luck). I would avoid the restaurant at night, as the food is overpriced and not great.

<Content>Fantastic! I recently spent 11 nights at the Rydges Jamison Hotel in Sydney. I booked it based on the ratings/reviews given on this site, as well as the price. Located on a quiet street near the Rocks area of Sydney, its charm is felt immediately as you pass thru the front doors and enter the beautiful lobby. You become more impressed as the bellman handles your bags, and the curtious front desk personnel cater to your every desire. The twin double room in which I stayed was not only clean and well kept, but very comfortable, with outstanding views. The bathroom rivaled those found in the Bellagio, with its deep soaking tub, and separate glass-enclosed shower. I found it to be everything I could want and more. The location, staff, and amenities are unsurpassed for the price. I look forward to my next visit.

<Content>Great hotel convenient for major sites Wonderful hotel which is very close to circular quay (5 mins walk) and the usual attractions (15mins to Darling Harbour 20 mins to Opera House). Very close to Wynyard station and only just round the corner from George Street (main shopping street).Staff are very well turned out polite and knowledgeable about city attractions, restaurants etcRooms are well appointed and very well maintained, those on the upper floors give you access to the Jamison Club which provides a private breakfast area and evening aperitifs and light bites as part of the rate has some nice views across to the Harbour from the Jamison Club which are unfortunately partially obscured by other larger high rises.

<Content>Fantastic location, Helpful staff, Clean quiet rooms I would definately stay here again. The location was perfect. Situated right next to The Rocks and Circular Quay we were in easy reach to the restaurants and pubs, the Harbour Bridge and Opera House. The hotel staff were helpful and polite. We were in a duluxe room, very large bedroom, great view across the sky line of sydney at night, and a huge bathroom, bath and shower. The room was always cleaned and stocked up with new toiletries, towels. Also an important point was that it was a very quiet room, maybe because we were 14 floors up or perhaps because there was not that many peole in the hotel i don't know but it was lovely to relax in peace and quiet!If you take away one thing from this review- take this. We had previously read reviews on here and decided that we were not going to take the hotels offer of $33 for breakfast each morning. We spent a lot less on breakfast out of the hotel. There are so many places to choose from: A)Over looking the Bridge and the Opera House. Around Circular Quay. B) The undergound shopping centre. (Actually goes under the Rydges Jamison, stretches for something like 3 roads in each direction!) This centre is home to so many cafes, juice bars, fruit and vegatable shops, bakeries the list is endless there are all sorts of breakfasts avaliable. Ok so it doesn't sound appealing but you can always buy your breakfast as a take away and eat it whilst taking in some of the wonderful landmarks in Sydney- ie sitting on the Opera house steps, The botanical gardens. (Or go one better get on the Manly Ferry and have breakfast at one of the cafe's there.) whatver you do have a good trip!

<Content>Trainees need more training My husband and I stayed at this holiday while on a world trip this summer. We had arrived from Ayres Rock late one afternoon. The check in staff consisted of two people, one of whom was a trainee. After handing over a pre-paid voucher he tried to charge us for the room. We were then told that they had no rooms available as per our booking and would be up-graded. the up grade was a smoking room (we had requested non smoking) and the furniture was stained and the room itself in a poor decorative state. When we enquired how this was an up grade as we had booked a de-luxe room we were asked if we wanted our original room back! Also had a Matilda Tea Cruise booked as part of our package and had to ask several times before this was forth coming. great pity about the level of service as the hotel is central situated for all the sights Sydney has to offer.

<Content>Truly Excellent Stayed 4-nights here during Aug. 2005. This place is great. Wonderful location. Only 3-blocks from the Circular Quay. Metro is down the block. Close to Darling Harbor. Very helpful staff. Arrived at 6:am and was automatically given an early check-in. Spotless well-appointed room. Exceptional amenities, including robes, dimmer switch lighting, refrigerator, etc. Would absolutely stay here again.
