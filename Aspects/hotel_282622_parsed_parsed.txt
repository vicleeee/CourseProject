<Content>Central Location, But Noisy This was our second stay at Hotel Ateneo and somehow the experience was not as good as the last time. We booked a triple and stayed in room 306 which faces the street. It was nice to look at the other buildings and lean out and glimpse the square, however the noise from the very late revelers as late as 4 a.m. as well as the utility trucks interrupted our sleep. I would suggest moving to an interior room with no view, such as 301. The walls seemed paper thin this time and we could hear other guests walking on the hallway floor as well as all the doors opening and closing. There was also a lingering smell of fried food permeating the hallways. In terms of service, the afternoon clerk simply stood there and didn't even open the door as we struggled with our luggage and was simply...frosty. The morning clerk, Gaetan, however was as helpful and friendly as you could wish for.The area is a bit seedy...for San Francisco, CA visitors, think Powell and Market Street seedy...but we felt absolutely safe walking the area even in the early morning as the police are ever-present. The station is just down the block. The location is so central -- Madrid Vision bus pick-up just down the street, lots of good restaurants, Gran Via shopping, Plaza Mayor...and the accomodations are spacious, very clean and modern ...but it's a toss-up whether we'll stay there again given the noise. Perhaps we'll try one of the other half-dozen hotels nearby. We found a great place to eat at Calle de la Cruz, 17 -- Fatigas del Querer. Check out the restaurant review. You'll like it! Avoid Garbo Ristorante. Don't get fooled by the slick modern decor. The food is mediocre and overpriced!

<Content>Okay location and that's about it in the middle of the red light district this hotel looks and feels a lot like its surroundings; unloved and ever so slightly seedy. For the price one can do much better. Our room was at the rear of the building with a window facing a wall and an air-conditioning unit. The window only opened partially and the blind was broken anyway. It's located in the tourist centre and that's about the best to be said.

<Content>Great location and clean hotel This hotel was in a fantastic location! It was central to all the tourist sites and where the sites were out of the way, you have 2 metro stops (Gran Via and Sol) close by to choose from to get to those sites. It is on a dodgy street (sex shops and female prostitutes come out at night) but the location could not be beaten. There are also plenty of police around as there is a Police station just 2 doors down from the hotel.The rooms are also very clean and the staff was really helpful. Breakfast wasn't included in our deal but there are plenty of places nearby to eat. Plaza Mayor is only a 5-10 min walk away and Sol is only a 2 min walk away. The only downside is that the walls are really thin so you can hear people shouting outside at night. But I think that is the trade of alot of Spain hotels.

<Content>Perfect Location This hotel is a great place to stay. The location is central to everything, landmarks, metro, shopping etc. The hotel staff is very friendly and willing to help with anything. The room was large and always clean. We stayed in an inside room so as not to have the noise from the street. Price was right. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>a little too "girls of the evening" friendly The hotel was comfortable. easy to walk to shopping, theatre, downtown and metro. Had two 20 year old daughters with me. they were okay with the evening ladies. I had issues with it. the police were readily available. Lots of construction going on nearby. Hotel smelled musty. Had two beds and a cot. comfortable. felt safe, yet cautious.

<Content>Solid hotel - would give it a 3.5 (btw average and above average) Based on some of the reviews here, I had low expectations for this hotel, but my husband and I found a great price online (85 euros) and the location is central and walkable to everything. Our room was HUGE, much larger than usual for a city hotel in Europe. It didn't have a lot of character, but it was definitely spotless and modern, and we had free internet access from our room.We had no problems with noise whatsoever (our room was not facing the street, but we were right next to the elevator), and we slept like babies. The hotel is also right near a police station, which made me feel better about safety after reading about all the prostitutes in the area. In our experience, the street was fine - I would stay there alone as a woman and not worry about it. As far as prostitutes, we didn't see a single one. Either I couldn't recognize them or it was too cold for them to be out on the street!While I wouldn't call the staff overly warm, they were very helpful whenever we asked for advice or directions.All in all, it was a solid experience. If you can catch a good price, this hotel is fine for a business trip or as a tourist if you want to see more of the city than your room anyway!

<Content>Bad Experience I'm very disappointed by this hotel. The room was very small, not spotless clean and it smelled like in a Metro Station. Next to the hotel is what appeared to be the biggest construction site of the country. They worked there 24h/day. At 3 at night it was so loud, I couldn't sleep even though I had earplugs.The only could thing is the price. But it's lousy value.

<Content>Solid little hotel I just spent five days there. I had a side-facing room, which helped with the street noise (don't expect to sleep with your nice balcony door open) - but with the window closed, it was quiet. (Still, bring earplugs - it's the big city.) The air conditioner was excellent, the room clean and nicely laid out, the breakfast buffet complete, and in all it's a very nice value for money. Yes, there are prostitutes up the street, if you turn away from Sol, but if you go left there's nothing like that. (And they leave you alone if you ignore them!) It's as nice a centrally-located hotel you could get for the money; I recommend it highly.

<Content>Fantastic time in Madrid We stayed at the Hotel Ateneo in Puerto del Sol, which is very central and is located very near the Puerto del Sol Metro, Heurtas, Plaza Mayor and Plaza Santa Ana.Our room was very nice(air con worked perfectly, which was a blessing given the heat). The only slight inconvenience with the hotel was a slight noise from nearby building work which started quite early in the morning. The buffet breakfasts were tremendous with a good choice of food.We found all the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful, unlike the previous reviewer from Nevada.Word of warning if you are getting an airport taxi from the airport to the hotel - we were charged 37euros(ie 27euros plus 10 euro supplimentary fee). The metro will cost you 2 euros!!! The metro system in Madrid is very easy to navigate and is very cheap and efficient. Connections to every part of the city. Tip with the metro, buy the 10 journey ticket which costs 6 Euros, and can be used over any amount of days.We went to Toledo and Segovia by bus which we would definitely recommend, but the one tip here is if you buy a return ticket which we did, make sure you get your ticket stamped with the bus time, at the ticket office of the bus station you are leaving from prior to getting on the bus or they will not let you on. Both cities are very different, but each worth a visit. The Real Madrid stadium Tour is terrific value at 15 Euros.Brilliant trip to Madrid - highly recommended and we are looking forward to our return trip.

<Content>Great location Hotel Ateneo Puerta del Sol is in a great location, off Gran Via, andis great value. I stayed here for three nights sharing a triple room with 2 friends. The room contained two twin beds and a sofa bed. The room and ensuite were clean and comfortable although the room was very cold at night. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Only downside was the noise from the street so bring ear plugs.

<Content>A wonderful place to stay To cap off my trip to walk part of the Camino de Santiago, I booked 2 nights at this hotel in Madrid. I am so glad that I did! I arrived a day earlier than expected, so had to stay at another hotel which wasn't so nice.I had sent a box of things to myself  it was waiting for me when I checked in. My room was on the 2nd floor, nice new furniture, a bath with shower AND a tub, and a TV with 2 English stations (albeit BBC World  CNN International). The bed was very comfortable, the room quiet. The hotel is between metro stops Sol  Gran Via, but I walked everywhere  only used the Metro to get to  from the train station at Atocha  the Airport.I will be going back to Madrid at least 2 more times,  plan to stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Fab Fab hotel, Great location. The room was very clean and comfortable. Luckily the weather was very warm when we were there and the air con worked fine. We slept well as long as you shut the windows and left the air con on as the street is very busy. The staff were very friendly /helpful and spoke very good english. The free internet access is also a bonus. There are prostitutes on the street but they don't stand outside the hotel or at least not when we were there, they were up from the hotel going towards Gran Via so didnt effect us at all, as previously mentioned there is always a Police presence and we walked back down there at 2.00am in the morning and felt fine.However we do have a slight negative which was that we booked/reserved the room on the internet and on checking out were charged an extra 30 euros! when we queried this as we had our print out from the website we booked with we were firstly told it was for the breakfast and when we pointed out we had booked for bed and breakfast we were then told it was VAT!!! so not really sure what we were paying extra for but this aside it was still a great hotel and we would definately stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Location and Great Value My partner and I stayed here for 5 nights from 25-30 April 2007 having booked on the basis of reviews posted here. We were not disappointed.As others have mentioned the location is ideal - no more than 100 meters from two metro stations (Sol and Gran Via) and right in the heart of the city. It's great both for sightseeing - the Prado etc are within easy walking distance - and food and entertainment. The red light aspect of the street caused us absolutely no problem and in fact provided us with some amusement.Our room was large by 3 star standards and also had a large bathroom which was cleaned daily. The airconditioning worked well (tho' we didn't need it much as unfortunately the weather wasn't too good) and there was plenty of storage space. The cost was 490 euros for the five days.Every one of the reception staff was helpful and spoke pretty good English. I mentiioned on the Sunday night that the internet connection was causing problems and it was fixed at breakfast time next day.All in all if we ever return to Madrid - and I hope we do - we'd certainly stay here again.

<Content>Great location Good centrally located hotel. Helpful staff. Rooms reasonable size, large bathroom. The hotel is very near to the red light area and is on a busy street leading up from the Plaze del Sol. The road is very noisy at night, so it's not possible to have your window open, air conditioning not too effective. The rooms at the back are really dark although quieter. Breakfast served until 12 - very civilized! Shopping area less than 5 mins walk, couple of minutes walk to metro stops Sol and Gran Via. Bar next door good for drinks before going out. Would recommend it for a reasonably priced weekend break hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel Could Not Best Location Young Travelers, Chicago, IL USAMy Girlfriend and I stayed at Hotel Ateneo in March during a two week trip to Europe. We selected the hotel based on price and location. We felt the rate was reasonable and location farily centralized, but upon arriving were a little nervous about the street that we were on. Apparently, this street is commonly known as a place where hookers hang out / work. So when we returned to the hotel after dinner and drinks we felt it's surroundings were a little sketchy late at night.  Other negative was that they double charged my girlfriend and I. The room was reserved with her credit card and the next morning when checking out we paid with mine. Hopefully they mistakenly decided to charge both of us for a one night stay. We didn't discover this until we were going through our card statements back home. Wasn't happy about that.  Besides the surroundings and billing issue we felt the hotel was clean and modern. Big plus was free internet access in the business center. If you looking for mid-range pricing, clean, and central it's not too bad.

<Content>Very nice hotel Booked through the Ryanair.com site for 50 euro's per person per night. Good deal while the hotel is in the perfect location, breakfast is convenient and rooms are clean.The hotel is located in a street with all kind of shops. Some reviews mention sex shops in the street and some prostitutes. Okay, there are some but this doesn't affect my positive rating for this hotel. The street is so busy with pedestrians that you hardly realize that it's there. My girlfriend and I felt completely safe. Remember, the neighbourhood is the city centre, not a quiet suburb.I would recommend this hotel to all my friends.

<Content>Proximity to All Having made a hasty retreat from a previously booked hotel, we found the neighboring Ateneo Hotel a most welcome relief. With underground secure parking nearby, we were free to wander the streets of Madrid (too often under construction) to a great variety of places of all types to eat, the museums to the east and the palaces to the west. And insofar as shopping, everything was right outside the door...the city's major department store, excellent art dealers and the required tacky T-Shirt vendors.Our room was spacious and overlooked an interior courtyard which made it incredibly quiet. An extensive breakfast was served and The Metro stope within a block or so of the hotel.On top of all, was a frendly and helpful staff, versant in English and knowledgable and having a sence of humor, a bonus after we'd walked all over this great city.

<Content>Centrally located and good value An excellent stay in late October 2006. The hotel is centrally located 2 minutes walk from Sol or Gran Via underground stations, and central for all Madrids attractions. Friendly efficient staff with smooth booking, check in and departure procedures. They all spoke excellent English. A very good and extensive breakfast with hot and cold dishes for everyone. Overall a very good experience at a reasonable price (110 e for room with breafast for 2 included).Although we had a second floor room with a balcony onto the busy main street below which is being pedestrianised and is subject to heavy road works, the noise was quiet as can be expected in any city centre. The street is a mixture of retail and leisure and seems to be a hang out for street hookers at all times of day. This does not detract from the area and it is by no means a sleazy or dodgy location. Theres a good mixture of locals, shoppers, punters and tourists all milling about together.I would choose it again.

<Content>Terrible (luckily only for 1 night) We stayed in this Hotel for one (terrible) night on Saturday. While approaching the hotel we realized that it is located on a noisy boardwalk. We asked for a quiet room and had 2 options to choose from: back side room with broken airconditioner and window or front side room. We had to choose the second option due to the fact that the stuff was unwilling to fix the first room's damages. We were locaten on the first floor above the street and couldn't sleep at night.There is no doubt that the location is central, but it comes with big (noisy) price.

<Content>Very pleasant stay I just stayed at this hotel on a recent trip to Spain - I stayed for 3 days at the end of Aug and 1 more night in Sept. I booked this hotel after reading the positive reviews on this site, and the reviews turned out to be very accurate: the hotel and room were very clean and pleasant, the staff spoke English and were helpful, and the location was very central in the city.The only caveat I have about it is the immediate area around the hotel: Puerta del Sol is the Times Square of Madrid, overrun w/ tourists and undesirable locals, and the restaurants in the area catered to tourists. However, don't let your first impression of the neighborhood fool you: there are so many better neighborhoods  sites within easy walking distance of the hotel,  the nearest train stations, Sol  Gran Via, are hubs on the train system. I ended up walking to the much more chic  fashionable Chueca area for shopping  eating (a 5-minute walk away)  just avoided the immediate area around the hotel. Also, if you're a shopper, there are 2 HMs right near the hotel that are both excellent.For the price, quality,  cleanliness, I would absolutely stay here again.

<Content>Confortable and great location The hotel is very nice with great comfortable and refurbished rooms and en-suite bathrooms. The staff in the reception is very nice and the location is great in the very centre and good for tourism. The only less nice thing about the hotel is the breakfast, buffet but with little selection and runs out very fast, also the staff in the breakfast area (just one lady) was less and helpful. Good value for money in the busy and historical centre of Madrid.

<Content>Lovely hotel Stayed in this hotel start of March. Modern, quiet and well designed rooms; friendly staff; and good breakfasts. What more could you ask for? Well, turn left out of the hotel and in 60 seconds you're in one of the main squares in the city! This also avoids most of the 'colourful' street inhabitants. Rooms and hotel look exactly as advertised on the Internet. All in all, will definitely stay here if I come back to Madrid

<Content>Great Hotel at a Low Rate This hotel turned out to be a perfect pick for us. The room was attractive and spotlessly clean, the bathroom was big and nice, and the location was perfect for getting around the city. The room had nice french doors that opened onto the street, which we sometimes opened for the fresh air, but when closed they blocked out almost all the street noise. We could hear a bit of noise from other rooms, but nothing out of the ordinary. We are two women in our mid-twenties, and we had each lived in Madrid before, so we were familiar with Calle Montera. If you are not, expect sex shops and prostitutes along the block. If that will freak you out, don't stay here. If not, this hotel is the perfect pick for central location, spotless accomodations, and low price.

<Content>Great Location If you are looking for a central hotel, you would do a lot worse than book the Ateneo. We stayed for two nights in late February and the hotel was excellent. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. The rooms whilst not the biggest were fine and very clean. But what wins it for this hotel is the location, it a about a 2 minute walk to Puerta Del Sol square and metro. If you are prepared to walk for around 5 mins the bars are numerous and there is something for everyone, there are tapas and irish bars dotted up all the streets leading of the square. All in all if you are on a bit of a budget I recommend this hotel highly.

<Content>Good value hotel in a "hot" street We have stayed several times in the Ateneo . Its a totally renovated hotel in an old building 1 block away from Puerta del Sol with all the attractives of Madrid (theaters , museums , shops , nightlife ) accesible by foot . Rooms are modern ,simple and quite big (specially those in the top floor ) , with huge bathrooms . Buffet-Breakfast are excellent and the staff is correct . Problems? The location is unbeatablely central but ... Calle Montera is the equivalent of Rue St.Denis in Paris , with girls staying in the street every 5 meters . This not represent a security problem at all but can be a little bit disturbing , even if this street activity is really not noisy .

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Location, great breakfast lounge The best Hotel we have had stayed before, because its location, staff, level of cleaning in their rooms and turistic areas to be visited, practically speaking you do not spend money on cabs or public transportaion, because is so centered and so strategycally well located that you really save moneyThe hotel staff makes you feel at home, is so great and even greater is the all you can eat breakfast included with the room price, so, having this feeling in your first visit to spain is so good, they tell you everything, where the best tapas restaurants are located at (By The Way Picoteo's, is the best and the cheapest one, We were 2 adults, one 10 year old child, eating any kind of tapas only spend 20 euros in total including drinks (ca帽itas)), where buying cheap and good souvenirs, even they tell you where not to go after certain hours in terms of your personal security.I recomend this hotel over and over aagin, if you want to have and see everything around the corner and saving money like no ma帽ana, this is the place

<Content>Great Hotel Was a little leary of the area from reading the reviews on here but it is no problem day or night. I felt very safe. The hotel is in an excellent location. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was spotless and most importantly the bed was comfortable. Would stay there again. Shuttle from the airport (minibus) was 18E for two.

<Content>Wonderful breakfasts The hotel is located in the center of Madrid, just a short distance from la Puerta del Sol. Heading to La Gran Via, streets are unsafe and after 8PM, surrounded by prostitutes. There are some sex shops nearby the hotel for which suspicious men hang around. Rooms are clean and big enough. Breakfasts are delicious and included in the room cost. The restaurant beside the hotel charges for sitting on a table without informing you. There is available internet at the lobby. Reception staff are courteous.

<Content>Very good hotel This is a very good hotel,reasonably priced, and in an excellent location.The rooms and bathrooms are large and modern though simply furnished.They also have air conditioning. Breakfast is excellent.The hotel is in a great position, 100m. from the Puerta del Sol and its transport links, and the same distance from the Gran Via which is one of the main streets. To get to the latter, however ,you pass through the area referred to by everybody who has stayed here. It is actually quite a sight to see so many prostitutes in such a small area, in the middle of the day, and in the heart of a city.If you walk straight ahead when leaving the hotel you are in a different world, the street leading to the main shopping area and many restaurants and bars.I have have stayed in this hotel twice and shall do so again.

<Content>Best hotel my whole trip Orginally booked a triple at the Hostal Astoria for 67 euros/night. Arrived at the Hostal Astoria and they didn't have a room for us so they moved us to their sister hotel, the Ateneo, for the same price, lucky us!! Probably would not have been able to afford staying here otherwise (we tried to stay here again on our return to Madrid but it was over 100 euros/night for a double). Clean, modern hotel with friendly staff that was helpful giving directions. TV with CNN, hairdryer, and mini-bar in the room. Bathroom, beds and even the pull-out sofabed were great. Location is central next to Sol subway stop and Puerto del Sol but the street is a little questionable, mostly tattoo shops and porn stores. If this doesn't bother you (we were 3 girls and didn't feel unsafe) it won't be a problem. Would def recommend.

<Content>Madrid in July Just arrived back from staying at the Ateneo. Location was excellent, as said in previous reviews, next to Puerto del Sol. We asked for a quiet room and were given one at the back of the hotel. The weather was red hot, but for a 3* hotel, the air conditioning was great. The area does have a lot of prostitutes, I found it strange seeing them at 10am, but didn't particularly bother me. Rooms were large as was the bathroom, beds really comfortable, so we have absolutely no complaints (and I'm dead fussy). Had the breakfast one day, it wasn't too bad for 6 euros each. Be sure to use the 'hop on hop off' bus to get you round the main sights.

<Content>Great Location My wife and I stayed here for four nights in April It is a modern hotel, well located between two main metro lines. The room was large and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We didn't take breakfast there, but would recommend it to those travelling to Madrid and looking for a moderately priced place to stay.
