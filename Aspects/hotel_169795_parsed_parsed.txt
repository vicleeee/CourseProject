<Content>Good We stayed here 2 nights. Nice hotel, modern furniture, clean, good breakfast, nice hotel bar, good central location.However on the first night it was extremely cold, the air conditioning, although set on heat (30 degrees) would still blow only cold air. On the second night the temperature was much better, I don't know how come. In the bathroom it was still very cold. They started vacuum cleaning the corridors at 8 in the morning which was quite disturbing.The safety box and minibar could only be used if specifically requested from the front desk which gave you the special keys. Therefore we didn't bother to ask for it (for such a short stay) but it would have been a problem to carry all the money with you for several days, in a city like Mexico City.

<Content>First time in MC, great stay We stayed here upon our arrival in MC, after a trip from New York, and before exploring the country. Travelling with 2 children, aged 7  10. We had a great time, with excellent service from all staff, who assisted us where necessary, always with a smile.Location was good, near Chapultepec Perc, great for the kids, and in the Zona Rosa, fun for the parents.Don't let yourself be distracted from stuff that can happen in any large city hotel. This one is so good we rebooked a stay 2 weeks later on our return from our trip, before flying back.

<Content>Sanctioned Theft - Proceed with Caution! I stayed at the Galeria Plaza while in Mexico City on business.The room was comfortable, the service was good, and the location was central. Breakfast was great, if a little pricey; neighborhood had a lot to offer, if a little shady after hours. I was happy with most every aspect of my stay - until I checked out.Upon checking out of the hotel, I was given my additional charges, as is customary.My phone bill - for four international phone calls of approximately 20 minutes each, to the US; 5 phone messages; and one domestic call - also under ten minutes - came to 5796.80 MXN! While I have traveled enough to know that international calls from a hotel room are going to be expensive, this was an expense I never dreamed of! I was cautious and limited my calls, but as I had no cell service, I did need to call home.$579 USD? Because I got a great deal on the hotel, it exceeded the cost of my stay. Because I got a great deal on my plane ticket, it is almost equal to the cost of my ticket. I was outraged, and personally insulted by the amount charged.When traveling, you know to gird yourself against theft. I did so, following all rules - i kept under $100 on me at all times, and I kept everything of value (watch, wedding rings, and Passport) locked in the hotel safe. I did not, however, imagine that I needed to gird myself againsthe hotel itself- alas, that is where the robbery ocurred! Sanctioned, at the check out counter!While the charges can be avoided by not making phone calls, it is the practices underlying the charges that should make you hesitate to book this location.

<Content>Terrible experience I stayed at this hotel from July 30 - Aug. 8th. My experience was terrible. Noise in the early morning hours (staff)! HOUSEKEEPING: The iron box was always on the floor where I left it (mind you I had a deluxe-deluxe - no ironing board). No fridge, it took two days to get the fridge and another 48hrs to have it opened. The bathroom was never replenished - I had to call, and call, and call for service!! For all these days I was here, I had one little bar soap - eventually had to buy my own body wash. The wrappings  plastic bags from shopping were carefully put on the dresser for me!!-- What for?? The desk (glass-top) was never wiped down since I checked in. RESTAURANT: Watch out 4 flies (esp. Lobby Bar). The food choices were extremely limited; went for buffet - but stomach did not agree with that for 3days...(diahrea). Check your receipts - especially when paying cash. I was given an old receipt of June 29 - think it (in August)! they will apologise!! If you have a deposit at the desk, insist on your receipt copies - they'll make you pay double! CONCEIRGE--Two GREAT younger men..Alejandro (sp) and Lazro (. Your forgot something - try calling - reception will hang up on you forever. All communication in spanish... lots of annoying assumptions! Duty manager Emmanuel was understanding!

<Content>Great Hotel and Location Hotel is in a great location for those that like to explore on foot. There is enough around the Zona Rosa area to keep you occupied for more than a few days: shops, local markets, to the must do Chapultepec Park.For those that want to explore out with Zona Rosa, the metro station is only a 10min walk from the hotel which is cheap and an ideal way to get around Mexico City. We used the metro throughout our stay and found it to safe, clean and easy to understand. The hotel itself is modern, clean and fairly priced. We found the staff to be extremely helpful from the front desk to the bar staff. There are a lot of business types that use this hotel that bring with it conferences in the upper floors, so those that prefer to have a more relaxing atmosphere this hotel may not be for you.Swimming pool is lovely with great views around, but on the small side for those more interesting in fitness rather than relaxing.Restaurants in the hotel are OK; we would recommend getting out there and sampling the local food, especially those small taco taverns! But we can understand when convenience is priority after a long day walking around.Room was very clean to the point where they organized our toiletries in height order! It had all the usual mod cons with plenty space.There is so much more to say about Mexico City (Aztec ruins, culture museums etcéˆ¥?, but our advice is to research and explore. Mexico City in our opinion is safe with police always present. Mexican people are friendly if YOU make the effort.Overall a great stay in a great city!

<Content>Don't go - we were robbed!! My girlfriend and I booked to stay at the Galeria Plaza for our 5 days in Mexico City, based on reviews here on tripadvisor. Our initial impressions were spot on the reviews - good location, clean, modern. However our stay turned into an awful one, half way through, when we had MX$6000 stolen out of our room. We arrived at the hotel at 2am, after a near 24 hour trip from England. We put our valuables (passport, cash, keys etc) into the safe in the room, although the safe didn't have a key. We woke up the next morning and headed straight out, forgetting to ask how to get the key for the safe. As soon as we arrived back later that afternoon, we got the key from the front desk and promptly locked the safe. Then, when we went back into the safe the next day to get more money out, MX$6000 (US$600) were missing!We reported it to the front desk immediately and they were as good as useless. They refused to accept that it had been taken, and said they simply asked the maid if she had seen anything and she said no. It took us 24 hours to be able to speak to the manager, who wouldn't help us initially, and even suggested that we were making it up. In the end, he said that all that they could do was escort us to the police station. They couldn't have been more unhelpful and even tried to make us pay for the phone call to our insurance company!All in all, this could have been a nice stay, but it was a disaster. The hotel were dreadful in assisting us. I urge you not to stay here with the thought that if this has happened once, it could happen again.

<Content>DF dulce DF Great location! We also loved the modern clean design of the hotel and the professional, courteous and competent staff. The rooms were clean and large and I highly recommend the rooftop pool to cool down after a busy day in the city. My only complaints - the bed might be a little firm for some tastes, the hotel has a definite business traveler vibe and you might have to ask for more towels.

<Content>Wonderful hotel w/ and even better location This hotel was not only clean, nice, and cheap for the quality you get, but the employees were super nice as well. Everyone that I talked to spoke English, though I could tell that they were happy to hear me try to speak some Espanol. (fyi, when travelling fr. the airport, DO NOT take the street cabs outside the airport. you can go to the taxi stands Transporte Terrestre (very safe  reliable) and purchase a fixed-rate ticket for about $15-20 which is really cheap for how far they have to go and all the traffic they encounter. it is located to the Lt. as you exit customs  near Sala A exit. Also, hold on to your ticket and only give it to the driver, as we had a porter trying to take our luggage and ticket.) The room we stayed in had a very comfy bed, but we liked that the mattress was a little firm. The only thing that we can even possibly complain about is that when they changed our towels out eveyday, they didn't give us new washcloths, as we had to ask for new ones every day. (I guess peop. like to steal them as souvenirs, so they have to be cautious w/ them) So what's to say about the location... well it was centrally located w/ tons of great restraunts and close to Chapultapec Park and practically the back yard to the Monumento a la Independencia (El Angel). I went w/ my boyfriend and my parents and have to admit that we never once felt uncomfortable or unsafe. (there were police everywhere) Of course, as w/ every big city, U have to be cautious w/ your wallet/purse and not wear flashy jewelry, as this will surely draw unwanted attention. However, we didn't encounter the ladies of the night one reviewer spoke of. If U can figure out the bus sys. (or ask someone at the hotel) it's a pretty cheap, convient way around the city, as is their subway system.  Thus, next time we go back to El Ciudad we will definately be staying here at the Galeria Plaza. Oh  fyi, this hotel is also part of the Brisas chain of hotels in Mexico (which, in my humble opinion, has the highest quality as well as the best located properties of any hotel in Mexico)

<Content>Good Hotel Plus: The rooms are nice and spacious. The staff is very helpful. I would actually go as far as say that the staff was probably one of the most helpful I've ever delt with.There are 2 bars, and on arrival, we got a free drink , which is a nice start to a vacation.Minus: It's a little outdated. The bathroom was a bit dark, and musty.

<Content>Great Hotel in nice location We stayed here for 5 days and enjoyed every bit of it. It's located in the Zona Rosa which is exactly where we wanted to be. It was safe and close to all the bars. Had no problem with the staff or if we wanted to have guests over.

<Content>Great Hotel, Not The Best Though Galeria Plaza had a friendly staff and good location on the edge of the Zona Rosa, 5 minute walk to Sevilla metro and only a block from Reforma. The neighborhood is teeming with police at all hours and safe for tourists although there are prostitutes and touts along certain side streets (but they are harmless). The beds and rooms are great, very comfortable and 7-11 is very close by for anything small you might need (bottled water, etc.). The only problems were: the a/c in our room wasn't very high powered and had to be set to lowest temp for a few hours to really cool the room down; the breakfast buffet in the cafe was a *total* ripoff at approx. $25 USD per person!; the room service and cafe menus could use a bit more choice, especially for vegetarians. Otherwise, a wonderful hotel and a great place for a first time visitor to Mexico City. Also, the day trips arranged by the in house travel agent were terrific and he was very helpful. Do keep in mind though that during off-season you can easily get a room at a more modern hotel like the W for the same price. But also, those higher end hotels aren't in as lively an area as Galeria Plaza.

<Content>Great location at a good value Galeria Plaza is a great top-end hotel in the center of Mexico City. The hotel is ideally located in the Zona Rosa within two blocks of the Angel de la Independencia and Paseo de la Reforma. Its central location makes it very easy to get to the historical center or Chapultepec via taxi (40 pesos during the day) or Turibus (100 pesos for all day use). It is also withing walking distance of Avenida Insurgentes with its Metrobus transit system. The hotel has a taxi sitio in front.The hotel staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I accidentally booked my stay to arrive a day later than my actual arrival. The staff worked with Expedia.com to cancel my Expedia reservation (even though it was withing 24 hours I did not get a penalty) and then gave me a new reservation matching the Expedia rate. The concierge was always helpful and answered any questions we had.The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The entire floor we were in was non-smoking which was a pleasure, as many hotels in Mexico continue to permit smoking in all the rooms. Note that the beds in this hotel are somewhat harder than average. If you like extremely soft beds, this could be a problem.One final comment about the neighborhood. The Zona Rosa, is very hip and happening with lots of night life. However it is also the center of the gay community in Mexico City. The scene is equivalent to any major city in the U.S.; however, if this sort of thing bothers you, you may want to look for a different neighborhood altogether.Tip: When taking a cab from the airport, Galeria Plaza is in Zone 4, $152 pesos as of Nov 07.

<Content>Just OK In despite of the fact that the rooms are nice and renovated, the hotel looks very dated (lobby, restaurants, etc). It is centrally located, but the neighborhood isn't nice at all (especially at nights). Breakfast is very mediocre, and they charge you 21 USD if you want to use the Internet.

<Content>Fantastic location, too bad the ged was so hard Pros: Location is fantastic, right at La Zona Rosa, Paseo De La Reforma and a few short blocks from the Metro station. If you can handle a 30 minute walk you can easily get to Bosque de Chapultepec. Concierge was very helpful, self-service cappucino machine by the elevators, roof top pool and gym was easily accessible. Hotel has parking if you have a car.Cons: The bed was very hard and the pillows were too soft. No in room Internet access unless you buy an access card ($20/day) and the business center charges $2 for 10 minutes of use. For 4 stars it should be free. Chairs were attractive but not relaxing to sit in (just lie on your bed I guess). The key to the safe is not in room; you have to get it from the front desk. Bathroom is not well lit, so you shower in near darkness. Also if you're tall (6' and up) you may have to hunch over in the shower too.

<Content>Had a nice time at Galeria Plaza We were going to Mexico City for my grandmother's 90th birthday and needed 5 rooms. My mother chose Galeria Plaza because it was a central location for all of our activities. The staff at the hotel was extremely friendly and made us feel welcome and comfortable. The bed was extremely hard and the first room they gave us was very small. We asked for a bigger room and they gave us one. THERE IS ALWAYS A BETTER ROOM. The staff was very accommodating and helpful. My girls loved the pool upstairs, but it closes at 7pm..way too early for us. It would have been nicer if it stayed open until 9 or 10pm. The restaurant had a nice breakfast buffet and that made it easy for us. There were some nice restaurants around and cheaper options for breakfast if we didn't want to spend $15 a buffet. We never felt in danger walking around, and we walked around the zona rosa at all hours. Loved the insurgentes market and artist market on sullivan. The only thing I would caution is that this is a very open and homosexual environment. I don't have a problem with this at all, however, you may appreciate knowing this if you are going with children. You will have a lot of explaining and teaching moments while walking these streets. We had a wonderful time and would probably explore staying in another neighborhood such as polanco (closer to Chapultapec) next time we go with our children. Happy travels.

<Content>Nice Hotel - Restaurant is Slooooow I really liked the hotel....the rooms were nice, the bed soft, TV was great, location was nice right across the street from the Angel on la reforma. It is located in the Zona Rosa which is nice but I really do wonder how safe it is there at night. There were lots of highly armed security cops in the streets like Swat teams....When I went to eat downstairs however, I believe I must have waited for at least 30-40 mintues for my pasta. It was pretty empty when I stayed over the weekend too. Hardly anyone on my floor let alone the lobby. Different from when I stayed across the street at the Sharaton where there were lots of people in and out from the US. I would def. stay at this hotel again if I was concerned about budget but since I usually go for work (where I don't pay out of my pocket) I would recommend going across the street to the Sharaton if staying on your companys dime and not so worried about costs...

<Content>Average Hotel, below average service We stayed for a couple of nights in the Galeria Plaza Hotel on a stopover from Cancun. Arriving in the afternoon, the checkin was quick, but the staff are indifferent, if not outright unfriendly if you don't speak spanish.The hotel is centrally located in Zona Rosa. Don't take any of the taxis outside the hotel. Walk down to the monument and hail a cab. (always establish a price beforehand though).The hotel room was on the small size, but average for an executive suite. The furnishings and decorations were clean. No problems there. There is currency exchange available at the front, but you can get much better rates outside in one of the banks. My main problem with this hotel did not come until I arrived home and looked at a charge on my visa statement. They had charged me for the mini-bar, which I never used. It is difficult to reverse afterwards, so you should make sure you get the statement when you check out to avoid my problem.Overall, it is a clean hotel with below average service. I'd rate it average if they had not made that mistake. I give them 2 stars because of it.

<Content>$14.50 USD Charge for one Toll Free Call I was in Mexico City this week for two nights. Spent the first night at the Sheraton Historico at a rate of $178 and based on favorable reviews on Tripadvisor decided to try and save some money the second night at the Galleria Plaza. The contrast was striking. The room I had at the GP was tired, tiny and very dark. While clean, it only was a place to sleep. Upon check out the next morning, I was reviewing my bill and found a charge for $14.50 for one toll free call I made to the MCI access line (an 800 number as we would say in the US). While I frequently do see a minor charge (it was $2.50 USD at the Sheraton the night before), not only was this excessive, it bordered on fraud. I challenged the charge upon check out stated that it was not posted in the room and was extremely excessive. The clerk kept on insisting but finally agreed to reduce the charge to $4.00 USD. My recommendation, stay at the Sheraton. For a few dollars more, it was a night and day difference in the room, the overall hotel environment and the absence of fraudulent telephone practices.

<Content>Perfect stay Great Hotel, great location, great service. I stayed 8 nights at the Galeria Plaza and enjoyed everything about it, especially the rooftop swimming pool. The only downside was a $6 per minute charge to call the US, but I guess all hotels in Mexico charge the same...

<Content>Excellent Hotel We spent five nights at this hotel,from 04/05 to 04/10,and were very pleased with our selection.This is our fourth trip to Mexico City and would say this is the best among the other hotels were we have stayed,especially the location.It is a very ellegant hotel .The staff was super friendly and very helpful.There are McDonalds,Burger Kings,KFC,Popeyes,Seven Elevens,at walking distance plus Sanborns and VIPS cafeterias,the mexican equivalent to Dennys or IHOPS.All of them are very convenient because the meals at the hotel were not cheap.The room was extremely clean,lots of space,comfortable bed.The only downside for me was that I was at a non-smoking floor and could smell cigarette smoke.Seemed that somebody was not respecting the rules or that there was a problem with the flow of air in the building.About the city,it is wonderful and safe.One caveat for any prude people,this area is the gay zone of the city,If you get annoyed by gays,do not come to this area.They are all over and very open with their public displays of affection.I am a liberal and must confess that the first day it was shocking.

<Content>Great Concierge We stayed four nights in March/07, the location was great for the Tourista Bus and walking to different monuments. The hotel was very clean we stayed at a 5 star different Hotel on Reforma and thought this was a much cleaner place and better location to the action. Concierge was very helpful, he always had time to book us side trips and tell us place we wanted to go see, and get us Taxi's we felt comfortable in. The only down side was the quick call to the states cost us $60.00 no more than 3 minutes, the internet in the business center was difficult to obtain due to no one being there most of the time, plus it had a chart rate so we ended up not using it. Would recommend this place and would go back again, drinks at the bar were to high $7.50 each, they gave us a free drink coupon wish we used, great trip.

<Content>Modern, well appointed and quiet The room was a delight--attractive, light- and soundproof. Located in the Pink Zone not far from Chapultapec Park, the Galeria Plaza staff is helpful, cooperative and friendly. The hotel has a strong commitment to green hospitality. The card key unlocks the door and, inside, provides access to lighting. When the card is removed as you exit the room, the lights go off. The hotel gives you the option of reusing your towels to reduce energy and water use. (How often do you change your towels at home?)Except for the $8 shots at the bar, I had no complaints about my four-day stay and would recommend the hotel to anyone not needing to be downtown.

<Content>Great hotel! I stayed at the Galeria Plaza for 4 nights in April 2006 during Holy Week. The hotel seemed geared towards business travelers but we felt right at home when we stayed. The front desk staff was very helpful and spoke English. They exchanged our money and were very helpful in giving directions. The room was large and clean. Very clean actually- the maids were a little over zealous and when we requested the room not to be cleaned they did it anyway. They were so throrough they even repacked our luggage and folded our clothes! I loved the rooftop- a small pool but it was too cold to swim anyway. The view of the city was breathtaking. The location was great- close to Metros but the Zona Rosa was very interesting in itself. You must eat at Beatricita if you stay- an incredible authentic and cheap Mexican meal experience. We couldn't have asked for anything more here and would be very willing to stay again.

<Content>Good place to stay We stayed at the Galeria Plaza for the Thanksgiving break. The hotel location is in the business and night life district, Zona Rosa and felt very secure. The hotel is not in a tourist area but in clean, upmarket sorroundings and only 2 mins walk to the Tourist bus stop. The rooms were as expected for a upper class hotel and very comfortable. The staff were excellent. We used the services of the very helpful concierge in organizing guides and sightseeing in and around Mexico city. The restaurant at the hotel was OK although there is a lot of choice of good eating places in the neighbouring streets. Minor quibble-to get the free internet, one had to use the business centre or the lobby. All in all, a comfortable and satisfying stay.

<Content>fantastic hotel i stayed at this hotel in the zona rosa for 2 nights. The room was extremely large, the service was excellent and was in walking distance to all the major clubs in the zona rosa as well as the subway. if you want a hotel that is all glitz then this is a pretty good place. if you want a more historical and cultural feel for mexico city i would suggest staying the centro historico (historical centre).

<Content>Does not qualify as a 4 star hotel We booked the Galeria Plaza based on the high ratings here and on Hotels.com and we were very disappointed.We stayed from December 27th thru 29th and then again on December 31st. I booked both of these stays through Hotels.com before I had traveled to Mexico City and now wish that I had not. This hotel was listed as a 4 star hotel and the service and facilities that we experienced during our stays definitely do not warrant that.For both stays I had booked the Brisas Business Club-European Plan with a non-smoking king bed, which according to your website provides the following: One king bed or two double beds. Located on top two floors (10th and 11th). Large window with city views. Desk. Three multi-line phones. Internet access (surcharge). Minibar. Coffee/tea maker. Satellite TV. Alarm clock. Marble bathroom with shower and tub. Access to the living-room-like executive lounge providing check-in and concierge services; complimentary daily Continental breakfast; complimentary evening wine and appetizers; express check-in and check-out. Upon arrival at the hotel for our initial stay on the 27th, we were informed that the top 2 floors (the 10th and 11th) were being remodeled and therefore we would be on a lower floor. Furthermore, even though I clearly reserved a king bed they claimed none were available unless we wanted a smoking room, which we did not. We did receive vouchers for the complimentary daily Continental breakfast, however, instead of complimentary evening wine and appetizers we were given a single voucher good for 2 drinks at the bar. The fact that this plan was advertised, yet none of the benefits were truly available was clearly a case of false advertising on both the Galeria's and Hotels.com part.Things did not get any better once we went to our room, the following is a list of problems that we encountered:-Extremely loud noise from the pipes following toilet flushing -Extremely loud noise from the pipes when the show was turned on-Neither A/C nor heater were operational-In-room safe was broken-Had to argue about the telephone charges, even though we were informed upon checking in that all local and 800 calls were free We were outside of Mexico City for a few days and returned on December 31st for a one night stay, the results of which were no better than the previous one. Upon checking in I knew that we would not have access to the 10th or 11th floor, so I requested the breakfast and drink vouchers. Although these vouchers had been freely given on our previous stay we had to request them 3 times before someone at the front test would give them to us. Additional issues on the second stay:-Only 1 bath towel provided, had to ask 3 times, finally went down to the front desk at 1:30 am and waited until they brought them.-Toilet leaked-Again neither the heater nor the A/C were operational. -Had to argue about the telephone charges, even though we were informed upon checking in that all local and 800 calls were freeFrankly I am very disappointed both in the Galeria Plaza and in Hotels.com for advertising services that were a) clearly not available and b) for claiming to be a 4 star property. The only positive is that the staff at the concierge desk and at the cafèŒ… were very good.

<Content>Comfortable place to stay, wonderful concierge! This is a very good hotel, located about 10 min walk from Chapultepec Park and only 5 min away from the metro. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The small pool and exercise room were nice as well. The greatest thing about the hotel was the impeccable concierge service who was always ready to recommend activities (whether the commercial day trips or our DIY activities).

<Content>Ok..but I chose this hotel after reviewing. However, we were disappointed when we were there.Our family arrived around 2:00 pm. We got a room, however, it was not cleaned yet.. I asked to switch another room.. They said there was no more non-smoking room. Thus, we had to choose to either wait until they clean up or move to smoking-room... :(Also, front desk worker told me we came too early... I don't think 2:00 pm is early to arrive...Finally, we got a room, however, the heater was not working and drainage got a problem... :(Next day, we complained and complained thus we got a promise that they would prepare another room for us until we were back from seesighting. Front desk workers are not much friendly...However, concierges are very nice and friendly....It was a good location, however, less than I expect... Zona Rosa is kind of simple ( restaurants and shopping.....) However, it is near to chapultepec park. Our children enjoyed there...

<Content>Great Location The Galeria Plaza Hotel met our expectations in a hotel. It is situated in Zona Rosa (or the pink zone), and very central to many bars - gay and straight. The brick streets are lined with trees and plants that give this area a park-like feel. There are many restaurants in the area (both local and American), which are relatively inexpensive. Many locals walk around at night, so we felt safe by ourselves.The hotel has a rooftop pool with awesome views of the city, especially at night. There's a gym where guests can work out as well. The concierge was extremely helpful, as our luggage got lost. He was on the phone every hour until our bags were located.The cleaning staff is very regemented. If you don't want your room cleaned at 8:00AM, put the door sign out so they won't disturb you.When taking taxis, it is really important to find a reputable stand. And taking a taxi from the airport should be around 150-200 pesos. Try not to get ripped off by all the local taxi drivers.One last thing, don't miss Bazar de Sabado - an outdoor market a taxi ride away that is only open on Saturdays.

<Content>Comfortable hotel in great location I recently returned from a trip to Mexico and I enjoyed staying at the Galeria Plaza. The hotel is located in the Zona Rosa, close to many restaurants, Internet cafes, Starbucks, and a store selling American newspapers. It has the feel of a business hotel, but a leisure traveler like myself would still be comfortable. The hotel lobby has a beautiful bar area. The room was beautifully designed in a modernist style, with black and white furniture, and quiet. TV had CNN International, E!, and a few other English channels as well as many Spanish channels. The room had three phones with two lines and speakerphone. I would not recommend the Internet service via TV - it is expensive and hard to use. The hotel has two restaurants. Service is friendly and professional. Taxis are always waiting outside the hotel. Overall a great experience.

<Content>Excellent hotel in the heart of Mexico City Great hotel in a very good location indeed. The staff is helpful, the rooms are very very nice, the breakfast buffet is just fantastic. Extremely good value for the money. We had a great and relaxing time there and would have loved to stay longer than the 1 night we spent. If ever back in Mexico City will definitely use it again.

<Content>Great Hotel - Great location Having stayed at the Calinda Geneve Zona Rosa during the first leg of our Mexican trip, we decided to try a nicer and quieter hotel while still staying in the Zona Rosa area. The Galeria Plaza proved to be a fantastic choice. The people who work there where all very friendly and catered to our needs. The rooms were nicely appointed and very comfortable. The pool and gym facilities located on the top level were not espectacular but adequate and provided a place to relax and catch some rays. The hotel is within walking distance to many shops, restaurants and night clubs and to all forms of public transportation which will take you just about anywhere you want to go within the city. I have stayed at many different hotels in Mexico City and this one will definitely get my business in all my future trips there.

<Content>Great Location-Friendly Staff Stayed recently at the Galeria Plaza for the first time and I was very satisfied with the staff and the location, it's within walking distance of the famed zona rosa in Mexico City an area filled with restaurants, nightclubs and excellent shopping. I will be coming back to Mexico City in the coming months and I will be staying at the Galeria Plaza once again.

<Content>Very good We stayed there on june 24, 2006 for 4 nights and we loved it.The hotel is in the famous zona rosa pink Zone. The location is good, the rooms were very nice and clean. Maid service excellent. Around the block on Reforma there is a 24hr restaurant called VIPS wich is like a Dennys, very nice, people very friendly. For breakfasts is great. Take the taxis that are at the hotel, they are safe. We also recomend the Turibus which gives you a very detailed tour of the main parts of the city for 100 pesos. You can get off on any of the locations for example El Zocalo (downtown) and visit the historic ruins that were recently discovered or the museums at Chapultepec park, and get back on another turibus for the same price. They go around every 30 min. We found the local restaurants very clean and the Tacos al Pastor the best. We will definetely visit Mexico city again and stay at the Galeria Plaza.

<Content>Great hotel This is one of the best hotels ive ever stayed it. Great location despite the fact that its in the la zona rosa ( pink/gay zone), Great service - room service, restaurant, housekepping - everything. you could leave your clothes on the floor ( we tried it to check) and it would be folded up,and set onto the table and evveryything would be in military position every morning. The tea could be hidden in the bathroom and marked and we would see new set on the table unmarked. We couldnt believe they were that good.And as it was a business hotel, youd get brollies assistin you to your taxi when raining. And the concierge was very helpful. basically there is no where else i would stay when in mexico city and you shouldnt even think of anywhere else either. id give it a 10. You can see a national monument from your room and the city is your oyster. The hotel is great.

<Content>Great place to stay in Mexico City I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Galeria Plaza in Zona Rosa. I have to disagree with the previous reviews of the hotel being 80's. We found the hotel very stylish and pretty. The staff was so helpful and nice, and most spoke English. The room was big and comfortable. The maids were great and we came back each day to a lovely clean room stocked with toiletries and water bottles. The area the hotel is in is very safe. There are police everywhere and the hotel staff looked out for our safety as well. We got a great bargain on the room and loved the location. I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>NIce hotel for good rate My wife and I stayed for three days and enjoyed it very much. Recieved a free upgrade to a master suite upon check-in. Large hotel with many outlets. Service was excellent but the food was average. Most spoke English also. Great location with many bars and eateries close by. The laundry prices are ridiculous though. It is around 6 US dollars to get one pair of underwear cleaned.

<Content>Nice, affordable hotel This is a great hotel with a very convenient location. Although the beds are as hard as a rock, the staff are very helpful, most speak fluent English, and the location and price ($135 average a night) are hard to beat. The modern, dark chocolate decorating scheme is a nice touch, and the water here is purified - which definitely matters and helps keep the cost of all those bottles of agua purificado down. The hotel gouges guests on the little things ($3.30 for 15 mins on a computer with internet, $28 for a five minute cab ride to the Ballet and back), but in the end, its convenience, service and overall affordable room rates make it a worthwhile choice. ~B

<Content>Nice Hotel As opposed to most reviewers of this hotel, I came expecting something extraordinary. I was a bit disappointed. This is indeed a nice hotel, with clean comfortable rooms. The decor is indeed very 80's, though most of the furniture is a bit newer. Roof garden is a joke; it's just a pool and a few lounge chairs on the roof. It is, though, located in the lively Zona Rosa (not recommended if you're with children). Overall a positive experience.

<Content>What a Wonderful Stay! Don't be fooled by the somewhat dated and plain exterior of this hotel. The Galeria Plaza is an outstanding hotel in every way. My partner and I stayed there for four nights, and we couldn't have been more pleased. The best quality of this hotel was the service. All of the staff were extremely helpful and eager to please. In particular, I can't say enough about the maid service. Everyday our room was cleaned to the tee; we even got cookies one day! Our room was delightful. Though our view of Mexico City wasn't stellar, it did not matter because we thoroughly enjoyed our room amenities (what a comfy bed!) and slick modern dark wood decor. The rooftop pool looked great but it was too cool outside to go swimming (Keep in mind that Mexico City is in the mountains.) The rooftop gym was quite adequate and had a beautiful view of the city. The hotel is in a great location - The Zona Rosa. This area has many great shops and restaurants, and the Metro is just a few blocks away. Lastly, the price is right. Check around on the internet. We stay for about $100 US dollars a night - quite reasonable for the outstanding quality of this hotel. Stay at the Galeria Plaza; you won't be disappointed.
