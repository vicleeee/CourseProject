<Content>Where do I put my suitcase? This is a Japanese Hotel not an American Hotel (size wise). Barely room for a second suitcase....barely room to walk around your bed! Yes, tiny tiny rooms...about a foot bigger than Japanese chains I have stayed in and smaller than most Prince Hotels. Nothing special...No extras...your typical HOLIDAY INN Crowne Plaza--nothing extra! Pricey Restaurants. If you do stay here--there are a few breakfast shops nearby...Location is nice---active at night and day....lot's of shops and great Restaurants around. Easy to get to.Last time i will stay at this chain!

<Content>good hotel, super location, superb staff Very convenient for a business traveller to Japan. There is a direct hotel bus from Narita Airport to the hotel - 3000 yen each way, or, some Narita Express trains stop directly in Ikebukuro or, when arriving by Shinkansen from Kyoto etc: get off in Ueno or Tokyo Main station and take the direct train (Yamanote line) to Ikebukuro, a fairly large station. Once there: just look for the Metropolitan Plaza exit and the hotel is 2 mins from the exit! Stayed 5 nights in Oct 08, 12th floor, small, but for Japan decent size room, good bathroom, very quiet, very clean (I had specifically requested a non-smoking room ... probably a good idea in Japan as smoking in restaurants and hotels is still widespread. Breakfast was included as booked early on the web, decent rate of about 20000 Yen / room all inclusive. Buffet breakfast was very good with plenty to choose from including +++ fresh melon, pineapple, oranges, all the usual hot and cold options, all varieties of good tea and coffee / latte / cappuccino. Some chef made a delicious vegetable omlet on request ... The double bed was a bit small (1.4 m wide) and too hard - but the excellent, very friendly, superbly efficient staff organised some more duvets to put on top of the hard mattress to ensure a comfortable night's sleep. We had a few meals in the hotel, although good, they were VERY expensive. There is the Tobu department store right next door which has superb restaurants including a fantastic sushi bar on the 11th floor - much much cheaper. Free fast internet access in the room (though NO WIFI). PCs, Printers etc on the ground floor if you haven't got a laptop with you. Gym / Swimming Pool use possible - but expensive (2500 Yen / visit) I will most definitely come back to this hotel

<Content>Decent hotel This hotel was in a great location with a department store/mall, restaurants and pharmacy all nearby which was great because meals in the hotel were expensive. The room was basic but clean and comfortable. The only drawback was very little English channels.The staff was very helpful particularly at the concierge desk.

<Content>Superb service at this comfortable and well located hotel I stayed with my wife and 16 year old son for 11 days. The hotel is located next to Ikebukuru staion - It is therefore ideally placed to easily visit ALL the tourist areas of Tokyo that you are likely to want to see. The hotel is immaculately clean and our triple room was big by Japanese standards. We were on the 22nd floor and therefore had a stunning view of the city! The strength of this hotel is the professionalism and friendliness of its staff. - Nothing was too much trouble for them! I have travelled widely throughout the world, but I have not experienced more efficient ,polite and friendly service anywhere ! I would certainly recommed this hotel for an one seeking a well located hotel with excellent service.

<Content>Economical with their information This hotel are a little economical with their information. I booked 4 nights through my travel agent in Taiwan  requested at least a double room. My booking was confirmed as a double. On arrival we were checked into what they call a semi-double room. Rather confused i took a look at it  was nearly knocked out by the smell of cigarettes in such a confined space. Semi double means a 3/4 size double bed not a full size one. Now i'm 6ft 6  my Girlfriend is 5ft 10 so you can imagine the difficulties we had. The bed was pressed against a wall from 2 sides. They some how managed to squeeze a desk in there along with a chair which meant one of us had to be on the bed for the other to move around. The bathroom was like a portaloo, it had plastic walls  was quite obvioulsy built into the room with plastic panels. Anything going on in their was fully audible to the rest of the room. I made my concerns  obvious problems known to the hotel reception who just looked blank at me with a  so whats the problem  look. The manager took over  after an hour of wrangling  losing my temper he got my point  moved us to a king size room for an extra 2000 yen per night. Sick to death with their lack of concern or ability to understand why i did not want to spend a night sleeping againt the wall  my girlfriend trying not to fall out of bed i took the extra cost on the chin. Everything else about the hotel was nice, good location  great staff just as long as you do not complain or air your views in front of other guests. Breakfast is a waste of time, save the money  eat out. I have never been given bacon that you can see through, Pretty much everything else was deep fried  cold. Not a pleasant start to the day. They expect about 2500 yen per person for breakfast, total rip off. You would find a bagel from the shop across the road a lot more filling  a much cheaper healthier option. Book only kingsize  above  forget breakfast !!!.

<Content>High Class Hotel Stayed here for 2 nights in their standard double bed room. The rooms are small, but this is typical in Japan. Very clean and comfortable accomodations. Great service.Location is good, right next to the Ikebukuro Station which links you to anywhere you want to go in Tokyo. The subway system is very efficient. There are plenty of places to grab a bite to eat. I recommend visiting the nearby department stores which have many restaurants on their upper floors. If you don't speak Japanese, no problem. Just point to what you want in their display cases.The easiest way to get to/from the hotel from Narita Airport is to take the Friendly Limousine Bus. It costs only 3,000 yen and takes about 1.5 hours. Buy tickets as you exit the customs area. This sure beats navigating the train/subway system with luggage and definitely beats spending your life savings on a taxi.

<Content>Great hotel and location This hotel is located in a great location, 1 block from Ikebukara train station (2nd largest train station in Tokyo). From here you can connect to anywehre in the Tokyo Metropolitan area including a train from Narita airport. The neighborhood is filled with great restaurants and department stores. You can find any kind of food at the TOGO store next to the train station which has food on 4 different floors, 2 on the upper levels (floors 14 and 15 for sit down dining) and 2 sub basements with more takeout counters (several hundred) of every type of cusine, a liquor department, many bakeries and a full grocery store. This is where we went almost evey day to pick up breakfast and dinner items at a very reasonable prices. Note that if you use forks and knives, not all takeout places have utensils other than chopsticks so bring a plastic set from home. Paper nakpins are also in short supply but you get free tissue handed out at almost any street corner in Tokyo so you can use that. The hotel rooms were on the small side, mine had no drawers whatsover, and a very small closet. However the bed was very comfortable and king size, with down pillows and cover, and immaculately clean. I had an empty refrigerator that I could stash all my food purchases in (no mini bar). Hotel has a full health club including an indoor pool that costs about $20 per visit to use, but this includes use of free exercise clothes and shoes, and free classes. Book your room at their web sit to get substantial savings on room costs (my room averaged about $140 per night). Note that if you go to Tokyo you will have to climb lots of staris and walk for miles as the train stations are huge. I averaged about 6 miles per day walking. Signs in Tokyo are in English in the train stations and on major streets, but it can be easy to get lost as the numbering system is totally incoherent and you need to frequently ask for help which locals are very happy to provide. Bring lots of cash as ATMs except for the airport don't take US ATM cards and credit card usage is not that common.

<Content>Loved this hotel! We chose this hotel for our Honeymoon, so our expectations were high. We booked using priceline, and got a great deal on air fare plus hotel. First of all, it was a snap to get to from Narita airport. You can take the airport limosine bus (for the same cost as taking the JR, without the hassle of luggage on the train) from the airport and it will drop you off directly at the Crowne Plaza Metropolitan. The staff was extremely courteous, spoke english well, and very helpful. I had originally booked a standard corner (a bit larger) economy room, but decided to upgrade to an executive king room, since this was such a special stay for us. I was able to do this by emailing them, they responded promptly, and let us pay for the upgrade upon check-in (only about $100 extra per night). The room was absolutely amazing! We had a king size bed, mini fridge (which they stocked with drinks everyday), safe, huge gorgeous bathroom, complimentary robes and slippers (brought fresh everyday), and 2 large windows with spectacular 24th story views of the sprawling city below. We were in love with this room! There was even a tray of fresh fruit waiting for us when we arrived, which was great for two tired jet-lagged newlyweds. These executive rooms were on the exclusive Metropolitan floor, which was accessible only by our room key cards. During our 8 day stay, we used the Ikebukuro station nearby to access the JR and subway, which allowed us to easily get to ALL the sites we wanted to see during our visit. The Ikebukuro station is a major hub, and is a stop of the big Yamanote line that encircles the city. We did not miss out on one thing, and had little trouble getting around, even when multiple transfers were necessary. We even made a day-trip to Kamakura (took about 1 hour on the JR) to see the great Buddha and Hase-dera temple, and had no problem whatsoever (except forgetting our umbrellas!). There are lots of restaurants around, plenty of varieties of food, and lots of shopping near the hotel. The Metropolitan across the street had a huge department store, and 2 floors of restaurants. Be sure to visit the Mos burger across the street from the rear entrance for a truly Japanese fast-food experience! We also found a great restaurant on the last day called Tapa, which was in the basement of a building on a nearby corner. I dont recommend breakfast at the hotel or anywhere, as the cost was high. There are 3 convenience stores nearby that have fresh fruit, pastries, canned coffee, and juice for a light breakfast in your room for cheap. Orange juice was put in our mini-fridge daily. We also picked up beer, bags of chips, rice cakes, sushi, and salads for late-night snacking. The convenience stores are: 7-11, am/pm, Lawson, and FamilyMart. It is expensive enough eating out everyday for lunch and dinner, save your money on breakfast! I recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Tokyo. We had an exciting and adventurous Honeymoon, with plenty of relaxation time in the great room and awesome bathroom (extra deep tub and rain showerhead). It was convenient, the staff was wonderful, and Ikebukuro is an up-and-coming district with a plenty of restaurants and shopping, and a fun night life. Don't overlook this truly great hotel!

<Content>Pricey, pretentious  Everything was spotless  hotel has a luxurious look about it. As expensive as you would expect in Tokyo. Breakfast buffet is good but was extremely pleased mine was included in price or I would have gone elsewhere to eat.Rooms small, but understand this is a Japanese thing, bathroom even smaller, with more buttons on the toilet seat than an airline pilot has to contend with. Gripes:- the place is pretentious  there is a real down their nose feeling from the staff when you make any requests or consultations.- bar is pricey, service picky  a distinct lack of ambiance to the place. Not allowed to stand at the bar (which I like to do).- location is poor  we seemed miles from anywhere. Seedy area but felt safe walking around. The nearness to the station is fine if you want to take advantage of trains, but if you do any hotel daily bus tours you will be picked up first, be on the coach for an hour doing other hotel pick-ups, then dropped off last.If I do Tokyo again (unlikely, if I return to Japan I would stay in Kyoto!) I would certainly not stay here.

<Content>Exceptional hotel This is an exceptional hotel, with an exceptional level of quality and service. Several onsite restaurants, free Internet (bring a cable), and very convenient to the Yamanote line train. Located right next to the Ikebukuro station, you also have more food than you could hope for.Rooms are very spacious, for Tokyo.However, given that it's a Western branded hotel, expect to pay more than you should.If you want a real deal on a Western hotel, book a local Japanese Western-style hotel, like the Bellclassic one station over in Otsuka. These hotels are usually harder to track down on your own, and usually are built to cater to the Japanese wedding industry, where western style hotels are the vogue. But the prices are fantastic and the service on par with what you'll find here, and most such places have everything the business traveler needs

<Content>Great Hotel Don't be put off by thinking that this hotel is far from the centre of Tokyo. The local train station is at the end of the street and the journey to Tokyo main station takes about 10 mins.The hotel itself is up to the usual high standard of Crowne Plaza, I couldn't find anything to complain of during my visit.The area of Ikebukuro is an extremely busy area with plenty of shops to keep you occupied during the day and hundreds of small restaurants to discover at night.Having said that the area is short of traditional Japanese sightseeing opportunities so you have to use the train for those.

<Content>Nice hotel, ok location This hotel was pretty good. It wasn't the cheapest, but certainly was worth it for the quality of its rooms and the location. It is right next to a subway station, so you can pretty much go everywhere in Tokyo with that. Also, it's situated near a large department store (forgot the name) and a whole bunch of other shops. There is a convenience store right across the hotel, perfect for picking up snacks and breakfast items. The rooms themselves were immaculately clean; they were small, but that is the case with all hotels in Japan. I would definitely consider this hotel the next time I visit.

<Content>Great hotel at a great price! Great hotel in a great location. Rooms are a bit small but I suspect all hotel rooms in Tokyo are small. The room was immaculately clean though, and the staff was wonderful. Although the concierge we dealt with knew very little English, we appreciated her effort in trying to answer all our questions. Located just southwest of Ikebukuro Station, the hotel is only a short walk (2-3 minutes) away from the all-important Yamanote Metro Line. There are also many western-style restaurants west of Ikebukuro Station, while there are many local cuisine choices east of the Station. There is also a delicious ramen stall inside the Station. There are also lots of great shopping choices in Ikebukuro. We found that we could dine and buy items at cheaper prices in Ikebukuro than in other districts such as Ginza or Shinjuku or Shibuya. The best thing about this great hotel was that we paid only 89250 yen (which is about $815 USD) for six nights (including a Friday and Saturday night) from 01/28 to 02/02 on japanican.com. That is about $135/night and that price INCLUDES all taxes and fees! I would totally recommend going over to japanican.com and looking at the Crowne Plaza . One last thing, other reviewers have mentioned the free internet at the hotel but that is no longer the case. However, internet use was very reasonable at 100 yen (about 92 cents) for 15 minutes.

<Content>Handy Location The Crowne Plaza I found to be in a very handy location, with Ikebekuro station just next door, plenty of shopping and some good bars and restaurants in the vicinity. Staff were very good and the free high- speed internet access was terrific, with plenty of terminals to choose from. It doesn't take too long to get into the downtown area.

<Content>Okay but a bit out of the way Stayed as part of a family holiday at the Metropolitan. Rooms were adequate for Tokyo and Japan in general. Like everywhere else in Tokyo, get your snacks  drinks from convienence stores within a minute's walk or from vending machines.The breakfast buffet was plentiful and we were glad that it was included in our room rate. Go early as there may be queue by about 7:45 or 8 am. The Ikeburo area as mentioned is quite chaotic and not really touristy so get the name of the hotel in Japanese if you plan to wander around the area or are coming in via the subway atation. The area is also northwest of the rest of Tokyo so its a bit further away but well served by many subway lines.

<Content>Nice hotel, staff very helpful  I booked a special deal through Japan Travel Service at a very good rate and was given a deluxe room. The room was on the 19th floor with views of Tokyo  Mount Fuji, and was clean and nicely decorated, but very small - perfectly adequate for me so not a problem, but if this was deluxe I wonder what a standard room is like? Otherwise, very nice, very large hotel with a good selection of restaurants  bars in-house, although they are a bit pricey - cocktail bar/restaurant on 25th floor is nice with good views. The staff were exremely polite, friendly  helpful (as were most of the Japanese people I had contact with). Hotel location is good - a few minutes from Ikebukero station, which is a major station - TIP: there are many exits, so take the one at the end of the platform marked 'Metropolitan Exit'. Ikebukero is a very busy area with lots of shops, restaurants etc. and is not a tourist area so you may struggle to be understood in English, but as I said, the Japanese are very helpful  friendly so just have a go at communicating and you'll get by (be brave, try speaking some Japanese - it's really appreciated!) - also, many restaurants have picture menus, so that helps!. Ikebukero is not right in the centre, although you can easily reach everywhere by the efficient train service.Tokyo tips:Be careful of the cyclists on the pavements(sidewalks).On escalators, stand on the left/walk on the right (opposite to UK).Beware - taxi doors open automatically.In toilets, you may find heated seats (a surprise when you sit down!) and many buttons at the side - DO NOT PRESS ANY UNLESS YOU ARE SURE WHAT THEY DO!!!! ;-)

<Content>Friendly, clean and very well located hotel I stayed 10 nights at this hotel in May and June 2006. I was very pleased with the service. First of all - I have prepaid the stay with the tariff that restricts any changes or cancellations. Due to the illness I had to change the reservation, and despite the fact I was not allowed to they were very flexible and agreed to that. In JAPAN (!!!), where flexibility is usually close to zero (!). The location of the hotel is very good - just next to Ikebukuro metro, which makes it easy, to access any location within Tokio. A hint: from Narita Airport DO NOT use metro nor train - take a very convienient bus, that is timely, departs straight from the Arrival Terminals and leaves you in front of the hotel door.The rooms are tiny, but very clean and well equipped. Service is fine, they are helpful and trying to advise whatever necessary. What I did not like - it is a pretty big one and therefore a bit crowded, which results in some waste of time at reception desk. Nevertheless - good location, helpful staff, I will consider to stay there again once in Tokio next time.

<Content>Convenient, Very Nice and Accomodating Booked my room through Rakuten.com (English). The room was very convenient to the Ikebukuro train station, a 3 minute walk once you find your way to the correct exit. There were 3 of us and the room had 3 separate beds which took up much of the space. We were on the 12th floor. The room was standard but only used it for sleeping. It had all usual Asian hotel amenities as well as free internet service in your room or down in the business center. The service of the front desk was very good like most of Japan. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants as they seemed a little pricey for the buffet, $42 for dinner and $23 for breakfast, and my wife is quite picky. We did try the pastry shop in the hotel which was very good and reasonable. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance. In addition, we found the department stores all have a very large food stalls, vendors that one can eat fairly cheaply with wonderful choices for all tastes. The Tobu Department store is located within the train station. Lastly, great props to the hotel for allowing us to leave part of our luggage as we left Wednesday for Kyoto for 2 nights and didn't want to transport everything. We re-packed four suitcases into one suitcase, a backpack and a small Sportsac and left 3 suitcases at the hotel. The good thing is we missed the typhoon when we went to Kyoto and when we returned the weather was hot, humid but clear. We picked up our luggage actually 4 days later on Saturday and the hotel didn't mind at all. I asked if I owed them anything for the storage and they said no. That's an indication of the service you can expect in Japan.

<Content>Perfect stay in Tokyo, look nowhere else HiWe`ve stayed in Crowne 22-26 August 2007. From this forum pages I knew the hotel is under a constant renovation - yes the pool is not finished yet, neithe are some floors. 1/ In our booking we mentioned accomodation on the renovated floor which was met without delay or reminding. We were on the 15th, non-smoking. Check-in swift and efficient, staff speaks english pretty well, they are helpful and understandable.2/ Room. Not as big as of Crowne in Jakarta, but enough spce for 3 of us and luggage, even at the window there is resting area with table and cushions. Everything new and working. As a tee-making facility they have a nice small metal kattle and tiny oven.3/We didn`t book breakfast or any other meal, there are plenty eateries around the hotel, prices are affordable and much lower in the comparison with the hotel ones.4/ Location. Simly perfect. Ikebukure is one of the major stations in central Tokyo and cross point of 3 or 4 lines. Obtain a suica card and travel easily.

<Content>great room my husband and i stayed at the metropolitan for two nights in early august. we paid $135/night, which was more than we wanted to pay, but hotels in tokyo are generally not cheap.i'm really surprised at people on trip advisor who say that it's not quite a 4 star because i think it is, and i'm finicky. true, the hotel isn't great to look at from the outside, but who cares? there is a lot of hotel staff and everyone was super attentive, polite, helpful, and professional. the hotel serves a lot of business people and it's always very busy in the lobby. when we checked in, i asked for one of the remodeled rooms and it was great. very clean and modern, though small like a lot of asian hotel rooms. great bathroom with a bidet toilet. i had family members who stayed at one of the un-remodeled rooms and they said the rooms weren't great and the carpet was pretty worn, so just make sure you ask for a remodeled room. i'm sure that all the rooms will be fixed up by next year. there is a room by the lobby where you can access computers and the internet at no charge.oh, and don't eat the breakfast buffet. the food is expensive and mediocre. there's a great, upscale all-you-can eat shabu shabu restaurant within walking distance near seibu (sp?) dept. store but i can't remember the name. it's near uniqlo and beams.the metropolitan and its surrounding area is very busy and chaotic, so be warned. if you want peace and quiet, go somewhere else.

<Content>nice place in Tokyo Nice hotel in a nice place of Tokyo, near the subway and near plenty of malls. If you cross the street to the metropolitan building and go up to the 7th floor U have plenty of family restaurants at nice prices.We had reserved this hotel because of the pool and when we arrived the pool was under construction, they should have noticed that point when we reserved !!Bad point is the breakfast, expensive, the eggs are COLD and if your kids do not drink tea or coffee but drink hot chocolate U have to pay a supplement (after having payed the breakfast buuffet). We travelled all around the world and it is the first time that happens !!!!The concierge is very bad for answering questions about tourism.

<Content>Great place to stay We found this a very comfortable hotel and reasonably priced for Tokyo. We had booked for three and no third bed was made up but the hotel sent someone to do it immediately and apologised twice for the oversight. The location was very convenient to the JR line and there were plenty of places to eat at on the streets nearby and in the Metropolitan Plaza opposite. The room was very clean and comfortable and a nice quiet place to have a rest in during the day after tackling the Tokyo crowds. The staff were polite and helpful and advised us that there may be construction noise beginning at 5.30 am but we didn't hear any. We'd definitely stay here again.

<Content>Questionable My wife and I stayed 4 nights at the Crowne Plaza Metropolitan in June 2007. The room was extremely small and dingy. This was my first trip to Tokyo so I don't have anything to compare the room size to from Japan, but this seemed to be exceptionally small given what we paid. We did have a great view on the 23rd floor though. Another positive was the free broadband internet access in our room. It appears that the hotel has only recently come under the ownership of the Crowne Plaza, so hopefully some upgrades are coming.

<Content>Experienced no problems. Spent five nights there (in one of the nicer refurbished rooms.) Don't believe the bickering, there were no major problems. I might agree that it's not quite a 4-star, though, especially as they've switched out the minibar for vending machines by the ice machine.And believe me, spend any amount of time in Tokyo and you'll be very, very happy that your hotel is right on the Yamanote circle line.Oh, one warning: Don't believe the directions you get from the front desk. I was given very precise directions to exactly what I didn't ask for more than once.

<Content>This Hotel is Great Thanks for the reviews. It certainly helps me to make the right choice. My family of 5 stayed in this hotel in late May. The hotel is nice  clean (though it looks a bit old from the outside). It has a direct airport transfer right to the sheltered lobby  guess what? it was pouring when we arrived. My 3 large lugguages were transferred from the coach to my room with no hussle. The staff is helpful  thoughtful. We got 2 connecting rooms  was allowed to check-in earlier (1:30pm). The room is comfortable  clean. It has an automated toilet bowl  a heated mirror to clear the shower vapour. The hotel is located near the west entrance of the train station which is less crowded as compared to the east entrance which is pack  very happening. Overall, it had been a great stay, And if for any reasons you do miss the Singapore food, we happened to come across an eatery that will satisfy your needs. It is called Daichinoki Singapore located at Shinjuku-ku, Takadanobaba 2-14-16 Meiho Blg 1F, Tokyo (about 5 mins walk from Takadanobaba station). The friendly chef and lady boss would be more than happy to serve you some of the familiar dishes in their cozy little restaurant.

<Content>Very nice The hotel is in a nice area of Tokyo. The lobby and public areas are nice, staff is very friendly. Rooms are small, clean and comfortable. The TV is limited to two English speaking stations, CNN and BBC news. There is pay TV if one wants movies. Good views are afforded from the higher floors of this 24 storey hotel. I did not eat at the hotel, as I found the prices to be somewhat high. Breakfast buffet was about $25.00 U.S, there are other places to eat in the area.

<Content>City but not so city Located very close to the Train station and the main JR line so very conveinient. Hotel has 2 entrances with a number of restaurants and an observation/restaurant/bar. 24 hour free internet is a bonus. Lower floor rooms are quite small and the smoking rooms are really smokey! Higher floor rooms are bigger and refurbished. I found reception tried to hard to be efficient so made themselves unefficient. The conceirge is very helpful though and efficient with baggage. Safe deposits are in a locked room next to reception and the currency exchange counter.

<Content>Okay for 1 or 2 nights, anymore go elsewhere Stayed 6 nights, 2 adults  1 child.Room size - well I have been to Japan before but this was barely live-able for 6 nights. The room consisted of three single beds and a tiny closet. OK for 2 adults staying 1 or 2 nights, any more go elsewhere. Reservation was wrong, they only listed 2 adults and we had to wait for them to install an additional bed in the room (good thing I had the original confirmation or they were going to charge me extra). Severely overpriced restaurant so never ate here.Platinum benefits/recognition - NONEThey give all PC members drink vouchers - we got 3 - but when we tried to use them at the tea lounge we were ignored. lets see - only2 tables occupied, 2 staff who saw us and ignored us while we were waiting by the wait to be seated sign for at least 5 full minutes. This was the only place in Japan I have ever had bad/no service.

<Content>Great Value This hotel is a great option if you want to be out and about exploring Tokyo. The staff are courteous and helpful even when it's busy - and most of them speak English. You need to learn how the subway works to get around Tokyo and the concierge will be more than willing to help you figure it out.The hotel is simple but clean and almost completely upgraded. Just steps outside the hotel are shops, restaurants, and fast food if you don't want to eat in the hotel (I think it's expensive). The subway station is almost adjacent to the hotel which was GREAT - you walk out your door, hop on the subway, and you're at your destination. The hotel is not super central but since it's so close to the subway, and some shopping and food it is good value. It's in a safe clean area as well.The only minor down side was that there is no gym (and the pool is seasonal), and the rooms can be quite small.

<Content>Not bad, but upgrades are not completed... I stayed here recently for 6 days. The location, near the Ikebukuro Station is very convenient- there are a lot of places to shop and explore, many restaurants, all within walking distance. I didn't go to any of the in-house restaurants as a previous poster stated, they are quite pricey. The Business Center with the computers and printers for guests was not bad, and the in-room free Internet was quite fast. Note: despite what others may have posted, NOT ALL THE ROOMS ARE UPGRADED! Only about 1/3 of the floors are upgraded. While the non-upgraded rooms are not by any means bad, they are a bit dated and worn (circa 1990s). The room I had was a standard double- one night in the non-upgraded and the rest in an upgraded room. The upgraded rooms are very nice- deserving of the 4 star rating. The double bed rooms are tiny, though. We could barely fit 2 26 suitcases and had to use the table as a second luggage rack. There is no desk. Otherwise, it was quite comfortable. I also saw the 2 twin-rooms and their size is better-suited for 2 people. The double rooms are probably best for solo travelers.Overall, this hotel is a great value for Tokyo. The staff really do try to be helpful. If they ever get around to upgrading all the floors (not sure if this is planned), then this would certainly be one of the best values in Tokyo.

<Content>Good value, But First the good points. For what you get in Tokyo, this hotel is a good value for the money. I don't like to list what I paid because rates change all the time. However, for the dates I was there, the rate was good compared to other hotel's rates.The hotel is located in the Ikebukuro area of Tokyo. Not the top area, but plenty of shopping and restaurants around and centrally located to take the JR trains or Metro subway around tokyo.All the rooms will be upgraded by February 9th so they are all clean. The hotel employees are all friendly and very helpful.High speed internet is FREE!This hotel is one of the stops for drop-off and pick-up for the airport shuttle express.Now the bad. The room designs are just strange. The room size of the two single beds was bigger than the room with the queen bed and both at the same rate. (Check it out on the hotel web site) The room with the King bed is listed as the same size as the single beds but cost more. Even though I was traveling alone, I of course booked the single beds room.Big mistake! Decent size room, except the beds are the hardest I have slept on outside of China. (If you like hard beds, then this is a good point) After two nights I couldn't stand thinking I had three days to go. I asked for a room change to the King size bed because I saw the double size bed room, and it was indeed to small. They upgraded me without charge. (Another good point) While this bed was better, it still was the hardest outside of China. The big problem is even though the size of the room is the same larger size like the single beds size, it has a lot of wasted space, making it seem smaller than it acutually is. Shame on me for forgetting to take pictures. The writing desk is useless because its built into the wall and has no room to fit your legs under. There is a small round table with two chairs I was able to use for my computer. However, what's the point of a writing desk you can't use. The breakfast Buffet comes out too almost $22.00 U.S. Way overpriced for a Crowne Plaza. Never tried it. Many places for breakfast across the street at the Metropolitian Plaza.So it's up to you. I would stay here again depending on my budget. I'm taking a final blowout three week vacation and am saving my money for nicer hotels in the cities where they would be much cheaper than Tokyo. One further point. I don't want to sound like a stuck up traveler and I know many people don't stay at a lot of hotels every year. HOWEVER, PLEASE do not call this a 4 or 5 star hotel! Crowne Plaza's are ritzed up Holiday Inns. 3-31/2 stars at most. (Unless there's one out there I don't know about. Very possible) Anyhow, this hotel does NOT have a concierge, seperate shower, turn down service, etc. Nothing wrong with that though, it's not supposed too.5 star hotels are Ritz Carleton's, Four Seasons', Peninsula's, etc4 star hotels are Westin's, Shereton's, Hyatts', etc. (Though depending on franchises, they can be higher or lower).Thats my rant for now.

<Content>Excellent value, location! As far as hotels are concerned in Tokyo this is superb value for such a high standard. Location for me was the best!. Whether its shopping, dining out ,its perfect and far cheaper and less commercial then other areas like Shijuku but still accessible on the subway (across from the hotel) to other locations. You'd be mad to eat in the hotel as its expensive and there are plenty of restaurants a stone throw away. Shuttle bus took 90 minutes and brought us directly to hotel. Don't take a taxi as its exceptionally expensive!! While the rooms were small we had a lovely room with a glorious view of tokyo. Hotel staff were exceptional! Absolutely loved Tokyo and will be staying here again.

<Content>Great Tokyo Option Great hotel at reasonable prices- have stayed at a number of 3-4 star hotels (although think this is more a 5 star) and found this the best value for money to date. Very comfortable king bed in a large room. Nice bar on top floor made more affordable by the drink vouchers offered on check in ( I guess from reading that is only for Priority Club members). Got excited about visiting the hotel pool till we were asked to pay 2000Yen each for entry but this tends to be standard practice in Tokyo hotels.Good location on Yamanote line although a little far from central Tokyo - be sure not to miss the last train as cab fares from Shibuya/Rappongi are expensive! A lot of restaurants close by even a few with English menus - at worst it is only matter of pointing to the picture or, in some, the plastic representation in the window. Limousine bus service to the airport arent too frequent but closeness to rail station made the Narita Express via Shinagawa a convenient transfer option.A great Tokyo option

<Content>I like it Staying 2 nights for 3 person at Jan23, I found the room was clean, spacious and quiet (at least I couldn't hear other's toilet sound). Well located, just minutes from the Ikebukuro Station. And have so many dept stores, attraction and food stores neaby, Tobu, Seibu, Plaza, Parco, Tokyo Hands, Sunshine City, Toyota show room (just seen a very good drum show at the G/F).Same to all hotels in Japan, no matter what digits you entered, the temperature is always the same (HOT), at least the window of this room can be opened a little bit. Strongly recommend.

<Content>Great Location, small rooms The Crowne Plaza Metropolitan Tokyo has a great location, being right next to Ikebukuro Station (in the north-east of Tokyo) and a 2-min walk to either Seibu or Tobu department stores. The service was excellent, but the rooms were quite small as i was expecting in a tokyo hotel. The decor in the room was outdated but i didnt mind that much. The washroom is pretty simple equipped with a Japanese-[--]toilet. When booking make sure to apply for the Priority Club (free) to get a free welcome drink (coffee, coke or even champagne) and late check out. Overall a good hotel, 4-stars by North American standards.

<Content>Great value and great location This is a great hotel and the location is really good for travel throughout Tokyo - its literally beside the train station. The rooms are on the small side but very well appointed ( recently renovated). There are numerous restaurants nearby and all very reasonable. SEBU and TOBU department stores a 5 minute walk. Staff at hotel have limited english but not a problem they are very helpful.
