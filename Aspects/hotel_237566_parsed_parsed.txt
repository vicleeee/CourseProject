<Content>Christmas at the Owl My wife and I stayed for six nights at the Owl over the Christmas holidays and we enjoyed it very much. Very nice room at the back of the hotel, great staff, friendly and informative, nice being in a quiet Amsterdam neighborhood so close to everything. A modest breakfast buffet, but they do have Corn Flakes, in addition to meats and cheeses and fresh bread for the toaster. The Owl took care of us very nicely.

<Content>Wonderful hotel but bring your ear plugs We felt very welcome and comfortable right from the beginning. All reception staff were great and more than ready to answer any questions we might have had. Room was comfortable, quite spacious, well appointed and very clean. Breakfast, although continental was also quite good, particularly coffee which was excellent. Breakfast available until 10.30 which was also nice. Good location, near to trams and nice restaurant area. Lovely park nearby too. Shuttle from airport worked well.However on the minus side lighting in room at night was dim and bedside lights were a strain to read by, which we like to do. The bedroom walls are also paper thin and so you are disturbed by other room sounds. Anyone running a bath/shower or using a hair dryer could be doing so in your own room. Also all doors seem to have to slam to close. So unless you are a really early riser or a really heavy sleeper, the noise factor will be quite a problem.

<Content>Fantastic Little Hotel :) Had an amazing stay at the Owl Hotel. Its a small place in a great location, really central with all amenities and transport links close by, but its in a really quiet and sweet street. The staff were great, so helpful and friendly. The rooms are small but are all you need... Comfortable, safe, clean and warm. Lovely bathroom, comfy beds with extra pillows on request, and a safe in the room which is free of charge.Breakfast was lovely, a good choice.Overall, excellent value for money.We really enjoyed our stay here and highly recommend it!

<Content>Nice little hotel i the heart of town My wife collects owls and when we planned a three day trip to Amsterdam, it was natural that the Owl Hotel caught our eye. While that was interesting enough, it was the reviews on TripAdvisor that decided for us. We were not disappointed.It is in an excellent location, on a quiet street in the center of town, hardly a ten to fifteen minute stroll from the major museums and the entertainment and eating places of the Leidseplein.You can get there easily by tram from the Central Station, if you don't mind a ten minute walk with your baggage. For about fifteen euros a taxi will drop you of at the door.The complimentary breakfast, is a small but nice spread, served in a room overlooking a little garden, where it would be great to sit when the weather allows us to.Its a small hotel but neat and clean with all the basic facilities.The staff were very friendly and helpful.The safe in the room is at ground level inside the wardrobe. Lying flat on my stomach I couldn't read the instructions. Fortunately, they have a lockers at reception where you can keep your stuff.While you cant make coffee or tea in the room, the drinks at the bar are reasonably priced.If you carried a lap top, wifi costs three euros for an hour, (compared to six euros for half an hour at the place we stayed at Antwerp). If you use the hotel's computer, internet is complimentary.We really enjoyed our stay at the Owl Hotel and while leaving my wife was happy to give them an owl to add to their small collection !!

<Content>Great location, terrific value, excellent staff The Owl is a super little hotel with great staff in a terrific location just 3 minutes walk from the Leidesplein. Very close to the major art museums and a canal bus stop. The room was tiny, but I've heard that's the case with most rooms in Amsterdam. They could use better pillows I'll say, but for the money it was a fantastic 4 night stay.

<Content>Excellend location We have just returned from a weekend at the Owl hotel .This hotel is lovely. Very clean, tidy and quiet. It is just 1 minute walk from Leidsplein in a quiet street (behind the Marriot hotel) and 2 minute walk from the museums. Very convenient for sightseeing in Amsterdam. I have visited Amsterdam for 1 night with my brother and we chose this hotel through the trip advisor reviews. The carpets are brand new, and the room is of good size. We paid 130 Euros for 1 night for a room including breakfast which we thought was of excellent value. We were not expecting much for breakfast but is a lovely continental spread with cheeses and different breads. Overall I would say this is probably a good option for sightseeing in Amsterdam and an absolute must .I am recommending this hotel for a basic stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>Very nice hotel We have just returned from Amsterdam and stayed at the Owl Hotel.The hotel is off the main road and takes a minute or so to walk to Leidseplein and a little longer to the museum quarter (Van Gough etc)The staff at the hotel were really helpful and polite; there were 14 of us and we arrived early but were allowed to go into our rooms (except one) as they were ready.Breakfast was really nice with a small selection of cereals, Meat, yoghurt and bread. Tea/Coffee machine.There are no tea and coffee facilities in the rooms but that didn't bother us.The rooms varied in size ours being slightly smaller than others and were all exceptionally clean, all rooms had a safe.The hotel had a lovely secluded garden with tables and chairs.The hotel bar was really cheap - bonus!If I return to Amsterdam I will definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Author>Tavistock
<Content>A very good hotel in excellent surroundings I spent at the Owl Hotel 10 nights in August. My friend and I shared a twin room on the second floor. The room was spacious and comfortable, it had a big window overlooking a pretty garden, some trees and a nice building. Everything was clean and worked properly. We had a tv set, a desk, a chair and an armchair, a wardrobe. In the bathroom there were both bathtub and shower, towels were changed every day (if we wanted so), a hairdryer was provided. Of course our room was cleaned every morning.The breakfast room was big and looked out onto the same pretty garden we could see from our window. For breakfast we had a wide choice of hot and cold drinks, different types of bread, jam, spread, cheese, ham, cereals, etc. In short, not a cooked brakfast (except for hardboiled eggs) but a really substantial one. The staff were kind and helpful. The people at the reception were always ready to help everybody with advice on places to go, where to rent bycicles, the weather, etc.In the hotel there was also a small room with a pc provided with free internet connection, a bar and a nice common room with a tv.The location was just great. That part of the town is very close to the city centre and the canal belt, but it's quiet and beautiful. Trams 1, 2 and 5 stop near the hotel (all three of them go to the Central Station). You could easily reach Leidseplein on foot (5-10 minutes). In the surroundings there were all kinds of restaurants and shops, at least two supermarkets and two places where you could rent bikes. Moreover, the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum and Vondelpark were nearby. I have only one minor complaint: in my humble opinion the directions provided on the hotel website aren't very clear. In fact, before reaching the hotel we got lost several times. As for the price of the room, it wasn't certainly cheap, but I think it was quite fair, considered what we got, a good room in a lovely hotel in a convenient district of Amsterdam.

<Content>Nice Hotel Stayed at the Owl for four nights with my husband to celebrate our Ruby Wedding. The hotel is in a good position, very clean and the breakfast is OK. Its very easy to get a bus or tram just over the road. On arriving at the airport we got tickets to Centraal Station then the number 5 tram and got off at the Van Gough Museum. We got lost for a while, your landmark is the Marriot Hotel, the Owl Hotel is in a side road by the Marriot. Going back to the airport we got the 197 bus wich runs every 15 minutes. the stop is over the road from the hotel. Amsterdam can be very busy, this hotel was very peaceful.

<Content>Lovely Hotel A very nice hotel set in a quiet side street just a few minutes walk from the Leidesplein or Vondelpark. You can also get either a 1,2 or 5 line tram to or from Centraal station or to Dam Square very easily. The staff were very welcoming and were always happy to help or advise about Amsterdam. I stayed in a double room with my girlfriend which was a decent size and ensuite. The breakfast was good and the hotel has a nice lounge area. There is a free Internet connection if you just have to find out how your football team did at the start of the season (they won)! If you are looking for this star rating/price of hotel then I thoroughly recommend the Owl Hotel.

<Content>tiny with charm Made the mistake of booking a single room. Should have gone for bigger. Room felt like a closet. Really really tiny. Shower was extremely small too though I am a woman of average size. On the plus side, lovely staff and outside patio. Nice breakfast. Free Internet a plus. Nicely located near museums, parks, and tram access nearby. Would probably stay at the Merriott next door next time, will lose the charm but gain in space.

<Content>great hotel Just back today from 3 days staying at the owl hotel.,celebrating couple of b'days. Had a great time. Hotel was in a great location. Close to the Leidsplien and other main streets. Rooms were fine - (some nicer than others), but all were cleaned every day. Staff were always pleasant and helpful. Bar prices very good. Little terrace was lovely for sitting and relaxing. Breakfast was very good with a choice of cereal, various breads, ham, cheese, eggs, fruit salad, juice + a selection of teas and coffee. This hotel will definetly be my choice of hotel when we plan our next visit to Amsterdam.

<Content>Owl a Lovely Experience We arrived in Amsterdam early Monday morning after completing a wonderful 14 day transatlantic crossing and were greeted with sunny skies and temperatures in the high 70s as well as it being a national holiday. Amsterdam was buzzing with activity. We arrived at the hotel around 9 am and well ahead of check in time, but the hotel personnel were so gracious and kind and stored our luggage for us while we went exploring until our rooms were ready. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, although there was no air conditioning. The bathrooms were very nice. Things got a bit warm but kept busy during the day and tried to only be in our rooms at night when it had cooled down. We could open the windows and get a lovely cool breeze. The breakfast was quite lovely and ample, and sitting out on the cool and pretty terrace was very pleasant. All of the staff, and especially Marina, were very helpful at all times, arranging for a large van pick us up when we checked out on Thursday, helping us get dinner reservations, and in general making our stay quite comfortable. The hotel is very conveniently located to everything and in a very very quiet neighborhood - as opposed to the very dirty and noisy central area of Amsterdam. We are very glad we picked this location and this hotel. Price-wise it was very reasonable and I would not hesitate to recommend it.

<Content>Splendid Arrived from Paris about mid day, had little trouble finding 'The Owl' from Centraal. Check in was a breeze. Room was clean and manuverable(sp). Fairly nice view out the window. Elevator quite small, Folding cage door will bite you if not paying attention. Hotel near the splien and many decent restaurants. Transpo is pretty tricky though.Had afternoon drinks at the Owl. Very liberal. Breakfast next morning, very tasty. Management went out of way to take care of our laundry.The Owl was more than what we expected :-)

<Content>Good This is a good deal for Amsterdam where rooms are notoriously small. Rooms here are spacious and not over-priced. Trams 1,2 and 5 from the main train station 'Amsterdam Centraal' all pass within 200 metres of the hotel. Alight at Leidesplein as other reviewers mention. There is free internet in the lobby and a decent breakfast each morning. One tip is don't stay in room 27. It's above the internet room door which also leads to the stairs guests on the first floor often use to get to their rooms instead of using the lift. I heard this door a lot at night so moved to room 37 and all ok. Reception staff excellent. I'll stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel Great Price We stayed at the Owl Hotel for two nights in mid April while waiting to board a river boat. The hotel was an exceptional deal in a great location. We arrived around 11 AM and our room was ready. Recommend room #26. Bright, airy and overlooks the garden. The included breakfasts were typically European with cereal, juice, cold cuts, pastry, toast, hb eggs, and great coffee.The hotel also had a small bar for a late afternoon beer or a night cap. Plenty of restaurants around for meals, and a short walk to Leidesplain. If we get to Amsterdam again and need a hotel, we will definitely stay at the Owl.

<Content>The Owl Is A Hoot The Owl is the place to stay in Amsterdam unless you have Euros pouring out of your pocket and price doesn't matter. After spending considerable time looking for a hotel under 100 Euros a night and still wanting a good location with good to excellent Trip Advisor reviews, I found The Owl. I am SO glad I did.The location is within walking distance to the Leidesplein, the Museum District, Tram stops and the Canal Boat office. The neighborhood is safe, quiet and classy.The staff were great, helpful and friendly. And they are always available at the bar the hotel has if you want a good night Heineken for 2 Euro before bedtime!I had a single room which was fine. The bathroom is small, but so what? In a single room you can keep the door open, though it will close if privacy is needed.To sum up, The Owl is a deal and a very enjoyable place to stay in the wonderful city of Amsterdam.My stay was 5 nights.

<Content>Stay at the Owl! What a wonderful little hotel! My husband and I were very impressed with the staff. Everyone was very helpful with directions and suggestions. Breakfast was simple; toast, eggs, coffee, tea, milk and cereal but it was included in the price of the room. The dining room looks out over the back garden. The bar is really just an extension of the front desk but there are a couple nice couches and chairs to relax in. Our room was very clean and had plenty of room to unpack our things for a long weekend. The double bed was on the small side and it would have been nice to have more than one pillow each. The cable tv had muliple English language channels. The walls are a little thin...we could hear our neighbors arguing at 2 a.m. The hotel is located near a tram stop but is within walking distance of just about anything for two young adults. If you have children it would be quite a hike to the Anne Frank House or to the Royal Palace. There are plenty of good restaurants nearby including a fabulous little Italian place called La Cucina De Cesare that is about 4 blocks from the hotel. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful hotel and great location The hotel is in a very good location close to many of the attractions but in a quite location in a side street. We are a family of 5 and had one double room and one triple room. The rooms are all recently refurbished and extremely clean. The bathrooms are quite small but newly refurbished and clean. Breakfast is downstairs with a good selection of cerials, meats, cheeses, bread and fruit. It is enough selection for a hearty start to the day. We were delayed one day due to being fogged in at London Heathrow and the staff did not not charge us for the first nights accomodation which they were entitled to. At all times the staff were freindly and helpfull. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great littel hotel Owl Hotel was a great find! The location is fabulous - tucked away in a quiet littel street yet within 5 mins walk to Leidseplein. We had the quad room which was the biggest room in the hotel according to the front desk, so there were no space issues fort us. We had a king size bed, 2 single beds (double-decker), an LCD TV and a tiny coffee table with some chairs, and the room was still spacious. The rooms were always clean. Didn't notice any smoke smell (unlike Holiday Inn Heathrow). The dining and lounge setup was really cosy and they had a beautiful Christmas tree- so eveything felt really homey and cosy. Unfortunately for us the weather was much too cold for us to sit outside in the patio - it must be quite lovely in summer!Breakfast was more than substantial - 3 kinds of cold cuts, 3 kinds of bread, 2 kinds of cheeses, boiled eggs, biscuits, a variety of cereals, fresh milk and cream, coffee, tea, hot choch, orange juice. Absolutely spoilt for choice!Don't miss their little collection of owl figurines by the computer - they provide free internet access so another plus point! Don't hesitate in booking Owl Hotel for your stay in Amsterdam!

<Content>Smoke smell was prevalent everywhere. The staff was very nice but I was there with 3 children, and am a non-smoker. People smoked at breakfast, in the lobby, in the hallways and the room smelled like an ash tray. The room was otherwise pleasant (two singles with a bunk bed, a little table with three chairs and a desk and chair, with plenty of closet space). I wish that I had been informed of the smoking. Great location.

<Content>Good, but small rooms too depressing I have stayed at the Owl four different times and it is a fine small hotel really. Like most stays, however, the overall quality depends on the room. The first two times I had a courtyard room with a full bed, the last two were tiny rooms with a single bed by the wall, a stucco wall at that, one that will scrape your arm at night. There was no room at all and as for the tiny bathroom, you could not do #2 without ducking under the sink (sorry, but that's the truth). Lord willing, I am going back to Amsterdam this January and at first was in auto-pilot mode to go back to the Owl. I emailed them requesting a room, but did not hear back. So I kept checking other options and decided upon another hotel, who assured me I would get a nice room with a double bed overlooking the courtyard.The Owl does have a nice breakfast and complimentary internet and computer usage. Just ask for a bigger room unless you are sure you are okay with a tiny room with a single bed by the wall.Oh, and it is in a great location near the Vondel park and the museums.

<Content>Good value, good location The family-run Owl is an old favourite of ours and it did not disappoint. We stayed for 4 nights (third year in a row) in a large family room. Twin beds for adults and bunk beds for children. The staff are always friendly and helpful. Small lounge/bar and breakfast areas are very good. Buffet breakfast is always well-stocked and frequently replenished. Could do with a bit more variety (fresh fruit and yoghurts perhaps) but was good enough for the price.The room was fine. Bathroom a bit small and my sense of smell detected that a smoker had been in the room recently. However, this is the Netherlands and in smaller hotels exclusive non-smoking rooms have not necessarily caught on. Furnishings are ok but perhaps getting a bit dated.The hotel is in a quiet side street (there are a number of hotels in this road - more spring up each year) and it is a matter of a few minutes walk from the Leidseplein, park and museums. The tram for the station is also very close. For my young family it is far away from the bawdy side of life that tends to blight certain areas of the lovely city, especially near the station and with the proximity of the restaurants and facilties at Leideseplein the location takes some beating. The Owl has character and is worth considering for a short family break.This is not a budget hotel but we found the facilities and location to be very good value at the price.

<Content>Good hotel, good location. The Owl Hotel is in an excellent location in Amsterdam. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are very clean and well serviced. The buffet breakfast is very good. The double rooms are small and there is not a lot of storage space. If you are used to a large bed you will find this a problem here. There is no airconditioning and this could be a problem in the summer months.

<Content>A gem in Amsterdam We found everything was as beautiful and clean as it is on the website photos. Great location, a short walk to streets of restaurants, the major museums, a boat trip ticket office and some of the most beautiful canals. The staff were really friendly and always ready to help. The rooms were made immaculate each morning and the beds were very comfy. At breakfast there was a large variety of things to choose and a lovely breakfast room which overlooks the garden. Sitting in the patio area for breakfast or any other time, was a pleasure because it was well cared for. Considering how close you are to all the activity, the garden was a tranquil place to sit. If we went to Amsterdam again we would stay here.

<Content>Lovely little hotel My boyfriend and I stayed at the Owl from 24.06.07 to 30.06.07.This was my eighth visit to Amsterdam and we decided to try a different hotel, we were very pleasantly surprised. The staff are all very friendly and helpful, the cleaning staff are brilliant. Our room was cleaned and made-up one morning after we came back from breakfast!! They keep the place lovely and clean, the reception, lounge and breakfast areas are very pleasant on the eye and everything is really chilled when you go for breakfast which is a great relief from the craziness of Amsterdam.The breakfast does not offer enormous variety but it is very good and everything is very fresh and tasty, it set us up perfectly for the day.They have a free internet service next to the breakfast room where you can have a quick check up of emails, etc on their PC. This is a first for me and a great little service.There were a couple of minor things that need slight repair in the room but nothing that would spoil anybody's holiday. For example, one of the sockets did not work.Yet another great visit to Amsterdam, will no doubt be back next year and I will definitely consider staying in the Owl again. Oh, and try the Toro Dorado grill restaurant on N.Z. Voorburgwal for a great meal, I've been a few times and have overlooked mentioning it before! Oriental City is a lovely Chinese too!Stay at the Owl, you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location We spent 4 nights in the Owl Hotel Amsterdam in June 2007. We picked this hotel because of it's location and favorable reviews. We were not dissappointed. The location is excellent, nearly adjoining Vondel Park and close to canals and the centre yet very quiet. This small hotel (34 rooms) is very clean, tidy and friendly. The staff went out of their way to be helpful and pleasant. The included breakfasts were an added bonus and good enough we were never tempted to go out for breakfast. The rooms were smallish as is the norm for hotels of this class in Europe but modern and spotless.We had a great time!

<Content>Not the best of experiences! We were recommended to the Owl Hotel but clearly the standards differ considerably. The Hotel is very clean and well cared for downstairs and most of the staff were pleasant. My experience of the sleeping accommodation left a lot to be desired. I found the double bedroom to be incredibly tiny with a small rail to hang clothes on but not a single drawer or shelf to put any clothes away. We were there for 5 nights and I can tell you it was a most unpleasant experience. No tea or coffee facilities in the room or in the Hotel other than at breakfast time and the latter had no rolls or croissants - the bread appearing to be from a packaged loaf. We went in the bar a couple of times but one night the receptionist/barman clearly couldn't be bothered to serve us and he claimed the bar closed at 1am. When we pointed out that it was only 12.55am he reluctantly served us. At 1.20am a group of 8 other guests returned to the Hotel and very surprisingly he served them alcoholic drinks. Before retiring to bed I enquired about the licensing laws and although he told me the Hotel Bar closed at 1am, I was left with the impression that you could have drinks after that if he could be bothered to serve them!I believe that the Hotel is OK for an overnight stay but certainly not for any longer. We shall certainly return to Amsterdam again but definitely not to this Hotel.

<Content>Small rooms but great location We stayed at the Owl for 5 nights in March. It was myself, my wife, and my three small children. We had arranged for a quad with an extra cot as bed 5. The room would have been small for just my wife and I, let alone the five of us. Still it was quite clean, and efficiently cleaned every day.We arrived at around 9AM and were pleasantly surprised when our room was available. With three small kids with jet lag, this was terrific and I will always be thankful to the Owl.Breakfast needs to be expanded. The breads are simply slices from a packaged loaf, no rolls, nor croissants. There was no yogurt and the fruit salad seemed to be from a jar. It would also be nice if they kept the coffee machine on 24 hrs for self serve.There are few amenities at the hotel. No shampoo in the rooms, no coffee in the rooms, no minibar nor refrigerator, no cable TV.The location is fabulous. Can't be beat!!!!!The staff was efficient and appropriate but I wouldn't say overly friendly, But not rude nor unpleasant, either.I would stay at the Owl Again but I would probably look around to see what else is available first.

<Content>Fly in for a good value room Stay here! Ok, you鈥檙e not going to be blown away with sharp design and a funky interior, but the whole hotel is spotlessly clean, recently redecorated and has a rather unique feel to it. Plus each member of staff we met 鈥?be it the guy who runs the place or the young man who worked the night shift, were beyond brilliant, knowledgeable of the city and super-helpful. The rooms are roomier than I thought they鈥檇 be. The bathrooms are spacious with a powerful shower in the bath. The breakfast is buffet style 鈥?help yourself to as much cheese, slices of meat, boiled eggs, cereal, fruit, tea, coffee, waffles as you can manage. It鈥檚 centrally located to the main touristy stretch and one of the main squares. Just remember, a taxi from the airport to the Owl Hotel should be around 30 euros. Pay much more than that and you鈥檙e being taken for a ride (quite literally). We paid almost 40 euro 鈥?we obviously looked like tourists! The hotel has a tiny lift. Somewhat of plus considering the tall, steep stairs that every building seems to have. Sadly we only had one night in the city but will return and will stay there. For the price, it's faultless.

<Content>Small and friendly I stayed here with my father back in Feb 06. Everything was clean, the staff were friendly and it's very well located for the Musems. About 15 mins walk from the centre of Amsterdam but enough shops, bars, etc to keep you entertained along the way.

<Content>a small hotel with excelent staff My husband and I stayed here for a week several years ago, and I still remember it fondly. We stayed for 1 night in the Marriott nearby, and then moved to the Owl. We were living in Germany at that time and had driven our car to Amsterdam - not the best idea in hindsight . The Marriott parking garage was full the night we stayed there and they had said they could not help us, even though leaving a car unattended on the street in that area was an invitation to having it broken into. The next day the folks at the Owl impressed us by recommending a good parking garage for very little $$, calling the garage, and making sure our car got there. The rooms were small to really small, but the staff more than made up for that by being so nice to us the whole trip.

<Content>Great Location We stayed in the OWL hotel over a week beginning Oct. 17. When we arrived just after 8 in the morning, we were told our room would be ready in 30 minutes and we were invited to sit in a lovely sitting room with television and view of the patio. We were offered and accepted tea. Check in was quick and we were shown to our room. It was nice and clean. There was cable television. The bathroom was adequate and clean. We just were not accustomed to using a hand shower head, but adjusted. We enjoyed having free breakfast each morning. It was delicious and served in a wonderfully warm setting with clean linen and china. The staff of the hotel was accommodating, extremely polite and smiling no matter what time of day or night. The Owl is in the midst of the great museums. It is just a short walk to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum. It is also a very short walk to Leidsplein and public transportation (the Trams). Restaurant row is only blocks away as well. The hotel also has a computer for those who wish to check emails.The hotel made our trip to Amsterdam fantastic!

<Content>Cute hotel in a good position The hotel is in a fabulous position for exploring, but without being too close to the loud and busy square and bars in this area - a 5-10 minute walk gets you to hundreds of restaurants and bars. The reception was very nice and friendly - and our room was ok.It was small and a disappointment to start with - but we soon got used to it.....at least the small bathroom was clean. The decor was tired and we discovered a plastic bottle under our bed which was not a great indication of cleanliness....especially at the price of the rooms.That said, we would consider going there again if we went back to Amsterdam as it was nice, and you could do a lot worse!

<Content>Cute Hotel!! The Owl Hotel, located on a quiet looking street behind the Marriott and in the museum district of Amsterdam, offers amenities we've not had before in Europe. It has a comfortable reading room and a great garden patio. We (five adults) had two rooms, both of which were of adequate size and clean. The bathrooms were large. One of the rooms had a screen shade that allowed us to keep the window open on the warm nights without worrying about bugs. The included breakfast was good and the staff helpful. They also provided a fan to help us compensate with the abnormally hot weather Holland was experiencing. The only drawback was the Friday night noise level, especially in the street side room. (On Saturday night, noise wasn't a problem--go figure!!)

<Content>Nice location, great value. My 12-year old son and I stayed at the Owl, and were very pleased.I had done my research through Trip Advisor and travel books, and the advice I got was correct: The Owl is a nice, quiet place in a central location for sight-seeing (bike rental place was very close). The front desk staff was extremely helpful and kind, and the room was simple, clean, comfortable and quiet with a pretty garden view.Breakfast was good, if basic, but not for coffee-lovers. We overslept once and got down as breakfast was being cleared, which was very frowned upon. Don't be late!!!

<Content>Loved the Owl! My husband and I stayed at The Owl at the beginning of May, and would recommend it to anybody. The rooms were fairly small (which is expected in Amsterdam) but spotlessly clean and comfortable. There is a small bar area joined onto reception, serving reasonably priced beer. During our 3 night stay the bar was very quiet and meant that the staff had time to chat and make you feel at home. The hotel also has a lovely patio to the rear, we had lovely weather and it was great to be able to sit outside in the peace and quiet. The Owl is situated on a residential street, and is quiet and out of the way of the main hustle and bustle of the Leidesplain, while being within easy walking distance. It is in a brilliant location. So a lovely hotel with friendly staff and in a great place, we鈥檇 go back any time and wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to recommend it.

<Content>Superb Hotel is superb with a welcoming atmosphere, very helpfull staff and a lovely breakfast if a little basic. Rooms are very clean and tidy with fresh linen every day and we had a superb view of the garden. The only problem with this hotel is the distance to the heart of the city. Nearby is the Holland Casino and the Irish bar (one of many) also a hard rock cafe, but too get to Dam square, the red light district and rembrant square which are the main social areas they are quite a walk so i reccomend the trams or bikes. but overall i strongly reccomend this hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel, no problems This hotel is a nice compromise between a chain hotel and an older hotel with more character closer to town. We had a nice, short stay at the Owl during a 24-hour stopover in between flights from US to Africa. The room was nice and clean, if a bit small. The breakfast is good (except for the coffee) and the staff very polite and helpful. One nice thing is that there's a bar in the hotel if--by some chance--you are unable to find suitable nightlife in Amsterdam.

<Author>hmmmmm
<Content>doublebooking fiasco, but nice and polite staff I probably am not in a position to write a review of the hotel itself beause I did not get to stay there due to the doublebooking fiasco which the Owl staff had to make up by moving us to another hotel across the street (Liedse). We got SO unhappy when we heard the news from the receptionist. Well, I am not a nice person when I travelled all the way from London, dragging our suitcases all the way to the hotel to be told I can't stay there!! The receptionist was very polite, and he was truly sorry for the doublebooking fiasco because of the hotel.nl website's bug or some sort of glitch on their website which let us reserve the Owl's room when it was actually overbooked. Normally I would not be a nice person when encountering a situation like this. And yet, the way the receptionist was sincere in his apology, as well as fair and efficient in the choice of the alternative hotel, I more than forgive the otherwise terrible mistake in the booking system, and wanted to give the Owl some credit for its ability to damage control with care for the customers. Well, of course if they really cared they wouldn't have that online glitch. But I think it was more than compensated by the way they handled the mistake and accident.

<Content>Great Hotel Great hotel, easy to find if you follow the directions in easier posts. We had room 26 which was of ample size for our needs.Great breakfast, but no toaster - tip - if you ask the staff they will make you toast. The staff are really helpful and all speak excellent english.If you forget things like adaptors etc, ask at reception, they have a box of items you can borrow. I really liked this hotel, it is in a quiet location and our room overlooked the little terrace which is lovely for sitting in and having a quiet drink either before a night out or at the end of a hard day sightseeing.

<Content>Great value and location We requested room 26 as was suggested in other reviews and it was a good size space for a couple, with an adequate bath. It faced the interior courtyard (I imagine summer dining takes place there)and thus was very quiet even when street construction started one morning. The buffet breakfast was more than adequate with ample choice of breads, beverages, cold meats, cheeses, and a variety of spreads. Also boiled eggs, yogurt, cereal/toppings and fresh fruit. As Amsterdam is a relatively small city, the location is very good as we walked to Leidseplein and beyond to shop for food or clothes/gifts; visited major museums nearby and caught a wonderful photo exhibit at the small FOAM gallery. The hotel has a computer with internet which you can access for 15 minutes per one euro. The main door is locked at night but the receptionist is always near the desk to let you in. The staff were all accomodating and helpful including giving us restaurant tips. We would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great Value Hotel. Me  my wife saw in the New Year at the Owl Hotel and found it a great value hotel. Ideal location near Leidseplein, helpful staff  tasty continental breakfast. Our room (54) was small but spotlessly clean and looked out the side of the hotel - a nice view of Vondel Park. For a clean hotel in a good location at good value, you can't go wrong.

<Content>good location but bad room Owl hotel is very close to leidsplein and holland casino. Few steps from voldelpark and museum plein.The room was VERY small and no facilities inside. The window was broken and the wind entered (-2c掳). the heating was under the window. Bathroom was very poor and the towels are old.The included breakfast is in dutch style.It was quite expensive for a three star hotel.

<Content>A Gem! My boyrfriend and I stayed at the Owl Hotel for three nights last month. I booked this hotel after reading about it on this site. The price was right, location seemed ideal, and there was availabilty. We arrived at the hotel late in the morning, and were pleased to learn that our room was available. Yes, it was rather small- but it was clean and featured everything needed for a restful stay. I can't say enough about the location! We walked to almost everything. The major museums are a couple of blocks away, and there's a tram stop just minutes from the front door if you need to go a bit further. Breakfast was great- the room was cozy and inviting, and the spread was yummy. Last but not least, the staff was friendly and very accomidating! Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to AMS.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We stayed at the Owl Hotel for two nights in October having read reviews on Trip Advisor. Our two sons had a twin room at the front of the hotel, and our double was at the side. The front room was a good size, although the bathroom light was not working, and was not fixed whilst we were there. Our room was pretty small, but both were spotlessly clean and functional, so unless you are planning on spending a lot of time in your room (which most visitors probably are not) then a small room is not really a problem. The staff were friendly and very helpful (although the waitress at breakfast did not look too happy!), and the breakfast itself was very adequate. Having read in another review that it was tricky to find, we made sure that we had a good map to start with, headed for the Marriott and had no trouble finding the hotel. I would definitely recommend this Owl - it would appear that it is also very good value in an expensive city. Would go again.

<Content>Highly Recommended! My husband and I stayed at the Owl Hotel in late Sept 2005. Based on another tripadvisor.com reviewer's comments, we reserved room 26. What an excellent recommendation! The room was a good size and quite clean. The bathroom was immaculate. Our room faced the hotel courtyard so we were able to open our window at night for the cool breeze without worrying about street noise.The hotel is in an excellent location. However, it is a bit tricky to find. From the train station, take tram 1,2, or 5 to Leidseplein. Head towards the Marriott. Walk along the left side of the Marriott (past the Club Med). At the corner of that street, turn left and you will see the Owl Hotel. The area near the tram stop is very busy with shops and restaurants (there is also a laudromat within walking distance for those on long trips). But the hotel is tucked away on a quiet street so you should have no problem getting a good night's sleep.The room rate (we paid 115 Euros) includes a typical European breakfast (fresh bread, cheese, meats, jam, tea, coffee, and cereal). The hotel staff was very friendly and provided excellent service. The next time we visit Amsterdam, we will be sure to stay at the Owl Hotel.

<Content>Owl Hotel - wonderful This is a really great place to stay.A really quiet street just behind the marriott.The rooms may not be large but they're more than adequate and very clean. the bathroom was spotless. The only problem was the shower wasn't quite powerful enough. Breakfast room was spacious and there was plenty to eat.I'd highly recommend this hotel and won't hesiatate to stay here again.

<Content>Good location We stayed here in July 05. Difficult to find at first it's behind the Marriot Hotel. In a really good location, not in the middle of all the noise but just a few minutes walk from the activity.Our room was v. small as we had our baby with us plus a cot plus a buggy! We asked to get moved to a bigger room as we were there for a week, that was no problem and got a lovely bright room at the front of the hotel. Friendly and helpful staff.Breakfast consists of cereal,bread,cheeses,hams and a lovely chocolate spread! We would definitely go back here.A clean,cheap,basic hotel in a nice area beside Vondel Park.

<Content>Just short of Great After reading all the superlative reviews, we eagerly booked two nights at the Owl. It was somewhat less than what we had expected. On the plus side, the staff was very nice, and the location is fantastic. As several other reviewers noted, the rooms are very small, so we were forewarned. The breakfast, much vaunted in other reviews, was only slightly better than average. It was above a continental, but only barely. My other complaint is probably just a matter of personal preference, but the pillows were HARD. If you are used to a little give in your pillows, look out. All in all, the Owl is probably a cut above most other smaller hotels in Europe, but only by a bit.

<Content>A very nice boutique hotel I've been to Amsterdam four times since 1984 and have stayed at the Owl each time. It is a very nice and accommodating hotel. The owners continue to upgrade the quality of the building and the service and are always very helpful when addressing my many questions about AMS and the surrounding area. The hotel is very centrally located, but is a bit hard to find at first. It's behind the Marriott Hotel on the Stadhouderskade.

<Content>small room but nice visit I stayed at the Owl Hotel for 8 nights recently. My room was tiny, and as it was very hot, it sometimes felt even smaller. (I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this room was the smallest I have ever stayed in) But the hotel was clean, safe, and in a convenient neighborhood which is more important than the size of the room. My room was cleaned and vacuumed every day, the bathroom was immaculate and I had fresh towels every day. The breakfast was excellent and a great deal given the price of breakfasts elsewhere! The staff were friendly and helpful.

<Content>Owl Hotel is wonderful We stayed at the Owl Hotel for 4 nights in May/June 2005, and we just loved it. Our room, (a standard double - two single beds pushed together) on the top floor at the back of the hotel, was not large but it was bright and clean, with a modern desk, wardrobe, colour TV, and a spotless bathroom that was positively huge by European standards! The room also had large windows which we could open, as well as a retractable window shade. We had a nice view down to the hotel's little patio and garden below. It was a pleasure to be able to access the garden from the breakfast room - made it feel like we were visiting someone's home! The staff were polite and friendly and were always willing to answer our questions. Our room was cleaned every day and new towels, etc. put out for us. The classic Dutch breakfast consisted of bread, cheese, various cold cuts, coffee and tea, fruit juice, cereal, fruit salad, and boiled eggs, all of it tasty and plentiful; definitely filling enough to fuel our walking trips through Amsterdam! We particularly liked the location of this hotel - close to the Leidseplein in a quiet, treed neighbourhood, yet within easy walking distance of the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, Canal Boat Tours, the Holland Casino, and Vondelpark; trams were also available just a few minutes away near the Leidseplein. If you stay at the Owl, be sure to say hello to their friendly kitty cat, Puck. He's a real charmer. All in all, we found the Owl to be the perfect spot from which to explore Amsterdam, and we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Liked the Owl We stayed at the Owl Hotel in May of 2005 based on some user reviews and guidebooks. It seemed as though Amsterdam hotels were on the expensive side, so Owl seemed reasonably priced for what you'd be getting (125 euro). I was kind of bummed about not staying on a canal, but those hotels were more expensive and hard to come by. It's located on a quiet street close to one of the last canal rings. It was very easy to get to from the airport, taking the train and then either tram 1 or 5. The staff was very nice and helpful. The breakfast had nice selections and took place in a pretty room that has an outside patio as well. The hotel has a computer with internet that is helpful. Our room had a double bed that was comfortable, big windows, and a nice, clean bathroom. It was on the second floor, so I'd probably ask for a higher one if you can. Overall, I recommend the Owl for a stay in Amsterdam. Quiet, clean, comfortable, and well priced.

<Content>The Owl-a great find Just returned from a 11 day stay in Amsterdam's Owl Hotel. Very good room rates. The owners and staff were extremely helpful, pleasant, and professional. The hotel was very neat and clean throughout. The room cleaning and tidying up were very efficient. My wife and I highly recommend this very cozy family run hotel.

<Content>Owl met all our needs Husband and I stayed at the Owl four nights the 3rd week of February 2005. We arrived at the Hotel after a long overnight flight from Cairo and knew our room wouldn't be ready at 0830 hours, so we just hoped to be able to leave our bags. Wonderfully our room WAS ready, and it was spotless.The bathroom (room 26) was more than spotless, with a powerful shower and lots of hot water. The room size was moderate, but we spent little time in our room. The double was two twins pushed together, but that's not that uncommon in most non-chain smaller hotels we've stayed in in Europe. The location was wonderful, away from the noise of the center of the city, yet close to the museums, Leidesplein (and the trams). We walked everywhere and found wonderful restaurants nearby.Breakfast was fine: bread, cheeses, eggs, meats, coffe, juice, and cereal. Certainly enough to get your day going.We would certainly stay at the Owl again if we're lucky enough to get back to Amsterdam.We took the train from Schipol Airport to Centraal Station for just over 3 Euro per person each way and then hopped either the number 1, 2, or 5 tram from Centraal Station to the stop near the Marriott Hotel. The Owl is on the block behind the huge Marriott.

<Content>Good location, great breakfast! My wife and I stayed at this hotel in early Feb 2005. The rooms are standard european size (read: small), but it was very clean and provided all the amenities. The staff was friendly and helpful.They serve the best breakfast you'll find in Europe. It actually had eggs! Overall a great spead!The only complaints I have are that it was a little hard to find (tucked away off a street that is currently under some construction) and they're website doesn't provide very clear instructions. Second, was that the 'double' room came with 2 seperate twin beds pushed together. Thsi would have been fine but they each had their own bedding so it was like my wife and I were sleeping in seperate beds (which we were...). These arn't show stopper issues however, don't hesitate in booking this hotel, we'll be staying there again next time we're in Amsterdam.

<Content>Great, quiet location, but near the excitement! My wife and I stayed at the Owl in mid-December 2004. As we walked from the tram stop, we were surrounded by the hustle and bustle of a very busy part of town (the casino, restaurants, etc.). But as we made the final turn onto the Owl's street, suddenly all was silent. It was just a quaint, quiet residential street. The hotel itself is similar. Typical European, compact room but very clean. Typical Netherlands style breakfast in the dining area. Easy walk (even in winter) to the major museums, etc. Overall very pleasant and a reasonable price. We will almost certainly return.

<Content>Fantastic location, lovely hotel! We stayed at the Owl over New Year, and found it to be a great all round hotel, very friendly staff and excellent location! As we were in Amsterdam (what a great city!) over New Year, we wanted to be in a location that was near to all the action, but not too near that we wouldn't sleep at night! The Owl was within minutes walk to all the nightlife and restaurants in Leidseplein, but in an almost residential area, so wasn't noisy. The shower in our room wasn't working initially, but we were changed without hesitation. We only made it down to breakfast once, but it was nice with eggs, cold meats, cheese, cereals, juice, coffee, tea etc. I highly recommend this hotel and hope to be back some day!!

<Content>Just Great I've just spent six nights total, 4 nights in a double room and 2 in a single, at the Owl Hotel. It was just great. The rooms were clean, with private modern bathrooms, lots of heat (important at this time of year) and the beds were really comfortable. The location turned out to be perfect as well and was easy to get to by tram and was in walking distance to the major museums and just about everything else really. The breakfast was good and the breakfast room looks out on to a nice garden. The staff was great too. Very helpful, kind and courteous. It is a small hotel tucked in behind the giant chains and has more of a residential feel. There is also an old black and white cat in residence who likes to spend time mingling with the guests. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to those looking for an alternative to the larger hotels.

<Content>Good Value Hotel I spend five nights at the Owl Hotel in October. Simple but clean rooms. Bathroom has a tub and was clean. Try to ask for a room facing towards their garden. Breakfast includes a selection of hams, cheeeses, breads, cereal and juices. Perfect for starting your day right. The staff is very helpful. The location is close to the museums and 4 minute walk to public transportation, shopping, restaurants, and bars. About a 25 fun walk to the Dam Square. Priced at a very reasonable rate given high hotel prices in Amsterdam.
