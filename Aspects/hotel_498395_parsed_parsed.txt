<Content>Friendly Hotel We stayed in this hotel for one night on a transit to Australia. The staff were very friendly and always willing to help. Check-in  check-out were quick. We were given a room on the ground floor just next to the restaurant. We thought we would have problems with noice but we had a peaceful night.The standard room was small in size, but the room  batthroom were very clean. All the basic items were available in the room. As you know, hotels are very expensive in Singapore so I can't complain about the room size. It's more than adequate for one night stay. The breakfast was basic. Although our connecting flight at 6pm, we had to check-out at 12 as per the hotel policy. Otherwise, we had to pay for an extra day. On checking-out at 12 noon, the staff kindly kept our luggage in a safe place in the hotel. They also made some suggestions to spend our spare time i Singapore. In addition, they also arranged a taxi for us to go to the airport.We are happy with the hotel and the service we received.

<Content>Nice hotel....noisy location We stayed at Hotel Perak for a few nights in November. The staff at reception are very friendly and they were very accommodating with our requests for a quiet room.Our room was very small but it was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was also very small but everything worked as it should.On our first night at the hotel we went to bed at about midnight but were unable to sleep due to the night club that is just around the corner. At 3am we went down to reception and they very kindly moved us to a ground floor room that has no windows. This room was much quieter.The breakfast at the hotel was very nice and staff serving breakfast were friendly.Overall we had a nice time at the Perak and the problems that we had were not the fault of the hotel but rather due to the location. We felt that prices for the Perak were quite high..but again this is not the fault of the hotel but down to the demand for accommodation in Singapore.

<Content>A small but comfortable lodging The staff aren't the friendliest, so expect to carry your suitcases up three flights of stairs at 3am in the morning. It's not rudeness, just Singapore style stand offishness.My wife says the bed had the hardest mattress she ever slept on, but I loved it. She called reception and got new softer pillows, though, so was placated for the few nights we stayed there.Air conditioning works well, and for someone who likes the cool, I loved it as an oasis in the midday heat (we ventured early morning and then late afternoon/evenings). They provide a fairly basic breakfast, as you'd expect from a small and quiet hotel.The actual rooms are very small, but clean and comfortable.Overall, a lovely colonial feel, and smack bang in little India, which is a wonderful location. The MRT stop is only a few minutes walk away, to explore the rest of the city.We'd stay there again.

<Content>Great Value in Singapore We had a great stay at the Perak. If you're looking for a hotel with more personality than your typical chain and don't want to stay with a bunch of rowdy kids on break, it should work for you. Note that rooms are on the small side. We followed Lonely Planet's advice and requested room 302, which faces the street and is their biggest outside their triples. We paid a lower rate and got upgraded to it when we arrived and no one had booked it. If they have it, get it. Staff was helpful, if a tad professional. Bathrooms were clean, but again, don't expect a claw-foot tub. AC worked fine. Little India neighborhood was interesting, as you were away from the skyscrapers and heavily-touristed Chinatown, but felt like you were in cool place of its own. Noise of mosque didn't bother us.

<Content>A Real Gem This is really a gem of a place. Reminded me a lot of quaint BnB's in the UK. The place is really value for money. The rooms are nice although a little small. Very very clean though. The reception and sitting area is very pretty and pleasing to the eye. Breakfast menu is limited but good and cooked fresh when you want it. I thought it was a good place and will recommend it to anyone. The location is also quite central althought the nearest MRT is a bit of a walk but nothing to impossible. Nice, lovely place.

<Content>Nice hotel, but do not rent the loft rooms/apartments We stayed here for 3 nights with our family with 2 kids aged 4 and 5 on a stopover on our way to Bali. Before we had kids, we had stayed here a couple of times in standard/superior rooms. As we were looking for 2 bedroom accomodation, which is very hard to find in Singapore!, we were happy that the Perak Hotel could provide us with a loft apartment with a little kitchen with 2 bedrooms. It costed SGD 415 (roughly EUR 200) per night.Even taking into account that Singapore accomodation is very expensive, we found the value for this accomodation okay, but we had some problems.On the positive side, the loft was rather large. On the negative side, almost all light bulbs were not working, almost no water came from the shower and the hotel's archive was being kept in the loft! Also, the kitchen was very minimal and the service not too friendly.So next time, I prefer to rent 2 interlocking normal rooms at this property.

<Content>2* room at 4* price The bathroom is the size of a match box, the sink doesn麓t have a hot water tap, the shower is separated from the toilet and sink by just the shower curtain, the toilet doesn麓t flush (although they did fix this) and the whole room smells badly of damp. In the room there is a note from the hotel advising guests to tread lightly as the creaky floorboards can be noisy for the rooms below. The people above us must have missed the note as the racket of the floorboards - which really were excruciatingly loud - kept us up every night till 2am and then woke us at 6am. Not sure if the hotel is next to a restaurant kitchen but the smell of Indian cooking would filter into the room and was very overpowering. If we paid for a budget room then it would have been ok but we paid SG$174 per night hoping for something a bit nicer and were bitterly disappointed.Pros - Free wifiCons - Everything else

<Content>Loved the Perak Hotel! We absolutely loved the Perak Hotel! We stayed there for one night in August 2008. The rooms are on the small side but look lovely (hard woorden floors, great eye for detail, huge television) and the location is great. We walked to a bunch of sights in Singapore from the hotel, which was very doable. The breakfast is pretty great too! Great assortment of bread, cakes, jam and even peanutbutter. Not a huge assortment of eggs and so on, but I didnt really miss that. Last but not least: free internet at night, a decent book exchange and free luggage storage.Especially considering the price (we paid 198 singapore dollar for a superior double- the standard doubles only have a skylight, no windows) its a very good choice and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Singapore!

<Content>Great Location and Value The Perak Hotel is a very pleasant, inexpensive hotel. The hotel is described in one travel book as a backpackers type of place, but this was not our impression at all. Our room, although small, was very clean and comfortable, and had a good TV and a small refrigerator, plus a very clean, small bathroom. The bed was firm and the room was furnished with some interesting pieces of furniture. The air-conditioning worked well, which is not a small thing in Signapore. The breakfast was quite good, with toast and fried eggs, fresh fruit and yogurt and cereal. Also, there was a free internet computer station. The front desk personnel were efficient and helpful, and offered us a glass of fruit juice when we arrrived. When we needed an early taxi to the train station, the front desk person arranged it quickly. The whole place is clean and well-run. Note that the rooms are at different levels of comfort, and we stayed in a deluxe room, which is the most expensive. I do not know what the other levels are like. However, our room was a very good value for expensive Singapore. This hotel is located in Little India, and is reasonably close to a subway station, as well as good Indian restaurants and shops.

<Content>The rudest staff I have ever met!! I live in Asia and have travelled loads in this region but have never come across a hotel that were SO unhelpful. My friend booked it as a little change to the budget style accomodation we had previously been staying in. We moved from a very friendly budget hotel in Singapore to the Perak Hotel, which turned out to be a huge mistake.I was shown the room and the amenties within that room when I arrived, when I tried to use the safe I found that I was unable to open it. I called downstairs to ask for some help where I was told to read the instructions. I explained that I have already read the instructions and would appreciate some help the lady on the phone groaned and said ok. When she arrived at my room to assist she was extremely truculent and apeared bothered by my request. Later that day I asked one of the staff to turn the temperature of the ac unit down as I was too hot. He scolded me in a very loud voice saying 鈥淭he temperature of the room is fine, it is hot outside. It will go down later鈥?When I told him that I thought he was very rude and that I certainly didn鈥檛 appreciate being shouted at. He chuckled and said he didn鈥檛 shout then left the room without adjusting the ac.Later in our stay we returned to the room to find that the cleaner had thrown out a large stack of wedding photographs that belonged to my friend. I went downstairs to find out what happened,only to be told by the gentleman behind the desk that it was 鈥渘ot his problem鈥?he said he wasn鈥檛 the manager and could do nothing about it. He also said that if you left your belongs on the floor then they would be thrown out.(The photos weren鈥檛 on the floor) What was very confusing was the actual garbage in the room wasn鈥檛 removed during our entire stay! I asked to speak to the manager on the telephone, a request that was of course refused. Eventually the produced a cleaner who denied throwing out any photos but as he couldn鈥檛 speak any English and I couldn鈥檛 speak Chinese I was unclear about how much of the situation was undersood by him. I definitely wouldn鈥檛 go back to stay in this hotel nor would I recommend it to others.

<Content>Do not stay at this hotel For a hundred quid a night I did not expect to be shouted at and treated like a second-class citizen.My friend and I had 2 nights in singapore and decided to splash out and spend a bit of money.Every member of staff was rude and unhelpful and we would have laughed, were we not paying a lot for this privelige.I left photos of my wedding out in the room and the cleaner threw them away.When I was very upset and asked reception for help the duty manager said 'It's not my problem' then when i asked to speak to the manager he refused to be put on the phone.This hotel is run by cowboys.GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Cosy and close to all It's hard to find budget accomodation in Singapore and Perak was reasonably priced compared to other hotels. Just inside Little India near a few backpackers places. Staff very accommodating and friendly. Rooms were clean and were serviced daily with fresh linens, towels etc.Our only gripe is that we didn't seem to get any hot water in the shower. This wasn't a major issue as it was always hot in singapore but just a bit of warmth in the shower would have been good.

<Content>Disappointing It's a pretty little hotel and it's in a good location with good access to the metro on the airport line and the other sights of Singapore. But the negatives outweighed the positives:- It was an absolutely tiny room. Two people might fit - but not with luggage! - Noisy. Oh my goodness so noisy. Our upstairs neighbours were checking out 4.30 am so for over an hour from 3.30am it sounded like a herd of elephants trampling on our ceiling. - Customer service was lousy. Very unfriendly staff who made us feel like we were interrupting them when we checked in. Also, I rang the desk at 4am asking if they could ask our upstairs neighbours to be a bit more quiet but their response was 'they're checking out soon'.Fine if you've got nowhere better to stay but I'd say look elsewhere first.

<Content>Cozy place A very nice place with friendly staff, we felt at home immediatly. There were refrigerator, coffee-making facilities, big mirrors, good beds and a nice little bathroom where they chanced towels every day when they cleaned the room nicely. Futhermore it is situated on the edge of Little India, which is at cozy and inexpensive neighbourhood.The breakfast was not so big, but it was there, and okay.Also remember, the price for a room is very cheap.

<Content>Great stopover hotel I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on a stopover and was reasonably impressed with the rooms and service, although I noticed another customer seemed to have trouble checking in. Rooms were lovely although wooden floors meant you could sometimes hear others walking around. I would recommend this hotel for those on a budget who would prefer something different to the average chain hotel. The location is fine for getting to attractions as the MRT is just down the road.

<Content>Good value in Little India We stayed a couple of nights en route to Lombok and then again coming back. Pretty boutique hotel. Smallish but adequate rooms - spotlessly clean. No frills (pool etc) , but then you are not paying for them either. Very convenient location, just 5 minutes amble to Little India MRT station, and taxis and buses available closer still just at the bottom of the road. and bang in the middle of Little India so bars and restaurants all around anyway. Nice breakfast, very welcoming, helpful and friendly staff. Very good value for money, highly recommended.Possible down sides - rooms and corridors have beautiful wooden floors so there is potential for noise from other guests and also there is some street noise - neither bothered us, but if you are a light sleeper you should maybe take earplugs. Also there is no lift - we were on 3rd floor, and again didn't bother us, but others may feel differently.

<Content>Great, unique hotel I have been staying at the Perak Hotel everytime I go to Singpoare for nearly 8 years. I always book a deluxe room, so I can't comment on the other room types. It is the mix of old colonial charm and the modern conveniences like wireless broadband that I really like about this hotel. The wooden floor-boards, old style windows and facade of the hotel remind me I'm in Southeast Asia - something the bigger places on Orchard Road don't do.Over the years the staff now recognise me, and I have always found the service friendly enough - and very helpful. Given that Singapore is not a budget travel destination, I find the room rate very reasonable for what you get and will always recommend it to friends. The location in Little India is great, very close to the MRT, Queen St bus terminal, great food and plenty of atmosphere on a Sunday.A unique hotel in a great area of Singapore.

<Content>Very Disappointed We booked the hotel after reading mostly favorable reviews. We checked into our room on the ground level which had no windows. We thought, only one night, we can deal with it. Before heading out for dinner, I plugged in my electric toothbrush. When we returned, I put the key in the power slot and there was a flash and then nothing but darkness. The night desk person came into the room with a flashlight and starting ranting about overloading a circuit. I tried to explain to him that all that I had plugged in was a toothbrush. Being an engineer, I know there were other problems not caused by a damn toothbrush. We then turned on the air con and it started to rattle like crazy (it was old and partly taped up). We pointed this out to him and he said he would see if there was another room available. After 15 minutes, my wife finally went to the front desk and asked him if he had found another room. Without looking at her, he said nothing and handed her a key. No offer to help with moving our luggae to the new room up on the third floor. This room was much better, with windows, but they did not seal properly and we spent a sleepless night kept awake by the noises on the street below. In the morning when we checked out, the day staff were there and they were just as cold as the night man. I'm not sure if this was just towards us. But this counts as one of the worst experiences I've had in my 20 years of extensive travel.

<Content>Hotel with personality My wife and I stayed at the Perak Hotel for four days in mid April 2007. We booked directly with the hotel, and even then still managed to get a superior room for only S$148 a night.The bed was rock hard, the bathroom was tiny and the breakfast was quite basic. The only other negative was the three flights of stairs we had to climb with suitcases, as they are small enough not to need a lift.These aren't big things though, and there were plenty of great points as well - a five minute walk (if that) to the Little India MRT, a 1 minute walk to a 7 Eleven store, minutes to many places to eat and it was a hotel with personality - after 2 days there, we were recognised by staff and greeted by our names.The air conditioning is a must have in Singapore, and the staff service was also fantastic. There is a big difference between a small hotel like this, and one of the larger ones I have stayed in here before. You're treated like a number at the larger ones, and the Perak made me feel like a guest, not a customer.I'd be happy to stay here again.

<Content>Disappointed with the Perak Hotel I stayed at the Perak Hotel in March 2007. It was just a one night stopover but was pretty disappointing. The hotel bills itself as a boutique property, but there's realy not much to it with the exception of a few antiques in the hallway. The rooms are small, the bathroom shower is just above the sink so everything gets wet. Breakfast is mediocre at best and the hotel staff is not all that helpful when it comes to late check-outs. The locaton is good, in Little India, and its just a few blocks from the Metro station. Other than being convenient to Little India, the hotel has little to offer. I probably wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Great amenities for the price If you want a first class or corporate hotel in a nondescript cityscape, then stay away from the Perak, instead book at one of the glass and concrete boxes on Orchard Road. The Perak is not like the big chain hotels but is a great value for the money in Singapore. For around $70USD per night you get a clean (albiet small) room, with basic but nice appointments(Cable TV, A/C, DVD, free wireless internet, etc), a good location in vibrant Little India, and basic but tasty buffet breakfast. I had no complaints other than a bit of street noise late at night when a neaby bar was closing up. But the cheapest rooms at the Perak have a skylight rather than a window and are much quieter if noise is an issue

<Content>Great little hotel Stayed at The Perak Hotel on two occasions during 2006. Found the location very convenient with easy access to downtown Singapore.The building itself is very nice both inside and out, think it might have been one of the old chinese style clan houses, nicely decorated on the inside and is in keeping with the traditional style.Had a look at a few different rooms, the sizes do vary. All were very clean and comfortable. Breakfast served on the ground floor, very tasty buffet style with plenty of coffee tea and juice.The staff were great, really helpful with advice on what to do while in Singapore and the best ways to get around.Would gladly return to Perak Hotel next time I visit Singapore.A real alternative to the big international hotels. Has the personal touch lacking in bigger establishments.

<Content>Very Budget! Only hotel we could get in Singapore under $100 US for a short layover in Singapore en-route to Bankok. Read the reviews and they were not bad; however, I expected that the hotel would be better. We were told upon arrival 2:00 AM that there was only one room available and of course it was on the ground floor and had no windows. Room is small, which is fine for a budget hotel - basically clean, but not worth $90+ US dollars!! After being there and seeing the neightbourhood, the most I would pay for this hotel is $50, $60 at most US$. We stayed in Phuket at a 3 star hotel ( Karona Beach Resort  Spa) and paid $77 including breaksfast  taxes- which far surpassed our expectations for the money and certainly a great improvement over Perak charging $90+ US.) The Perak Hotel rate inlcudes breakfast which was pathetic! Toast - instant coffee, noodles one morning and juice. I would rate this hotel - 2 stars at most!. If you are on a budget and just need a place to sleep for a night or two - this would be it - Really worth about $40-$50 US per night.BTW - The towels were very stained - with I will refrain from saying here! I hope they invest a litte $ in getting some Clean and presentable towels for their customers.

<Content>Disappointed After reading the comments on tripadvisor and a call to the hotel I booked 2 deluxe-rooms via the hotel's homepage. On calling they told me that only deluxe-rooms are free. My mistake, I didn't do attention to the confirmation email, they confirmed 2 standard-rooms. We arrived at midnight and was very disappointed about the standard-rooms, very small, no windows, only air-con and no internet, the good thing about the rooms: they are clean. Next day I checked the deluxe-rooms, but finally for this price I don't agree and we changed the hotel. Paying only 40 SD more we've in very well four star hotel now. The perak hotel staff is very friendly, they offered deluxe-rooms and did no problems about our hotel change.

<Content>I agree with 'the indipendent': one of the best budget hotel in the world. A nice hotel in the indian part of singapore.Our room was clean, comfortable and nice, staff was kind and helpfull, for only 60 euro with breakfast.In the surroundig you'll find resturant, shops, underground and a shopping center.This hotel is also advised by the indipendent as on of the best budget hotel in the world and I agree with them!
