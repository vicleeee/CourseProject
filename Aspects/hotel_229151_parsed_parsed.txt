<Content>Wonderful discovery Travelled to Amsterdam for business and was extremely pleased with this jewel of a hotel. Well tended, comfortable, stylish rooms. Professional, helpful, polite staff. Simply the BEST location for the canal neighborhoods, and close to all the hubub of the old town. Walking distance to Reiksmuseum and all markets. Fantastic bakeries close by. Fantastic coffee shops close by(Cofee and Tee). Cafe Singel was SUPERB for lunch. FoodWare offered a wonderful lunch buffett(but no atmosphere to speak of, just good quality food...). Beulings restaurant was an incredible surprise discovery, 5 star multi course chef's choice, small cozy... all a short walk from the hotel. We will look forward to our return.

<Content>Superb hotel The staff are extremely friendly and accomodating at this hotel. Our flight had been changed without notice and we arrived at the hotel 3 hours earlier than expected. We managed to check into our room prior to mid-day with no fuss, this was a first for us! The hotel is beautiful and very relaxed and is perfectly situated for exploring Amsterdam. We didn't use public transport at all, we walked everywhere. The breakfast is rather on the expensive side of 16 euros each but then again, you get what you pay for. I would recommend this hotel without hesitation and will be returning on our next visit to Amsterdam.

<Content>Great location We have been to Amsterdam before and stayed in very basic hotels so decided to go for something a bit more upmarket this time. We really liked the hotel and were lucky enough to be given one of the bigger rooms. It was clean and in really good order. We also really liked the location - its not to far to the station and a short walk to dam square. The roads around the hotel have a really good selection of places to eat and drink.We got a really good rate on the room - if we had paid more we might have been a bit disapointed and we have rated it highly for its value for money.Recommended.

<Content>Lovely place to stay We stayed for three nights, and found this to be a clean, plush and comfortable hotel. We stayed in Room 512 which was on the top floor (in the roof), the room was just right for two people, not huge, but well arranged so we didn't feel 'squeezed' as you can feel so often in some places. It had a very decent bathroom with shower/bath and hairdyer, plus all the usual things and lotions (except soap, which came in a squeezy bottle on the wall). There is wifi, but you have to pay (10 euros for 24 hrs).We didn't have breakfast in the hotel (so can't comment), but it was extremely good to know that in the afternoon after walking around (freezing) Amsterdam, there was free coffee/hot choc/tea to warm you up whilst nibbling on the free pastries/biscuits whilst slumped in a comfy sofa reading the newspapers provided. There were no coffee making facilites in the room, and the minibar only contains water - but again, it is free.The staff were very friendly and helpful, and huge fish tank in reception was just awesome, my husband could barely tear himself away from it.

<Content>Mixed feelings If arriving by train, take a cab. It is really a long walk from the station unless you have no luggage and have 20-25 minutes to view things on the way. Arrived and was given a so so small room with no view. Asked for another. Hotel was accommodating to a point in that we were shown another bigger room or we could opt for a small room with a view. We opted for the broom closet sized room just for the view of the canal. (They claimed no others available. I was not so sure) This was our choice but two normal sized adults pretty much have to climb over each other to function.) Bathroom nice but very limited space on sink and shelf. View great from room . Bed was okay. No bed bugs that I could see or feel.(saw that in another review) Closet space....Poor. No drawers, a high hard to use shelf. (I lived better out of a foot locker in the Army). Beautifully decorated downstairs public rooms. Did not do the 16 Euro breakfast but room looked nice. Free coffee, cookies and candy in lobby area was nice touch . Bar open 24 hours. Fair prices on the drinks. Service was very good and staff helpful with a good restaurant recommendation. Price for 3 nights averages about 155 euros a night with taxes.

<Content>Great little hotel The last couple of reviews don't compute with my own experience. I booked through a discount website and was therefore expecting one of the less good rooms. However on checking in I was given a room at the front of the hotel, overlooking the canal (207). The room was not huge (to be expected in Amsterdam) but was perfectly adequate and well designed (cubby holes to use as bedside storage). The bathroom was clean and much bigger than many I have experienced at far more expensive places. The staff were very polite and helpful and I found the facilities and location of the hotel to be very good (a 10 minute stroll from the central railway station). I made use of the free loan of a DVD player which was an added bonus.Downsides? None really, the wifi connection didn't work on the last day but I was refunded the cost of access with no question.

<Content>Not that good I honestly cannot believe the high score at tripadvisor. I usually choose my hotels based on the ratings here at tripadvisor and have never been disappointed. However, Esthera did not live up to my expectations. The room (512) was tiny, with a tiny bathroom which actually has no space to put the towels (stored on a rack above the bathtub). If you want to take a shower you have to throw the towels onto the floor. The furniture had several cigarette holes, although it was supposed to be a non-smoking room. The rooms are noisy due to the lack of any sound insulation. Breakfast is an extra 16 EUR per person which I thought was included in the price, another bad surprise. Staff is not particularly friendly. Location is quite nice, which is the only positive thing about this hotel.

<Content>Nice Hotel Watch out for the Bed Bugs The hotel itself is very nice. However, watch out for the bedbugs. We stayed in room 406 at the hotel on the 24-26th October 2008, when my Husband and I woke up on the Saturday morning we noticed that we had little lumps on our skin but did not understand why. When we woke up Sunday morning with more bites I put 2+2 together. I woke up with a bite on my eye lid, which hurt and itched like hell. A week later I still have the lump without the redness!Since then, I have had to spray my home and my bags with the clothes I took to make sure this does not spread into my home. Once you have bedbugs they are hard to shift. Until now I did not know they actually existed. Its AWFUL! I have yet to email the hotel and see what repsonse I get, however, if you do stay here I would suggest you check the bed first before opening your luggage. Other than that, its a nice hotel and a nice location. I hope you have better luck than me!

<Content>Loved The Estherea Stayed for three nights from 20th October to 23 October  found it more than lived up to our expectations. We had a very comfortable, quiet room with large bathroom. The hotel was warm  comfortable with exceptionally charming, helpful  efficient staff. The breakfast was delicious  the complementary coffee, chocolate or tea very much appreciated. The hotel is on a lovely stretch of a quiet canal within easy walking distance of almost everything. There is a selection of restaurants to suit every taste  pocket just around the corner in Spuistraat . The only negative thing I would say about the hotel is that the grouting  tiling in our bathroom needed some maintainanceThe only negative experience we had in Amsterdam was that we were very overcharged for our taxi from the station. We asked the hotel to get us a taxi back to the station. This was less than half the price we paid to get there

<Content>Customer Service at its best! We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay at this hotel. It is full of charm and elegance. The decor is lavish and welcoming and a change from the usual modern hotel. The reception areas were gorgeous with polished wood and chandeliers. But what really sets this hotel apart is the customer service. The staff are friendly and any slight problems we encountered were dealt with efficiently and with a smile. Breakfast was plentiful and fresh. The complimentary refreshment area was a nice touch and very welcoming after a long day. The hotel is situated on a quiet stretch of canal but only 5 mins walk from the hustle and bustle. I would reccommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet comfortable stay,

<Content>A wonderful time We stayed there 3 nights from 12th Oct. We were absolutely pleased with everything the size of the room has enough space to open 2 hugh samsonite luggages + hand carry + has a writing table, the ensuite has everything incuding cotton buds and even bathroom slippers. On top of that the breakfast has a wide choice of bread and pastries including hot hard boiled egges, the waiting staff were excellent and very quick to respond. The front desk receptionists and the potters were all absolutely wonderful and of course the free flow of hot chocolates and biscuits help when we returned in the night and feeling cold and waiting a hot drink and there it is. No fuss at all. The location of the hotel is just great as well. 5 minutes walk to Dam Square and to where all the food is. We visited Anne Frank's house (10 minutes walked), Van Gogh museum (tram), Behjinhor (where the nun used to stay- 5 minutes walk), Molen van Sloten Windmill (by tram) and of course we walked to the famous Red light district, we truly enjoyed ourselves and because the hotel is so conveniently located, we can come back anytime when we were tired. We had a great stay. I would defintely stay there again if I were to visit. The only thing we weren't sure was why the receptionist advised that we take a cab to and from Schipol airport instead of taking the shuttle bus. We decided to take the shuttle bus anyway and we had a wonderful tour of the various drop off points for free. The shutttle was on time on both journeys and we were equally pleased.

<Content>Unbelievable Breakfast! We stayed in Hotel Estherea for two nights this October. From the moment you enter its opulent panelled lobby you feel welcome. Our room wasn't quite ready and we were invited to help ourselves to free coffee, tea or hot chocolate (really good), while we waited. Our room overlooked the canal and had a pretty four poster bed. It boasted every convenience even down to the free slippers (well at least I hope they were free!). Breakfast was quite simply wonderful! Every conceivable thing you could possibly want to eat, from fresh fruit and smoothies, cereal, different breads and pastries to lovely crisply fried bacon, 'proper' sausages and eggs (scrambled or fried). Once we ate here in the morning, we didnt need anything until dinner time! We walked everywhere from this hotel, it couldn't be better placed for any attraction you may wish to visit. My only critiscism would be the lack of proper lighting to read by at night and to fix my face in the morning (!) and our bathroom was a little small, but these were minor flaws. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to feel spoiled and relaxed at the end of a day.

<Content>A most memorable experience My husband and I spent four fantastic days at the Hotel Estherea last month and what a beautiful hotel it is. Our room was overlooking the canal and it was so lovely to see the activity day and night. Our room was very attractively decorated, ensuite had plenty of room and included were all the soaps, shampoos etc. Plenty of cupboard space which included a safe, iron and ironing board which is a very helpful addition and not usually provided in most hotels we have found.Breakfast was in a very pleasant environment and included a vast assortment of beautiful food. It was a lovely addition to be able to have, tea, coffee or hot chocolate at any time and often with the addition of a piece of cake or biscuit and also fruit on hand as well as sweets and a cool drink of minted lemon on the bar.The furnishings in the lounge and reading room were so lovely, it was wonderful to experience a little bit of yesterday today. We would strongly recommend a stay here.Lance and Jean Pereira, Western Australia

<Content>A truly magnificant jewel Hotel Estherea:We have just recently returned to Canada from our visit to Amsterdam and our stay at this magnificent hotel (Rooms 217 and 218)We couldn't have chosen a better place to stay in Amsterdam. The hotel was magnificent and we felt more like family than hotel guests. Everything in Central Amsterdam was within walking distance and the front desk staff were exemplary. I felt like we were welcomed home every time we entered the front door. From the abundance of fresh flowers, to the regal chandelier, to the library, the hotel exhibited old world charm and richness that flowed from every corner. The rooms were wonderful, clean and large. The large bathroom with double sink left no room for morning confusion. The Singel Canal was at the doorstep, and marvelous restaurants just around the corner. I would recommend this location to anyone travelling to Amsterdam.

<Content>Brilliant hotel - highly recommend it Our visit to Amsterdam was made so much nicer with a stay at this hotel. I searched for months to find something good online and most hotels I found hadnt the best reviews. However, this hotel lived up to its reviews and more. It is very central and just by one of the canels. You can walk everywhere from this hotel, even Central Station which brings you straight to/from the airport. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a bit pricey at 鈧?6 a head but there are plenty of lovely cafe's just around the corner where you can eat for less. I was extremely impressed with the complimentary tea's / coffee's / hot chocolate / sweets / fruit and cakes (yes free cakes!) that were in the lobby 24/7. Our room was a decent size with a funky decor and also had a huge bathroom with double sinks. Plasma TV in our room also along with an iron and ironing board which was great as usually you have to borrow one from reception. Our friends stayed in a room on the 5th floor which was very similar to our's and also a decent size. Also the rooms were cleaned daily. Although quite a pricey stay, it was well worth it for the comfort and I would definately recommend it to all - could not fault it.

<Content>Very Good This hotel lives up to its description on their own website. I walked from the station (a little too far for a short walk) and on the way it rained. I arrived, soaked, and the front desk staff immediately grabbed towels to dry me off.The room was very nice, albeit a little small, but extremely comfortable. Very nice atmosphere.

<Content>Location, comfort and style This is a very nice central hotel located on a canal 5 - 10 minutes walk to all the sights. The beds are comfortable, the furnishings nice and the room a decent size for European hotels. Lobby, reception area and breakfast room are very beautiful and old-wordly with elegant wood furnishings. Bathrooms are large and very modern with double sinks. Restaurants close by. Very quiet area and away from the major tourist area near the train station, but only a 10 minute walk away. Highly recommended.

<Content>The PERFECT birthday!! The other reviews have said most things.....My husband and I stayed at Estherea for 3 nights. We stayed in a large canal view room with a four poster bed.....well worth the extra money. During our stay it was my husbands birthday and we were amazed by the birthday greetings and little extras. All the staff were incredibly helpful and attentive.Well done Estherea. Highly recommended!

<Content>lovely hotel and great location My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend in January 08 and spent a bit more than we normally do for a hotel and were not disappointed. We couldn't believe when we walked into the hotel it was so nicely furnished. We had to wait a few minutes for our room to be ready but there was free tea and coffee and sweets so we were happy enough to wait! Room is lovely big bed very clean and very comfortable, tv was also quite good most of the channels are in english and had a good range of channels. Bathroom also lovely. couldnt fault anything about this hotel - well just one small thing - we stayed from a Sat to a Mon and on the monday morning there was construction work going on outside where our window was (it was facing the back) so not good when I'm woken out of sleep! but we were leaving on the Monday so it didnt really bother me. The construction work's probably finished up by now anyway. Anyway to finish up - I would definately stay here again it's money well spent, and also brilliant location just a short walk away from dam square and loads of restaurants. Also is a walking distance from the train station (takes about 5-10 minutes).

<Content>Great location This is a great old fashioned hotel in a central location. While the decor is a bit old fashioned, the staff is friendly and the room are more than adequate.We were only there for two days so not enough for comfort to be an issue. We were able to get to everywhere we wanted to get to by foot and there were great restaurants and bars nearby.

<Content>Great hotel in good location We have just returned from a short break in Amsterdam and very much enjoyed our stay at Hotel Estherea. Our room (416) was immaculate and nicely furnished. The bathroom was large and modern, with a lovely double sink and bath/shower. The staff were friendly and very helpful. There was no coffee or tea facility in our room but complimentary drinks and small cakes/sweets are available in the reception (v nice!). If we had any complaint at all it would be that the pillows were rather thin and so we could have done with more but, since we only stayed for a couple of nights, we didn't bother to ask for extra (though I'm sure they would have happily accommodated us). Overall, we had a lovely stay and if we return to Amsterdam in the future we will happily book again.

<Content>Everything was exactly as described...AWESOME On a whim, I decided to stay over in Amsterdam for 1 night. I wanted to go all out and stay somewhere 'Fancy' and was ready to pay for it. But the reviews for the Luxury hotels were spotty and I didn't want to make a 300 Euro mistake.So I held my breathe, went with Hotel Estehrea after considering everything else and settled in on the location, price (I paid a special 99Euro for a Single room), and its reputation.What a great location! Remember I only really had 24hours. This location was picturesque, right on the Canal, and close to everything. You cannot go wrong with this choice of area. For breakfast, I grabbed an excellent coffee and Croissant a mere block away on the Singel. AMAZING.The room. My room was a lot bigger than I thought. I thought because I went with the lowest rate, I'd get a closet - but I got a very roomy/comfortable room. I was very happy. Very quaint. I'm a bit of a design snob and wanted to stay in something modern and luxurious, but I was very satisfied with the room and the decor. Okay - it could use a bit of updating - but like I said, quaint.The staff. EXTREMELY FRIENDLY and HELPFUL. Check this out: I only had a credit card from the airport to the hotel (Taxi was about 43Euro). Because I didn't have cash, the front manager had no issue giving him cash and charging the taxi to my room. I travel every week and stay in the top 5 hotels in the world on a monthly basis. No one EVER did that for me. Extra kudos for making it easy for me. I also left my shirt and tie. They contacted me after I got home and asked me where to send it. Have you ever heard of such proactiveness?All in all - I arrived at the Hotel at 6pm and only hit my bed at 5am to check out at 10am the next day. I had a great stay in Amsterdam and this Hotel was a big part of the reason.

<Content>Great location, good service We enjoyed our stay here. Great location - near everything but quiet. Charming. Tea coffee and snacks all day. Rooms are small, bathrooms are minute - but that's how it is in the old charming hotels in good locations. Standard room has almost no room to move around. Deluxe room is comfortable and has room enough for desk, table and a couple of chairs. Our rooms had great view of canal below.

<Content>We loved it! Beautiful hotel, great staff, free goodies! We LOVED the Hotel Estherea. My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and found it to be wonderful. It was in a great location - about a 5 minute walk to Dam Square and about 20 mins to the Anne Frank House and Central Station.The staff was always approachable and helpful. They booked tickets for us for the Anne Frank house, in order to skip over the very very long line. I highly suggest doing this. We got our tickets at the hotel front desk, and skipped an hour long line to walk straight into the museum. The tickets were the same price as buying them directly at the Anne Frank House. The staff also provided us with free ponchos and use of umbrellas during the rainy days.If coffee shops are on your agenda, there are many places near the hotel to check out. There are 2 shops within a 3-5 minute walk and dozens more within a 5-15 minute walk.The free cookies/pastries/coffee/tea/hot chocolate in the lobby was a great perk. We saved quite a few Euros by snacking at the hotel instead of at a cafe!Breakfast is 16 Euro per person, which is quite pricey. We peeked into the breakfast room one morning to see what we were missing and we were not missing much. We opted out of breakfast and went to a small bakery on the corner. We each ate breakfast for 5 Euro there - a much better choice than the 16 Euro option!We ate dinner one night at Caprese - the Italian restaurant on the street behind the hotel with the yellow and white awning. It was inexpensive, compared to many other restaurants in the area and it was absolutely delicious.Our room was wonderful. The bed was ok - not the best, but certainly not the worst. My only complaint in the room was the hair dryer. It was very weak and semi-broken. (I had to hold down the on button constantly or else the dryer would turn off.) Other than that, the room was great!I would certainly put this hotel in a 4 star class - not a 3 star, as listed. I have stayed in many 3, 4, and 5 star properties - and this is certainly a 4 star, considering all of its amenities.

<Content>An Ideal Hotel and Haven in Amsterdam We stayed at the Estherea as a birthday treat and stayed for 3 nights over a weekend. We can only echo what other visitors have said, peaceful, quiet, clean and ideally situated for all the many places in Amsterdam that a visitor would wish to see. All staff were attentive and eager to please from check in to check out, an approach which will secure a return visit from us.We stayed in room 210 which overlooked the Singel canal and how pleasing it was to sleep with an open window in a busy city, there are not many city hotels in which that is possible. The room was a good size with all facilities that we needed and cleaned to a high standard every day.Like some of the other visitors we decided to breakfast out and found a lot of choice alongside the floating flower market which is less than a five minute walk and at a very reasonable cost.On entering our room I was pleasantly surprised to find a birthday card and generous gift from the family who own the hotel.Would I recommend the Estherea? Of course I would !!

<Content>Charming place to stay We stayed 4 nights in this lovely hotel. We had a triple room and my mom had a single room. The single room was very small but the tasteful decoration, elegant colors, comfortable bedding and beautiful furniture made up for the size. The triple room was also beautifully, luxuriously decorated and the beds were very comfortable. The hotel has a very old Europe charming feel. The large chandeliers in the front lobby, the lovely wood paneled library, and all the fabric just makes this hotel inviting and warm. The staff is very professional and helpful. The location is great, on a canal street and close to all attractions but at the same time quiet and picturesque. Another lovely feature was complementary tea, coffee, hot chocolate, water, cookies and pastries that were so great to have after a long day of walking around town. I found this very thoughful. I definitely recommend this hotel to all.

<Content>Loved it! My wife and I stayed here in July 2007 and were very happy with it. The rooms were very small but really charming. The location was perfect. We got a great deal and did not pay nearly the price listed as average price righ now so I'm really basing our contentment on the price we paid. Great lobby too! We would stay there again. We had a second story canal view room.

<Content>Lovely little hotel by canal Spent one night at the Estherea. It is a warm, comfortable and cosy hotel. Rooms are small but other touches more than make up for it. Good breakfast and tea, coffee and chocolate and cakes available all day. Excellent touch. Very friendly and helpful staff. Cannot wait to go back again.

<Content>Beautiful, charming and accomodating Hotel Estherea is a fabulous hotel and quite accomodating as well. We just returned from our travels which including this hotel and loved everything about it. Clean, wonderfully helpful and pleasant front desk staff and exceptionally large room for European standards. Easily accomodated me and two kids with lots of room to spare. Coffee, tea, hot chocolate and cookies are always available to guests...a huge perk for a quick snack since Europe is so expensive these days for American travelers...a coffee break anywhere in Europe can easily run $15-$20.00 these days. Fruit is usually also left for guests as well as small cakes if they are left over from the restaurant. The hotel has a wonderfully comfortable lobby as well. Without doubt I would stay here again.

<Content>Great Location, Quiet The hotel is in a great location - just around the corner from lovely restaurants and bars but still quiet.I found the price expensive but then all hotels seem to be expensive in Amsterdam. We paid 220Euro for a Friday and Saturday night in July.Rooms are small but adaquate and very clean. The bed was comfortable, the towels were fluffy.We did not eat at the hotel so I can make no comment on the menu. However, they do have good coffee in the lobby, small pastries and toffees. A nice addition.One complaint I have with the hotel is that the tiles in the bathroom are quite slippy and on the first night both I and my partner slipped when stepping up into the bathroom. Although I lost my balance I didn't fall, my partner did and banged his elbow.The second complaint is that it is unreasonably expensive to use the internet facility in the lobby. You pay 5Euro for 30 minutes when for the total cost of the accommodation, the internet facility should be free. We needed to check our flight reservation which would take 5 minutes yet had to pay 5Euro for the facility.I would rate the hotel nice, great location but rather expensive for the room size etc.

<Content>Great Stay!!! Loved The Estherea! We stayed at The Hotel Estherea for 3 nights in June. What a great hotel....everything that has been said is true...great location,beautiful lobby,free tea /coffee/snacks. There were 4 of us, 2adults and our 2 children(ages 13  15). It is difficult in Europe to find either connecting rooms or rooms that will accommodate 4 people. At the Estherea we had a quad room. It was fine for the 4 of us. It faced the street behind the hotel (no canal view),but it was a lovely street view. We had a king bed and 2 doubles with plenty of room. The room also had a desk  chair, plus 2 sitting chairs, a flat screen TV,and a large closet. The bathroom was clean and stocked with nice products. The real beauty of this hotel was the staff....very,very nice,great advice and restaurant recommendations. We had drinks at the bar which was nice, but never had breakfast at the hotel. If you walk out of the hotel, turn left and make a quick left at the side street, on the right side there is a great bakery (3 minute walk)...we got fresh treats in the morning and had them in our room with coffee. The breakfast price at the hotel was a little steep at 16E per person. Be sure and take Mike's Bike Tour while in Amsterdam...it was one of the highlights of our trip!! If you have any questions let me know!! Happy travels!

<Content>Decent Rooms are small- have a hard time thinking of a room being much smaller. It is very clean, and in a good location- central to many things. Staff is so so- not overly friendly. Initially gave me a first floor room which was quite loud due to street- they did agree to change that. They charge around 7 euro to use the internet- so i went to an internet cafe. Not a bad place if you are just going to be sleeping there but if spending a decent amount of time in the hotel may consider other places due to small room. The elevator also didn't go down from the floor above the lobby on the day I was checking out- so had to carry suitcase down a flight of stairs- for the price you pay it certainly isn't what you get in the US .

<Content>Charming Respite in the Heart of a Great City We stayed at the Estherea for 3 nights at the end of our honeymoon. I am so glad TripAdvisor is available, as I would never have found this gem otherwise. The hotel is tucked into the quiet Singel Canal, in a great part of town. Our room was #210 and looked out over the Singel. The street itself is very quiet, and while it's only 1 or 2 blocks from all of the action, we could never tell while we were in the room! All we could hear out of the windows is the everyday hustle and bustle of Amsterdam (think bike bells!). Our room had a double bed and a sitting area with a desk, plus of course a nicely appointed bathroom. The products in the bathroom were wonderful and the towels were very lush!There is an area in the lobby where they serve free coffee, tea, candy and cakes all day and night. Plus, fresh fruit! There is also a bar area that is fully stocked, so you can get a drink at any time, plus they have the most wonderful mint-flavored water available (that's free!).There is an elevator but you can also take the stairs if you are so inclined. If you exit the hotel and turn left, there is a Greek deli/restaurant that serves up AMAZING, authentic dishes. It's great for a quick bite! Lastly, I cannot say enough about the staff. In true Dutch fashion, they were patient, gracious, and willing to help with any request....all with a smile!

<Content>Great Hotel in a Nice Neighborhood Great hotel with good rates located on a canal. I travel to Amsterdam 8 times a year for business and have been let down by a lot of hotels but not this one. I was looking for a good value as I was spending the weekend on my own dime. The hotel is charming and squeaky clean. Service was very good. Room very nice. Would definately stay here again.

<Content>Perfect Location!!! Hello - I booked this hotel based largely on the reviews here. I have to say the reviews were spot on and the hotel was fantastic. The only exception from the reviews was that we had great customer service (this has been complained about in the past). I am picky and felt they were great. The night clerk was very lazy but heck he is the night clerk. All the others were very friendly and helpful.I wilI not repeat all the same good reviews as the past, I will only say they are true. I felt that, although pricey, it was a great value for all you received and the location. We had canal view room 514 and loved it. It is small by US standards but larger that many other european hotels I have been in. Perfectly comfortable for our 3 nigth stay. The bathroom was huge. There is a great bagel shop two streets up for breakfast. Stop looking this is a perfect spot!

<Content>Above and Beyond Expectations Previous reviews have already stated all the nice things about this hotel, so I won't repeat them. I will just back them up by saying that the Estherea is a GREAT hotel! Super-friendly staff, unbeatable central location, nice extra touches, sparkling clean rooms. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

<Content>brilliant hotel This is an amazing hotel. We had a deluxe double with canal view and four poster bed. It was very romantic and beautiful. The staff were all friendly. The best thing was the complimentary tea, hot choc and cakes in reception which you could have when ever you wanted without feeling you were being watched. We took it up to our room which was good too. The hotel was very comfortable to be in with a relaxed atmosphere. The location was the best and was central to everything. I would recommend this hotel and would stay again without hesitation.

The staff at the reception desk were very friendly and helpful.It was lovely to have free coffee,tea and cookies/cakes were always available in the lobby.Location was also very central. The tramlines were close by and it was possible to walk to Dam square, the museums etc. Lots of restaurants close by and there is a lovely tearoom ,just on the corner for breakfast if you do not wish to spend 14 euros for b/f at the hotel.I managed to book this 4 star hotel at 107 euros/day on [--]

<Author>GoGirlToo
<Content>Absolutely Wonderful Hotel We stayed over in Amsterdam for four nights en route to Prague -- my mother, my sister  I. We all had a fabulous time at the Hotel Estherea -- and agreed it was one of the nicest places ever. The hotel is in a perfect location on a quiet  lovely canal within easy walking distance of many major sites (Dam Square/Anne Frank House); a tram stop is just a block or so behind the hotel. There are many excellent  reasonably priced restaurants very close by. The staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful and made excellent suggestions for restaurants, tours, etc.. Best of all, the hotel is gorgeously decorated in old-fashioned Dutch style. It's a very atmospheric canal house, but with all of the modern comforts -- and then some. Coffee, a large assortment of teas, cocoa or ice water (with mint  lemon) are always available for guests to enjoy; in the afternoons  at night savories and/or sweets (e.g. gingerbread, pastries, olives etc.) are also set out. As Amsterdam was still cold in early April (though the hotel was always warm), we got into the habit of enjoying tea in the afternoon  camomile tea with cake at night while watching the interesting tropical fish tank in the beautiful livingroom/lobby before heading up to bed. Our room for 3 was large and very beautiful; the bathroom was large and well-equiped. All and all, a wonderful treat. I''d love to go back -- anytime!!

<Content>A delightful experience My family and I have recently stayed at Estherea and I loved the hotel. The front desk staff were very helpful and friendly and the location was just perfect. Although the rooms were small ( one was even tiny) and two of the bathrooms equally quite small, we were deligheted with the character of this canal house.It was near everything in a quiet canal - Singel- and you could walk everywhere. We also enjoyed the coffee, tea and hot chocolate facilities in the lobby as well as the small biscuits.It was really a delightful experience I would like to repeat.

<Content>A Must My mother and I have just come back from Amsterdam and I chose to stay at this hotel due to the great feedback I had found on Tripadvisor. I have to say the hotel was superb!!! The check in staff very helpful and friendly, the decor very welcoming, the rooms were smallish but so beautifully and tastefull decorated, we really couldnt have wanted anything more. The bathrooms were very clean and the beds very comfortable. A real bonus was also the free afternoon cakes/ coffee for guests.We had a brilliant stay and will do so again!!

<Content>Best choice in Amsterdam if you're like me If you're like me you want to stay right near everything happening, but have quiet for a restful retreat.If you're like me you want to fully experience the location you are in by making your home one of architectural ambiance unique to the area, while not forgiving luxury, comfort and class.If you're like me you want to walk effortlessly to everything you would want to see in the heart of a city, taking the headache of transport out of your experience.If you're like me you will relish in even the smallest den of rest at the Hotel Estherea. Drink it in.

<Content>Tiny Shabby Room I have been to Amsterdam a dozen times in the last 10 years and stayed at a different hotel each time because I've never had a good hotel experience in Amsterdam: tiny rooms and tinier bathrooms, high prices and staff that range from cooly efficient to condescending insolence. So when I read the glowing reviews of the Estherea, I had hope - unfortunately unfounded. I was assigned the smallest room in the hotel although my rate was the normal one for a double room (well over $300US/night). It was so small, that when I took the large decorative pillows off the bed the only place to put them was on the floor and that left maybe 5 narrow feet to walk around the bed that was wedged in an alcove. The room could best be described as shabby, carpet that hadn't been changed in 20 years (an issue because you had to get on your hands and knees to get to the room safe in the bottom of the cupboard - not a closet). There were holes in the walls left unfilled, 80's style metallic wall paper and beat up cheaply made furniture. It did have a view on the canal, but that just meant it was noisy - I could hear a couple talking at normal voice through the walls too. I asked to move and of course they were full. The staff was reasonably friendly but not helpful. The only good points were the neighborhood and the breakfast. The lobby was rather grand, but in the flower capital of the world it was odd to see so many fake, glittery flower arrangements and I never spent time in the lobby anyway. So still searching for a decent reasonably priced hotel in Amsterdam.

<Content>Wonderful experience I was delighted with this hotel which I booked after reading the very favorable comments on TA. I travel to Amsterdam monthly for business. This Spring I decided to take a few days for touring with my daughter and was looking for a less expensive option than the business class hotel I where I usually stay. We`loved the Estherea - even though we ended up with a small room on the interior. The hotel is so well located, slightly to west of the center of old town, so we spent most of our time touring the city and didn't mind the room. The beds were fine, the bathroom small but clean and modern. The lobby and room are charmingly european. There is always drinks and sweets available for guest. The staff was polite and helpful. I am sure we will stay here again.The location of the hotel is great. Unless you are into the honkey tonk bar scene, sex workers, or just general touristy places, I highly recommend the quieter west side of the historic downtown. The streets and canals are elegant, it feels very safe, and you won't be awaken by the rowdy bar crawlers in the middle of the night. There are also very affordable cafes in the area, with very good and healthy food. We enjoyed being the only Americans eating in these establishments!

<Content>Not Your Average European Hotel My wife and I stayed in the Hotel Estherea for three nights and really loved the place.First of all, when we arrived quite a few hours before check-in time, they did their best to get the room ready for us. And when it was ready, we were brought to the room where our bags were already waiting for us. A nice start!The room itself was lovely and overlooked the peaceful Singel Canal. The room was unusually decorated, as was the rest of the hotel, and definitely not like your usual generic hotel.Breakfast was a bit on the expensive side at 鈧?4, but was a very decent spread.Downstairs in the lobby, there was a small bar and library, with tea/coffee/hot chocolate making facilites and little cakes left out. This was all so cozy and welcoming that I was happy working from the lobby for two days ...We've previously stayed in the Krasnapolsky in Dam square, which seemed a bit soulless and overpriced compared to Estherea.All in all, this is a very nice, unusual and welcoming mid/top-range hotel.

<Content>Elegant but comfortable Hotel Estherea was a delight! We so enjoyed it, that my children groaned about leaving. First, it has a lovely and welcoming public area with warm lighting, wood panels, and leather sofas. It also has a small bar and a library-- to top it off, there is 24 hour a day hot chocolate and coffee available, and the hotel puts out pastries, cookies and candy. This was a big hit with the kids, and they would look forward to return from cool, wet sight-seeing to sit with us and sip cocoa! The rooms were comfortable and tastefully decorated, and the bathrooms spacious and well equipped. Photos do not capture how lovely it is. We will definitely return. What a delightful place!

<Content>loved the decor Have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Estherea.We were delighted with the hotel. The location is very attractive being on one of the cannalls (Single) and is central so many of the sights are within walking distance.The decor is fab if not a bit over the top with dark reds velvet, tassels and chandeliers everywhere.Staff are helpfull and polite and the rooms are comfortable (we were on the 4th floor with a stunning cannal view).The breakfast buffet (E14) was worth every cent.We would stay again deffinately

<Content>Bloomin' great We have just returned from a 3 night city break with our 2 children and were delighted with our hotel choice. We used the fast  efficient train service between the airport and central station. The hotel is a 15/20 minute stroll, if it's not raining, and its central location means that pretty much everything is within walking distance - although the trams are easy to use when legs get weary.The room (419) was ready for us on arrival at 1.00pm and there was plenty of space for all 4 of us - no canal view, but the windows open onto the interesting cityscape. Our bed was large  comfy, and the large sleigh-like sofa converted into 2 single beds. The bathroom was small but adequate. We found the staff friendly and helpful and the whole hotel felt spotlessly clean  well maintained/decorated.The breakfasts offered plenty of choice, including hot (bacon, sausages  eggs) and cost 14 euros per person (children under 11 free). However, there are plenty of cafes nearby - a couple of good ones 5 mins walk looking out onto the flower market - and offer much cheaper alternatives.There is plenty of choice for restaurants in the evening. The hotel recommended the Haesje Claes just around the corner, where we enjoyed the typically-Dutch, and very filling, food. There was a childrens menu and prices were reasonable.All-in-all, the Estherea is a great base from which to enjoy this fascinating city.

<Content>Hotel Estherea Stayed at the hotel in February, and it is very nice, staff is very professional. However, I thought the hotel was noisy. The hotel is especially noisy in the early morning as guests check out, with wheeled suitcases, doors banging shut. The hotel is charming and quaint but for the price I think you can do a little better.

<Content>Beautiful hotel and I'm not easily pleased Not the easiest place to find but once you know where to go it is excellently located close to Dam Square. It's a really different kind of hotel and from the moment you walk in you feel it's special. The decor and furnishings are opulent and the rooms have a feeling of elegance. I loved the bold red floral wall paper in our room. Everywhere was beautifully clean and well maintained. They provide free tea, coffee and hot chocolate in the lobby 24 hours a day along with cakes and sweets.It was noisy during the night. I could hear guests arriving back at the hotel and I could hear bikes and people out on the street. It is on one of the quieter canals so I guess other hotels have more noise. I didn't find it too much of a problem and would certainly stay there again.

<Content>An excellent hotel,  We are just back from 4 nights at the Hotel Estherea. It is an outstanding hotel. It is beautifully decorated and extremely well run. The hotel staff is very helpful. Some of them might be a little formal, but all tried their best to help us in any way they could, from getting dining reservations to having a room for us when we arrived at 7 am - amazing! The location was unbeatable - no matter where we wanted to go in the city, it was an easy walk. We finally took the tram the last night, just for the experience. We had a double without the canal view, but it was very spacious. The bathroom, though small, was both spotless, and well equipped. The price was very fair. Even with the sad state of the dollar, it average the same as a recent stay at the San Diego Embassy Suites. I can't thank all the reviewers enough for all the great information that they have given in their reviews. They helped make our trip go smoothly. From needing our credit card pin number to get the train tickets from the airport to finding the Gollum - a neat brown cafe -your advice was invaluable. I strongly recommend reading all the reviews you can- I felt so comfortable choosing restaurants and finding places - like the advice from about 25 close friends!Don't hesitate trying the Luden - just around the block. The food was terrific, reasonably priced, especially in the Brasserie in the front,and felt like being in Paris. The Cafe Luxembourg was also fun, and just a little further down the street. The soups and fries were especially good. The hotel's location near so many great restaurants is just icing on the cake. We tried the hotel breakfast, and it was very good, but also crowded because they were full while we were there. So we only ate there once. Broodje Bert on the corner serves a bargain full breakfast or just a roll if you want, simple but fun to sit down and watch the world go by in front of you while sipping your coffee.Yes, we had a wonderful time. The weather was cold and rainy - it even snowed. But it didn't matter, we had such a good time in Amsterdam - we recommend it highly- and everyone spoke English!

<Content>A Real Gem I am just back from the Hotel Estherea having spent 4 nights there with my 3 sisters. We booked a quadruple room (yes we are a close family!) which was quite spacious compared to the cramped offering of Paris the previous year. The hotel is located on the Singel canal which is a quiet part of the city but also very central for site seeing. The hotel has a quaint olde worlde feel to it the moment you enter. Luxurious fabrics, carpets and curtains are used throughout the hotel as well as 2 very spectacular chandeliers in the lobby - quality and class without being stuffy. There is a fantastic aquarium just inside the front door which we spent 10 minutes looking at everytime we left or returned to the hotel! Beakfast was a buffet style and of a very high standard with plenty of variety to cater for all tastes. The other nice touch was the complimentary hot drinks, chocolates, fruit, sweets and cakes which were available throughout the day and of course the resident housecat that occasionally graced the lobby! The staff were also very helpful and courteous. For beer lovers there is a cafe down the side street from the hotel - Cafe Gollem which sells over 200 speciality beers.

<Content>canal view hotel estherea was superb, tastefully furnished, our double room with a canal view was very spacious light and airy, staff friendly and helpful, central for most tourist attractions.Close by there is a delightful street of antique shops which incidentally do not open until 11am, enjoyed our visit, highly recommend.

<Content>Great location, ambience No hotel booking website had this hotel available for our required dates so we had to book this straight from the hotel, which was fine.We arrived in Amsterdam very early on 1 March and arrived at the hotel at 7am. We were efficiently checked in but the room was not ready so we hung around before the weather became more conducive for outdoor exploration. We really liked the cosy intimate decoration downstairs, which wasn't too ornate but which had an air of old elegance and detail. The library was well stocked and the chairs were very comfortable.The room we had (#316) had no view but was more than sufficient for 2 persons. Amenities were as expected, although we did find the bed (queen-sized) a little small because we were so used to our king-sized bed at home. Room was well furnished and decorated and I didn't find the internet rate of 10 euros a day (from 12pm to 12pm the next day) exorbitant.Reception was always courteous and polite and the breakfast spread was simple yet good (14 euros per person), with a small but fresh selection of hams, cheeses, fruits and some hot dishes.Location was great for walking everywhere (we only ever took the tram once in our entire 3-night stay), except when we were lugging our luggage from the central station to the hotel. I would definitely recommend this as a good alternative to the numerous large chain hotels in the city.

<Content>Terribly noisy Stayed one night at this hotel with my mother. She had a smoking room, I had a non smoking room, as we had requested. Pretty expensive, 160 euros each + tax and breakfast (363 euros total). The worst thing was the noise from the neighbouring rooms and the lift just outside my room. Paper thin walls and very poor insulation. If I hadn't had my earplugs with me, I wouldn't have got any sleep at all. Very confortable bed, though.Both rooms were extremely cold and my mother woke up with the cold in the middle of the night. She had no idea how to switch on the heating.The staff was not particularly friendly, the blond woman at the reception desk on 17 February was very cold, distant and extremely slow.Pros: location and confortable beds, good breakfast.CONS: very expensive for what it is; TERRIBLY NOISY.

<Content>A Gem! A gem in Amsterdam, perfect location we had a great room with a wonderful view of the canal right outside of the hotel. The room was good sized for Europe (meaning my wife and I were able to turn around at the same time). The bed was very soft which was great for my wife less positive for me but all in all I highly recommend the Estherea.

<Content>Decent hotel with a few bad experiences My husband and I stayed here from October 8th-14th, in a canal room, which I requested ahead of time when I booked through their website. Our room was fairly large and the view of the canal out of the front windows was fantastic. The lobby was beautiful, breakfast was pretty good, and there were lots of nice spots to hang out and have tea or coffee in. The location was terrific, pretty central to things that we wanted to do and only a few blocks away from a train. The staff was perfectly fine, they helped us when we needed help and were always polite.The room did have a few bad points however, and I was fairly disappointed after reading all of the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor. While the room did look fairly nice, the bed was horrible and had both me and my husband tossing and turning. He actually lost a fair amount of sleep one night because he was just so uncomfortable. We got a bit used to it after a couple of nights and to be fair we are a bit pampered by our mattress at home, but this was just awful. I've slept on fold out sofa beds that were more comfortable.Then there was the bathroom. I have stayed in many hotels with teeny bathrooms, that wasn't the problem. The problem was the mildew, stained towels, and bad ventilation. I can honestly say this was the worst hotel bathroom I have ever been in. Just very unpleasant overall. One thing that we did not have a problem with was the squeaky floorboards. The noise from other rooms and floors seemed fairly minimal to me, but we live in a flat that is on the second floor of a three floor hundred year old building with wood flooring on each level, so both floor noise and hearing other people is probably less likely to get to me then other people. Overall a very pretty hotel, and we had a decent stay there, but the bed and bathroom will keep us from returning.

<Content>Lovely hotel I recently spent the weekend with my boyfriend at the Hotel Estherea and it really was lovely. The location on the Singel canal is perfect; every attraction is within walking distance and there are a number of excellent restaurants very near-by. Although we were in one of the smaller rooms (we got an excellent out of season deal), it was perfectly formed and exceptionally clean. As mentioned in some of the other reviews, one of the nicest touches is the free tea, coffee, hot chocolate and cakes; it feels like such a treat to come in from a day's walking/sight-seeing and to relax in the beautiful reception area. I would without hesitation recommend this hotel and will stay here on any further trips to Amsterdam.

<Content>Excellent family run hotel If you are tired of corporate hotels this is the place for you. Small individual hotel near centre easy to find, friendly staff. As a business traveler it was a breath of fresh air. Small standard double room with great view of canal suited us just fine.Try it ;-)

<Content>We will never return to Estherea! We have stayed at the hotel three times, always for at least two nights. The first time we stayed in a room on the top floor. That was ok and we were quite impressed so rebooked to stay before and after flights from Amsterdam. However, these last times were very disappointing. The rooms we stayed in were ok in size, but have the noisiest floorboards ever. It was so bad we hardly slept because of guests moving around above us. We stayed in rooms overlooking the internal courtyard on the first and fourth floors. The reception area is quite cosy, but the coffee machine is often breaking. The staff is a mixed bag. From a very pleasant and helpful young lady, to the most terribly grumpy man on reception. Make sure you check your bill before you leave. The people next to us at check out were charged for breakfast they didn't have and other quests having meetings there were also complaining to the grumpy man about being overcharged. This hotel has totally lost it for us. We will not be returning.

<Content>Gorgeous hotel! I took my Fiancee here for a 3 night stay for his birthday. We enjoy city breaks and his brother lives here so it killed two birds with one stone. I booked this hotel based on trip advisors rating and I was not disappointed. The hotel is just lovely and the staff extremely polite and helpful. We had the breakfast one of the days and everything was lovely, as were the lamb burgers we ordered from room service one day. I have already recommended this hotel to others and I will definitely book again when we next go to see my fiancee's brother.

<Content>Small but perfectly formed! We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the hotel Estherea which I had arranged as a treat for my boyfriends birthday. We were in room 207 which was small but absolutely lovely: beautifully decorated with a great view of the canal. I had mentioned when booking with the hotel that it was my boyfriends birthday during our stay and on arrival a gift of chocolates had been left for him in our room - which was a very nice touch. Staff were pleasant and helpful without being grovely. We had breakfast in the hotel on two mornings (for an extra 14 euros each) which was worth it for the lovely surroundings, cakes and chocolate milk!!! My only reservation would be that the sound proofing between the rooms was not great but otherwise this is a great little hotel that I would not hesitate to visit again.

Shuttle bus available from the airport.Finally....the hotel provided the most comfortable PILLOWS I have ever lay on in a hotel!!!I know that sounds mad, but if you are fussy about pillows, like me, you'll appreciate it!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel BUT Me and my wife loved the hotel and I agree with the other reviews.I just feel it need to be mentioned that even though the hotel is one of the best the staff is not.How can such a nice hotel have so unpolite staff.From the day we arrived check-in and everyday we passed the reception it was like this: We are educated to say good morning,afternoon and evening, but when we did that the staff was ignoring us like we where not thier.It was like this everyday everytime we passed the reception.SORRY but for me that makes a diffrence and I hope it was just bad mood the staff was in when we where there.But the hotel is worth visiting !!

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Excellent Staff Just returned from my 40th birthday trip to Amsterdam. The Estherea Hotel was brilliant from start to finsish. The public rooms are all very plush, the bar area though small is very nice and warming. The staff were all very very helpful and polite. The room was on the top floor and was very comfy. The location of the hotel is excellent, once you have found your bearings everything is within walking distance. All in all a very nice 3 nights, we will use the hotel again.

<Content>Great start to our vacation!! The location of Hotel Estherea is wonderful - we were able to walk to almost all the sights, and there was a tram stop about a block away for longer trips. Plenty of restaurants nearby as well. The lobby and reception areas are lovely and relaxing - lots of places to sit with a book or chat with friends. The hotel has a restaurant for breakfast, as well as a small bar. In the lobby is also a machine where you can serve yourself coffee, tea, or hot chocolate at any time. And don't miss taking a look at the incredible aquarium!Our room was very comfortable, and quite large. The bathroom was huge! We didn't overlook the canal, but rather a street to the back of the hotel. We did get some street noise, but it isn't a particularly loud neighborhood, so it didn't really wake us up. I recommend this hotel for a nice stay, and can understand why it has so many good recommendations on TA!

<Content>Excellent quality for the price We only spent one night in Hotel Estherea in Amsterdam, but it was a very pleasant experience. The hotel is well located at one of the canals of Amsterdam. It is quiet and very well located to see many of the main attractions of Amsterdam. You can reach the hotel on foot from the Central railway station (approximately 15 minutes), by public transportation or by taxi (about 10 euro's). The rooms are relatively small (this is Amsterdam after all), but well equipped and the hotel even has a library! In front of the hotel, there is a stop for the museum canal tour.

<Content>Luxury and Indolence We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Estherea. The hotel is excellent with really good service. We were just expecting a few bits but breakfast is a lovely Dutch/continental spread and the restaurants, for an evening meal, are all round the hotel and are of great value with good food. This hotel is one of the most convenient for restaurants, coffee shops and bars. We found a Bar that allows cigar/cigarette smoking and drinking and, although neither of us smoke tobacco, we enjoyed the 'old' style of Dutch Bar and if you want to mix a little luxury with the odd trip shopping then this is an absolute must as it's just round the corner from ALL the shops on the Damrak.The staff at the hotel seem to go by the maxim of, 'we can do it and if we can't then we know someone who can'.This is a 'Family Run Hotel' and family owned in every meaning of the word and it really does feel like home once you get into your room after a day wandering and shopping.Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed at in Amsterdam on holiday.

<Content>Not so inviting Estherea Stayed here for two nights. I have been to Amsterdam several times but i found it difficult to find at first and a bit isolated on the way back in the evening. When we checked in i had forgotten my visa card so i paid cash up front... no problem but the guy at the front desk was rude beyond believe.He demanded 250 euro deposit per night and for me thats alot when you are only on a weekend break and it was unexpected. I had to give him 400 euro in the end. This left us with very little cash. When we were shown to our room it was tiny really small. The end of the bed was 1 foot from the wall and there was less than a foot either side of the room.We thought there was no bathroom and when we opened the door to what we thought was a wardrobe it was actually a toilet and tiny bath. When you closed the toilet door there was a 4inch gap really nice.I spoke to the front desk and they said they would change rooms the next day and to be fair they did give us a nice room at the top of the house.I did not enjoy this hotel at all i found the staff rude and unhelpful and the facilates poor.Watch what room you get i did request and pay for a deluxe to start with however there idea of deluxe is a view of the canal.This hotel is not worthy of a four star more basic 3 star

<Content>Peaceful, high-class comfort Was so completely disappointed with the Brower down the street we checked a website and found room specials at this place for only 10 euros a night more (and no breakfast). If you look for specials, this place is in no way overpriced. Great location, beautiful, comfortable, spacious rooms and an exemplary staff.. The canal room had a wonderful view and we felt like royalty the whole six days we were there. They may not serve breakfast, but for about 5 euros, you can pick up some wonderful broodjes (great sandwiches) or pastries right next door. Especially after our poor experience down the street, we could not have asked for a better respite and rescue. Would recommend to anyone!

<Content>Great lobby and location This hotel is in very nice area, centrally located, at canal Singel.Atmosphere is warm and welcoming, you have to spend time in the lobby, drinking free tea (big choice) and coffee, like you are at your home.Rooms are pretty big for european standards. What we didnt like were beds (too soft and double room is twin in fact). Bathroom was ok, big (what i didnt like is maybe only small detail - plastic curtain)I would like to suggest this hotel to every one who knows to appreciate carrying for details.

<Content>Overpriced for what you get I found that this hotel didn't warrent the over 200 EUR a night we paid for it. The room was tiny and the bathroom was more like a closet. The location was quite good however. I would not recommend it and not go back due to the fact that you would expect more given the price paid.

<Content>A bit disappointed We have just returned from a three night stay at the Estherea. Having stayed there twice before we had high expectations and were a bit disappointed with the size of our room (411). There was barely any space and it had the smallest wardrobe we have ever seen....it held three coat hangers once clothers were on them!!!! To open the safe and the fridge we had to move the bedside table and although there were 20 lights in the room, it was very dark. The bathroom was very clean but very tiny. There was always plenty of lovely hot water but we could have done with more towels.Breakfast was very nice and there was an excellent selection of food. Having free coffee etc in the lobby was a bonus. It may seem that we are being fussy but the hotel is not cheap and we were expecting a room the same size as we had had on our previoius visits. The hotel is ideally placed on the Singel canal, minutes from Dam Square. Would we return, yes.

<Content>Lovely Hotel in one of the best town's locations... This wasn't my first stay at Estherea in Amsterdam but, since last time, the hotel finished the restructuring works and the result is really EXCELLENT!The lobby is much bigger, as well the breakfast room; our room had a great Singel's canal view and we are [me and my girlfriend] very very happy of the romantic weekend we spend there...An hotel that I highly suggest for a romantic weekend in a wonderful town like Amsterdam...A very special mention to the incredible BIG aquarium in the lobby that you can spend hours watching it... A real masterpiece!

<Content>Fantastic Find My partner and myself stayed at this hotel last tuesday, having found it on the internet and read the reviews on tripadvisor. we were lucky enough to be allocated a room with a view of the canal it was beautiful with crisp white bed linen and sumptious pillows we didnt get up till 11am the next day!. The free tea, coffee and hot chocolate, along with scrummy cakes in the reception area was a real bonus. Having stayed at many hotel chains such as the Marriott and the Hilton i feel this hotel beats them all. The location is perfect for all the major attractions, yet very peaceful. I highly reccommend this hotel and cant wait to return again soon.

<Content>Cosy, sumptuous and incredibly romantic Myself and my husband stayed at this beautiful hotel last week. We had a room overlooking the canal and it was amazing. The room itself wasn't terribly big but it was spotlessly clean and decorated with beautiful fabrics and furniture. The room had three windows overlooking the canal and at night the view with the lights from the houses opposite was so magical. The bathroom again was spotlessly clean and had everything you'd need. From the moment you enter the lobby of the hotel you know you've made the right choice. Luxurious fabrics all around, a gorgeous library to sit and read in and beautiful couches in which to relax and have a drink. The location of the hotel is excellent and they have a list of recommended restaurants in your room which we went by and had two lovely meals. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>You can't smoke cannabis here ! We stayed at the Estheria for the first time and would advise anyone who wants a cozy, friendly, and smoke free enviornment to give it a try. I heard people complain about paying $15.00 for breakfast but the complementry hot drinks, cakes, biscuits and fruit available in their fantastic lobby/bar 24 hours a day more more than compensate for this. The Estheria has an in house rule that bans the smoking of any cannabis products ANYWHERE in the hotel. They will add $150 to your bill should they catch you, and they WILL catch you! They have very few smoking rooms(tobacco only) so make sure you make it clear when you book if you need a smoking room. A great hotel for non smokers. If you smoke but dont have a smoking room you will have to smoke on the street! We will be returning in 2008.

<Content>Great hotel My husband and I just returned from a week in Amsterdam where we stayed at this wonderful four-star hotel (November 2007). The location is perfect鈥攊t is about a 15 minute walk from the train station, close to the main square, and close to many restaurants. The lobby and other rooms on the entrance level were gorgeous鈥攋ust what I would expect in a hotel of this caliber. Our room overlooked the Singel Canal. Our comforter was so comfortable, I didn't want to get out of bed. The staff was kind, polite, and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here on my next trip to Amsterdam.

<Content>Another great Trip Adviser recommendation! Just returned from a long weekend at the Estherea Hotel. As mentioned by previous reviewers the hotel is excellent; a great location, a super room (we had a room with a view over the canal) but most of all the staff and customer service were what really made our stay. They could not do enough for us,the welcome was genuine and the advice offered on tours/eating out etc was spot on. This hotel deserved the praise and title of most romantic hotel in Europe!

<Content>Beatiful hotel - worth every penny When I read the last review of this hotel I thought it must have been written by the manager - maybe I still think that...but everything he/she wrote is true. This hotel is beautiful.The location is fantastic - on the Singel canal - peaceful, but only a stone's throw from bars and restaurants.We had room 210 - looking over the canal - four poster bed - v. comfortable - v. clean. Lovely white bed linen.Downstairs there is free tea/coffee/hot chocolate, biscuits and cakes. Really useful when we were there as it was freezing.The staff are v welcoming - perfect English and you can book lots of things at the front desk - the Canal hopper tickets for example. They can also lend you an umbrella.There is a restaurant called Casa di David almost opposite - great atmosphere and great Italian food - and only a minutes stagger back to the hotel!I can't recommend this place enough - when we go back to Amsterdam - which we definitely will, I won't stay anywhere else.

<Content>Nice but noisy We always check hotels on Tripadvisor and this one had excellent reviews with which we would agree.The location is ideal and the service outstanding.The little touches such as free coffee and fruit throughout the day were appreciated.Our room was spacious, comfortable and well decorated.Breakfast was worth the money and we enjoyed it.The down side was the noise.We had a street view room on the first floor.There was no double glazing so passers-by might have been with us in the room until 3 a.m.Building work began next to the hotel at 7 a.m. most days and continued until 6 pm. or later.We were not informed that this was taking place.We did ask to move rooms and, to be fair, we were shown another room but it was so small we decided do without sleep for the four days we stayed.The nearby November restaurant served good food, so we recommend this to you.

<Content>Dissapointed This Time This was our 3rd time in the Estherea - we loved this hotel on our previous 2 visits and had booked in for 4 nights this time but it proved to be 3rd time unlucky for us.On arrival were were allocated a very small room - the bed was so tiny we wondered how 2 people could fit into it. Also our room overlooked a very noisy building site which we believe should have been brought to our attention when checking in. This hotel is not cheap so we decided to complain. The receptionist was a grumpy middle aged chap who eventually agreed to move us although he was not apologetic at all. We were moved to a very spacious quiet room and were more than happy with it. Unfortunately our experience has made us doubtful if we would go back to this hotel for a 4th time - a shame really.

<Content>What else is there to say? Very nice hotel, excellent location. Yes, many of the rooms are on the small side (especially compared with the USA) but big enough unless you have lots of luggage. Useful list of recommended nearby restaurants in the hotel room brochure. Our favourite was the Haesje Claes - the menu included in the brochure shows only a tiny sample of what's on offer there. One tip: think carefully before buying an IAmsterdam card - you will need to be pretty busy to make it worthwhile, and nearly all the main sites are within walking distance.

<Content>Lovely hotel Lovely hotel! Our double room was small with no canal view. I requested one, but no rooms were available. Still, room was nice and cosy and the bed absolutely fab! Bathroom was also small, but again nice and clean. Free tea,coffee and hot chocolate with cakes in lobby! Location is central but nice and quiet! Overall we were very pleased with our stay.Tip - If you like tea/coffee in your room without going downstairs, get a travel kettle with you, very handy! We never travel without it:)

<Content>great hotel Stayed at the Estherea from 14-18 Oct. Chose the hotel because of great reviews and was not disappointed. Decent sized room(516) was well appointed with a comfy bed and large bathroom. Have been to Amsterdam a few times and the Estherea is by far the nicest hotel I've stayed in. Also the best location. Would definitely stay here again

<Content>What a great hotel....! This hotel was one of those rare things...a perfect fit. Not a big chain so it had a personal touch, but very well appointed. The location was excellent in one of the inner canal rings on Singel. There was great dining and shopping nearby. We stayed at a chain hotel for one night before Estherea and it was more expensive and much less pleasant. Our Estherea room was just configured great, the bathroom had 2 sinks, plenty of room and a great shower (the actual bath faucet has to be turned the the left to get the shower to work-it was a bit tricky). The rooms were updated with great linens and very clean. The common areas were very cozy. I didn't eat at the hotel restaurant. Breakfast is very pricey and we didn't want to eat that much so we went a few doors down to get a baguette for breakfast-1 Euro. One thing I loved about the hotel was the free coffee/tee bar they have in the lobby. It's a beautiful bit of custom-built carpenty that has all sorts of teas, sweeteners, and an awesome coffee maker where you just press a button. This is a great perk in a hotel when you just want to get going in the morning and don't want to have to sit down and order a simple cup of coffee. We couldn't stop saying how great we thought the hotel was. We paid a bit more for a canal view (our room was 314 and great) but it really made our stay nicer being able to look out onto the canal. I totally recommend this.

<Content>Fabulous stay at Hotel Estherea  We stayed at Hotel Estherea at the end of August.The hotel is very central and within walking distanceto the main attractions like Dam square, the Red Light District, museums and Central Station.The service provided by the staff at the front desk was excellent - both at check in  check out as well as with any requests duringour stay regarding places to visit and reservations for lunch or dinner.Our room was spacious and very comfortable and the bathroomspotless. A pleasant surprise especially after a day spent sightseeing was the coffee/hot chocolate provided in the foyer for guests.We loved our stay in Amsterdam and at Hotel Estherea and if we ever return we certainly will look forward to staying at Hotel Estherea again.Thank you to all for making our stay a really memorable one.

<Content>Great Hotel Great Location We are a family of 5 with 3 teenage boys. The location was perfect, in the middle of the 9 streets section and it allowed us to walk almost everywhere. We walked to the red light district, the museums, the train station and the casino all within a 15 minute walk. great restraunts on left out of the hotel, one block then down to the next street then left to the next street, away from the canel. we left the boys in bed and got breakfast at a close-by pancakes cafe each morning we found the hotel breakfast to be expensive and not that good. The staff was very helpful but a little snootie. our room overlooked the singel canal. we had two rooms which ajoined at at a T at the end of the hallway. there was a main door which allowed us to keep the room doors open between us and each room had its own door as well.

<Content>I want to go back! This is what a hotel should be. We took the luxury double rooms with canal view as we had heard the regular rooms can be small. it was 230 euro without meals. very comfortable plenty of space, nice view. the location is perfect. very scenic and quiet but easily accesible to everything. breakfast was good but at 14E could get pricey for a large group. one morn we just ate their free coffee/hot chocolate/cookies/cakes in the lobby and grabbed a croissant at the bakery next door.The people are nice as well. I'd go back in a heartbeat.

<Content>we will return Above expectation. No excuses, delays, problems, and apologies. We prefer quiet solitude than overstated lobbys and understated rooms and steer away from hotel chains catering to families. Not that we don't like kids, just when they aren't our own. Rooms were spacious and tastefully appointed. Deluxe rooms were the same price as a standard room everywhere else. Quiet, elegant ambiance and furnishings. Ideal location. Secluded from the main street hustle and bustle and trams along a peaceful canal, five minutes walk to everything, ten minutes to everything else. In all aspects, this hotel earns its four stars, although their breakfast buffet was a bit pricey and we opted for finding our own as was advised on Tripadvisor.

<Content>A wonderful hotel I loved this hotel from the moment we drove up to the front door. We were met by Rudy, who was wonderful and took care of us very well. We arrived early, at 10am. Rudy took care of our luggage and brought us coffee until our room was ready.We had a room with a canal view on the fourth floor. 412 if I remember rightly. The room was quite large, very nicely furnished and spotlessly clean. The check in staff were polite and professional. We loved sitting in the lovely lobby drinking coffee and resting our aching feet. There is a coffee/hot chocolate/tea machine in the lobby where you can help yourself 24 hours a day. The aquarium in the hotel is also amazing.The hotel is in a quiet and central location, within walking distance of many of the sights. Good restaurants can be found in the street behind the hotel, and lots of shops in the pedestrian street behind that. We did not have breakfast at the hotel. There is a great place on the corner called Bertje, or something similar. They do a good breakfast for 7 euros.

<Content>Nice, but very cramped Had problems right at the start when my mother's suitcase was off in some bin somewhere and we thought it had been sent to a different city. One and a half hours later the bag appears and we're off. Got a large cab for the 6 of us and were ripped off (we were told later what we should have paid) by our driver. Learned a lesson on that one!The hotel was a welcome sight after our long journey. Beautiful lobby and sitting area. Friendly staff with good advice on how to spend our time in Amsterdam. Our room was incredibly small. The rooms for the others traveling with us were a bit larger in size. All of us had the same lovely view across a very small alley into someone else's room. Would have liked something bigger and better but for $300 USD what do you expect??? Breakfast was tasty and filling enough.All in all, the hotel was average. Got a better perspective after visiting the other 7 hotels during our stay. I know you're not in the room much but for the price we would have liked to have been able to not step over our suitcases to get into the cramped bathroom that had no where to put your things.Amsterdam was a great city. Much better than we epected. Beautiful canals and friendly people.

<Content>The best hot chocolate Prior to arriving in Amsterdam I e-mailed hotel for directions from Central Station. They were prompt in giving accurate directions. After checking in we asked several questions to understand how to get around. Front desk staff was basically cold and and not helpful. Amsterdam was interesting but not easy to get around. The hotel room was clean, location was fine but would not be a country we would look forward to visiting again. The hotel offered hot chocolate and coffee in their lobby area as a courtesy.

<Content>Beautiful decor, lovely breakfast and fantastic location!! As a trip leader for a NJ Ski Club, I brought a group of 46 to the Hotel Estherea for 3 nights after a week of skiing in Italy in March.Everyone was so impressed with the hotel and its staff, that my husband and I returned the first weekend in Sept. with 6 friends before embarking on a cruise. The rooms are clean and well appointed. Although the rooms that faced the street to the rear of the hotel had larger double-sink marble bathrooms , we again opted for the front rooms with 4 canal facing windowsfor a wonderful view. Ask for Rooms 110, 112, 210 or 212. for a canal view. For a city with pricey hotels, we were happy to pay 185 euro per night to stay in such an elegant small hotel. It is quite comfortable to sit in the lobby or read a newspaper in the library while enjoying a complimentary cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate and cookies. There is also a small staffed bar.The buffet breakfast was included in the price and was nicely done. It included eggs, sausages, cold cuts and cheeses, cereals, fresh fruits and juices, and marvelous assortment of homebaked breads and pastries.It's location on Singel makes it a short walk to all the attractions and around the corner from the excellent classic Dutch restaurant, Haesje Claes.

<Content>You probably can't go wrong here. This hotel is a welcome respite in a city of questionable lodgings. The decor is classy and warm, and it has an old charm that for once *doesn't* mean run-down and cramped.The room we stayed in (four nights) was small. Not quite Manhattan small, but definitely not spacious. Enough room for two people and two suitcases. The bed was comfortable and large, and the hotel staff was more than willing to give us extra pillows. We had a view of some other rooms' windows (very close by), so we had to keep the curtains closed at all times. If possible, I'd recommend asking for a room with an exterior view.The bathroom was clean and luxurious. My only gripe with the bathroom was that the towels were a bit too small. Chalk that up to Americans wanting everything to be oversized!The breakfast buffet here is pretty decent... I think we paid 14 euros per person, and we got fruit, cereal, scrambled eggs, pastries, etc. Standard, but fresh and well-stocked. They gave us free (small) bottles of water in the guest room every day, which is a nice touch.Unfortunately, I think our guest room was right above the kitchen area, so every morning around 7am, we heard the swinging doors to the kitchen and the clanging of plates right through the vents in our room. It wasn't a huge deal, and might not be an issue in other rooms, but you might want to bring earplugs just in case, if you plan on sleeping past 7am.Another minor gripe is the hotel's strange policy of wanting you to leave your room key at the front desk when you leave. The keys are on a keyring that has a magnificently posh tassle on it... which would be cumbersome to carry around, anyway. But this means that you have to wait in line at the front desk to get your key or drop off your key. In other words, allow yourself a few minutes on the way back to your guest room. ...I'm reluctant to mention it here, but you have to wonder how easy it would be for a thief to get into a guest room by simply asking the staff for a certain guest room's key by number. They didn't check our ID or anything when we asked for our key.In all, we'd recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Amsterdam. The neighborhood is quiet but close to everything (we're big walkers and were able to walk everywhere). You probably can't go wrong with this hotel in terms of comfort and value.

<Content>A Small Palace I highly recommend this hotel, it's in the middle of all the attraction, the entrance of the hotel make you feel as if you entering a small palace, they serve you coffee tea hot chocolate and some muffins in the lobby for free all day long, our room was small but ok, when you want to book make sure that you take a big room in the upper floor far from the noise.

<Content>Fantastic hotel I found Estherea through Trip Advisor, and thught it looked wonderful, which indeed it was. I travelled with my father and grandparents and we all agreed it was a great place to stay in Amsterdam. The location was wonderful, in a part of town which is quiet but close to everything. The rooms were very charming, and we all had canal view, which truly gives you the right Amsterdam feeling. The staff was friendly, the breakfast nice, there was complementary tea, coffee, cakes and fruit in the lobby and the bar was NEVER closed;-) We had a wonderful stay, and for future stays in Amsterdam I know where I will stay!.

<Content>Great Find in Amsterdam Hotel was very clean  nicely furnished. Rooms larger than expected from other comments. It was very convenient to everything. Within walking distance to many sites, two tram stops near by for others. Of special note, the staff was extremely helpful with information about the area and making arrangements. Breakfast was expensive at the hotel, but eating at the many nearby cafes was cheaper and added to the Amsterdam experience. Hotel is 5 stories, but does have an elevator. The lounge area was very comfortable with coffee, tea, hot chocolate and cookies available 24 hours. A very comfortable place to stay while visiting Amsterdam. We highly recommend it.

<Content>Favorite hotel of our two week Europe trip This was our first and favorite hotel of a two week Europe vacation (we stayed in 6 hotels). The Estherea is sparkling clean, rooms of acceptable size. Charming boutique hotel with a gorgeous, welcoming, cozy lobby with separate sitting rooms. Fresh orchids everywhere. Free coffee (mediocre), tea and hot chocolate at all hours, often with snacks as well. GREAT quiet location on Singel canal a couple blocks from Dam Square. Staff seemed competent , if not particularly warm (although I will single out one guy, Igor, who worked hard to get us reservations for the Anne Frank house when there was a problem with the internet site). By the way, you must have reservations to Anne Frank; we went at 7:30 pm and there was still a line around the block. We didnt' have problems getting into any other museums. Only downside was the charge for internet - 5 euros for a half hour. All other hotels during our European stay offered free internet use. We would definitely stay here again and look no further. Another nice touch- refrigerator in room stocked with two free bottles of water each day of our 3 night stay. We absolutely loved this hotel. Felt great to return here each night.

<Content>Elegance and Privacy The Estherea is a beautiful hotel on the Singel Canal. The interior is done in highly romantic style, with amazing flower arrrangements everywhere. Everything is clean and well-maintained. The staff are helpful and unflaggingly friendly, and since they ask you to leave your key at the desk, you are always welcomed home personally. I had a wonderful room with a canal view and while it could get somewhat noisy from time to time - I was there on Gay Pride weekend, so it's hard to tell what's normal - if I closed the drapes and shut the windows at night, I slept like a baby.The very best part about the Hotel is that it is perfectly within walking distance of every major attraction and enough off the beaten track that, when you come back to the Hotel, all the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas disappears.At the nearest corner is a small cafe that has the freshest salads in Amsterdam. I would skip the breakfast at the hotel and eat at this cafe or walk to the flower market - five minutes away - and have a classic Dutch pancake and watch the world go by.This hotel is a jewel. I plan to stay here again.

<Content>a liittle gem Just returned from a three night stay at this lovely hotel. After much searching on the net for a hotel in amsterdam, decided on the Estherea after reading the excellent reviews on trip advisor, also helped by the many photos posted on this site. It was a last minute break for myself and my husband and I contacted the hotel direct as was slightly worried about the room size-and explained that I would like a large room if possible as am quite claustophobic unfortunately. Despite such a late reservation a prompt reply followed with no problem re the room size. On arrival we were delighted with the location of the hotel being in a quiet part of the city and in lovely surroundings. Our room 514 was right at the top of the hotel but really spacious and absolutely lovely-very comfortable bed and huge bathroom. Our whole exepreince of amsterdam was lovely and we will certainly be returning to the Estherea! Don't hesitate-book it and enjoy-we certainly did!

<Content>Need to be a heavy sleeper I picked this hotel for the first two nights of our trip to Europe with our toddler. I knew it was a little out of the way and wanted to make sure we were in a quiet location to get our sleep. I was pleasently suprised when we got there. It was very elegant and clean and in a beautiful location. However, we were woken each night by noise from above. The building is very old (hence the charm), but the walls are paper thin. The first night, I woke up every 30 minutes due to noise. The second night, we all woke at 12:30. The man in the room above us was having a meeting. We called the front desk several times since none of us could sleep. Finally, my husband took my (now crying) daugher to the lobby and the front desk clerk handed him the keys to the suite on the top floor. We moved, but by this point the whole night and the next day were shot. If you can stay on the TOP floor, I highly recommend this hotel. Otherwise, you better be a good sleeper.I regret to say that I had read other complaints about noise in this hotel before making my reservation.

<Content>Great Hotel Great hotel and very comfortable surroundings. Little to add to earlier reviews and highly recommended. The only negative observation was that it is not wheelchair friendly - but this is amsterdam so goes with the territory.

<Content>Estherea Lives Up to its Fine Reputation We had elevated expectations about the Estherea, given the positive reviews, and we are happy to report that this small hotel is indeed a great find. Our room was very comfortable, recently renovated and decorated with superb taste and a sense of style. The beds were deep and comfy; the chairs and other furniture luxurious, in an old world way. It had a large bath with a double sink, which I did not expect. The public areas on the ground floor are especially inviting, for a coffee and a sweet treat, or a drink in the evening. These rooms have fabulous wood paneling, particularly in the stunning library. Everything was very well maintained and in perfect working order.The unexpected bonus about the Estherea is that it is in a great location, on the innermost canal known as Singel. The back of the hotel looks over Spuistraat, which has an abundance of the city's best restaurants, cafes and bookstores. We had all of our dinners (four nights) at restaurants that were within a block of the hotel - Haseje Claes, Kantjil and Tigre, and the Luden. All very different and all highly recommended. The Greek deli next door and the bakery down the alley on Spuistraat are also outstanding. You can tell we did our fair share of eating while in Amsterdam.From the Estherea, we could walk 15 minutes and be at the Rijksmuseum, the van Gogh, or the Concertgebouw. Or, one can take the street trolley, which is also just a block from the hotel. And, for the sheer pleasure of it, just wandering around the neighborhood, seeing the magnificent buildings on those delightful canals, peeking into stores and brasseries, bakeries and boutiques, taking in what makes Amsterdam so special, is the best reason to stay at the Estherea.

<Content>Small and elegant We spent three nights at Hotel Estherea and could not have been more pleased with their service, location, and atmosphere. The staff from the front desk to the maids is very professional. We walked to everything (Dam Square, Van Gogh Museum, Rijksmuseum, Red Light District, Rembrandt Square, and various shopping areas). You could have a breakfast buffet in the hotel for 14 euros or go to the corner cafe and enjoy breakfast for 7 euros. The lobby of the hotel has complimentary coffee, tea, hot chocolate, assorted candies and mints in addition to afternoon pastries and fruit. Trams and restaurants are within a block or two. They even lent us umbrellas and gave us complimentary plastic ponchos when it rained.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel This is very nice hotel that exceeded our expectations. We had a spacious room(#507) that faced the canal, it really couldn鈥檛 have been nicer. We especially liked the free coffee and snacks in the lobby. The staff was always helpful and went above and beyond. I asked for simple directions for driving and the staff member got online and printed out mapquest directions for me, very nice!One important item that is not mentioned on their website is that a trolly runs close by from the central train station. If you take the train from the Airport(very easy), you get off at Central Station and catch the #2 trolly. This will take you steps from the hotel. We tried to get a taxi from the train station and they wanted to double the price because it wasn鈥檛 that far of a drive. Only because we didn鈥檛 know about the trolly at that time.

<Content>charming hotel Stayed two nights at the Estherea hotel. Location ideal, can easily walk to most attractions. Although the room was small the canal view was a treat. Comfortable bed with nice crisp white sheets and soft pillows.Lounge and bar area tastefully decorated, nice little touches included glass jars of sweets, complimentary tea, coffee, and cakes.My only gripe was the monotonous music played in the bar.Complimentary bottles of water in the room was appreciated. On request ironing boards and irons were available.  Reception where friendly and polite. Would stay at the Estherea again however, would like to book a larger room.

<Content>Lovely Hotel. Great hotel, the staff were really friendly and helpful. Our room was the best, it was on the fifth floor, not overlooking the canal but with a balcony. A great location, everywhere is in walking distance. The breakfast was ok for 14 Euros but you could get just as good a breakfast for a lot less. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing for a central location.

<Content>Best hotel we stayed at in Euope! My husband stayed 3 nights and I were very impressed with this hotel! It was so cute and romantic. We booked it without doing much research, just knew we wanted to stay near dam square. The overall experience was great. It's on one of the canals, and our room actually had large windows that opened up and looked over a quaint street on the other side. Really was a nice room. Everything was very clean, had everything we needed, the staff was so friendly and helpful. We were there on our honeymoon, and the first day after we stepped out for a while the staff put a nice gift in our room for our honeymoon. It's such a cute hotel. We also stayed at a 5 star hotel in London and in Paris, but still this hotel took the cake for us.

<Content>A hotel which oozes charm 15th July 2007 - Chris and Janet, Cheshire, UKMy wife and I have just returned from a 4 day break in Amsterdam. We were very impressed by the quality and style of the buildings fronting onto the various canals as well as the choice and variety of restaurants,cafes , museums etc.,To cap it all, Hotel Estherea was a fine example of a beautifully refurbished hotel with a stylish reception area and attentive staff.Our room on the 4th floor overlooked the canal - room 414 - and the hotel was ideally situated for a great range of restaurants and snack bars.A wonderful holiday and we would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Disappointing - why is it so highly rated This hotel is highly rated and we cannot understand why when you have so much choice in Amsterdam for others.They first proposed room 405 (standard room) which is a very tiny room with no view (there are others like this one actually). You can actually find better in an economy hotel for far less money. We refused the room (they were maybe expecting we would accept it because we booked it on the internet with a discount - why do they have to try it, thinking people are stupid - it is always unpleasant to refuse rooms). We changed to room 415. This room was a little bit bigger, still with no view and had really nothing special. We had to accept it as we were told there was nothing else. We waked up several times during the two nights of our stay. We could actually hear each step of the neighbors on top (what is unpleasant) and more important the hotel was noisy (you can easely hear the neighbors when they come during the night, when they leave in the morning or when they just talk). On top of that, the shower was not working the second day.Globally, we found this hotel very expensive for what it is (especially if you have to pay 250 euros for a standard - basic room) and were disappointed. Of course, the location is good and the bibliotheque charming but this is not obviously where people sleep and rest to better enjoy the city later on.

<Content>My New Favorite City and Hotel From the first second we arrived, my mother and I, the staff was very warm and friendly. They let us see many options for our room before we chose the one we stayed in. The rooms were very well kept with a very fancy decor. The rooms had a refridgerator, safe, hairdryer, ac, heat, and a tv. The hotel had an elevator which helps with carrying luggage up the narrow and steep houses of amsterdam. The front desk was so helpful with arranging dinner or attraction reservations. The last thing that I found very impressive was that the hallway by the restaurant, had coffee, hot chocolate, hot water for tea and at many times of the day, they had fresh fruits and pastries. The hotel location is fantastic. Just two blocks from Dam square, but yet the hotel is situated in a quieter area. The hotel is also near the tram stops in front of the palace. I would recommend that you see, the Anne Frank house, Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, and take a bike tour or walking tour of the city to see all the historic sights. Parting notes: Take a canal tour, ride bikes through the city, and visit the historic quater and the red light district. Have fun!

<Content>Strawberries and cream! My husband and I stayed at the Hotel for 4 nights, 17th - 21st June and really enjoyed our stay. Our room was lovely and I thought quite spacious, the staff were helpful and we really enjoyed the complimentary refreshments in the lobby, on a really hot day to come back to fresh strawberries and cream and a slice of gateau was bliss! I would recommend Casa David for a lovely italian meal and service, we also enjoyed a pizza cruise along the canal. If visiting Anne Franks house be sure to get your tickets first from the Tourist Office located at the main railway station, then all you have to do is buzz the bell and go straight in.

<Content>Charming hotel Staff friendly and helpful. Hotel is very pretty. Location is great, halfway between the Rail station and museums, short walk to all major sights in Amsterdam. I had a double room. The size is perfect just for myself, but might be a bit tight for couples.

<Content>Very nice hotel The hotel is in a quiet backwater very close to the centre. In fact the area is charming with lots of interesting shops and restaurants away from some of the busier (tackier) parts of Amsterdam. We booked a deluxe room on the hotels own website and requested a canal view. The room was quite small (but that is normal in cities like Amsterdam) but it was very nicely decorated and maintained. Nice bathroom with all the usual amenities. View of the canal was lovely. As stated by other reviewers the complimentary coffee, cookies, cakes and fruit etc is very nice. Breakfast at 14 Euros was also quite good. We loved the hotel and would stay there again without hesitation.

<Content>Can't say one bad thing about this hotel!! Amazing!! This hotel hands-down deserves the Traveler's Choice award (very proudly displayed on their front counter - so cute!). I requested room 417 because I had read it had a really nice canal view. I kind of badgered the hotel about it before arriving, which apparently worked because I got room 317, which also had a nice view. They knew exactly my preferences when I checked in! Nice size room, gorgeous linens, although the bathroom towels were itty-bitty! Very odd. Great bath products and the shower had a retractable clothesline, which was really cool and which we utilized. I paid 220 per night for the room which did NOT include tax - so it was more like 230 per night. Well worth it though - it was close enough to be within walking distance of everything we wanted to see, yet far enough from the RLD to be away from the noise and riffraff. Excellent. Everyone who worked the front desk was really friendly and nice - another place where you have to turn in and recieve your key whenever you leave or come back - sigh! The one exception was one lady who personally struck me as weird and not helpful. I don't recall her name, but she was in her late 40s or so, had blond hair and glasses and was short. She gave us a weird fake smile whenever we saw her and we ended up avoiding her whenever possible. When we first arrived, I asked for a recommendation for a good Thai restaurant within walking distance and she got this puzzled look on her face like she had never been asked that question in her life! she immediately went over to the computer, presumably to do a google search. Amsterdam has a gazillion good Thai restaurants, according to my guidebooks and friends who have visited there - not a weird question by any means! When I saw her going to the computer for help I said forget it, please just recommend anyplace good within walking distance. She recommended Broodje Bert, right next to the hotel. Although the food wasn't horrible, I can't recommend this place. They are just sandwiches and the service is excruciatingly slow, even by European standards. I would have walked a little further, had I known how close the pancake restaurants were to the hotel. One really nice gentleman working the front desk recommended an Indian restaurant, Shiva, which was awesome. The free coffee and water were also a nice touch. The afternoon snacks were a nice idea, but imo didn't taste very good.My only real complaint was that when I made the reservation, the hotel emailed me that the rate did not include tax or breakfast. But one day out of desperation, we decided to eat the breakfast even though it was 14 Euros per day. The buffet was excellent and no complaints - except that everyone there seemed to have the breakfast included in their rate. Nobody asked us for our room number or had us sign anything - we could have been eating the breakfast all three days!! Why tell me that it wasn't included? I felt kind of ripped off in that regard. Overall I would stay here again without hesitation. I feel certain that this is the nicest hotel of its class in Amsterdam. Request a room facing the canal and you will be in heaven!

<Content>Loved this quaint european hotel! Just got back from the Estherea. What a beautiful charming hotel. The decor is quite nice, rooms are spacious, and the location is excellent. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Amesterdam. Very nice place. Hope to return in the future!

<Content>Fantastic I have just returned from a break with my husband in Amsterdam from 29th May to 1st June and had a fabulous time at Hotel Estherea.I found the Hotel at the last minute going through the internet and booked direct with the hotel. Absolutely gorgeous hotel which is located down Singel Road right by a canal which was quiet and only a 5 minute walk to Dam Square. Room was a bit small but very tastefully decorated and enough space for what you needed. We also asked for a canal view room when we arrived and were not charged any extra for it. Hotel Staff were really friendly and helpful, nothing too much trouble. Tea, coffee etc all complimentary 24 hours a day in the reception area, help yourself. Nothing in rooms but okay to go downstairs and take up to the room. Cake and fruit also complimentary. Did not have breakfast in hotel as not up early enough! We got a train from the airport for 4 euros each and it was only a 15/20 minute journey. Much cheaper than taxi and then we walked to the hotel from station.Recommend Majestic Bar in Dam Square for a drink and spot of people watching! It served Thai food and nibbles as well which was reasonably priced and tasty. Also Caressa Restaurant (I think) little Italian behind the hotel which was really good. Very busy so a good sign to eat there. Bar De Waag in New Square Market really good for midday snacks and evening meal.Definitely recommend to my friends and would definitely go back again.One thing I would suggest is that we went from Tuesday to Friday so missed the majority of the stag/hen parties. As we sat in Dam Square on the Friday afternoon they were all turning up in their job lot t-shirts so if you wanted a romantic break without the rowdy parties then go midweek!!

<Content>great hotel...ideal location stayed in this hotel for 2 nights 9/10 June. Ellegent upmarket small Hotel in a great location. payed average of 190 euros per night whichrepresented excellent value for Amsterdam. The room (506) was a little small but very clean and well appointed.Nice touch is the free coffee/tea cakes and fruit near reception.....some great places to eat and people watch close by and the hotel is not too near smutty Amsterdam, but not too far away if you want to take a peak.Have stayed many times before in this great City and would stay at the Estherea again

<Content>Wonderful hotel Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly staff in this great hotel. Rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated. Free tea and coffee (and lovely cakes!) in the lounge were much appreciated by tired travellers. Really convenient for all the major attractions, but in a lovely quiet location. Restaurant recommendations very helpful. I booked a canal view room which was lovely, but the interior room the kids had was just as nice. Can't praise it highly enough. If you're trying to choose between hotels when you're reading this, stop looking and book this one!!!!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel I booked this hotel for my mum and her friend for their trip to Amsterdam from 26th May to 30th May and I choose the Estherea based on all the comments from the website. I was a bit concerned about the comments regarding the room size but my mum and her friend were very pleased with the size of the room which was small but not too small!!The things they loved was the location, the coffee and tea facilities and the helpfulness of the staff. They also had breakfast every day which they said was very good and had a choice of hot and cold food.They said they would definitely recommend this hotel and if they visited Amsterdam again they would stay here again. I am very pleased I booked this hotel for them and I can assure other readers that if my mum and her friend said it was excellent it really was as they have very high standards.

<Content>Wondeful hotel Delightful hotel, with a superb location. The room was a little small, but v. cleverly designed in order to make best use of the space.The staff could not have been more helpful, to the extent of printing a train timetable out for me for a journey I needed to make the following day.

<Content>Perfect location We are a group of 11ladies and have just returned from a weekend in Amsterdam. We chose the Hotel Estherea by the excellent reviews and were not disappointed. The hotel is beautiful and the tea, coffee, hot chocolate and cookies available 24hrs in the lobby was a real bonus. The location is excellent, very quiet picturesque canalside location but only a few minutes easy walking to the centre. We checked in late due to flights (hotel was advised) and the staff were very helpful as they were throughout our stay. The Concierge recommended a Dutch restaurant for Saturday night that was just around the corner from the hotel and this too was very good, excellent food and good value. Initially we were disappointed that we were not given the canal side view that we asked for, instead we had rooms facing a tiny courtyard - but this wasn't a problem as it was very quiet. Amsterdam is a lovely city, definately recommend the Canal bus tours especially for a short stay as you can see most of the city and it is very informative. Should we go back I will definately stay at the Estherea and recommend others to do so as well.

<Content>so looking forward to trip Arrived monday afternoon, check in ok, was explained everything in 5 seconds flat. Breakfast was nice plenty of choice, quiet  relaxed, room small  window faced someone elses window so kept curtains closed. Very very clean, maid service was excellent.The disappointment came when speaking to anyone, yes we were answered  that was that. Maybe it was just us coming from the uk  northern we like conversation! But we dont blame the hotel staff, as the days went on we realised it was everyone in amsterdam, very abrupt.

<Content>great location Just got back from 4 nights at the Estherea... was not disappointed. As most people agree, the location is good. We walked from Central Station without problem. We had room 107, it overlooked the canal which was nice, but the room was small.check -in and check-out was quick. If I go to Amsterdam again , I would stay here.As far as earlier posts regarding construction noise, that was not there at all... maybe it is all done. And if you like Italian, definitely check out Casa de David right down the street on the Singel canal .... very good food and a 2 minute walk from the hotel

<Content>1st class hotel Stayed at the Estherea from 13th - 16th May and was a lovely experience. Hotel was immaculately clean and friendly and within walking distance of all the main attractions. Would have been nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room but all was available plus more in the lobby (just had to get dressed and go down for it).Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Fabulous Estherea Spent 6 nights at the Estherea in May. What a terrific find. Walkable to everyplace, close to trams and central station. Great restaurants right out the door. Try Da David on the Singel, great italian cuisine. Ask to sit upstairs in the window.

<Content>fantastic What a treat! The Estherea is a jewel. From the reception desk to the size of the room, the decor, the beautiful amenities and cleanliness of this establishment we were welcomed and thrilled. We booked a room overlooking the canal. The sun flooded the room through the 3 floor to ceiling windows. Eventhough you don't spend all that much time in the room, coming back to this comfortable room was a joy. Everything was immaculate. The bathroom was huge with 2 sinks and lots of room. Loved the towel warmer!The location couldn't be better. There were lots of restaurants around the hotel and pubs and cafes too. The bakery right around the corner made the most delicious pastries and croissants and we had them for breakfast every day with fresh squeezed orange juice. Transportation is fantastic. Hotel 3 blocks from Dam Square, a 5 minute walk from every tram and only 3 stops from Central Station. Our room was over $300/night but well worth it for the comfort this hotel offers. Hot tea, coffee and hot chocolate available all day with a lovely lounge, library and lobby in which to enjoy a rest.

<Content>Wonderful hotel with central local While on a river cruise vacation, my husband was taken ill and admitted to an Amsterdam hospital. A friend was able to get me a room at this hotel for two nights. I found this hotel to be one of the most charming I have stay in. As a travel agent myself, I have stayed in many hotels. My room was not large, but it had everything I could ask for and more. It was beautifully appointed, very clean, and very conveniently located to the city center. Even though I was alone, I felt very safe. The desk clerk would remember me and ask about my husband's health. I would not hesitate to book my clients in this hotel in the future.

<Content>Very charming hotel My husband and I just returned from a 3-night stay at the Estherea. We were very pleased with the hotel. When we arrived, they showed us two available rooms- one without a canal view and one over the canal. We paid the extra euros (45 a night) for the canal view room and it was well worth it! The room was spacious and comfortable. The hotel is in a great location- quiet, but central to all the musuems and restaurants. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Very Nice Stay -- Would certainly stay again We had a very pleasant 8 day stay in April, myself and my two sons. Their father joined us after several days, though we were given the Family room at the start, though at a reduction until we were indeed reunited as a family (of 4). The hotel is very conveniently located within the central ring of Amerstdam, on the Singel canal, and within easy walking distance to Dam Square Central Station. Day trips were therefore made very easy, and the hotel provided info if one preferred guided tours of the city and countryside. There are many very good restaurants right behind the hotel on the Spui and very conveniently located groceries (the ubiquitous ah:) and department stores within blocks. The hotel itself is run by very coureous and pleasant staff, is comfortably and elegant furnished, and offers a complimentry afternoon tea. Breakfast was good, though at14 Euros not a terrific value (though our 12 and 7 year old ate for free, which offset the expense). Had our room only been a bit bigger, things would have been ideal, but they were very fine, indeed, and we'd gladly repeat the experience.

<Content>Wonderful hotel We have just returned from a one night stay at the Hotel Estherea and found it to be charming, comfortable, and well located. We booked a triple through the hotel and were greeted as old friends at check in. Our room on the fourth floor didn't face the canal which we knew ahead of time, but it was spacious, beautifully decorated and very cozy. The bath was wonderful with a deep tub-shower combination and everything we needed as far as hot water, soft towels, and fine bath products. The front desk people provided us with a map and directions to the Anne Frank house (close-by), made reservations for us at an excellent local restaurant to coinside with our Anne Frank visit, woke us up in time to have a full breakfast in their restaurant, and had a cab waiting to get us to the airport in time for our flight out.This was a quick visit on our way home from France, but we plan to go back next April for a longer stay.

<Content>Best Location in Amsterdam, loved it! A quiet and upscale view of Amsterdam from the most desired location. It is walking distance to everything and anything and if you can't find what you are looking for, the very helpful staff will be pleased to assist you.We had a canal view room which was very big by Amsterdam hotel standards. Everything is immaculate and very clean.Staff are exceptionally helpful, we left our computer plug in the hotel and they had no problem posting it to us the next day. The courteousy was greatly appreciated.

<Content>Beautiful Estherea 11th April 2007We booked the Estherea through Hotels.nl. and loved our stay from 3rdto 6th April. From Schiphol airport we got the train from under the airport to Central Station. This was rather confusing for novices - you need to ensure you have enough coins to buy tickets from the machines - 3 Euro 60 each, or pay more at the ticket office. The hotel is almost a mile from there, so we got tram 5 to Spuistraat, from where the hotel was just a short walk. We were lucky to get a large room and bathroom on the top floor, but no view as it looked into the internal courtyard/lightwell. I was disappointed at first because of this, but it turned out not to be a problem as we spent very little time in the room. The room was very well furnished and decorated to a high standard. Everything was immaculately clean. Igor would have changed our room if we'd wanted to, but I soon got to like it. The staff are very friendly, helpful and polite. The ground floor of the hotel has sumptuous, classically elegant decor, which I loved, and we spent quite a bit of time relaxing and enjoyingthis area. The chandeliers are something else. They have put in a lotof thought here to cater well for guests, with a wide selection of complimentary beverages, in Delft china, on tap constantly in the foyer. Fruit, chocolates, pastries and cookies were also offered. All this can be enjoyed in the comfortable lounges/library/bar - somewhere to relax and enjoy meeting other guests. We enjoyed meeting some American guests - it is a sociable hotel because of these common areas. The tropical fish tank in the lounge area is fabulous - it has an awesome variety of fish, and various beautiful corals growing in it.The hotel is well located on the Singel Canal, a quietish (not much traffic - mainly bikes) upmarket area, where you are spoilt for choice for bars, cafes, restaurants and pastry shops within easy walking distance. Spuistraat, behind the hotel, has lots of restaurants and ends in Spui Square, which buzzes with cafes and bars. We enjoyed Cafe Luxembourg here. We also enjoyed dutch food at Haesje Claes on Spuistraat, Italian at Casa di David on Singel - lovely ambience, and Indonesian at Cilubang on Runstraat (we had the Reijstaffel, an interesting selection of small dishes rather like tapas). Broodje Bert, next block down, is good for very reasonably priced lunch. (Bertburger was excellent)!We had lots of rides on the Canal Bus - a fun way to get a good look around the city. We didn't use the trams because you can easily walk to most places from Singel You have to be very 'bike aware' as they are everywhere! I will hire one next time to save my feet from aching at night after so much walking on cobbles. I am already planning to return in the Autumn and would choose to stay at the Estherea again. Thanks to the staff for a super holiday. Sue and Richard (The Welsh folks from Swansea).

<Content>Great Place Just came back from one glorious week in Amsterdam, and the Hotel Estherea could not have been better. The staff was friendly and helpful, the room was tastefully decorated, and breakfast was plentiful and delicious. The bathroom was plenty big, with a double sink! The hotel is conveniently located on the Canal Belt and is in walking distance to everything Our room was on the fifth floor overlooking a canal, and this hotel even has an elevator. There is always coffee, tea, water, and something sweet to eat in the lobby. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Felt like royalty! The hotel was most welcoming, convenient, and quite accomodating in every way imaginable! Conveniently located in wonderful canal-front location! The decor was exquisite and the complimentary accomodations for snacks and meeting areas were wonderful. Fresh floral arrangements and Delft pattern china around the entire lobby , breakfast, and sitting areas! We met folks from California and Wales in the lovely sitting rooms as we drank our tea! I will definitely plan to stay here the next visit to Amsterdam!

<Content>a gem of a ahotel What a wonderful find the Hotel Estherea was. We stayed there for 2 nights in February this year. If you're looking for a small, comfortable hotel in a lovely part of Amsterdam with rooms overlooking the beautiful Singel Canal, then this is the place for you. The staff were extremely friendly and couldn't do enough for us. Each night they recommended and made telephone bookings at fabulous local restaurants for our evening meal. Our children loved the free tea, coffee and hot chocolate which was served in the lobby area. I can thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone, and would liketo add that I don't normally take the trouble to write reviews about anything!!

<Content>lovely hotel in great location This is a truly charming hotel right on the Singel Canal. Our room was bright and spacious and the bathroom was well appointed. It was a pleasant place to wake up in and to return to each evening. A bit formal, but not stuffy.

<Content>Good Time We stayed here for 3 nights in March and arrived at the hotel at 10:30 am and where very pleased to be told our room was ready, we were just hoping to dump our luggage and check in later. The room did not have a view but this did not really matter as we got a good rate. The room was a good size with a very comfy bed. The hotel does have a very nice lobby and seating areas where you can relax and enjoy the tasty free hot chocolate/coffee/various teas that was very welcome after a day shopping in the cold. We had a lovely time and have already recommened the hotel to others. If you are a light sleeper i would recommend earplugs as even though we where on the top floor we could hear traffic noise and the building works, but earplugs soon sorted this.

<Content>Tiny rooms but a great hotel We stayed for two night鈥檚 at 150 euro鈥檚 per night.This is an excellent hotel on balance. The location is perfect, a short walk from the shopping streets, central station, Dam square, etc. The staff on the whole was very friendly and extremely helpful with restaurant suggestions and directions.Normally we would never spend any time in the foyer of a hotel, the foyer was very inviting and cozy with comfortable seating areas, a little library and nice little bar with free coffee, teas, water and selection of afternoon cakes.There are two main problems with this Hotel, 鈥mall rooms (first room I was shown was canal facing, nice room but the size of a rabbit hutch (she said generously), asked to be moved, the next room was a little bigger. I don鈥檛 know if this was the only other room available or the guy on reception was being a sod but the second room over looked a builders yard, had a fighting couple next door and was smoking room. I had requested a quite, none smoking room, should have moved again but at that stage didn鈥檛 have the energy. Bathroom鈥檚 small, hotel should thing about refurbish them. 鈥he room was poorly sound proofed, I don鈥檛 know if it was just the location of our room or all rooms have the same problems.Just a word of warning to those of you who like a little smoke; this hotel enforces a strict no cannabis smoking policy, as someone on our floor found out (arguing couple )to the tune of 150 Euros which makes it a very expensive splif! Check out the little Greek restaurant next door, excellent food, reasonably priced! Also a little caf茅 called Broodje Bert a few doors down from hotel.I would recommend this hotel just be ready for very small rooms

<Content>Lovelely hotel We stayed at the hotel Estherea for three nights, 18th to 21st March and were given a lovely room on the fifth floor overlooking the street and city. It was absolutely spotless, spacious and very well decorated with a great bathroom.The public areas also were immaculate, cosy and very comfortable - it was a pleasure to come back to the hotel after a day sightseeing, especially as it was very cold while we were there - it snowed one morning! Coffee, tea etc. are available free of charge in the lobby and there is also a lovely little bar and a library.The hotel is in a perfect location to explore the city on foot. Public transport is plentiful and there is a tram stop two streets behind the hotel which we caught to get to Central Station and from there took a train back to the airport on our return home.. We also took a canal bus; tickets can be bought at reception and last all day and until noon the next day.Igor and the rest of the reception staff were all extremely friendly and helpful which made our stay all the better.There are numerous restaurants in the area, we especially liked the Haesje Claes on the road behind the hotel, which was very handy.All in all we had a great trip and will definately return to the Estherea, although next time we will try and visit in warmer weather!

<Content>Loved the Hotel Estherea Stayed at the Estherea for one night on Sat 17th March with my husband and 2 children. We had an absolutely fantastic time as soon as we got to the hotel, the lobby and reception areas are stunning, with a huge tropical fish tank which had the kids mesmerized. What you cant get from the photos however is the wonderful welcoming atmoshere the staff do truely care about their hotel. We arrived early but there was no problem getting our room early. The room was very spacious and light and airy and most importantly very clean. The complementary drinks in the lounge worked very well and my son was kept in a supply of biscuits. The hotel is very centrally positioned in a lovely area. The staff recommended an Italian restaurant Casa David I think it was called and the food there was fantastic. The hotel allowed us a late check out and were most helpful in getting us a taxi to the airport. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and would return here if we were to go back to Amsterdam. A big thank you from the Atkinsons.

Our room was on the fourth floor and we were given a canal view at no extra charge. The room was small but one has to remember that one is staying in a city centre town house. The room was very tastefully decorated and the bathroom was more than adequate with plenty of hot water to soak those tired limbs. We stayed four nights between 15-19th March 2007 and from the outset could not have asked for more helpful and conscientious staff. Advice was given as to a good restaurant on the night we arrived. Our flight had been delayed and it was 2145 by the time we booked into the hotel. The staff made the reservation for us whilst we freshened up and were also happy to make reservations for our choices over the following nights. The lobby of the hotel and surrounding lounge and bar are very comfortable and again very pleasing to the eye. I read previous moans about the breakfast and yes if you look around you will I'm sure find cheaper deals. However the hotel restaurant is cosy, with nice tablecloths and pottery and the choice of food and drink is plentiful (14 Euros per Head)The location is excellent being centrally located. Everwhere is within walking distance, but importantly the hotel is surrounded by great eating establishments. Directly behind the hotel is one of the best fish restaurants one could hope for. Lucius, Spuistraat 247. We went twice it was that good. Not cheap, but plenty of atmosphere and bistro appearance. Casa di David further along Singel from the hotel provided great Italien food, but recommend you book particularly on a week-end. Good, wholesome Dutch food at Haesje Claes, again behind the hotel, along from Lucius. Cafe Gommel around the corner (left out the hotel down the alley) is a great old bar and try the Cheeseboard for a good snack at just over 4 Euros. Finally, fresh pitta bread at the Greek adjacent to the hotel is well worth a visit.To example the great efforts of the staff, my wife lost both her wedding and eternity ring whilst in Amsterdam. We reported this to the reception, where before long one ring had been recovered from one of the washing machines in the laundry. The following day, the staff had recovered the second ring and seemed as happy as we were.Don't stay anywhere else in Amsterdam

<Content>Lots of others to choose. Generally a good Amsterdam hotel in a great location. A few small defects spoiled it for us. Original check in clerk was quite snooty and unfriendly. The room was good but the double bed was actually two beds pushed together with separate sheets etc. We asked for smoking room but didn't get it. Neighbours were noisey. The cabbie that the hotel called for us to get us to the airport did a tour and it was 17 Euro more than the inward trip. He seemed to know the snooty guy). BUT, bar staff and luggage people were very friendly. Only one beer on tap, though. Wouldn't stay again.

<Content>Wonderful experience at Hotel Estherea We had one night in this lovely hotel and can't wait to come back. The hotel is spotlessly clean, charming and comfortable. I loved the comfy bed, the clean bathrooms, the lobby with free internet, mint infused water and great atmosphere. The hotel conveniently located a short 2 block walk to Dam Square and the staff was professional and courteous. The room was quiet at night with a wonderful view of the Singel Canal. Highly recommended.

<Content>Not pleased Based on the reviews from this site, we decided to stay at this property for 3 nights. The location is great and the lobby and other common areas are very charming, but that is where it all stopped. We first given a room on the 2nd floor which was the size of a closet. We were abruptly awakened at 07:30 by the very noisy construction occurring on the floor beneath us and in the hallyway right outside our door. After complaining to the front desk, they moved us to another room up on the 5th floor, supposedly away from the noise. This room was even smaller with about 12 inches between the bed and wall. And as luck would have it, at 07:30 we were once again jolted awake by even louder construction noise right outside our window. It was very puzzling to us that we were never warned about the construction and that the staff did not seem to know where on the property it was occuring. Even if all the construction was not happening, I can't understand why this place was rated so highly. I guess most of the previous reviewers enjoy tiny rooms with dinky bathrooms where you can't even stand up straight in the showers.

<Content>beautiful hotel, but... This hotel has a fantastic location on the Singel canal within walking distance to the major attractions in Amsterdam. The lobby and public areas are beautiful. There is excellent coffee available any time and plenty of comfortable seats to sip it in. Our room was very nice looking, but you hit your head on the tv entering one side of the bed, possibly on the chandelier entering the other side! Renovations were being done in the hallway. This involved stepping over, or requiring to move, workmen with many tools and open cans of paint in a narrow hallway. The breakfast at 14 euros is obviously overpriced and there are many good cafes and patisseries to eat in. Stay here for the location. If you pay enough, perhaps you will receive a more spacious room with a view. Right down the street, Dante's Cafe was good for dinner and drinks.

<Content>Beautiful hotel wonderfully located This was my husband's and my 10th visit to Amsterdam. We travel there often for business and occasionally on our way home from another European cities. Each time we try to find a location in which we can call 'home' and return to each time we have to be in the city. We have found our 'home' in the Estherea. The staff were wonderful. The lobby is beautiful and our room was just lovely. We booked a deluxe room on the top floor. It was beautifully decorated with a great view of the canal and the houses across the way. We arrived early in the morning and they gave us our room as soon as possible. Internet service was fabulous, although there is a slight charge both in your room or in the lobby(10 Euro for 24 hours or 5 Euro for 1/2 hour in the lobby). We only had breakfast once upon our arrival. However, it is a bit pricey at 14 Euro per person, but it was good.I hate to give this place such a great recommendation because I don't want it to become so popular that I can't book a room when needed, but I will make sure I do that well in advance for my next stay in February of 2008.It was a great experience.Only funny drawback is the walls to adjoining rooms are paper thin. The couple next door were extremely and often amorous much to our amusement! Here's to love!

<Content>Reasonable and Elegant Loved the elegance of the hotel and is very centrally located and within easy reach of all the sights. The hotel is beautifully decorated and the staff are pleasant and helpful.  However, the one area I was disappointed with was that we were there to celebrate my husbands 40th birthday, which I had advised the hotel of, and yet they gave us the smallest room in the hotel (as could be seen on the fire escape plan). So if you have a special occasion, i'd advise you to ask to see the room before you sign your booking form.

<Content>Almost perfect My wife and I stayed here from the 14th to the 17th of February and we really loved almost every aspect of it. In a beautiful situation overlooking a nice canal, it has a nice reception area, a beautiful marine fishtank with the most gorgeously brightly coloured fish, friendly staff, and somewhere nice to sit and have a drink after a night out. To be honest, neither myself or my wife slept particularly comfortably in the beds despite other people commenting on how nice they were, but I never normally sleep well in hotels so that's not really a fault in my opinion. What wasn't a good thing though was having a load of scaffolding outside the window, and a pair of Dutch workmen having a bit of a natter before starting work, quite early in the morning. We solved this problem by paying the extra to get a room with a nice view over the canal, but no offer of a discount was made, and no mention of the work in progress was advised to us at booking, and I do feel as though we were taken advantage of a little bit as regards that. Once we'd paid the extra, and got the new room, we had a lovely stay, but sorry, it left a negative that hasn't gone after 3 weeks.

<Content>An elegant hotel at a reasonable price! I took my entire family - four kids - to Amsterdam on a layover to Tanzania. We wanted to be centrally located in a family-friendly, but nice hotel. The Estherea was very friendly. We arrived on an early flight and they did their best to clean our rooms quickly so that we could check in early. The hotel was very pretty, and the rooms were very clean and attractive. The location was superb as we could walk everywhere. We never took a taxi! There were also excellent restaurants within walking distance and the concierge was always willing to give excellent recommendations. If I ever return to Amsterdam, I would stay there again.

<Content>OK Let's get the good stuff out there:Location: SuperbCommunal areas: these make the hotel, they are old-fashioned but very cosy and you'll happily sit in the library reading the papers if you so desire.Service: helpful and friendlyHowever, I always look forward to two things when I go to a hotel, and they are a great room and a delicious breakfast. Breakfast was distinctly average, not a very wide choice. And the standard room was tiny. I KNOW this is standard for city-centre hotels, especially in a canal-house, but there was no floorspace even for our bags! We had to move chairs to get the wardrobe open, there was nothing in the mini-bar, the bed mattress was AWFUL and shower room was a different climate to the rest of the room, seemingly being located somewhere near the North Pole.Whilst I wouldn't put anyone off staying here as the prices are reasonable, it's not somewhere I would return simply because getting a good night's sleep is so hard.

<Content>All around great little hotel I have stayed there three time over the past four years. If they didn't just raise their prices substantially, I would have stayed theere again. Staff are great rooms are adequate size for three stars in Amsterdam. They have recently renovated the lobby, which must be being paid for by the price increase. Best location. Right on a canal. More quiet and quant than other areas, close to a lot of attractions. I even walked there once from the train station with a carryon roller bag. Their breakfast wasn't worth it for me. There is a great bakery and a small sandwih shop less than a block down the Singel on the same side. Ther is a great breakfast and lunch place on the second street further down the canal on the opposite side. Sorry I can't remember the name, but we went there instead. It doesn't open until 9 or 10 am though. If the price is right, this is the best place for that money.

<Content>Great hotel I travel to Amsterdam frequently on business and have stayed in many hotels in the city. I like the Estherea very much - lovely location, quality of the rooms is superb and the cost of the hotel not so extortionate. There is a great Greek deli just next to the hotel if you are looking for a simple casual evening meal - perfect for a lone traveller like me! My only complaint is that breakfast starts at 7am - it would be nice if it could start a little earlier. The hotel is a brisk 10 min walk to Central Station - along the lovely canal, what is not to like? Highly recommended.

<Content>Excellent Lobby...less than ideal rooms... Lobby is absolutely beautiful and the staff is very friendly and helpful! Our room was absolutely terrible and faced inward toward nothing at all. Good budget hotel in Amsterdam.

<Content>What a fabulous hotel! What a fantastic hotel this is. It is very convenient, quiet, immaculately clean, and has probably the best staff I've encountered anywhere. They booked a concert for us, taxis and restaurants, and were always ready to give advice and suggestions or just to have a chat. If a light bulb went out, it was changed at once. The aquarium was amazing: I never even knew that you could grow corals like this.The constantly available chocolate, tea etc and cookies or cake were so much better than tea-making in the room.Our room was a little dark as there was scaffolding outside, but what the hell, we were only there to sleep. The room had everything we wanted, (including BBC1 2 on the TV). Even though the refurbishment was going on, it didn't inconvenience us and the workmen were very polite and tried to minimise the effect of their works. Amazing to see the corridors newly papered in a day!This family owned and run hotel is an example to all.

<Content>Great hotel, even with kids With kids aged 9, 7 and 4, finding the right hotel with inter-connecting or adjacent rooms is vital. Despite having been promised this, the rooms we were given were separated by an internal courtyard and some distance apart, albeit neighbouring.The next day, we were offered alternative rooms which were right next to each other and from this moment on, we had a fantastic stay. The hotel was excellent with really friendly staff who used their initiative and for whom nothing was any trouble.Rooms were very good, well-equipped and very attractive. Worth getting rooms with a view if you can, not on the internal courtyard so you have natural light.Breakfast was not cheap at 14 euros each, but it was good and free for children under 12.The location is great with good access to tourist attractions and a variety of good local restaurants.This was our first visit to Amsterdam and it is a great city, even with kids. All the main sites are worth visiting and many are free for the children except Nemo which was 11.50 euros each. Riding the trams and walking the canals alone are worth the journey!The hotel was undergoing re-decoration whilst we were staying and the weather was pretty poor, even by UK standards, and despite this, we had a great time and would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel.

<Content>Fantastic hotel- shame about the building work Stayed at the hotel Estherea after reading excellent reviews on trip advisor. I travel a lot and am always a bit dubious about trusting reviews but this really is an excellent hotel, one of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in. The decor is elegant but the hotel is very relaxed with a friendly and cosy ambiance. Our room had been very recently renovated and was immaculate combining traditional decor, furniture and comforts with all the modern extras you would expect from a discerning hotel including an LCD flat screen.  Unfortunately for us as our room was so newly renovated,the room next door was in the process of being renovated which we found out as we were awoken at 7.30am to the sounds of drilling and sawing!. Was very very disapointed that a hotel with such apparant high standards would not have pre warned us of the buiding work at such close proximity, especially as I had e-mailed the hotel just 2 days earlier. The hotel were appologetic but only after I had approached them and I was compensated but would have rather enjoyed a more relaxing stay. Would still rate this hotel very highly as the buiding work is coing to an end, and guests arriving after the renovations are complete will have a wonderfull stay, however, if your stay is soon, I would check with the hotel before your arrival to avoid dissapointment. The hotel is idealy located for all attractions and there are some great neighbourhood resteraunts and bars. In particualr Casa di david @ Singel 420, about 5 mins walk, is an excellent Italian.

<Content>Helpful staff My parents celebrated their birthdays here recently and thoroughly enjoyed their stay. The management were very helpful and gave us a choice of rooms and even left birthday gifts for my parents, which was a nice touch. The canal setting is lovely and the location within easy walking distance of many sights. I can highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Lovely hotel!! Stayed at this hotel for a couple of days at the beginning of feb and what a great choice we made. It is situated in a great location on the sigel canal just a couple of minutes walk from Dam square. The hotel decor and furnishings are lovely and the staff are very helpful. The rooms are nicely decorated with a great sized bathroom and were very clean. I would recommend this hotel and hope to return to the Estherea myself during the summer.

<Content>Brilliant I spent a lot of time on the TripAdvisor site to locate a hotel which met our requirements and wasn't going to break the bank. I am delighted to have encountered the Estherea.Our three nights there were absolutely first rate. An extremely comfortable room, generous bathroom with large bath and huge quantities of hot water, a breakfast of a quality (and quantity) which set us both up for the day let alone the morning, very welcoming and helpful staff and a location which to my mind is unrivalled - close to all the main sights (and shops) and only about 20 mins walk from the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh gallery. And it's clean.And a particular thank you - my wife uses a wheelchair (the hotel is not easily accessable if you can't walk as there are four steps upto the main door but a lift serves all floors) but can walk a little bit. On arrival at the airport, we discovered damage to the chair we'd brought with us which rendered it useless. Holiday in peril. KLM called the Estherea who actually had a chair they were happy to lend us for the whole of our stay. The relief at this cannot be imagined! This is just one example of the service at this hotel which I cannot commend too highly.This hotel is friendly and we would most definitely go back.

<Content>Gem of a Hotel We stayed here for a long weekend at the end of January. Although I had read the reviews I was still a little nervous about the hotel, however upon arrival I was really pleasantly surprised. We arrived to a typical Amsterdam street, narrow with a canal and our hotel was a couple of the traditional houses converted. The reception staff were really friendly and we were upgraded to a deluxe room. Our room was lovely (room 216) with a lovely view overlooking the canal. It was immaculately clean, spacious with a extra large bathroom. If you a planning on staying I would recommend that you upgrade to a deluxe room and if possible ask for this room as our friends who were also staying in a deluxe room didn't get such a nice room - again overlooking the canal but not as large and a small bathroom. Another thing which I really liked was the bed linen, nice fluffy pillows and a lovely duvet, no horrible blankets. There was building work going on whilst we were staying however it didn't affect our stay. The location of this hotel is perfect. Literally just around the corner from Dam Square. I would definitely return to Amsterdam and to this hotel.

<Content>Lovely Hotel Hotel was lovely. Staff were friendly and willing to help even when we complained about some building work that was going on they were very apologetic and even gave us a night free. The hotel is a short walk from the city centre so the location is ideal. The free hot drinks and biscuits was a really nice touch especially when you come in from the cold. All in all I would definately recommend staying here if you are thinking about going to Amsterdam

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We stayed at the Estherea for three nights in January 07. We had room 110 which was a canal view room (we were upgraded for free from a standard room). We had a lovely view of the canal, four poster bed and the room was a good size with a good bathroom and nice powerful shower.The staff were very helpful and friendly and the restaurant recommendations were spot on especially d'theeboom (try the white chocolate mousse). The free cakes and hot choc in reception kept us going coming in from the cold. The breakfast was nice and filled us up but as other reviews have said there are cheaper alternatives outside the hotel.We would recommend this hotel to anyone. Its location is excellent and everywhere is within walking distance. We'd recoomend the Heineken experience, Anne Franks House and the Red light district is worth a nose around.Thankyou to Hotel Estherea for giving us a great hoiday.

<Content>A Gem This hotel is definitely a looker. Eye catching lobby area, beautifully appointed and adorned. Very cozy, the kind of place where you can sit, chat and drink till late in the evening. The rooms were equally as charming and a decent size for Amsterdam. The service was helpful and ambitious, providing directions, a decent hair dryer and generally trying to be one step ahead of our needs.The hotel is a little noisy. Not due to the clientel, but the generally tight quarters and fairly thin walls. If you require absolute quiet to catch 40 winks then you may need to mention this when you book. Also, the hotel is currently undergoing renovations. Unfortunately, we were not informed of this prior to booking or check-in and the work often started prior to 9:00.The hotel sits on a lovely canal and has some great cafes and restaurants nearby. The Luden quickly became one of our favorites. It is also just a few blocks from Dam Square and is generally centrally located to the city sights.Would rate 3 and a half, but will curve down due to the construction. Just came from a 4 star hotel in Paris and this does not quite reach that level, though the service is probably some of the best around.

<Content>Welcome to the Hotel Estherea... I stayed here with my 13 year old daughter, in January. This proved to be a really excellent choice. We had a room on the 5th floor, very quiet, well appointed and a large bathroom, by European standards. We did not opt to pay extra for a canal view-we were only there to sleep anyway !The public rooms downstairs were fabulous- comfortable, spacious and welcoming. The biscuits, sweets, and beverages on tap in the foyer were most appreciated.Front desk staff were most helpful, and always went the extra mile-they lent me an umbrella when it started raining, a cellphone recharger when mine packed up, and were spot on with their restaurant recommendations. Do try the Casa Di David, just 2 blocks down Singel straat, for the best Italian food in Amsterdam.Locationwise this is hard to beat- 5 minutes walk from Dam Square, Kalverstraat, Palace etc. We took the shuttle bus service from Schippol,and found it convenient, and good value for money.My only gripe about our stay there was the exorbitantly high internet charges- 5 Euros for 30 mins just isnt justifiable in in city in the world !Overall, a fantastic little gem, we will definitely be back !

<Content>Lovely experience in this charming hotel Stayed 3 nights at Hotel Estherea, and thought it was wonderful.Our pretty, very clean, room faced the Singel Canal, so the views were great. The staff was very courteous, the lobby was lovely and it was very nice to sit and enjoy the coffee and tea that is provided. Location is great, with excellent restaurants just behind the hotel on Spuistraat: Haesje Claes, D'Vijff Vlieghen and Kanttjil  de Tijger were our favorites. Centrally located for walking to the sights (don't miss the floating flower market on Singel Canel at Muntplein.)Can get a little noisy at times, creaking floors, people traffic on the street below, but it didn't detract from all the charm.Word of advice: when taking a taxi (we took one to the airport) we were told by the front desk that if the hotel calls, it is a fixed rate, yet when we got to the airport, we had a hard time with the taxi driver, who seemed not to know a thing about it. Check the cost with the driver first. This was not the hotels fault, however. All in all, a charming hotel and a good value, and I would definitely stay here again when in Amsterdam.

<Content>The Absolute Best Place This hotel is absolutely wonderful. It is oozes charm and elegance. We were there for four nights and have no complaints. The hot chocolate and cookies were a huge hit with my kids. They always wanted to go back to the hotel when we were sightseeing. We had a very comfortable quad room with lots of fluffy pillows. The beds with their comforters were wonderfully soft as well. The breakfast was included and was plentiful and superb. We were in Europe for 2 weeks and this was the first place where the American bacon was cooked to perfection. The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. Singh, at the front desk, even gave us ponchos when it was raining. We plan to go back to the Estherea for our 20th. anniv. in 5 years, but this time without the kids. It is a very romantic hotel.

<Content>Loved This Hotel My wife and I spent Christmas in Europe with part of our time in Amsterdam. It was my first visit to Amsterdam and my wife's third. She read a review of the Hotel Esthera on Tripadvisor. We booked it and crossed our fingers that it was going to be everything we had read and hoped for. It was! We had the nicest stay there. Our room was beautiful and big (no view, but who cares, we were sleeping!). The staff was top shelf. The breakfast was generous and great quality. The complimentary coffee, tea or hot choclate and bisquits in the lobby was a great touch and very welcomed. Overall, the staff and front desk could not have been more helpful.If you happen to get lucky and have Rudy meet, greet and assist you then you really will have a wonderful experience.No doubts, no hesitations. This is THE place to stay in Amsterdam.Hinkle, Austin, Texas

<Content>Wow - Christmas at Estherea; the best! We spent Christmas at Hotel estherea - chosen thanks to the many good reviews it was given. Our fifth trip to Amsterdam and the best hotel we've been to. Arriving in ( after trecking round shops and bars) to the 24hr tea/coffee/hot choc machine was heaven (no kettles to boil)! There was even iced-water with fresh mint!Public rooms very cosy and Christmas decorations very tasteful. (Bowls of chocolates on various tables)Friendly, helpful staff. Breakfast is optional - well worth the 14 Euros - especially the sausages and the muffins!Room overlooked canal ; was a great size and tastefully decorated (antique writing desk!) We'll definitely return.

<Content>loved Estherea I have just returned from a 4 night stay at Hotel Estherea and it was wonderful. The hotel was gorgeous and comfortable. Tea coffee hot chocolate on tap 24/7. There was also a plentiful supply of biscuits and delicious pastries all day and night great after a late night! The staff were extremely friendly efficient and helpful especially Rudi. As soon as we checked in we got a map, brochures and special offer vouchers to various tourist attractions with no pressure to go. Room we got was decorated in lovely peach tones bed was ultra comfortable but very small no where to put suitcase which in turn took up any extra room. but thats only a minor fault which didnt detract from hotel. Bathroom was lovely bath and shower and a plentiful supply of toiletries and super soft towels. Breakfast was included and their was plenty to choose from whatever your tastes hot and cold. Dining room was lovely. Highly recommend and will stay their again as it was right in middle of everything yet quiet at night.

<Content>Beautiful hotel Stayed for 3 nights, booked through Opodo online which was cheapest deal i could find that included breakfast. A good 10 min walk from train station!Really impressed with reception and decor, felt very relaxed with the place. Our room was spacious and very clean. We faced the back of the hotel overlooking a small street. I did request an upgrade with a canal view but i was told this was an extra 40 euros per night. So i declined. Bathroom was nice decor ,very small but with deep bath and shower. Breakfast good, also you can have breakie in your room free of charge which was lovely. Tea/coffee not in room but available 24 hours in reception. Help yourself. Also biscuits, fruit and toffees! We arrived late so ate at Italian directly behind hotel which was good for cheap food.We also dined at a traditional dutch restaurant along the same street called Haasje claes, which was fabulous. You need to book table there is was rammed. cost for two people 3 courses and good bottle of wine 拢58. There was a great atmosphere and the people were very friendly. Hotel was great location and withing easy walking distance to most of sights and Dam square and shops. Just around corner is a tiny bar that sells loads of different beers. We went there twice! We didnt go on trams so walked everywhere, but did do a canal boat which was nice change and gave us a rest.We had a lovely romantic break and the hotel was individual and charming with modern facilities. This beats any chain hotels.Get to tourist attractions early to avoid queues.

<Content>Loved it I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend in Feb 2006 for his Birthday. I never got round to writing a review first time around, but we're looking to go back to Amsterdam next year and I would love to go back to Hotel Estherea.This is one of the nicest hotels we have stayed at. The staff were excellent, location very good, we couldn't fault it. I was considering paying extra for a canal view room but found the standard room really good value, with one of the most comfortable beds I have ever stayed in. The free refreshments in the hotel foyer/reception are a welcome sight after trudging the streets in the February temperatures.Hopefully we'll be able to book the hotel again for next year, and yes you can find cheaper hotels in the area but it's worth paying that little bit extra. We would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Ignore any bad reviews - this hotel is all you need!! We're struggling to find fault with the Hotel Estherea. We stayed for three nights and found the staff extremely friendly and helpful.You'll find cheaper, but you'll struggle to beat the location. We didn't have to use public transport to get anywhere as everything is within a 10 minute walk. However, the hotel is far enough away from the centre of Amsterdam to have the peace that we wanted and that some of the cheaper hotels cannot provide. Breakfast at the hotel was not included in the rate but as other reviews state there is a great little cafe within a few yards which does the job for half the price (and this is even mentioned in the hotel guest book!). We tried the hotel breakfast on the last day as well and it was certainly worth the money and kept us going until the middle of the afternoon. The hotel also recommend a number of restaurants and we tried three of these within a few minutes walk and have to agree with the recommendations. Overall, we took cheap flights to see Amsterdam but didn't want a cheap noisy hotel. The Hotel Estherea provided us with everything it promised and we will be recommending it to friends and family and would return without hesitation.

<Content>Definitely overrated After seeing so many wonderful reviews on this website, I was determined to book a room there for a three-day stay in Amsterdam. I contacted the hotel directly, and was offered 2 rooms (one for my husband and me, the other - for my 17  20 year olds). Two days before arrival, I e-mailed the hotel to reconfirm the reservation, and specifically asked for 2 rooms facing the canal. Yes, the location of the hotel is superb, and a little family-run restaurant on the corner just outside is wonderful, but the rooms... please! We were given 2 rooms, neither one of which faced the street. The term tiny does not even begin to describe it, and the fact that it was July - hot, humid - and the room had no air conditioning... The staff gave us one small desk fan per room, and we asked for another one because it was sheer hell sleeping in a stuffy, airless room, but were politely told that there were no more fans left to lend. I repeatedly asked to be moved to another room, but was told that the hotel was fully booked and my request could not be honored. In short, our stay at Hotel Estherea was disappointing, but walking the streets of this beautiful city, seeing all the wonderful sights, taking canal rides - it all made up for our not-so-wonderful accommodations.

<Content>Excellent hotel, great location Just returned from a great 3 night stay in Amsterdam. We had a family room which was comfortable and clean. The lobby has an old fashioned luxurious feel with a library, leather armchairs, chandeliers and a great aquarium. The reception staff were all helpful and friendly. Tea, coffee, hot chocolate and biscuits on tap all day. The upstairs corridors were a bit uninspiring but that was really the only thing that struck me. The hotel is in a great location, on a quiet part of the Singel, a few miniutes walk from Dam square and the main shopping streets, but also close to the quirky shops and boutiques of the Jordaan area. Would definitely return.

<Content>Beautiful hotel A brilliant location, we walked down to it from the main station but got a taxi back! The cobbled streets are a pain to drag suitcases over! All in all we had a lovely stay at this hotel, we visited it with 2 friends. Their room was bigger than ours, the window faced an inner courtyard which they found quite noisy as they had the noise from 3 other rooms surrounding the courtyard. Our room faced the rear of the hotel so no nice views for us, plus it was tiny. If I was to stay there again I would request a room with a view of the canal.The staff were very polite, place was spotlessly clean. There was complimentary coffee, tea, drinking chocolate and cakes, biscuits and fruit in the reception which was a nice touch. We didnt eat in the hotel as the street behind it is full of fabulous restaurants. Plus breckie was expensive at 鈧?4 per person. We walked to the flower market every morning for food, which was great and only a 5 minutes walk.The hotel is in a great location, 5 mins walk from Dam square but in a lovely quiet area. Would recommend it.The only bad part of our stay was the cleaners were very noisy, they woke us every morning at 8 - 830 slamming doors. Plus the morning we were leaving there was drilling and hammering going on in the hotel from 7:30am which was a total pain. They could have waited until a bit later to start making noise like that!! We complained and were offered a complimentary breakfast which we declined. But this probably almost never happens we were just unluckly.We paid 140 Euros a night for a double room... not bad for a 4star smack bang in the middle of Amsterdam ;-)

<Content>not to be missed! A beautiful hotel in a beautiful location- we couldn't fault it! The hotel's situation allows you access to all major attractions of the city. The staff were very helpful to everybody- not sure why some reviewers think they are not. Access from the airport is easy- if you don't want to get a taxi get the train underneath the airport to Central Station then catch the tram to near Madame Tussauds in Dam Square- the hotel is only a few minutes walk from there.Great cafe on the corner and lovely little cake shop down the side street with fresh cakes every day- not to be resisted!Flower market- excellent for stocking up on spring bulbs and fantastic displays of flowers- great cafes nearby.Would go again tomorrow!

<Content>Impossible to fault! This is just simply one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in - and there have been many! My husband and I plan to return to Amsterdam next year and I shall not even consider staying anywhere else. The hotel lives up to all the praise heaped on it by your other reviewers and is also exceptional value for money.

<Content>ab fab!!!!! we stayed in this hotel for 4 nights bed and breakfast , and having read some of the reviews were a little bit apprehensive. No Need, this hotel and staff could not do enough for you. The breakfast was excellent with enough choices to suit anybodys taste. Our room was immaculate and cleaned every day with fresh towels if required. Anyone who complains about this hotel should really get a life!!!!!!!

<Content>Absolutely Excellent! My husband and I stayed at the Estherea from September 18-22, 2006. From reading tripadvisor posts, I expected the hotel to be great and it lived up to that expectation. Paying 124 Euro/night including breakfast but not a 5% tax (visit the utell website for their Great Rates), I felt that we really came away with one of the best hotel deals in Europe.Upon checking-in, I asked for a room on the 5th floor (none available). I proceeded to ask for a canal view (available for a 45 Euro/night suppliment). We stuck with our original room which was Room 217. The man at the desk told us our room was nice. I thought that was his way of consoling me for not choosing to upgrade to the canal view.However, the room WAS nice! And we were escorted there by a bellboy who carried our bag and showed us how to operate the lights and open the minibar in the room. The room has an entry way with a closet and luggage area on the left and double doors leading to the bathroom on the right. There is no air conditioning in the room, however, there are two small fans provided. There are a few English channels on the tv. The windows opened out onto the most beautiful street view. The bed was two twins pushed together, however, the bed and linens were amazingly comfortable. Soft pillows and two twin-size down comforters made it hard to leave the bed in the morning. The bathroom was incredible and only slightly smaller than the size of the hotel room we had just stayed at in Paris. Double sinks and a deep soaking tub were nice touches. There was always hot water and strong shower pressure when bathing. Both the bathroom and bedroom were kept clean.Service was excellent. From making restaurant reservations to giving directions and train timetables, the staff went out of their way to help us enjoy our time in Amsterdam. The coffee, tea, and hot chocolate machines downstairs were fantastic and the little cookies in their own drawer made a quick snack with the drinks.Breakfast was included in our rate and always hit the spot. Breakfast included: scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, bacon, sausage, various breads, cereals, yogurts, fruits, meats, and cheeses. To drink, you'll find a variety of juices, milk, coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. They'll even make you a cappucino if you ask. I believe breakfast is 16 euro if not included in your rate. The breakfast room can hold 60 people and it did get almost full on the Friday morning we were leaving.The location of the hotel is fantastic. We came to Amsterdam via Paris on the Thalys train into Centraal Station. It was approximately a 15 minute walk from the station pulling our suitcase. Going out at night was also very easy and there is much to see within walking distance of the hotel.It would be very hard for me to stay at any other hotel in Amsterdam now that I know how great the Estherea is.

<Content>Horrendous I stayed here on business for two nights - and it was the only place with rooms available due to a convention.It is quite simply the worst hotel I have stayed in. I booked one of the deluxe rooms. It was comparable to a 2-3 star hotel in the UK (which would have cost considerably less). The bathroom was absolutely tiny, with a folding door.The reception staff were the rudest I have ever encountered. Despite telling them I did not want my room cleaned (as I was working), the manager called to me to tell to leave 'NOW' so that they could clean it.The night before checking out, I asked the receptionist if he could book me a taxi to take me to the airport for the morning. He replied that there is no need to book in Amsterdam, as taxis can be called to arrive immediately.The following morning, there were no taxis available for at least 1 hour, and the manager informed me that I should have booked the night before, because of the convention. When I told him what his staff had said , he merely shrugged his shoulders and said 'his mistake'. There were around 15 guests who all needed to get a taxi, all of whom were furious. In the end we shared taxis, and only just managed to catch our flights.It is the closest to Fawlty Towers that I have experienced.

<Content>Perfect spot I'd read the reviews before going, and they did not dissapoint. This hotel was well worth the money. It is close to everything, only a few minutes walk to all the bar action of Leidesplein, shopping, and the flowermarket. The great thing is you can enjoy the noise and the action when you want it, and return to the quiet and calm of this hotel when you are done. The canal view is gorgeous. The room was very clean and adequate. Of course a bit small, but a decent size for a dutch hotel. Staff were extremely kind and helpful. Having a nice complimentary cup of coffee in the lobby lounge after a long day of being out made it feel like home. My one tip, if you know you are going for next year, book this hotel soon, it fills up fast. I will definitely stay there again. It was my husband's first time in Amsterdam, and the hotel was a big hit.

<Content>Really brilliant My husband and i stayed for three night starting September 15th. We couldn't fault it at all. The room was clean and very comfortable, the lounges superb and the dining areas immaculate. Everyone did as much as they could to go that little bit further to help . The only downside for the ladies is the beautiful dark haired receptionist. Keep you husband on a tight lead!!!. I think mine fell in love again!!! One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.

<Content>a great hotel I was in Amsterdam in July and thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the Estherea. This hotel was great. The location was perfect- the bedroom was very comfortable and clean and the bathroom was very spacious. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Little Gem The Hotel Estherea is a great little gem of a hotel. If you are looking for a quite place to stay along a canal this is place for you. The room I stayed in (Room 316) was a nice size for European room with a great bathroom. The bathroom had double sinks! No problem with hot water or pressure. The bed was great too, nice hard mattress. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I think this hotel is more of a four star than the three I have seen it rated.

<Content>Excellent Estherea My husband and I loved this hotel. The location is terrific! Our room was small, but well-appointed, comfortable and clean. Super comfy bed. The bathroom was a generous size (considering the size of the room) and very clean. The lobby area is simply charming. Our room had a canal view, which was greatly appreciated. The staff was welcoming, but not overwhlemingly so. Like others, we also opted to have breakfast elsewhere. Bagels  Beans is a hike, but worth it if you need a big cup of coffee in the morning. (Besides it's on the way to the museums if you're walking.) Overall, a wonderful experience. We would absolutely stay here again.

<Content>Recommended city break hotel Have just returned from 2 nights at the Estherea for my husbands 50th birthday. Very pleased with the deal we got from Expedia, as it was in a nice location, convenient to everything but quiet. We found some good restaurants in Spuistraat, 2 minutes walk - thoroughly recommend Luden, also a good tapas bar. Staff very friendly (as we found most of the people in Holland). Weather was not good, but hotel will lend you a decent umbrella. Breakfasts very nice, and tea, coffee, hot chocolate available 24 hrs along with fruit and cakes. Rooms perhaps a little small, but on a city holiday you do not spend so much time in the room, and as it rained both days, lack of air con was not a problem! I am sure it is very cosy for a winter break!

<Content>Excellent Hotel If you want a hotel in Amsterdam which is clean and tidy, has friendly staff, has excellent facilities, and is in an ideal location (i.e. close enough to the action of Leidseplein  Dam Square whilst being far enough away to avoid the more 'undersirable' areas of the city), then the Estherea is for you.On arriving you almost feel you're in a time-warp, with an austere lobby/bar area reminiscent of the 1940's (some would call it charm ?), however this seems to be the whole point of the hotel as it is a perfect deterrent for the ubiquitous hen/stag party element which is more suited to the lesser hotels scattered around the Central Station.As with previous reviews we avoided the Hotel breakfasts  opted for 'Broodjes Bert' cafe which is 30 yards up the road - excellent breakfasts in the open air (weather permitting) for Eu 7.00. Any negatives ? Prices of alcoholic beverages at the bar were a bit excessive (which probably explains why nobody seemed to use it), however I'm probably being picky. Overall, I'd 100% recommend the hotel for any of you over 40 (if you're twenty-something and on an Amsterdam weekend which involves excessive alcohol  partying, this probably isn't the place for you).

<Content>Loved our stay in this hotel I brought my wife here as a birthday treat and read a lot of reviews on trip advisor before i booked. The Hotel Esther茅a totally lived up to its billing as a great place to stay. We were there from 3-6th July 2006 and loved our stay. i booked on the hotel's own website which I found to be same price as many discount sites and I did book about 2 months in advance. I requested that the room be a canal view and i was informed this would be extra (45 euro) which i didn't mind paying. As i had mentioned to the hotel that I was bringing my wife away for her birthday, when we got to the room they had left a small gift basket for her, wishing her a happy birthday....nice touch!The room was small but beautifully furnished and had air conditioning (which not all rooms have, we needed it, Amsterdam was hot !). The staff were really friendly and helpful at all times. The hotel lobby is also beautiful with a huge classy chandelier as the focal point. Also Hotel Esther茅a is beautifully located on the Singel (canal), and is really central to everything.I would return to this hotel without hesitation and we're already planning our return! No complaints here.

<Content>Estherea is a gem! Spent 6 nights in this charming hotel, July 4-10, 2006. Our first room was on the 3rd floor, facing an inner area. It was a warm time and our first night was uncomfortable.The very helpful bellboy suggested we find out if a room is available on the a/c 5th floor, which we did. Apparently, the entire hotel will eventually all be air conditioned. That made all the difference! Our room, though small, was very efficiently arranged, with closets, drawers, built in niches by the beds. Our first room was larger and had a big bathroom, but the canal view and a/c were much more important. We appreciated the ever present fruit available, as well as the coffee/tea/hot chocolate machine, and the cookies and candies.... fun to have a drink at the bar and enjoy the extra treats at no cost. The location is great, and close to many restaurants and places of interest. We took the trams often, and really got around easily. Our friend was staying at a hotel with an enormous amount of stairs just to get to the lobby. I felt we were in the lap of luxury compared to her place. The Estherea is a very special place!

<Content>LOVELY HOTEL We stayed in the Hotel Estherea for 2 nights in mid July. We had a family room on the fifth floor and luckily had airconditioning due to the extremely unusual good weather Holland is having at the moment. All the staff were very helpful and friendly and they were really good with the kids. Very close to all the main sights of the city and we walked most places with a buggy and five year old who didn't complain (much!) The hotel organised a babysitter for one night for us. She was very good and the cost was cheaper than our babysitter at home. We would definitely recommend this hotel for young families and would stay there again.

<Content>Fabulous hotel Date: 18/07/06Reviewer: A TripAdvisor member. Liverpool.Just returned from a 60th birthday celebration in Amsterdam. The hotel is every bit as good as its description. The rooms were clean and spacious. Although not air-conditioned each room had a fan. The staff were brilliant and nothing was too much trouble. I do not recall ever giving an 'excellent' rating before but the Estherea merited it.

<Content>Good hotel, Great location WE chose the Estherea based on earlier TripAdvisor reviews and were not disappointed. My wife  I stayed for 5 nights in mid-July after completeing a Baltic cruise. It was fairly warm in Amsterdam and our second floor front canal view room (#210) had no A/C but the nights cooled off quickly and the provided fan helped considerably. We slept with open windows and although it could get noisy with canal boats and mopeds, it get quite quiet after 10 pm (11 on Friday night) so sleep wasn't a problem.It is a lovely, mostly residential/small offce area with loads of cafes and restaurants on Spuistrasse, the street behind the hotel as well as in the nearby Dam Square and Leidesplein areas. We especially liked the prix fixe menu at Luden as well as the more bistro-like Cafe Luxembourg.The hotel's breakfast was fine, better than many European hotels and 'only' eur14 (where many charge eur20 or more).I would definitely recommend this hotel based on its location and helpful, friendly staff.

<Content>great choice! We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and strongly recommend it. We had a room overlooking the canel. Our AC worked well but we mostly kept the windows open. The room was clean and the staff was helpful. Best of all was the location. It was terrific- close to everything. Also, the hotel recommended a place to eat near by and it was great. Breakfast at the hotel was overpriced but worth the money on the last morning when we were rushed. They gave us breakfast on the house when we arrived the first day which was very pleasant after an overnight flight.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We stayed at this charming hotel July 4th thru the 6th on our way back from a cruise in the Baltic. We had booked a room on the canal which was on the second floor. It was very beautifully decorated with lovely drapes, and wonderful molding on the ceiling. The bathroom was spacious and had a wonderful deep tub with shower. The only problem was that Amsterdamn was experiencing a heat wave with temperatures in the 90's. This of course was not the hotel's fault and we were lucky to be quick enough to put our request in to move to the fifth floor which did have air conditioning. There is also an elevator which is not always the case in these small hotels. The staff especially the bellman/porter was wonderful and gave us great recommendations for places to eat. We would stay there again but would book a room on the fifth floor not on the canal side as it can be quite noisy. The hotel has a nice little bar and breakfast room. We walked down the street (Singel) and had breakfast at a little cafe which only charged 7 euros for ham and eggs on a roll with tomatoes and fruit on the side, wonderful coffee also. There is also a great greek deli next door with fantastic food and very reasonable. This hotel is in the canal ring and you can walk to the central station from there.

<Content>A decent place Stayed in the hotel 3 days ago. We typically stay in 4 or 5 star hotels and resorts and while not being picky, we know when the place is decent, fake or a rip off with a storefront. We really liked this hotel for it's location, staff and ambience. The place is not really that small but retains the boutique hotel atmosphere. Stayed on the 5th floor, top floor attic- like room (# 514) facing a canal. The room was not large but functional and charming with large bath, safe, and mini bar. Complimentary coffee, tea, cocoa, fruit and snacks next to the lobby. Quiet canal street location in great neighborhood, only 2 blocks (5 min. walk) from the ground zero of Amsterdam, 10 minute walk (average pace) to Red Light District. The street in the back has plenty of good restaurants. We tried 2 restaurants recommended by the hotel in their room booklet and liked them both. Massage can be arranged by the hotel. The bell boy even carried a massage table for the lady that showed up. Front desk was very helpful. Just friendly people all around. The bottom line: very reasonable for the price. Beware of some Chinese and Middle Eastern/North African restaurants in the area which serve substandard food for inflated prices... with a smile, of course. Stick to what is recommended by the hotel or just use common sense by picking a place that is busy (not only with beer drinkers) and appears to have a professional setup. There are a lot of tourists in the area and bad restaurants don't really care about repeat business. Anyway, next time in Amsterdam we don't have to look for another place to stay.

<Content>Stay here!!! We spent a wonderful 3 days at this Hotel of which I highly recommend. If you arrive by train at Central Station you will not need to take anymore transport if you are staying at the beautiful Estherea as it is only a 15 minute walk from the station, 5minute walk from Dam Square and within 5-15 minute walk from the main attractions of the city i.e. Anne Frank house, Van Gogh museum etc. The Hotel is truly beautiful, with wonderful staff who always have a smile and friendly welcome for you. The complimentary tea, coffee and very tasty hot chocolate is a godsend when you come in with aching feet from all that sightseeing and shopping you have just done! Just pour yourself a drink and relax in the sumptuous reception area before going up to your room which was rather smaller than I expected, but immaculate which is important to me as I am VERY fussy!! The bathrooms are spotless too. There is also a good sized TV with plenty of choice of channels for everyone, last year in Tenerife all we got was News24!! And there is also a safe. Breakfasts are plentiful and very tasty with an excellent choice for everyone, English and continental, you serve yourself and can eat as much as you want. Our view over the canal was wonderful. It is in a lovely quiet backwater, you can hardly believe that you are only a 5 minute walk from the bustling shops, museums, cafes, bars and resaurants. Absolutely highly recommended for all.

<Content>Loved the Elegant Estherea Have just returned from our European holiday, and am more and more convinced about the advantages of staying at family run hotels.The beautiful Estherea hotel is a family run hotel on the quiet Singel canal in the heart of amsteredam. The main shopping and nightlife areas i.e. Dam square, Leidseplein etc. are a few steps away and one can never imagine that the hustle and bustle is so close to this tranquil and pretty neighbourhood.The hotel itself is classy and elegant, and the beautiful reception and bar area with its rich furnishing and beautiful furniture resembles an upper class country home, warm and inviting. The stunning aquarium in the reception area which my daughter fell in love with, is lovingly tended too by the owner himself. We were met at the door by the friendliest porter in the world (he helps at the bar too), and he pretty much set the tone for the rest of the staff who were extremely corteous and helpful.The room was bright airy and plain lovely, with great use of space and very rich tapestry. The beds were very comfortable and the linen of good quality. The bathroom, although slightly small, had all one required , fluffy fresh towels and complimentry toilettries of good quality. Needless to say, everything was very clean. The complimentry coffee, tea and hot chocolate facility (all day long} near the reception, alongwith fresh fruit and cakes was very welcome as we would pop in and out of the hotel with our shopping bags. A nice touch indeed !!Definately recommend this hotel and would absolutely stay here again when i re-visit Amsterdam.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful stay I spent 3 nights (June 1-4) at Estherea with a friend. Never been in an Amsterdam hotel before but the reputation of hotels there it's quite bad, therefore - after careful consideration of other Tripadvisor's members! - opted for it, especially after getting an excellent rate through the Otel site. The Hotel is in an excellent position, about 5 minutes walk from Dam Square (possibily the busiest and noisiest place in Amsterdam!) but it's located on a lovely, tree-shaded canal street and therefore has a pleasant, quiet location. Indeed it's so centrally located that we never took a tram during our stay to wander around the whole of the city centre! Even the Central Station is about 15 minutes walk (if your luggage isn't too heavy of course, otherwise it's just a short trip with tram). The room we got (511) was on fifth floor and in the back side, therefore absolutely quiet. It was reasonably dimensioned (not a large room but we managed to find a place for 2 luggages and 2 backcpacks without bumping on them at every step). Everything was spotlessly clean, most importantly the bathroom, where towels got changed every day. The service was awesome, people at the door always smiling, courteous and full of help. Also the buffet breakfast was plentiful and of good quality (several different types of bread, good brands for jam and cornflakes, etc.); there was also free availabitlity at all time of coffee/tea from a machine behind the main lobby, which was very welcome after a day of walking in the cool air of this fake summer! I will definitely choose again the Estherea if I will return to Amsterdam!

<Content>Loved the Estherea Lovely hotel in a quiet but central location on the Singel canal. Only 3 or 4 minutes walk from Dam Square. We (2 adults  2 children) spent 3 nights in a quad room on the 4th floor, with 2 sets of twin beds. The room overlooked Spuistraat rather than the Singel canal, but it was a good size, light and airy, with an ensuite bathroom. Room was spotlessly clean and had a TV with UK channels. Safe in room for valuables. Breakfast buffet was from 7.00 - 10.00 and included continental breakfast, fruit, and cooked. Breakfast was Euro 14 for adults but free for children and good quality and value. Free coffee, tea and hot chocolate available from reception area until 11.00 pm. Small bar near reception. Staff were friendly and helpful. No restaurant in the hotel for evening meals but we ate at a couple of restaurants recommended by the hotel within 5 minutes walk (Casa di David on Singel and Haesje Claes on Spuistraat) and both were very good. We would certainly stay at the Estherea if we visited Amsterdam again

<Content>Charming Hotel This was my first trip to Europe and I booked this hotel based on reviews in Trip Advisor. I loved this hotel. The staff were very nice and our room was everything I wanted it to be (#314). We had 3 windows overlooking the canal, the room was nicely decorated, and the bed was very comfortable. Very cozy and charming. The location was perfect....walkable to Dam Square, Flower Market, Museums and more. I also loved Amsterdam. We will return and definetely stay at the Estherea!!

<Content>Good small hotel in excellent location My wife and I spent 6 nights at the Estherea. It is a fine hotel, in an excellent location with a friendly, helpful, knowledgeable staff. Our room was rather large by European standards and was the only room in the hotel with a balcony. The balcony was lovely for the 15 minutes each day it did not rain. The bathroom was compact, but had everything one could need, including the expected soaps, shampoos, etc. My only reservation is the cost and quality of the breakfasts. At 14 Euros per person it was not good value for money. Much better could be had in neighborhood cafes.The location is excellent, within easy walking distance of most of the mian sights and museums in Amsterdam. Since it is only about 200 yards from the nearest tram stop, it is easy to travel anywhere else in the city. There are more than a dozen restaurants, of various price ranges and foods, within two blocks of the hotel and many more if one walks 3 or 4 blocks.We would certainly stay in the hotel again and would recommend it to friends.

<Content>Good location and comfortable, but... We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and our family had four rooms - all very comfortable and quite spacious. We were visiting Amsterdam for a family member's birthday. My wife and I were in a twin room on the fourth floor and our two children stayed in another twin on the same floor. The hotel staff were very helpful, particularly the night desk attendant. We arrived quite late and he was very efficient. The 14 Euro breakfast was okay but not very memorable for the price.One issue which did concern us was that someone in the room next to our children was using cannabis - the smell pervaded all over the fourth floor. We complained to the hotel management who apparently, knew that someone had been using because the cleaners had seen the evidence. The hotel info booklet says quite clearly that they do not allow drugs in the hotel and the management told us that the fourth floor was a no smoking floor anyway. They didn't seem very anxious to enforce their own rules. The hotel was clean and comfortable and is in a good location. Would go back again, providing they sort out their confusing smoking/non-smoking policy.

<Content>Nice hotek near Dam Square If you hate noise - this is a good hotel. It is not on the main street - it is off a canal. I was given a room on the top floor and had to switch rooms due to noise from a compressor/heater that was operating up there. Otherwise, the hotel is very nice, centrally located and pleasant.

<Content>Stop Sneaking in to our Room! Anywhere you go, perhaps the bottom line is you only get what you paid for... We chose this hotel because of the popularity on this site, but went for a 500 Euro for 3 nights (standard double) special deal. Upon arrival we (cheakily) asked for a canal view room but was told there would be 45 Euro supplement charge per night.So our cheap-rate room was on the 2nd level with no view. Instead there was a small, dark patio right outside our window and a few workmen appeared every morning - God knows what they were renovating - checking up  down outside walls. We kept the curtains shut but had to keep the windows open while we were in, as the room was quite stuffy and the bathroom had no ventilation (there was a tiny, tiny one which didn't seem to do the job at all)The walls  ceilings were so thin - we couldn't hear the next door but we could even hear people whispering in the corridor, footsteps on the squeaky floor upstairs were almost unbearable.Peculiar thing was this..... You return the key to the reception everytime you go out, so they know which guests are in or out. On the 1st day when we went out for a dinner, we left some lights on and made sure all our windows were shut (dodgy patio!), came back a couple of hours later to find all the lights turned off and one of the top small windows open. 2nd day while we were out they changed the furniture - changed the bedside table, entire dressing table  all our things in the drawers were taken out (ok but why? we thought we were in the wrong room!) Evening of the 3rd day we deliberately left all the lights on and went out for a meal, came back few hours later to find some lights off, fridge door wide open (again WHY?????) small windows open again...We're not making up the story! And certainly we were not on the magic mushroom or whatever that is!! As soon as we go out they come in to check the room, open the window for ventilation and sneak out! Well there was a safe in the room so we weren't too concerned about the security... Shower was powerful. Free tea/coffee machine at the reception. But then it would have been a lot nicer if there was a kettle facility in each room. The hotel's in the nice part of the city, stunning chandelier  aquerium tank at the reception... The mystery of freaky guestroom-checker remains, but besides that, I would only recommend this hotel if you're prepared to pay more for better rooms.

<Content>Lovely place We stayed here for two nights in mid-February and found it a lovely place from which to enjoy Amsterdam. The standard double room wasn't large, but it was very clean and very comfortable. When we were in the hotel we found ourselves relaxing in the beautifully decorated library reading papers and planning where to eat next. We didn't eat breakfast here, there are loads of tasty (and cheaper) places nearby. Best of all the Estherea was a perfect location from which to walk to most parts of central Amsterdam.

<Content>Do yourself a favour: Stay there We have just returned today from three nights at the Estherea. We can only echo the opinions of all the previous reviewers who gave it the maximum five yellows as we call them. The staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful. From the moment you walk into the lobby, which exudes its own charm with tasteful decor, you have a sense of stepping back into a more leisurely and refined age. My wife was celebrating a significant birthday and when we were shown into our room the management had left a gift of toiletries wrapped in cellophane on the table. This little personal touch together with the complimentary hot drinks sweets and chocolates show us that the large, soulless chain hotels have much to learn from the smaller, family-run hotels which go the extra mile.Amsterdam is a compact city and whilst the Estherea is in a quiet location it is no more than two or three minutes walk from the bars, restaurants and shops. This is the best of both worlds. The management gives guests a list of recommended restaurants within walking distance. We tried two of them, an Indonesian in Rembrandt Square and a Thai restaurant, both of which were excellent.We feel the hotel maintains high standards and is not overpriced when compared to similar hotels in other Continental cities.The acid test is would we go back to the Estherea. Answer: like a shot.

<Content>Exceellent Hotel! My boyfriend and I have just returned from 3 nights at this Hotel over the Easter break and it was wonderful!Ok so it isn't cheap but, it was well worth the money and I didn't begrudge paying a bit more for a fabulous room which overlooked the Singel Canal and was huge with a wonderful four poster bed.We found the staff extremely helpful and friendly, we left our bags at reception on our last day and were told to help ourselves to the free coffee and tea on our return to pick them up which was a welcome break.The breakfast was expensive at 14 Euros but we only had it the once and it made our Sunday a more relaxing day.We tried to get a cab to the Hotel from Amsterdam Central Station on our arrival but the cab driver obviously felt it wasn't a worthwhile route for him and told us it was only a short walk!! It took us 15 minutes, not a long distance but probably a bit far with two suitcases and late at night! We took the recommendation of eating at the Three Sisters in Rembrandtsplein on Saturday night which Reception booked for us and it was a delicious meal, lovely steak and great service.I would definately stay at this hotel again, it's location is first class and I will certainly recommend it to any of my friends.

<Content>A perfect location; good value This was our first visit to Amsterdam and it is hard to believe that we could have selected a better hotel in terms of its central location and the friendliness and helpfulness of its staff.We found the Estherea at TripAdvisor and booked via an agent. We stayed for two nights. When we checked in the total room rate was split unevenly between the first (Thursday) and second (Friday) nights - so it may pay to check rates for a wholly (cheaper) midweek stay if your itinerary allows. We were allowed to check in two hours early and were given a room without a canal view. However, the room was large, spotless and extremely well furnished so no problem there.The free coffee and hot chocolate were very gladly received on several occasions during our stay. If there was a downside with this hotel it was breakfast which was not good value at 14 Euros per person - the juice is not fresh, the cereals are still in the packets and the very limited cooked food was of average quality.Breakfast is the only meal served in the restaurant. Room service is provided by staff ordering from a sandwich bar and restaurant nearby. This appears to be a good policy, at least as far as the restaurant (Haesje Claes)is concerned as, when we tried to eat there, there was a queue leading into the street outside.We tried the hotel's 'favourite' restaurant, as listed in the guide in our room. This is the D'Theeboom which is less than ten minutes walk from the hotel and is on the same canal (Singel). We were so glad we took the recommendation - if we have eaten a better meal in the last ten years, we can't remember it! Get the hotel staff to book for you - we turned up without a reservation and were very lucky to get in.We would definitely recommend The Estherea to anyone visiting Amsterdam. We would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Disappointing We thought (logically)that by paying more for our hotel, we would be getting a higher quality establishment.What a disappointment!Our room was not big enough to swing a very young, very small kitten in, let alone a cat!There was no air conditioning and when we stayed - it was HOTThe reception staff were stuffy and unhelpfulI would not recommend this hotel and I will not return to it either.

<Content>A great hotel experience We spent five nights here, and were happy that we had requested a room on the canal side - not only a beautiful view, but quieter than the back side of the hotel. Though I must add that the block behind the hotel was busier because there were many great restaurants in this direction. It was great having so many places to eat so close by.The room was large, nicely decorated, and very clean. The public rooms were inviting, the staff pleasant, and the help yourselves coffee, tea, hot chocolate and fruit was delightful when you returned from outside, or when you just wanted to sit and take it easy. Go for the hot chocolate, it's really, really good.The Spui square was only a block and a half away and from there you can get trams all over the city. The hotel location was terrific.I'd suggest this hotel to anyone visiting Amsterdam.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel This was our second stay in this beautiful hotel - we did not have a canal view this time but our room was huge and so luxurious. This hotel is the best we have ever stayed in, the staff are so helpful and friendly and the location is superb. We had good weather too this time so all in all it was a great holiday. We will definitely return again to the Estherea and highly recommend it to anybody not on a tight budget. Also the fish tank in the reception has to be seen to be believed - fantastic.

<Content>Great Location My boyfriend and I have just returned from a two night stay at the Estheria. It is in a superb location with lovely communal rooms downstairs where you can relax and enjoy the free coffee, tea and fruit. Our room was nice inside the only drawback was the lack of natural light, the window looked out on to an internal 'shaft' along with other rooms so you couldn't really open the curtains; they were also doing work on an adjacent room which was loud at 8.20 am. This said everything else was fine and the breakfast was great. Ours was included in the price (through Expedia- although the city tax is extra on your bill at the end of your stay.. not much though).. There's a lovely little beer place practically on the door step (turn left at hotel exit then take first left down the side road) called Gollem. Try a Jenever (Dutch gin) with a beer chaser.. Dante on Spuistraat a bit further up is also a good watering hole. We had a lovely Indonesian meal near by at Kantjil  De Tijger on Spuistraat 291/293- just order the 'rice table' and see what you get.. wonderful. Also De Jaren (Nieuwe Doelenstraat 20-22) over the Amstel is great for a good view and a bite of lunch. All in all I would recommend this hotel, particularly for the fab location.

<Content>Nice hotel but not really worth the money Just back from a stay in amsterdam which is a lovely city to visit. It was as a present for my husband so I wanted to get a nice hotel. This one is lovely but definitely not a four star hotel by any means. After reading reviews on this site we didn't go for breakfast..there are lovely places around to get something to eat for far less than 14 euro which is what the hotel charges. We were in room 407 which is too the back but is so noisy..not sure if it was just the people in the other rooms or just the hotel in general. The free tea and coffee and fruit was lovely especially considering it was so cold. The reception staff were really friendly and the location is lovely. I had asked by email for directions to the hotel and was told to either get a taxi from the airport or the connexion which connects the airport to the hotels. I wouldn't go for either of these ways...a one way ticket on the train is 3.60 each and then it is about a 15 minute stroll to the hotel. A taxi would cost 42 euro.....There are some really dodgy looking hotels in amsterdam so you have to be careful but this was 300 for the two of us for two nights with no breakfast so I think it was a bit steep.

<Content>A little disappointed but not a bad hotel There are definitely some great things about the hotel - we were very grateful to be given a room immediately after arriving at the hotel several hours before scheduled check-in. The staff were efficient and polite, the free fruit and hot drinks most welcome and the location is great. However - as previous reviewers have mentioned - we often found the room to be cold, this wasn't helped by the fact that the cleaners left the window open each day after cleaning (even though it was snowing outside!)and one of the radiators wasn't working. Our room was located next to the lift and this combined with the thin walls meant that we were disturbed by noise from lift mechanism each time the lift was used. We didn't complain as our break was only for a few nights and we didn't spend much time in our room but given the choice I wouldn't stay in that particular room again!

<Content>Estheria--my home in Amsterdam What is not to like? My wife and I have been to Amsterdam twice--each time staryed at this wonderful small hotel. We already have reservations for june 13/14 this year. The location is superior. We are not the DAM square crowd---we like the relaxed atmosphere---there is enough fun a good restaurants for us--two fine pubs near by. We found the management and employees friendly and helpful at all times. We travel in Europe quite often and look for hotels like Estheria---small family run fine hotels---we have developed our own list and frrequent them when possible. Estheria is great.

<Content>luxury at an affordable price we have just returned from a 4 night stay. Our room although a bit on the small side, had a canal view which made up for the room size. The bed has to be one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in, with crisp clean white sheets. The hotel was very clean, it has been polished to perfection. The free coffee, tea etc was a real bonus.The hotel is in the best location for exploring Amsterdam. We have been to Amsterdam on numerous occasions and have stayed in many different classes and types of hotels,always trying to find one that is located centrally, that has a good ambiance, that is clean, well looked after with attentive staff. We have found it with the Estherea - we will not stay anywhere else. ps try the all you can eat ribs at the sing singel pub, turn right when you leave the hotel and keep walking you will find the pub on the right approx 200 yds.

<Content>Reception staff and cold room let it down we were asked to pay upfront plus a 鈧?0 deposit by a rude reception man because we did not have our cradit card. When we got back to the hotel that night the room was freezing. The night porter was on and said that there had been a few complaint and that he will get it addressed in the morning. The next day when i spoke to the same reception guy he said there was no problem and that i needed to turn them on myself. I have never heard of a hotel room that you have to turn on the radiator yourself. So 1 turned the radiator knob to a different position and when we came back that night the room was still freezing. We were leaving the next day and all we struggled to get an apology out of them. So basically was not impressed with the staff. Location was great and the place was nice and clean. Would not pay good money to stay there again.

<Content>Couldn't have been happier with the Estherea My wife and I have just returned from a 4-day break at the Hotel Estherea. The staff are friendly, courteous and could not have been more helpful. We found it to be a very relaxing environment. The rooms are more than adequate, very clean and comfortable. The tea/coffee/hot chocolate which is available free of charge all day to guests is most welcoming when coming back in from the cold! We would definitely return to the Estherea and would recommend it to friends and family.

<Content>Great location A great location within walking distance of interesting sites. Not too far from an American Express office which came in handy. Did not try the full breakfast in the morning -- the muffins and fruit on the continental table were enough. Great advice on restaurants, appreciated the loan of an umbrella, and help with directions.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful! This hotel is a wonderful choice. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They gave excellent restaurant and excursion recommendations. We loved the 24hr coffee, tea, and fruits. The library and lounge was a great place to relax. We had one of the smaller rooms facing the canal, but there are bigger ones. It was perfect for a couple. The room and bathroom were immaculate. The hotel is situated within walking distance of everything, such a great location.It was far enough away from the things, that it was quiet and peaceful to sleep. My boyfriend and I would definitely recommend staying here and will stay there again.

<Content>Great value, great location We stayed in this hotel for a couple of nights in mid February. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a canal view room free of charge which was a great start. The room was beautiful - a very decent size with a sitting area and a compact but very clean and well equipped bathroom.The on demand tea, coffee and chocolate in the lounge area was a real plus and the beautifully appointed library was a gorgeous place to sit and read a book or the newspapers provided.Breakfast was excellent. Bacon and egg available for those who wanted something a little more substantial along with the traditional breads, rolls, meat, cheese, yoghurt, fruit etc. English TV channels available in the rooms along with a well stocked minibar and safe.The staff were very efficient, polite and friendly.It is so well situated, very near the centre but quiet location. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to any first time visitors to Amsterdam.

<Content>Gorgeous hotel, great location! We stayed for two nights on our honeymoon in the Estherea, we opted for a canal view room which was well worth the extra. They gave us an absolutely beautiful room with a four poster bed and a gift pack to congratulate us!The free coffee/hot chocolate 24 hours is great and there are really comfy sofa's and seats with books to read and you feel really welcomed there. The foyer is beautiful too. Location is fantastic, really easy to potter around and are some brilliant european cafes/bars really near by. Price was really reasonable too. If you are going for a romantic weekend in Amsterdam, or wanting to do the city (rather than take in the dope cafes and seedier end of town - although admittedly we did go for a walk round that area!)then this is definitely the place to say. Highly recommend, it made our honeymoon!(We also avoided breakfast there due to price and found a lovely place 4 doors down that was really nice and much cheaper).

<Content>Worth every euro My wife and I stayed at this hotel for five nights. She is a bit of a bathroom snob and is wary of European bathrooms. In this case, the bathroom met her standards: large tub, plenty of room, large sink bowl. We also appreciated the 24 hour coffee in the lobby. The staff was very attentive and their command of English was excellent. The bed was comforatble and spacious.It is also in a good location, near a lot of things but not too busy. As was the case with another traveler, we were occasionally disturbed by a bit of nighttime noise outside our window, but it was nothing extraordinary. Amsterdam is, after all, a big city.

<Content>Wonderful hotel My husband teenage daughter and myself arrived at this beautiful hotel on a cold snowy day and were greeted by a friendly member of staff who advised us that there was free tea, coffee and hot chocolate in the lounge all day to warm ourselves up. we were then shown our room by a member of staff and shown where everything was and our to use the safe. The only draw back was that there were not many drawers in the room but this did not matter for only two nights. My daughter was on a folding bed and did not worry. The room was large and warm and the bathroom lovely. There were two sinks but I would advice anyone that is fussy to take their own shampoo. I had read a previous reviewer and packed some. As well as the hot drinks there were biscuits and sweets around the hotel and very much appreciated after the cold wet walks.The hotel recommends several restaurants and we tried one two minutes walk at the back of the hotel it was Dutch and the food delicious we also tried an Italian that they recommended and the food was also very good.The breakfast although expensive at 14 euros was delicious and set us up for the day and gave us the chance to try Dutch cheeses and some of their jams.Our room was warm and we even managed to watch English television enjoyable on a very cold night

<Content>Perfect location We read many reviews on this site before booking and the Estherea Hotel really does deserve its high rating. We booked a standard room, which we did find quite small but we weren't intending to spend much time there so wasn't an issue. What was a problem were the decorators that started work next door at 7am, we mentioned this to reception and they offered us an alternative room (bigger and better view) immediately, no fuss or hassle. The hotel staff were all friendly and the hotel has a nice relaxed atmosphere, which was always a pleasure to return to after a hard day touring Amsterdam. The location is perfect and very central to all museums and restaurants, would highly recommend the Estherea and will definitely return again ourselves.

<Content>Non smokers beware! I went to Amsterdam for the first time with my spouse last weekend. We stayed at the Estheria for 2 nights in a deluxe room (room #114).At first we were very satisfied by the hotel because it is beautiful, our room was large, clean, well decorated, and had a nice view on the canal, and the staff made a good impression on us.The first problem arose on the first night: our room was on the first floor and we were disturbed around 1a.m by a group of people talking loudly right under our windows, probably waiting for some friends on the doorstep of the hotel. Apparently, nothing special has been done for (external)noise insulation. However it only last 15 minutes and thus was a minor problem. Note that we could not hear any noise coming from other rooms.The second problem was of much greater importance. We asked for a non-smoking room, as usual, because we are, though french, very sensitive (negatively) to cigarette smoke. The room was indeed non-smoking, and nobody had smoked in our room, but the room in front of ours (room #115) was a smoking room. And the guests in room #115, in their right, were unfortunately smoking a lot. Our room was invaded by smoke all night and we had to sleep with an open window in spite of the outside temperature (I would say around -5 掳C). At the reception, after checking the corridor, they admitted that there was indeed a lot of smoke but could not do anything because room #115 was a smoking room and the hotel was full (so that they could not give us another room).We thus spent a terrible second night in that hotel.We however appreciated the breakfast (non smoking area). Note that it is not included in the room price (extra 14 EUR per person).Note also that the hotel has no restaurant but that there are plenty right next to it.I did not ask for any discount (not my style, at least with my wife standing next to me :C), but when I checked out, they did not ask me whether I had enjoyed my stay, they did not apologize, and did not offer any kind of compensation.Apart from that, Amsterdam is a beautiful city and we had a wonderful time wandering in its streets and visiting a few of its museums.

<Content>17th century canalhouse charm My girlfriend and I loved the Estherea. This was my second time in Amsterdam, and the hotel was definitely better than where I stayed the first time. PROS1) Central location on Singel, which is the innermost of Amsterdam's four concentric canals. Roughly 3 blocks from Dam Square, with easy access to virtually all Amsterdam attractions. You can walk anywhere from here or catch a tram, but if you have luggage, a taxi is Eur 10 or less from Amsterdam Centraal. 2) Very attractive lobby with extensive sitting areas, a big aquarium, and all the charm of a 17th century Dutch canalhouse. 3) Well-decorated room with soft lighting, a soft off-orange paint job, and very comfortable bed.4) Responsive management. We had a billing problem that was very quickly resolved by management.5) Informative website with detailed property history.CONS1) Breakfast is 14 Euro extra. We skipped it. There are dozens of quaint little cafes within a 10-minute walk of the hotel, most of which have English menus and good breakfasts for Eur 6/person. Just walk in the direction of Jordaan.2) Bath amenities. You'll encounter quintessential Dutch cheapness when there is no soap, shampoo, or conditioner in the bathroom. Instead, there is a wall-mounted bottle of institutional-style chemical ooze that is said to work on both hair and skin. My girlfriend had a rough time, getting neither clean hair nor skin.3) Views. If you want a canal view, be sure to ask for it (and pay extra). Our room had a view of a ventilation shaft and caught a lot of noise from the teenagers across the ventilation shaft. The clientele of the hotel appeared to trend towards college-age Americans and families.Also note: wireless internet is 10 Eur per 24 hours.

<Content>Fabulous Husband and I stayed at Hotel Estherea from 11th to 13th Jan on our first trip to Amsterdam. Although we had a really hectic schedule and so did not spend a lot of time in the hotel, it really made our stay special.Its location is excellent - very handy for Dam Square, trams to wherever you want to go, and the street behind the hotel is packed with fantastic restaurants (recommend 'Five').There's such a lovely ambience from the moment you enter. Our room (212) had a canal view and was pleasantly and comfortably furnished.We did pay extra for a 'deluxe' room since they told us that was the only way we'd get a canal view, but another couple we met paid the standard rate (98 Euro) and also got a canal view.We also paid for wireless internet access for the first day, but then discovered so many unsecured networks in the vicinity that we didn't pay for access the second day, since we weren't too worried about internet security.The most expensive (reputedly) brothel in Amsterdam is a few doors down, but it's very discreet and the area in general is very upmarket.Highly recommend it (the hotel, that is)!

<Content>Delightful place to stay What a charming and warm hotel. This is so perfectly situated, in a delightful setting overlooking the Singel Canal. Three frontage canal houses make up this hotel. On entering, the reception is warm and inviting. The staff were helpful, the porter made us welcome showing the lovely lounges and breakfast room. A nice touch is the self service tea coffee and chocolate, plus the cookies in the draws beneath. It was great after a day of sight seeing to collaspe in a comfy chair and help yourself to a cuppa.As for our room, overlooking the canal, it was simply charming, room 110 will make you feel like you are on your honeymoon again! While the busy city called to be explored the lure of the cosy room also called on my tired feet. Just delightful.All in all a perfect location and a wonderful hotel. Everywhere was spotless. I feel that the owners are so proud of there hotel and so they should be. Always request a canal view though as it buts you on the best side.

<Content>Wonderful Experience We were traveling with a group of 5 couples and just completed a 14 day river cruise from Budapest to Amsterdam. Found the Estherea on the internet and it had received some nice reviews from fellow travelers. Price was right too. We were not disappointed. The rooms were spacious with a large bathroom. Our room was on the warm side but the hotel staff supplied us a fan which really helped. The lobby was had a wonderful decor and the staff was extreme helpful. Estherea is right on the Single canal and all the main attractions were within easy walking distance - Ann Frank House, Dam Square, Red Light District, Flower Market, etc. The hotel only serves breakfast which I thought was pricey. My wife ate there both mornings and said it was very good. There are a couple of pastry shops in the next block which were excellent. We highly recommend the Estherea.

<Content>Felt like a princess!!!!!!!! My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night. It was my first time to Amsterdam and I was told the city is not known for there hotels. I was so impressed with our hotel, it was classy and vintage everything I was looking for. The room was so spacious and clean and it had a beautiful big canopy bed and a view that was to die for. Ask for a room looking onto the canal. My boyfriend had been to Amsterdam before and was never happy with the size of room as he is 6'3. He loved the hotel too! It is also very central and easy to get around the city. I loved it and would definately go back.

<Content>Welcoming hotel, great location, friendly staff We stayed at the hotel for one night in November and as soon as you walked into the reception it was warm and welcoming. Complimentary coffee, tea and hot chocolate are available in the reception area and you can sit in the lounge and watch colourful tropical fish swimming around living coral in a fish tank. It was my daughters birthday and they gave her a fantasic room overlooking the canal, we had a room at the back of the hotel and although there was no view it was comforatble, nicely decorated with an excellent bathroom.The breakfast included fresh fruit salad, sausages scrambled eggs etc as well as cheese and cold meats which was more than enough to set us up for a day of sightseeing.And the great thing about the hotel is the location, you are right on the canal area with interesting streets nearby and restaurants etc within easy walking distance.To get there from the airport you can catch the train to centraal station (3.5 euros) and then catch a tram number 1,2 or 5 and get off at the third stop. It is a few minutes walk to the hotel.I will definitely be staying here the next time I come to AmsterdamPS they have a temporary outdoor ice skating rink in Dam square for the christmas period definitely worth a go - if you dont mind making a fool of yourself !

<Content>Fantastic place My girlfriend and I just spent a few days in this hotel and we were very happy. The location is just excellent, everything is at 5 - 10 min walk but the canal is silent and calm.The people working at the desk are very helpful and professional. A girl (unfortunately I do not recall her name) hepled us in finding cool resturants and took care of all reservations and also advised us of a resturant.The best part are the rooms. Our room faced the canal and was clean and very cosy, perfect for a couple. The bath is just great, big, clean and it had a bathtub! Immagine the whole day walking around Amsterdam in the cold and then going back in the hotel room and jump in a steaming hot bathtub...perfect!

<Content>Excellent Hotel We spent a long weekend in this hotel in September 2005 and found everything we had read in the reviews to be true.The hotel is in a great location for touring Amsterdam and although near the centre you are not disturbed by noise at night.Our room was beautiful and had a lovely view over the canal. The decor was tastefully done and everything was spotlessly clean.We found the staff to be very helpful and pleasant at all times even phoning the lost property office for us when we left our camera bag on the tram.The courtesy free tea, coffee and fruit is an excellant extra touch which we have not had before in any top class hotel.The only thing which we felt was lacking was the fact that the entire public area on the ground floor, including the bar area,was non smoking and while we accept this suited many people, it surely would have been possible to select one small area where smoking was permitted. Smoking was allowed in the rooms so it was not a problem but it did mean we did not tend to sit for too long in the public areas as we would have done between our sightseeing trips.On the whole, I would recommend this hotel and we will certainly stay here when we return to Amsterdam.

<Content>Great location, staff and room I was only there for one night before flying back to the states but after seeing the location (not too far from the Central Station but not too close), the room and being greeted by the friendly staff, I wanted to stay longer! I had a view of the canal from my good-sized room (as opposed to many European rooms that are rather cramped). There's a charming library on the ground floor to watch the world go by while having tea. I've stayed in a number of hotels in A'dam but I'll be going back to Estherea from now on.

<Content>Well served at the Estherea After reading the great reviews of this hotel, I decided to check it out. The 24-hour free coffee, tea, and fruit is a great plus. Computer internet is available in the lovely lobby at a beautiful wooden desk for 7 euros per hour, purchase the card at the hotel desk. Most staff were gracious except for one gruff older gentleman behind the desk. He was being imposed upon by all customers. It was a wonderful stay for the price.

<Content>A very nice hotel at a nice price We were very happy with our three night stay at the Estherea. We got an excellent weekend rate of 99Euros/night, and felt we got very good value. They also provide a 5% discount for paying with cash. The hotel is very clean and nicely decorated. As mentioned in other reviews, there is complementary tea and coffee in the lounge and small snacks. They have a library with travel books which we were able to borrow and take to our room to read. Our room had no view at all - looking into a window-well, but was large and very clean. There is really nothing negative to say for the rate we paid.

<Content>Great Amsterdam Hotel We highly recommend the Hotel Estheria. The hotel was beautifully appointed, the service friendly and the location can't be beat. We had a room overlooking the Canal. The room was small but spotless and comfortable. Great neighborhood in easy walking distance to all the sites. Go and enjoy!!!

<Content>Lovely hotel My husband and I spent four days at the Hotel Estherea, and we not disappointed! The hotel was very clean and the decor of the lobby area was pretty impressive.Breakfast on the other hand is not impressive, 14euros for not very much, we didn't have it, but we heard other guests talking about it!We found the staff very friendly and are happy to advise you of where to go and what to do.We had a room on the fourth floor, which was a good size, but not the greatest of views, but since we were there to sight see, we weren't bothered. We would definately recommend this hotel to anyone.Louise

<Content>Too beautiful for just 1 night I was recommended this hotel by my travel agent. After reading ALL the reviews at Tripadvisor, I was rather looking forward to seeing the place for myself. I stayed just 1 night in this beautiful hotel. I was fortunate enough to get a room with a canal view and a double bed just for me!! The staff were friendly enough, though I received a somewhat cold and confused reception on my initial arrival. My room looked like it was recently renovated, although the door looked like someone had tried to break into it. At the lobby there was ample FREE muffins, pastries, tea and coffee. The ONLY downside was that I was misled into thinking that the hotel wasn't far from the Centraal train station - in fact, it took me close to 30mins of walking (with luggage and backpack)! *phew* Overall, it was more than sufficient for my purpose - a place just to shower and sleep. I'd love to go back there in the future.

<Content>Locked out at 4am as night porter went for a sleep I was very disappointed to return from a night out at approx 4am  find several other guests on the doorstep.We were all locked out  despite ringing the bell, knocking on windows  phoning the hotel we were unable to get access until 5.30am - when the night porter woke up.When we complained about this the next day we were simply told that it would not occur again, although I would have expected some type of recompense or even a drink in the bar to compensate up for all our trouble.The hotel was charging 260 pounds a night for a room that we couldn't get to.

<Content>Lovely place to stay Having read all the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor I was confident we had chosen a good hotel and we were not disappointed. As the trip was to celebrate a birthday I had requested a canal view room. Although we did not have a canal view we were given a great room on the top floor with a balcony and the staff even gave a small present on arrival.From photos I have seen some of the rooms are on the small side, (although our room was a good size), BUT as a tourist out for most of the day how much space do you need? Our room (as well as the lobby, lounge area and restaurant) was spotlessly clean, richly decorated and had more charm than all of the large chain hotels put together. The hotel was on a quiet canal away from the busy/noisy streets but within easy walking distance of most places of interest and some nice restaurants and cafes. If I ever return to Amsterdam I will certainly stay there again.

<Content>What a nice surprise This was one of the nicest hotels I have stayed at in Amsterdam. I and my friend thought it closer to Centraal Station, so we opted for walking to the hotel instead of taking the tram. Should have taken the tram just one or two stops! But on arrival we found a beautiful hotel, from the lush reception and lobby area, to the bright and richly appointed room. It was very comfortable, and the bathroom was larger than we expected. The only downside was the airconditioning...although there were controls in the room, the temperature never seemed to change, so the room was always a bit stuffy.Overall, a very comfortable and luxurious hotel located right on one of the Amsterdam canals. I would definitely recommend this hotel, and would stay here myself again.

<Content>Much Better than Expected My husband and I stayed at this hotel in mid August. I was pleasantly surprised. This is a 2 star hotel? It is nicer than 3 star hotels I stayed in previously. The room was beautiful. We got a room with a view of the canal. Beautiful bathroom. The lobby is exquisite. Having all day access to a hot drink and a cookie or a fruit. Really nice touch. A quick walk from DAM Square and then all the other action. The staff was great. My advice... don't stay anywhere else - this is truly great value for the money.

<Content>Better than expected Beautiful hotel, very comfortable and luxurious. Decorations were superb, especially the chandeliers. From the outside looks very ordinary, but inside was a surprise. Especially appreciated the freely available help- yourself coffee, tea, hot chocolate, biscuits, fruit, and jars of sweeties!Did not have breakfast as thought it was very expensive. A family of four would pay over eighty pounds if having two breakfasts on a short break - which is exorbitant. Originally asked via internet for a view overlooking the canal but told there would be a supplement. but when arrived a room with a view was available without the supplement - so worth asking when you get there.

<Content>Great location great value My second stay here; the hotel has been refurbished since I last visited and is even better. We were not lucky enough to have a canal view room but ours was comfortable and attractive.The hotel has a cosy bar, pleasant breakfast room and library area. Although there is no restaurant for evening dining there are dozens of bars and restaurants within 5 minutes walk.All the attractions of Amsterdam are easily accessible, but despite this the hotel is very peaceful and relaxing.The staff are friendly and professional.All in all a great value hotel

<Content>Great, luxurious hotel! We have just returned from a 3 day stay at the Hotel Estherea in Amsterdam. We found the hotel lavishly decorated with warm and welcoming staff. Although our hotel room was quite compact it had a beautiful view of the canal and surrounding area and was tastefully decorated. The hotel is situated close to many of the popular tourist areas of Amsterdam but a good distance from the more seedy areas so guests never feel uneasy or unsafe. All in all we had a fantastic time and would definitely choose to stay here again.

<Content>the best in town Both my wife and i spent my 40th birthday in amsterdam recently and we chose to stay at the hotel estherea. This hotel is fantastic for couples and familys, it's no good for back packers or people on a budget as it's quite expensive. But if your looking for luxury at an affordable price, then you need look no further than this wonderful establishment. So if your planning a trip to the dam with your wife or girlfriend and choose to stay anywhere other than here, your making a big mistake! Go, be happy, n-joy!

The best thing about the hotel is its location, but that's not to say that it is the only good thing about it. But first things first.Adjoining the Spui, in the inner part of the Western Canal Belt on the Singel, near the Jordaan, near the Beginhof, with many excellent restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping areas and major tram access all within very close walking distance, it is probably as well located a hotel as there is in Amsterdam. It is amazing that this place can maintain relative quiet but it does. The rooms are small, but clean, with very nice bathrooms. The first room we were taken to was not exactly to our liking (though we would have been fine had they not been willing to let us change) but the staff was very nice and made a room change to a room that was more to our liking with little effort. Both rooms had canal views. They offer free coffee, tea and hot chocolate (available 24/7), they have a nice bar and a breakfast room with a typical dutch buffet breakfast (we didn't eat there -- we chose to eat breakfast at several nearby places that gave a much better slice of local experience). The hotel has apparently been owned by the same family for a long time, and it is pretty obvious -- much of the staff seemed related to one another. We were very happy there, more for the location than the rooms themselves, but there were nice amenities, nice rooms and excellent value for the money (and the location is definitely superior to many far more expensive and only marginally nicer hotels). At the end of 6 nights, we weren't sick of the place, which also says something.A word to those who care about such things. The Estherea is not cannibas friendly -- they politely but firmly make it clear that cannibas smoking is not allowed in the hotel. However, being within a block of Tweed Kamer, one of the most interesting and eclectic coffee shops in Amsterdam, and several others as well, it really didn't matter. Cheers!

<Content>Fantastic value for money Just come back from a 3 night stay in the Hotel Estheria in A'dam. A 4 star hotel located 2 minutes walk from Dam square overlooking a beautiful canal and walking distance from the station.We paid 拢66 per night without breakfast but got an excellent sized room which was clean, attractive and had an great bathroom.The only negative points about the hotel were the staff looked down on us a little (not mid-forties with beard) and no tea / coffee facilities in the room (free tea/coffee/chocolate in lounge with a large selection of fruit for free)Only minor points but will be staying there again in September.Try the DutchFlyer website (Stena lines) when travelling from UK - 拢50 return from London to Amsterdam station including ferry crossing. Great value and a good alternative to flying.

<Content>Loved the Hotel Estherea Beautiful lobby with great free coffee and tea service! The rooms were comfortable but not luxurious like the lobby. I would definitely stay there again! Check the internet for better than advertised room rates.

<Content>Excellent Hotel We have just returned from a 2 day stay at the Estherea. Contrary to other reviews we found the reception staff very courteous. We stayed in room 316 which did not have a canal view. The rooms were very clean and very quiet. The only thing lacking was air conditioning in the rooms. Perhaps not the best hotel to go to if you suffer from hayfever, as the public rooms are tastefully decorated with fresh flowers. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and would not hesitate to stay again at this hotel.

<Content>A fantastic hotel My husband  I have just returned from a 3 night stay in the Estherea hotel.We booked after checking the reviews on the site. I can honestly say that it was great. The staff were friendly  extremely efficient. We stayed in room 513  although we didn't have a canal view, the room was large  quiet. It was well decorated with lots of lighting. The bed was extremely comfortable, bathroom was small but compact  nicely decorated.A lovely touch was the free tea, coffee  chocolate in the lobby  the free fruit  sweets.It was about a 5 min walk to Dam square  fairly central for most things. We would certainly recommend it to anyone  would stay there again if we return to Amsterdam

<Content>Lovely traditional hotel, with great staff Me and my boyfriend stayed here for our anniversary last weekend and we had an excellent time. The hotel is in a perfect location in the Canal Singel and is close enough to walk to all the attractions, museums, bars and restaurants but far enough to be able to leave the red light district and coffee shops behind! It is also close enough to walk to from the Centraal Train Station.Although our room 313 had neither a canal or a street view and it was slightly small it was beautifully decorated and had everything we needed. We are used to staying in hostels and slighlty more budget hotels so this was luxurious! We didnt go for the breakfast on top of the room as at 14 euros each per day we thought it a little expensive and we dont usually eat much breakfast anyway so we left that. But there are free drinks; water, tea, coffee and hot chocolate and also free fruit which we had a lot of so that was very useful and saved a few pennies. I chose this hotel through the reviews on this website and the only concern I had was about the staff. I would just like to stay that I found ALL of the staff polite and nice, they helped us with dinner recommendations and reservations and when they found out it was our anniversary the lady on Reception ( I think her name was Esselaar, apologies for the bad spelling!) arranged to have some goodies taken up to our room in lovely packaging and a nice note, which was really really nice of them!So I would highly recommend this hotel to any couples wanting to go away to a nice quiet hotel, there were a few screaming kiddies running around but I think its mainly for adults. I would definitely go back to stay there if I were to go back to Amsterdam and will be recommending it to any friends, family or colleagues that go to Amsterdam.

<Content>Very nice hotel. Very nice and comfortable hotel. Excellent, friendly service. Stayed in room 317, quite large and comfortable. The rooms towards the back of the hotel (on the Spuistraat) seem to be bigger than the front ones (though the front ones have a view of the canal). Free coffee and tea downstairs very nice. Elevator is a good touch too. The breakfast was fine, but there are lots of good places for breakfast cheaper in the neighborhood. The location is terrific -- a beautiful area by the canals, more interesting and less crowded than the touristy areas in the center. Wonderful unusual stores everywhere you look.

<Content>liked it for the most part We stayed at Hotel Estherea May 9-12th. for the most part I agree with everything that has been written about the hotel. great location, it has been recently renovated and is quite lovely, close to shopping and restaurants etc. The tea/cofee station is a great plus in the lobby. The ambience in the lobby is pleasant and welcoming. Breakfast is okay, nothing special. I did wish they served even a light dinner as we were travelling with elderly parents and this would have suited them quite nicely some nights.Here are some other things that we did not like.My in-laws stayed in room 412 which overlooked the canal, the room is small but adequate and they enjoyed it. Overall they found it quiet enough for sleeping with the exeption of one night when people were quite rowdy for sometime in a boat in the canal below them. My husband, daughter and I had a triple - room 419 which overlooked the back of the hotel. not the most pleasant view, walls of graffiti etc. The main problem was the noise all night long of cars flying past the window and the voices from the street may as well have been in our room. we did not sleep well at all and one night not all. The room was very nice, our daughter had a pull out bed from the wall which was very comfortable as was our bed. I definitely would not stay in that room again.The bathroom is quite small, even for European size. There was nowhere to put toilitries etc but that was not a huge deal.The main thing that I did not like was the front desk staff. there was an older gentleman (I believe already mentioned in former reviews) who was verging on rude. I truly believed he thought he was there for reasons other than serving the customer. he was very unapproachable and gave the impression as you walked towards him that he would rather have disappeared. There was also a young lady on the desk who was very abrasive and had a very take it or leave it attitude. I saw them make fun of the customer behind their back on more than one occasion. something they should be more aware of.On the positive side there was a bar man who has been with the hotel for 6 months, regretfully we did not get his name. He was excellent and went far beyond customer service with a very pleasant attitude. He truly seemed to like his job.I will say that my husband became ill while we were there with a fever and infected throat and they were very good at getting a doctor, and when I asked for some toast to be sent up they sent up a tray of snacks all complimentary and wished him a speedy recovery.Over all we enjoyed staying at this hotel but I will say I was put off with the haughtiness of these two reception staff. someone should remind them that we are the customer and they should demonstrate better customer care. Unfortunately I tended to treat them the way I felt we were being treated so that likely did not help matters. Finally I would like to stay here again but only if we could be guaranteed a quieter room, and also if they gave their staff some training.

<Content>Great place to call home in Amsterdam! My husband and I spent 8 nights at the Hotel Estherea for our anniversary. We loved our room 512. We enjoyed the wonderful view of the Singel canal.

<Content>Excellent location, charming Hotel We just finished a very pleasant stay at the Hotel Estherea from April 23-29. The ideal location on a quiet, lovely canal allowed walking to many sites and easy access to both public transportation and Central Station for daytrips. The public rooms are rich, warm and comfortable with small extras that make a difference- free tea, coffee, hot chocolate and fruit in the lobby, a lending library with english selections. The staff were very helpful with good restaurant recommendations and sight seeing suggestions. The room was not large by american standards, but comfortable with a well equiped and pretty bathroom. We did not have a canal view but I did not expect that as we booked at a low price- 157 US dollars/night. Considering the poor dollar to euro exchange rate it was a good value, in a warm and authentic family owned hotel.

<Content>Excellent Location I have just returned from a 3 night stay in Amsterdam with 3 female friends. We stayed at this hotel on the strength of the reviews on this site and I can say that I was very pleased with the location and accommodation. The room was spotless if slightly small and the bathroom looked newly renovated and kept clean and well stocked.. Unfortunately the view was not good as the room was back to back with another room about 6 feet away. I asked if there was a room overlooking the canal and was told that the hotel was full. It didn't look full as we saw only a few other people during the weekend but as we didn't spend too much time in the room I guess it wasn't too important anyway. The breakfast room is very pleasant and the meal plentiful and fairly varied - certainly adequate and relaxing. The bonus is the tea, coffee and hot chocolate maker in the lobby with biscuits and chocolates to go with it - help yourself at any time - saves a fortune! the public rooms are very pleasant to sit in. But the great thing is the location - within easy walking distance to main tourist areas and train station but very quiet and peaceful - no rowdiness at all. Hotel recommends some great restaurants and will also book them for you - very helpful staff. I work in a travel agency and would have no problems recommending this hotel to any customer.

<Content>Best Location, Nice Hotel Just got back from a 4-day trip to Amsterdam, stayed at the Hotel Estherea and was relieved it came good - nice location on a leafy part of the Singel Canal (10-15 minutes walk from just about everything). This was my first trip to Amsterdam and was pleased I hadn't booked anywhere near Dam Square - if you want to do the bars/restaurants/museums and wake up to a great breakfast on the canal that's typically 'post-card' Amsterdam... then The Estherea won't disappoint (If you want to smoke spliffs, then don't book the Estherea - they don't like the smoke/smell effecting everyone else... but I guess 'space-cakes' are OK, whilst we are on this subject... not everyone in Amsterdam is spaced out doing coffee shops - life goes on as in most European cities with the daily work routine the norm for most people... for sure have a good time and if it's your bag to have time out in a coffee shop then this is a good place to have a relaxing time - for the record I don't smoke or drink as much as I did when I was 18-30 and now find myself spending hours in museums/bars/restaurants... something those old folks did, but now I've turned 40 and have children I find it's crept up from behind and I'm slowly turning into a 16 year olds worst nightmare / don't get me wrong... I still like drinking too much but I just can't face the morning afterwards anymore - it takes me a week to recover, mores the pity).The Hotel: I had booked a canal view room for the two of us (left the kids at home / Amsterdam is not really the place for young children on holiday)... I paid the little extra for the canal view... good move - good sized room, great view to wake up to, small bathroom, but clean. The hotel does not have a restaurant, but does have a small bar and a good breakfast room. Recently refurbished to deliver the 4-star welcome, but the room was 3-star... saying that the location was 5-star. Free Tea/Coffee/Hot-Chocolate 24/7... might not be much but makes a huge difference when staying in a hotel and keeping your costs within reason.The Staff: Sorry to say I agree with some of the other remarks... when we arrived the guy on the desk was very cold, but not rude - not typical of Dutch people... but the girls on front of desk during the day very welcoming. The last two days saw a different guy on the desk and he was fine... I would retun to this hotel no problem, I would also recommend staying there if this is your first visit.Location: Can't help banging this one home... have a look on a map before you arrive - you will be close to everything, have relaxing days feeling very safe day or night (this I can't say about Dam Square or the area behind it, you can feel the under-tow of exploitation and pick-pocketing).Tip: Book popular venues, especially good local restaurants in advance (the hotel staff can do this for you) - we were fine as the end of April is still low season, but everything was pretty much booked to full capacity (not sure I would like it in the summer)OR don't worry about it and spend time in the many good bars which do just as good food. As for museums/boat trips... these were busy - not too busy, but I guess if your coming peak season then you're up against all the package tippers in their thousands.Enough said - must get on - enjoy your trip... the Estherea is remarkable for what is a BB!

<Content>Would go again Stayed here for a three night break in February 05. Booked through lastminute and got an excellent rate but sadly not an excellent room. We were right up at the top with a view of a very dull courtyard complete with rubbish bins. However, we decided that we didn't mind too much - it wasn't bad enough to demand to be moved. Room itself was small, very slightly shabby in furnishing terms, but comfortable enough. Bathroom was small but spotlessly clean, well appointed and well stocked. I think I was just disappointed that the room, whilst fine in itself, was nothing special and didn't match up to the public areas. Also the walls are paper thin and we suffered with quite a bit of noise from other rooms and the hallway.The staff were very friendly, particularly in view of the fact that I got a bug and was very, very ill on our first night - they were very solicitous and kept asking me if I was ok after that! Breakfast was excellent - plentiful and fresh.The hotel is in a fantastic location, quiet and peaceful on the canalside, with lots of bars/restaurants nearby. Try 'Broodje Bert' on the corner one block up for fantastic toasties, sandwiches etc. The Indonesian restaurant one street over is very good also.Recommended.

<Content>Just lovely We stayed 3 nights at this hotel in January 05. It is a lovely hotel in a great location: easy walk to the main square or trams stop nearby. Good buffet breakfast in lovely dining room with traditional Dutch furnishings. Well stocked library with computer (small charge) for guest use.The hotel lobby and lift area was being rennovated during our visit. This disruption was minimal to guests (porters carried luggage up the stairs).Would definately stay there again.

<Content>The Crown Jewel of Amsterdam Imagine that you had just been invited to Amsterdam by your wealthy Aunt. She lives in a Grand and luxurious old Merchant's House alongside one of the more gentrified canals. The address, 2 minutes away from the Royal Palace at Dam Square is one of the most desireable in the City. On arrival, you step over the threshold and sink into pure wool carpets, you admire the glistening heavy chandeliers and become surrounded by luxury drapes, quality furniture and wood panelling. The gentle notes of Vivaldi diffuse effortlessly around you. Your Aunt's attentive staff are on hand to courteously assist. You are shown to your room, which also has a crystal chandelier and sumptuous furnishings. You have a large twin-sinked bathroom with an array of towels and Hydro products. All is serene, calm and feintly regal. And then you learn that everything you need to see in Amsterdam is only a few minutes walk away - that vision is the Hotel Esterea. Faultless. The reception rooms (a foyer, salon, panelled library, bar etc) are luxuriously finished in Cardinal Red, with loose-covered easy chairs, sofas and occasional tables. There is a feeling of subdued, understated oppulence - an ambience of the past. A medley of 1930's Pullman Parlour Car and a Stately home. You easily could imagine that the fellow house-guest sitting in the Library was Hercule Poirot. This is undoubtedly Amsterdam's best kept secret. THE place for the discerning traveller to stay.

<Content>Top Notch Hotel My wife and I stayed in room 410 overlooking the canal for 5 days in December 2004. The room was clean and modern with a great view. Our winter rate was only $96 euros with breakfast - very inexpensive for a hotel this nice. The lobby has been completely remodeled and looks great. The hotel is family owned and you can tell they care about it. I found the staff to be very helpful with directions, baggage, drink requests at odd hours, etc. The hotel is also within walking distance from just about everything to see in Amsterdam but the street below is fairly quiet. The breakfast was the traditional European cheese/bread/salame/cereal type thing and it was very well done. I really recommend this great hotel.

<Content>great location reasonable price We spent 3 nights there in november at 96 Euros per night which was good value for money. A great location for the touristy, and less touristy areas, and well located for food and drink. Free tea and coffee was really good but the breakfast was a bit pricey. Highly recommended for the nice rooms, friendly staff and above all the location.

<Content>Excllent location, lovely hotel Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in July 2004 location of the hotel although very central for walking to all the main tourist areas of Amsterdam and even walkable from the station approx 20 mins,if you dont have much luggage,is in a quite side street so no noise. Our room which overlooked the canal was very clean and very good decor. Which all added up to make a very enjoyable short break in the lovely city of Amsterdam. Highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location Great location, friendly staff, really nice clean room (not overlooking the canal) and we would definitely recommend this hotel to all. We would be happy to return at any time. The offer of free tea and coffee was greatly appreciated as a stop off point whilst cycling around this vibrant city.
