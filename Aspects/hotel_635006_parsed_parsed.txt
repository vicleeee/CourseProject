<Content>Absolutely Brilliant, you won't find better than this I travel extensively and I can honestly say the Regent is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. It was absolutely wonderful! There are many hotels to choose from in Beijing so I did a lot of research and am so glad I chose this hotel. From the moment we arrived, the staff were very welcoming and friendly, had a good grasp of English and could not do enough for us. The location was perfect, walking distance to Forbidden City and the Metro station is right next to the hotel. The rooms were very comfortable, and the bathroom was huge with a separate shower and bath. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the cosy hotel lobby is a great place for a hot chocolate after a day of sightseeing. A big Thank You to all of the staff at the Regent, we will never forget our stay in your wonderful hotel.

<Content>Excellent hotel Stayed two nights end of November 08. Location is ideal, right in the center of Beijing. Service, rooms and food (at the Italian restaurant) are outstanding. You will have a hard time finding better anywhere in China.

<Content>The Regent is regal The excellent service started over the internet. After making reservation for a week-stay at the Regent hotel Beijing via an online source, I sent the concierge an email asking about transportation to-from the airport. I got a reply within 24 hours complete with pricing and types of cars etc. I also asked for help with making a reservation at the Li Family restaurant, and within one day, the concierge replied again in the affirmative.While checking in, the clerk asked if I wanted an upgrade to a suite, including free daily breakfast. The existing reservation for a regular room (including taxes) was about $175 per night. With the upgrade to a suite, my price was $250 nightly. It was worth every penny. The suite was huge with luxurious wood paneling large livingroom and bedroom with one full bath (tub and shower) and a powder room. There were two flat screen TVs, glass walls and great views of the city. The bed, unlike many ohter in China, was very soft and the linens were luxurious. There is a metro station beneath the hotel and travel on Beijing's subway system was clean, cheap, and efficient.The Regent's lobby is high class and subdued with elegance. The piano music provided a relaxing break from the hectic streets of the city, and you can drool over the Lamborgini and Bentley showrooms attached to the hotel.The hotel was nice enough to hold our luggage while we went on a 2-day jaunt to Xi'an. The Regent is less than 3 years old and the fit and finish of the design and comfort is very high. The service level is excellent as most employees spoke passable English. The few minor complaints I have is with the breakfast buffet and the check-in time. The cogee was cold as was the sausage and noodles. And, although there is an egg prep station, it was not manned the day that I was there for an early breakfast at 6 am--I couldn't help it since I was jet lagged, hungry and bored. The chef was there when I ate breakfast later in the morning. I checked in at around 10 am and the clerk told me I would have to wait a few hours, or I could take the upgrade to a suite, which was ready for occupation immediatley. I found this sales tactic a bit pushy, but I took the bait and loved the suite.Overall, this is the best hotel I've used in a long time. It's highly recommened, especially if you can swing for the suite.

<Content>Best hotel in Central Beijing The Regent is my favorite hotel in central Beijing. The rooms are significantly larger than the Peninsula. The exercise facility is the best of any hotel I have visited in Asia. All the tourist sites are within a 15-20 minute walk. The subway stop is adjacent to the hotel. The main shopping area is about 5 minutes away and you have to cross a busy intersection, but it is not a problem. The staff at the hotel is very friendly. However, it would be helpful if the concierges spoke somewhat better English. I will definitely stay again when I next visit Beijing.

<Content>Brilliant! My husband and I have just returned from an amazing 5 days at the Regent. This hotel was everything I hoped it would be. The staff were extremley helpful and compotent, assisting us daily making the language barrier about Beijing non existent.The bed was very comfy, the view from our 16th floor room was lovely. The room was spacious and decorated very stylishly. We ordered room service a few times for lunch and breakfast. Again - very good.The location is excellent. A few minutes walk to shopping, 10-15 minutes walk to Tian' anmen Sqaure and forbidden city. I would highly recommend this hotel.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Superb hotel in great location We had actually booked the Park Plaza, but when we arrived at 10pm were told the hotel was fully booked (we had seen reviews saying this had happened to other people). We were upgraded to the Regent (next door) which is 5 stars as opposed to the 4 star Park Plaza, at the same rate including breakfast.The room we had was superb, top floor (19th), floor to ceiling windows with great views of Beijing (Forbidden City roof tops clearly visible). Room was quite big, nice bed, large flat screen TV, lovely bathroom with shower and bath and electric blinds. There were loads of toiletries and accessories in the room, in room safe and you could tell it was a very classy place. You get some free small water bottles in the room and more was provided at nightly turn down service. Breakfast was great, lots of choice - cereals, toast, pastries, fruit, yoghurt, cooked items, egg station etc.We ate in the Italian restaurant at the Regent and it was excellent, you are supplied a basket of fresh bread free which they did replenish if required (2 starters, 2 main courses, 1 dessert and 2 soft drinks approx 拢50). All the staff were very helpful. We would highly recommend this hotel, and are very lucky to have been upgraded there.

<Content>A Gold Medal for this hotel We have just returned from 18 days in China. Beijing was our first stop and the Regent was our first hotel on the itinerary. We spent 3 glorious nights at this jewel of a hotel. The location was fabulous. Just a short walk from the Night Markets and great food and shopping right outside the hotel. The rooms were modern, spacious, beautiful and included every possible ammenity. The staff was gracious and attentive, the buffet breakfast was amazing. I would give this hotel a 5+ rating. We loved it.

<Content>A great experience overall I booked Park Plaza next door and was upgraded to the Regent.The hotel is in an excellent location: very close to shopping, tourist destinations, and there are many eating places within walking distance. There is also a small convenience store across the street. The hotel itself is kind of tucked in on a side street, with some green spaces in the front separating the property from the busy streets of Wang Fu Jing. This is rare in Beijing. I heard no traffic noise from my room.The hotel appears new. My room on a high floor is nicely decorated in contemporary style. The bed is comfy. The bathroom is generously stocked. Internet is free. The slippers are plush. The pool is nice and quiet. I went swimming several times and it was never crowded like another 5-star hotel I stayed during the same trip to Beijing. The gym is nice. They even offer group classes such as Yoga and Step. Room Service is prompt and the food was good.The only fault I found was that the noticeable carpet stains in several spots. Overall, this is a great hotel. I would stay there again on my next visit.

<Content>faultless We were upgraded to this hotel from another one next door. had a corner room with executive club privileges. Great hotel--service, room, bathroom, breakfast, happy hour, pool all unable to be faulted. in great location close to the city centre, on top of a subway station and near a night market. Business travellers may be more demanding than us, but as tourists we were delighted.

<Content>Wonderful Property! We loved this hotel! It was beautiful, the room was great, the beds comfortable. it was in easy walking distance to restaurants and shops. We booked our entire China trip through China Odessy and everything was really great. We had great sight seeing in Beijing.We also ate at a great restaurant called Noodle Loft-about 20 min away from the hotel by taxi. They do have a waiter that speaks English and the menu has pictures-wonder ful food in a cool atmoshpere.For those that might be impaired, our hotel offered a free wheelchair which was great for touring the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace.This is truely world class property-we would go back in a heart beat!!

<Content>Excellent Stayed here over New Year 2007, what a fantastic hotel! The rooms are very luxurious, 32 HDTV, free High Speed Internet, Rain Fall Shower, Free standing bath tub, every sort of amenity you could think of! The best part was the bed, extremely comfortable, probably the best I've slept in, and I have stayed at hotels like the Plaza New York, the Dorchester London, the Oriental Bangkok, etc. The staff were very polite, and the level of englsh was reasonably good. Cleanliness of the room and hotel in general was only moderate, quite dusty. The swimming pool and health club is very opulent, hot tub, steam room, sauna, gym, 25m pool with pool bar. There is also a spa though very expensive. We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants so I couldn't comment, though a room service soup I ordered was very tasty, it was the price of dinner at the dumpling restaurant accross the street! Location is very good, surrounded by other luxury hotels, e.g, the Peninsula, the Grand Hyatt etc. Shopping is perimeter quite good- Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Ferrari showroom, Bvlgari etc. The hotel will also yield taxis for you and direct them as to where you want to go, as well as giving you a card to give to the taxi driver on return. Overall, an excellent stay.

<Content>Great Hotel but watch out for the hotel cups!!! Beijing Regent was initially a very luxurious experience for us travelling as a family. A great place to relax and spend the night especially after climbing the great wall. However, we did not have a very good experience with their facilities. One of our family members took one of the hotel cups to wash in the basin, without knowing that the handle can be detached from the cup. There was no warning sign either. Because of this, when he emptied the water from the cup, it fell straight out of the handle and there was a crack in the cup. When we checked out, we were charged RMB 280.00 just for this small damage!! So, if you are checking in this hotel, please be aware of this. The housekeepers also do not regularly replace the toiletries. If you have less than half a bottle of body wash left, they will not replace it!The hairdryer in our room was also terrible. I smelled a burning smell as soon as I turned it on. I tried to look inside it, and I saw a small fire coming out of the fan!!Overall, the outlook is great, but many details need to be taken care of.

<Content>OK stay at the Regent Beijing I stayed at the Regent Beijing just for one night (I travelled from Europe to Nanjing and made a one-day stop over in Beijing). Actually I booked the Park Plaza (on the same property) via the web, but that was full when I arrived and so I got a free upgrade to the Regent. (I read that in other reviews, so this seems common policy.)The hotel is really posh, with all the things demanding travellers (which I am not) look for: HUGE lobby, several bars with Piano player all day etc.The room was very luxurious (e.g. brand new flat screen with CD player - which I didn't turn on because I didn't have the time), with free internet access (if you bring your own laptop).The location is GREAT: Easy walking distance to Wangfujing, the main shopping street, and also Tian'anmen and Forbidden City(ca. 20 minutes walk).Only some minor details: The toilet was not really clean when I used it the first time (yellow stains on the seat), and the shower tended to flood the whole bathroom... - but that seems to be a general problem with 21st century fantasy marble showers: Beauty goes over functionality...But for the rest, an overall great experience. I am not giving the best mark because I was really disgusted by the stains in the toilet, which made me think that management might stress superficial poshness more than thorough quality control, but maybe I was unlucky. Remark concerning the neighborhood (has of course NOTHING to do with the hotel!):Rapidly developing area, with the last old buildings currently being knocked down to make place for modern high-rise buildings. Many other travelers warn against friendly students chatting you up when stepping out of the hotel and yes, this is true, but a phenomenon to be experienced EVERYWHERE in Beijing: These young people just start talking to you and walk with you (no matter what the destination), claim that they are art students, and suddenly (sometimes after 30 minutes of friendly chatting) they invite you to an art gallery where they claim you can buy cheap paintings etc. I never followed them, they are to be got rid of easily enough, but I heard of people who got into nasty situations (Not being allowed to leave the exhibition without buying something etc.) So simply DON'T GO THERE. If you are a Chang Bizi (a long nose as Caucasians are called by the Chinese), you will invariably have such an encounter in Beijing. On the other hand, I invited one such guy to a quick beer in the many outlets on Wangfujing, and we parted friendly enough. At least he spoke English, which is by far not normal in Beijing...

<Content>Highly Recommend ! Took me a long time to post this review but I just wanted to tell anybody who is thinking of booking this hotel to just do it !We also got upgraded from the Park Plaza and we were not disappointed. They even through in breakfast and Club privleges. Make sure to ask because the staff won't offer. The rooms were clean, modern and large. Felt like paradise when returning to this hotel after a long day of touring Beijing. Cozy, comfy beds with great linens and duvets. Very well located but taxis are cheap if you need to get somewhere fast.

<Content>I could become a regular I was originally booked to stay at the Park Plaza next door based on the reviews here. However, my wife showed up before me and was told the hotel was full and they took her and my son next door to the Regent. Levina at the front desk treated them like royalty and was always great to see ( just like the rest of the staff). She got us a gorgeous room on the 19th floor which gave us a fabulous view of the fireworks on the Festival of Lanterns. The room was stunning, dark woods, frosted glass, rich draperies, comfortable window seat, nice working space with lots of US plugs. The bathroom has separate shower and a nice deep tub. Lots of lighting option in the room always ensured you were comfortable.The staff was just great, everything we needed was taken care of, turn down service was quick, prompt and thorough. Laundry, like every hotel was overpriced, but the service was excellent. Everything that's been said about the Park Plaza goes for the Regent and it's worth the extra money (though we didn't have to pay it this stay). We ended up extending our stay for several more days and they honored the transfer rate from the Plaza, which was very nice of them.

<Content>An amazing spa! I recommend you choose this hotel if you are in need of a bit of pampering. As a woman on her own, they couldn't do enough for me. I have found that in many 5* hotels I have stayed in in the past they have either ignored me or made me feel uncomfortable for being there alone. The room was beautiful. I asked for one on a high floor for the view and was given one on the 19th floor. Everything I needed was just there in the room. I appreciated the caffitiere with the fresh coffee, the complementary bottles of mineral water and the bath salts and body scrub. You can have a soak in the bath whilst taking in the lovely view and watching TV. It would be a perfect place also for a romantic get away. The health club was amazing. The 32 metre pool was immaculate and very tranquil - a perfect way to relax between sightseeing. I was often the only person swimming in the pool. I also booked a few treatments in the spa which were just gorgeous and quite affordable. The breakfast was very expensive for Beijing but it was quite a spread. The only negative was that the cooked breakfast was a bit cold. I highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Beijing. The staff are very friendly and attentive and make you feel very welcome.

<Content>Ok, not as great as most say I have stayed at the Regent in two different types of rooms over the past month. And i have to say that although this hotel is nice, its by no means a top class hotel by todays standards. I stayed in a Executive room, and a one bedroom suite (with connecting twin premium). Yes the rooms look nice, but upon closer inspection they are quite dirty, with dirt mounds behind doors, and muck under bathroom counters. The daily cleaning is not very good as well. On two different stays the housekeeps did not wash used forks, or glasses and just left them sitting out. The showers (both my stays) seemed to have quite a bit of old residue in them. Room service was left in the corridors for extended periods of time as well. Complementary bottles are not replaced more than once a day (if that) and toiletries were not replaced at all during either of my stays. They seems very cheap with these sort of things. The rooms was not 'tidied' as well on several occasions, i.e. Not straightening coffee tables and sofa cushions. Overall giving the rooms a half cleaned feel. The rooms were also very noisy and hot. The noise came from outside the hotel, a building being constructed 24hrs a day (this is China). I think this affects one side of the hotel more than the other. The club lounge was quite good, and a great benefit. However it seemed that they only had one Joss Stone CD to play the whole time, on both of my stays. Quite annoying after a while. However, breakfast was good, and evening drinks is a nice way to wind down. Is this hotel nice? Yes. Is it great? No. Would i reccomend my family or friend to stay there if they were expecting the best? No. I would say go to the Ritz Carlton FS if you wanted a modern big hotel, or at Cote Cour SL if you are here for pleasure. It is an AMAZING 500 year old funky boutique hotel. I was also lucky to stay there in December as well.I would also say try to stay at one of the many hotels that are opening in Beijing at the moment. More will open over the next few months...- The Mandarin Oriental- The Park Hyatt- Ritz Carlton's (both)- JW Marriott- The WestinThe Regent is nice, not great. Sure its one of the top few in Beijing at the moment, but there are better... and there a lot more to come. So look around.

<Content>Terrible service This was my first visit at The Regent and I have to say that I won鈥檛 go back again.True, rooms can be nice and spacious鈥?But A/C is not working properly and smells so bad. Lot of noise from outside that I was not able to sleep. I have called the manager on duty, he was not able to understand me and offered me a free breakfast (guess what? my package included breakfast)鈥?br/>Speaking of staff. They ignore 鈥渄o not disturb鈥?lights. They do not speak English and they ignore you. Managers are seating in Bar or Restaurant and also ignore guests鈥?I have stay almost a week in a suite and none one of them came to me to say hello !!! The staff sees the clients as an annoyance. Getting a round of drinks at the lobby bar is a 30-minute affair. Extra marks for uselessness and grumpiness go to the front desk

<Content>Regal Regent We stayed at the Regent in Beijing twice this December. The first stay I booked through Expedia, and on the recommendation of hotel staff, I joined the Regent/Radisson/Park Plaza executive club (no fee). On the first visit, the standard room was exceptional and well beyond my expectations considering the very affordable rate. The staff was exceptional -with valets who were quick to argue with cab drivers on our behalf before we asked for help. The desk staff was very helpful, and if you happen to meet the Dutch woman who works evenings -she is amazing. After three weeks of traveling and trekking around China, I realized how outstanding this hotel really is. It is modern, exceptionally clean, and meticulously maintained -truly a five star hotel. On my second visit, I was upgraded to the executive suite for no additional charge, with breakfast and happy hour included. I ended up not leaving the hotel that day... a trip to the pool and the spa turned into an all day event, simply because no one else was there and it seemed a waste not to take advantage of the facility. This is not a backpacker's China, but it is certainly a welcomed luxury for any tired traveler or business traveler. Tips for the budget conscious -the Park Plaza is attached to the Regent and shares the pool/spa facilities (not sure about the rooms, but they are of the same vintage. It seems to book up faster and I've heard they upgrade you to the Regent (same fee) if they overbook. Also, look into the Radisson executive membership before booking for potential upgrades when you arrive.

<Content>nice brand new hotel arrived at the Regent and was a bit irritated with the front desk as the check in took a long time, the clerk was confused and ended up keeping me at the desk for a while since he wanted both photocopies of my passport and my I.D. card (told him that every other hotel in BJ req only a passport copy... ) the check out process was also slow... BJ is building hotels so quickly you get the feeling they don't really have many experienced hotel staff to choose frombut other than that, the room was beautiful with every creature comfort you'd wish for, the bathtub (being a new hotel) looked very tempting, we were here for a 2 day event, I was pretty happy with the food at the Chinese restaurant (on the 2nd or 3rd floor) and the convention/banquet food was not bad.coincidentally my parents stayed here a few weeks before I did and they loved the place (In terms of decor, food, comfort, location and etc)I loved the place too but have had faster/better service at the other BJ hotels (ie the Peninsula)

<Content>A truly beautiful hotel We were put up here Oct 1-2, right at the beginning of the Chinese National Holiday, on an overnight tour to Beijing from the Regent Mariner cruise ship, and were dazzled by the opulence of the room we were assigned - it was superb! There were about 700 of us on this tour, an included part of the Mariner's Grand Asia Pacific cruise (Vancouver to Los Angeles via Alaska, Russia, Japan, China, South-east Asia, Indonesia, Australia-New Zealand and the South Pacific), but the arrangements, food, and just about everything connected with it were exceptionally well done. Bravo!

<Content>Loved the Regent The Regent Beijing was the first hotel we have stayed during our annual 4-weeks long China journey, and it was one of the best hotels during our visit. We have booked a club room, which was spacious and very nice designed, bathroom just perfect with a lot of amenties. The Club also very nice and a breakfast service very good. We didn't eat in hotel restaurants, though we had some drinks in a bar and at the Grill, and the service was very good. The concierge was very helpful. The location of the hotel is very good, walking distance to Forbidden City and a short drive or walk to shopping street and Oriental Plaza. The taxi drivers don't know the hotel however, which is actually quite normal for Beijing, since they have most taxi-drivers coming from the country and they don't know a lot of Beijing. In the building next to hotel there are a couple of very good restaurants. The Regent is now my favourite in Beijing, and I have stayed in several five-star hotels in Beijing so far.

<Content>Loved the Regent Beijing and Beijing Regent Beijing was outstanding. Beautiful, friendly, comfortable, helpful. I traveled with my husband (who likes value) and 2 adult daughters (in their 20s) and all 4 of us loved this hotel. It costs more than other hotels in Beijing, however, a similar room in other major cities would be at least double the cost. Even my husband thought it a good value! We would definately stay again.Beijing also exceeded our expectations-- will post that separately.We did NOT, however, have a positive experience with expedia. My husband was told that breakfast was included in our rate by an expedia employee. When we got to the hotel, this was not the case. We tried to remedy the problem with expedia by phone, but were not at all satisfied with the customer service.

<Content>Superior hotel but inferior Front Desk services I stayed in Regent for 3 days and I had a good time staying in this modern superior hotel. The room is spacious and meticulously designed. Only one thing I would lke to make a remark, though only one thing but should not be trivial. The services at Front Desk shocked me. First, I requested a non-smoking room but it's not availbale at the time I checked in. Then the staff at Front Desk explained to me that they could make a 'smoking room' with no smoke. Was she playing magic?Second incident, I asked the lady at the Front Desk of where I could find a recognised Olympics shop, she gave me short  sharp answer in four simple words, no, I don't know', and then she kept dropping her head down. There were still a few silly things happened at the Front Desk while I simply want to make my review short. It's a pity if the hotel does not notice their inferior Front Desk services comparing to their superior hardware design. While lastly, to be fair, the valet services was good, I would like to pay the guys a compliment.

<Content>Nice Surprise We originally booked the Park Plaza which was just next to the Regent. When we checked in, the concierge told us that we were upgraded to the Regent with no additional cost!We pay HK$900 per night and enjoyed a spacious modern room wth a King size bed and buffet breakfast for 2. The bathroom was well equipped with supplies of leg balm and body scrub among other basic stuffs.Really no complaints for such a good price!

<Content>Heavenly! If you're looking for a fabulous hotel in Beijing, look no further! The Regent Beijing is as memorable as the historic sites we went to see. Personally, I don't think the Emperors of China had it this good.The hotel is barely a year old which means it was designed with the most up to date amenities. Our deluxe room was incredibly spacious and beautiful in decor. Of course, it has all the usual conveniences and amenities of a top shelf five star hotel, ie. flat screen LCD tv, dvd/cd player, featherbed, high thread count sheets, fluffy towels, marble bathroom, etc... But they had a bit more. The bathroom has a free standing bathtub and separate shower. The shower has both a rainshower shower head and a hand held shower. They also provide bath salts and bubble bath.The location is ideal. The hotel is within walking distance of the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, the night market (food stalls), Dragonfly (massages) and Starbucks (to the left of the hotel). If you're adventurous, the subway is next to the lobby. It's the Dengshikou stop on the number 5 line (just opened Oct. '07). Unfortunately, getting to the hotel is a problem. None of the cab drivers know where it is. BE SURE TO HAVE THE HOTEL'S PHONE NUMBER ON HAND so the driver can call and ask for directions. Or even better, print out the map on their website. Once you're at the hotel, ask them for a card with the hotel name and address in Chinese. This will help you get back.The restaurants are top notch. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet at Cafe 99 and the ribeye steak at the Bar  Grill. Let's not forget the great spa, gym and heated pool. Definitely shedule a massage in the evening. You'll sleep even better afterwards.Service is good overall. Everyone is very courteous. However, they could brush up on their English skills. Check in was very disappointing. We arrived from NY on a direct flt. (16 hrs.) at 5:30 PM and were told we had to come back in an hour because the room wasn't ready. We didn't get a good first impression but that was the only glitch. Fortunately, checking out was a breeze.We've stayed in numerous 5 star hotels around the world and we thought the Regent Beijing had the most beautifully appointed rooms. We were reluctant to leave the hotel even though we were in Beijing to see the sites. I think that says it all.

<Content>Great Hotel This is a lovely modern chic hotel. The reception area is impressive the rooms fully equipped and comfortable. The whole spa area is really fantastic - a full size swimming pool and a very large gym with lots of equipment. I paid a very reasonable price for the room but anything else in the hotel (food and drink) is very expensive. It is 20 minutes walk from the Forbidden City - and there is a Starbucks in the hotel complex!!

<Content>A Grand Hotel The Regent is one of the most beautiful big hotels I've ever stayed in, and had facilities to match. The hotel is very new, and the service still needs to smooth off some rough edges (mostly in the language department) but our experience overall was terrific. We had a big and beaufifully decorated room with all sorts of special touches (including free internet -- too many hotels of this grade charge 15-25$). The breakfast buffet was lavish and delicious. The fitness center was splendid and the pool was a delight -- sooo big. Also, the hotel's location is very central. Overall, a marvellous place to stay in Beijing.

<Content>Best Breakfast Buffet in China We were lucky enough to be upgraded to the Regent for one night as the sister hotel (next door), The Park Plaza Beijing Wangfujian was overbooked. This is a really great hotel with the best breakfast, wonderful fruit and fruit juices and decaf coffee - we spent 51 days in the region and this set the standard and was never beaten. Also, very comfy beds (again unusual for this part of the world), great room, flat screen TV and glass walled bathroom with electric blinds.Good location - you can walk to the Hutongs, shopping on Wangfujian and visit the night food market for a wonderful meal and experience and Starbucks is behind the hotel if you need a caffeine fix.We left our baggage at the hotel for 1 week when we went to Mongolia and it was safe and fetched for us with a smile on our return. We had to move back into the Park Plaza on our return, which was also good but the breakfast did not even come close!

<Content>Excellent Concierge but Poor Front desk English My husband and I stayed in Regent Beijing from Oct. 20th 2007 for 3 days. The room was spacious and excellent decor. The bed was very comfortable. Plenty of Amenities in the room and friendly service. Especially the Concierge dept. They were all very well trained and courteous. I deliberately did not give them any gratuity when I ask for service the first few times just to see if they still serve me the same way. Well, they did. They were just as friendly and as helpful. I left them a big tip when I leave. The only thing I am surprised is the level of English in the Front desk. I sometimes had to write down instructions or questions so they can find out what I was saying. Location is a little off the main part of Wang Fu Jing but it is still close enough within walking distance. I would definitely stay with Regent again.

<Content>One of the Best Hotels in Asia We have traveled all over asia, and not many of the 5 star hotels we have stayed at were as nice, attentive, and beautiful as this one. The concierge was very helpful, room service wasn't extremely overpriced, and the front desk staff was excellent. The room was BEAUTIFUL, it had the best furnishings out of any room I have ever stayed at. We were staying in the basic room for 107 a night, and were amazed. Vaulted ceilings, dark contrasting colored furnishings, beautiful lobby, GREAT location for tourists. The Regent has it all.

<Content>Way better than expected! I was actually booked at the Park Plaza and was surprised when learned that I was upgraded to the Regent Beijing. It's my first time in Beijing so I really don't know what to expect from hotels in Beijing. I was more than thrilled when I entered the room! It was so stylish and spacious!! Bathroom was great - the tub was so nice that it's hard to resist having a bubble bath. Bed was real nice, although I could only occupy a small portion of the king-size bed. Working desk was of the right size and with the right stationary - (I never expected a stapler!) and comes with free internet access!!!!!!! And breakfast was real good. A wide variety of food to choose from and the food actually tastes good (unlike that of the other 5-star hotel in the area).Overall, I think what I got well exceeded what I have paid for. Sadly, I had to switch hotel after my one-night stay at the Regent Beijing. Having stayed at one of the best hotels in Beijing, it was rather disappointing to move into another hotel (even tho a 5-star) which has been in Beijing for a longer period of time. It was then that I truly appreciated my stay at the Regent.

<Content>Exquisite Hotel! The Regent Beijing is one of the best and newest hotels in Beijing at the moment. It has a very grand but welcoming atmosphere. The hotel and majority of it's staff emanate top service and hospitality. The location is very convenient in one of the better suberbs of Beijing. It is close to many landmarks and shopping areas which are just a short taxi drive away - maybe 20Y-40Y. Western Management enables the facility to stay on top of world hospitality best practice and still focus on Beijing鈥檚 historical value - which is displayed proudly. Most of the hotel staff have an excellent command of the English Language and are helpful. But some require more schooling in Western Etiquette which was a pity - but hey, your in China. Cafe 99's staff are Fantastic - very friendly and welcoming each morning. In room Dinning is fairly economical and the service is One of the Best around. Housekeeping was a bit disappointing, our room was not cleaned very well for the whole 8 nights we were there. Only after we complained to top management was it cleaned to a better standard.The Business Centre staff were of very little help to us, there command of English was very poor and their service attitude was very poor - for example, while serving us in mid conversation they would not think twice to pick up a ringing telephone and leave you in mid sentence and not come back to you.The rooms are very large in comparison to Chinese standards and are decorated with luxury and comfortably in mind. You will feel right at home and never want to leave. It was great to come back to this hotel after a long day of site seeing or shopping.We felt It was also one of the safest hotels in Bejing.Overall, I would stay at this facility again.

<Content>Best hotel we've ever stayed in This hotel is absolutely suberb - perfect location (10 min walk to main shopping street and 15-20 min walk to Forbidden City / Tian'anmen Square); very efficient, helpful and friendly staff who speak good english; and the rooms / leisure facilities are excellent. Very good breakfast and the one evening meal we had there was first class too.All in all a perfect hotel from which to see Beijing from and the best hotel we've ever stayed in.p.s. when walking around Beijing take toilet paper with you as the public loos don't provide it!!
