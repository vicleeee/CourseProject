<Content>Best Value in Hong Kong This must be the best value in Hong Kong. The room is small but it is clean and well furbished - nothing tatty as is so often the case with smaller, cheaper hotels. The staff (housekeeping and concierge) was polite and very professional. The location initially seems a bit far from the hustle and bustle but, once you've mapped your shortest route to Nathan Rd., you are only 10 mins. brisk walking away from all the fabulous shopping in Mong Kok. For what I paid for my accommodation, I think this place is fabulous. The buffet breakfast at HK$45 compares favourably to places where I've paid 2-3 times that for breakfast in HK. If you need a bigger room with al the other facilities, go and pay for it!! The room was very quiet, unlike rooms I've stayed in in expensive hotels where the street noise was audible.

<Content>Below Average Negative comments:1. Rooms are absolutely tiny2. Unfriendly, uninformed and unhelpful staff3. Do NOT go on the tours they offer as they are a waste of money, cheesy and over priced. Rather do things on your own steam.

<Content>Small room but very comfortable stay We stayed in the basic double room. It is a pleasant stay as everything is clean, new and comfortable. The only downside is that the room is quite small as are the single beds. I am 5'5 and my feet dangled off the bed a little, if you are shorter than this you should be fine.The staff is friendly and the view from our hotel room was FANTASTIC. You could see all the way to the harbour from our room.Overall, I would recommend this hotel to others with the warning that is it a small space. However, I expect that if you will be in Hong Kong you will not be spending too much time in your room as there is much to do!

<Content>small rooms but cheap and location good We stayed here march of last year and decided to stay here again this year. Although the rooms are a bit small, it was cheap (around HK$ 400+ a night), and just a few minutes walk to Olympic MTR Station. They also have a free shuttle service to Airport Express Kowloon Station and to Mong Kok.

<Content>Good Value I stayed at Dorsett Olympic in mid January 2008 with a girlfriend, we decided to go for the cheaper option and took a bus from the airport, it was a struggle to communicate with the driver in regards to what stop to get off at. But we managed with a bit of luck and some english speaking locals, its quite convenient if you know what stop to get off, its only 1 bus which takes about 40 - 45 minutes from the airport, you get off and walk underground to cross road and its about 5 minutes walk from the bus stop. But unfortunately the MTR is a bit further away about 10 - 15 minutes to mong kok. As for the hotel itself, although the rooms are a bit small in general its very clean and reception was generally quite helpful. Given that it is one of the cheaper options in Hong Kong to stay at I thought it was great value for money!

<Content>Good, Comfy Hotel Although not located in the middle of the shopping districts, it's still very accessible through the MTR and the FREE shuttle service to and from the airport express, and other strategic locations. Rooms are small, but very clean and comfortable. Staff are friendly too. There's a McDonald's and a shopping mall nearby, and the MTR is walking distance. Will definitely book here again

<Content>Very good hotel - location OK Very nice hotel near the center of Hong Kong. Olympic MTR metro station is a 5-7 minute walk but isn't on the most useful HK transit line (Taxis are very cheap though; e.g. Dorsett to Kowloon center Tsim Sha Tsui: 35 $HK = 3 éˆ§?. Rooms are small but well maintained and clean (carpet and shower curtain could be replaced). Good air-conditioning which is a must in Hong Kong.Staff mostly helpful but not overly friendly.

<Content>Cosy and clean I stayed here for four nights in March. I thought the room was great - clean, light and modern. Ok, so my feet were hanging over the end of the bed (I'm 5'10) but I got used to it. The people on the front desk were very helpful.The best way to get there is the airport express to Kowloon station and then a taxi. (It works out at a couple of quid for the taxi and saves dragging your case around the crowded streets of Mongkok). Most taxi drivers don't speak English so before you go, print out the hotel website 'location page' and enlarge it, if possible. Underline the hotel name and street and give to the taxi driver.One thing to watch is that there is another hotel called the Dorsett Seaview in the same area and it's easy to go to the wrong one (as I did).Be careful in the bathroom if you wear the paper slippers provided by the hotel. It any water gets on the floor, it's extremely slippery with very little room to manoeuvre!It took me a couple of days to get my bearings and find my way to Olympic MTR station without going in the opposite direction but then it was fine. Plus, there's a McDonald's just five minutes walk away which is great for breakfast. Overall, it was good - clean and reasonably priced. Location is not great but with a bit of practice, you can get around ok. It's nice to see a bit of 'downtown Hong Kong' - away from the tourist areas.

<Content>On balance very good for price Based on the limited information in earlier reviews, I was pleasantly surprised with my stay at the Dorsett. Yes, the beds are very firm, and the rooms very small and the air conditioning does not seem to have a heating option. On the other hand... *They let us check in at 9am when we arrived intending only to drop off our bags from the airport.*Brought us a good quality baby bed, gratis, for our 10 month old. *Air Conditioning filters out smoke smells well. (We wanted a non-smoking room and ended up on a smoking floor--there are only about 3 NS floors in the 20 floors of the hotel--but did not have a problem with smoke smells, except when we turned the AC off and the gentleman in the room next door lit up. Turning the AC back on quickly alleviated the odours).*Staff throughout were efficient and courteous.*Considerable arrange of room amenities on hand (tooth brush, comb, in room safe, etc. in addition to usual shampoo and soap)*Well located between MRT stations (Olympic a quick 5 min walk, Mong Gok about 10/15 min walk the other direction). (They have an airport shuttle too, but the MRT was sufficient for our needs)*Plenty of local food/shopping easily accessible in blocks around hotel.I would not recommend the breakfast buffet as much as some others. It is adequate (particularly on your first morning before you have oriented yourself), but the variety is limited and missing a few breakfast buffet staples (like fruit!)

<Content>Worked for us. My girlfriend and I stayed here 4 nights. Although the rooms are small, like almost all in HK, they are well equipped and above all very clean. It takes about two minutes to walk via Olympic station, which is easy to get to from the airport via a change at Tsing Yi. Although it takes 10 minutes to walk to Nathan Road, we enjoyed the fact we were away from the craziness. Breakfast was a buffet affair mixing Cantonese and Western. A vending machine in the lobby was handy (takes octopus card too) as it is loads cheaper than the minibar! Overall good value for money, nice staff, clean, and from where we were on the 17th floor, facing Olympian City 2, a decent view, especially at night. Two small negatives. we booked a double online and got a twin. The room didn't lend itself to pushing beds together so we left it, couldn't be bothered to move room, and when we checked out tax was added over the price advertised, but it was still cheap. (500HKD per night BB) Will stay there again for sure.

<Content>New but tiny We stayed here for 3 nights split up with a side trip in between. We were newly arrived from America and wondering the streets looking for the hotel. The hotel is set a few feet off the street with no big signage to guide the way. Note to hotel: allowing guests to find the hotel is a good idea! You can literally be standing at the shop next to the hotel and not at all tell that the hotel is there!Once inside we found a tiny room with 2 tiny single beds. We had been told by the hotel that no double room was available even though we had booked one. It probably was better this way (our friends stayed at the Dorsett Seaview hotel with a double bed that was not much bigger than a single).The hotel is very new which is a plus. I've been to other scary old Hong Kong hotels and it is nice to have a bathroom not covered in mildrew. There is a flat screen TV on the wall with a handful of channels. No closet just one shelf. Needless to say we had to close our suitcases just to walk to the bathroom, either that or step through the suitcase. In order to pass each other in the hallway someone had to move to sit on the bed. The location is ok. The good thing is that it is on a quieter street so we did get some sleep. There are restaurants and a 711 plus McDonalds nearby (for those that have jetlag and need to leave their roomies to sleep). The bad thing is that it is a little bit of a hike to Nathan road. We didn't mind so much since Argyle St is a market street and we were able to get all sorts of yummy food and drinks there (sugar cane juice is awesome!). It could have been a bit closer to the action though especially at the end of a long day of walking.I would stay there again but only if I couldn't get a room at the Mingle. And I forgot to mention that the staff were only barely helpful. Don't bother asking for recommendations or any questions about the local area. They are absolutely no help. When we were leaving the hotel we were standing outside our room adjusting our bags. The maid asked if we were checking out and then went into the room to look for the tip then left. This was right in front of us!We only stayed there on the return from our sidetrip since no other hotel room was available for booking (Hong Kong was sold out).

<Content>Acceptable Let me start by saying we were looking for a hotel that was good enough and that's what we found. My partner and I were visiting Hong Kong on a weekend, when hotel prices seem to go through the roof. After spending a lot of time reading reviews and looking at prices, we concluded the Dorsett Olympic appeared to provide a good balance between price and quality. The hotel is a new building in an old part of Kowloon. The lobby was small and crowded, but the decor was alright. Checking in was fast and efficient, and we were riding the tiny elevator up to our room in no time.The other reviewers were right - these rooms are tiny! There is about 2-3 feet of floor space around the bed, and that's it. The bathroom is tiny too. That being said, the room was clean with a modern decor. At night, we didn't hear any noise from inside or outside the hotel, so we had a good night's sleep. We weren't in Hong Kong to spend time in our room, so the size really wan't that much of an issue.The location is good. It's about a 5 minute walk to the MTR, and only a couple of stops away from Central Hong Kong. The neighborhood is colorful, and we felt safe at all times. We didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on that.In short, if you're looking for a safe choice at a good price, then this hotel is worth considering. If you want ammenities and a bit more of an upscale feel, then pay more and stay somewhere else.

<Content>Small but clean and sufficient The room was small as expected, but it had everything we needed so it was good value. The dining room was limited and did not give us a full breakfast. The PC with Internet access as advertised was non existant. The location was not so good, but it was close enough to the MTR for us to get around to wherever we wanted to.

<Content>Small but Top Value I stayed for a week while attend an event at the Hong Kong Expo.Room was small but comfortable. Don't expect a view! The hotel restaurant was OK. The shower was high powered. Internet Access is $100HK a day and worked fine while I was there.Highly recommend the restaurant one block along Anchor Street on the same side of the street as the Hotel. It is very modern, clean and the food was excellent. Don't have a name for it cos everything was in Chinese but some of the staff had very good English. You'll spot it 'cos it stands out bright and clean alongside the dingy shops.Traveled every day to the Expo out at the Airport on the MTR from Olympic Station via Tsing Yi to the Airport Express. Buy an Octopus card for all your transport needs (MTR, Bus, Star Ferry, Tram) and you can even use it to buy things at some local stores like a paper of food and drink. Saves the hassle of change, I will return to this hotel.

<Content>Small rooms but really value for money The rooms are rather small but I was well prepared for that since I have checked up on it on a few travel websites (including trip advisor). However there was a lack of storage space since the closet is really small. Recommend to book a double room as its bigger than a twin room (since price is same). Even the closet and toilet seems bigger in the double room. Location wise, it is definitely not your touristy area and it looks like it was situated in this metal industrial area. But that was still bearable since it wasn't particularly noisy or anything. It was about 10 mins from the main shopping area of Kowloon and maybe 20 mins from Tsim Sha Tsui, hence will really require a lot of walking or cab rides. Staff are not exactly very courteous but you can still live with that. I wouldn't mind staying there again as the room is really clean and neat and its value for money; it cost less than $100 per night.

<Content>Small but comfortable I and 3 friends were staying in the Dorsett Olympic on 11-18 August 2007 for holiday. The room is quite small but adequate for two persons, the bed is only 1.8 m long so if you more than 1.7 m this could be a problem. The room is very clean and bright so the bathroom. The nearest MTR is Olympic which is about 10 minutes walk but you can always catch the hotel shuttle bus to the pioner center than to MTR Prince Edward which is only 1 block away from the drop off point. There are two seven eleven shops and one park n shop near the hotel (less than 5 minutes walk). I also have a friend who stay in Dorsett Olympic for 1 day then move to Dorsett Seaview because Olympic is full. According to him, Dorsett Olympic is better than Dorsett Seaview while Seaview cost more than Olympic, the room are more modern and cleaner at Olympic. For its price, I think Dorsett Olympic is excellent

<Content>Very new and clean What draws the most attention to this hotel is that it is the cleanest and newest building in the area... I would agree that the area is a bit old and not very pleasant looking, but that's HK. The room is TINY, but once again: that's HK. The hotel is very new, staff is very helpful and speak reasonable English. There's a shuttle to the shopping area, which is nice. It's also reasonably close to the MTR station which takes you to TST, causeway bay etc, which are the really nice places in HK.Breakfast was not my favorite; I still struggle to understand why anyone would eat lettuce and tomatoes for breakfast, but I've learnt it's a common trait in chinese hotels. I am going to HK again next month and I'm staying there once more, and it's pretty cheap for HK, and the rooms are very nice and new.

<Content>Cute Little Hotel I stayed in the Dorsett Olympic Hotel for a week. Overall I really liked this hotel. The rooms are small but it's Hong Kong, you can't expect to get a very large room at a reasonable price. As a solo female traveller I felt the room was small but nice and cozy. Another reviewer commented that this hotel is located in a total slum. It is true that the area surrounding the hotel is not very visual appealing. But a lot of areas in Hong Kong look a little run down but are perfectly safe. As a solo female (and often very paranoid) traveller i felt safe walking from the hotel to Olympic station since it is literally only a 5 min walk. However at night (past 10:30 pm) i took taxis just to be a little extra cautious.The hotel lobby is small but I think that makes it easy for hotel staff to be aware of who is entering the building. I have stayed in much larger hotels and often feel a little unsafe when there are a lot of unsavoury characters hanging out in the lobby. Not once did I find some loittering in the lobby.Given the close proximity to Olympic MTR station you can get to the centre of Hong Kong Island in less than 30 min (door to door). I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Nice, clean, sleek hotel We stayed here June 14-16, 2007 and I would say this is a good and nice hotel for its price. We were able to get a good rate (400hkd per day) for a twin room. The room is very clean and well organized despite the fact that it is small. Staff speak good english, and they are very polite and accommodating.The hotel is very accessible. Olympic MTR station is just a few walks away. Along the way, there is a nice restaurant (beside Bank of China along Tai Kok Tsui Road) that serves good dimsum. For breakfast, we eat 4 types of dimsum for only HKD$37! Then we walk a few steps and we came across a bakery called Victoria and bought egg tarts (which is only 3 for HKD$6). Instead of taking breakfast at the hotel, you can just walk towards Tai Kok Tsui and explore the stores and restaurants there. We saw a cooked food center along the road but we were not able to explore it anymore due to lack of time.We will definitely stay again at this hotel.

<Content>Great Accommodation with a reasonable price I went to Hong Kong to see a friend who was there for a study abroad program. I stayed a week and I must say this place is such a great place to stay. Room and bathroom were small but that's ok. There was a TV with 2 english channels on it, the beds were nice, and the place as a whole made up for it greatly. There was excellent service at the front desk and they made it so easy for me with the english they spoke very well. Shuttle was always on time and the maid tidied up the room every day. Bellman will push the elevator button for you and direct you out to the shuttle bus when it arrived. If I had any shopping, direction, or nightlife question they were always helpful by pulling out a map and pointing out all they knew (which was alot).They called taxis for me (one time the guest service guy went all the way up the road just to flag one down for me)! I was so very pleased with my stay and would stay there over and over again. Be careful, though, It's in Olympic City which is not an area where many other westerners stay. The place is still VERY safe, and was never in any worry that anything would be stolen. I was pretty much the only westerner at the hotel. But a 5 min. shuttle ride will get you to an MTR metro station which will open the doors to anywhere you want to go in Kowloon or Hong Kong Island. It's SUPER cheap! So are the taxis, but more expensive than the MTR.On the food end, there is a McDonalds just down the road, but who wants to go there? When you're in HK, do as the HKese do and eat at a local restaurant. There is a place very close by, to the left of the 7eleven I always called the Hot Pot place because it's real name was written in chinese, but it had THE best food from Vietnames, Chinese, and Indian you could get it there. Plus the bakery shops are also another thing to die for. I kept getting the raisin bread twists that were always sold there.Nightlife...not in Olympic City or the surrounding area. Take the MTR to TST (in Kowloon) or Central station (on HK island) and enjoy the nightlife there, it'll only cost you about $2 US to get you there and it's quick. Only trouble I had here was getting back. The MTR closes at 12:30am and to get back after that time you had to take a taxi. I was either in TST or on HK Island so to get back to my hotel it usually ran me between $4.50 US and $15 US depending on just how far away I was from my hotel.I would definitely stay here again without a hesitation.

<Content>Highly recommended for budget travelers Stayed in this hotel in April 2007 for 2 nights,got there by Metro and got off at the station Olympic.Was not a good idea with big luggage as it took 10 mins walk.We had twin rm 1601,which looked exactly the same as the photo published.Yes,small,it is Hong Kong, and I just paid 50éˆ§?night  I can't expect a 50sq.m. room.I got what I paid for.New, nice  clean room.Not good situated for tourists but the hotel provides shuttle bus service to Mongkok,Kowloon Station  Temple Street once every hour.Even by taxi to Mongkok it is just a few minute drive  cheap. The service people(Front desk,housekeeping  concierge) were all very nice  helpful

<Content>Decent well priced hotel. A tall thin building close to Hong Kong's most crowded area, Mongkok. Nevertheless, conveniently placed for the airport, Kowloon and Central as it has two MTR stations very close by.Rooms are small but seem to have most things in them. Beds are a bit short and there is no internet access of any sort.Clean, quite comfortable, convenient and well priced. Good for those on a budget.

<Content>Just Nice My BF and I stayed at the Dorsett for 3 weeks. First impressions of the hotel is that it was nicely decorated, but rooms on the small side. The view on the 13th floor, wasnt exactly spectacular but It was clean and service was good but found the staff did not speak english as fluently as i expected. Not situated in the best of areas as it was quite a walk to Mong Kok station, esp when its 30 celcius! Great shopping in Mong kok and Nathan Road which were close by and lots of different attractions only a few stops away. Hotel best suited to people who dont intend to stay in their room for the duration of their stay. Noise levels were to a minimum, no street noise, got peaceful nights sleep 99.9% of the time, maids usually got their hoover out early and the doors weren't exactly noise proof. Overall, pleasant, but would not stay here again.

<Content>Good value and pleasant hotel I stayed here for 4 nights and found it convenient and comfortable. The staff was a little abrupt but efficient. The room was clean. It felt a little on the small size but still adequate. The location was excellent being very close the Olympic MTR and taxis frequently passed by at the street corner 1 block away. The street is quiet at night. I ate at the hotel cafe once and it was nothing spectacular but is an ok option if you're too tired to go out. It was one of the best budget hotels I've stayed in.

<Content>Value for money We stayed in the Dorsett Olympic for 8 days in November and would recommend it as a relatively cheap stay. It appears to have recently been refurbished and dèŒ…cor and bathroom fittings were all of a good standard éˆ¥?fresh and clean. The rooms are small but adequate and ours on the 13th (non-smoking) floor even had a view out to the harbour. The house-keeping service was excellent éˆ¥?very prompt at lending us plugs and computer cables etc. Staff seemed to have good English skills. The location is close to the MTV but a few blocks from Nathan Road and is in an interesting area with plenty of local flavour. We found the free shuttle bus invaluable. It left on the hour throughout the day and was our means of transport to and from Nathan Rd and Kowloon Station. Our only complaints were the limited TV station coverage éˆ¥?almost entirely Chinese language stations, and the high cost of internet éˆ¥?HK$30 an hour, which was double most other hotels.

<Content>Loved it for the second time! Stayed at the Dorsette Olympic Hotel last March and thought it was a great hotel, overall.I went back to Hong Kong this month and stayed at the Olympic and still loved the place. It's a great place to stay. It is priced extremely reasonably affordable. 3 malls around you. Great dimsum place accross the street. Nice little shops around the area. Little hole on the wall restaurants with great cheap clean food. 2 blocks away from the subway station. What more can you ask for?pros: location, price, cleanliness, customer service, promptness, design, conviniencecons: A little on the small side. The bathroom is perfest for anyone under 250lbs.I would stay there again when I go back next year!
