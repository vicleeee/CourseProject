<Content>not a bad little place my first review!!this place was not too bad, a bit worn around the edges, a bit far out of town, but right next to the train station.i got there early, they made me very welcome, were very friendly and got the room cleaned quickly. maid was a bit grumpy, but whatever. the rooms were smallish, but serviceable. pros- out of amdam a bit, not in the touristy area friendly staff super friendly restaurant staff. very helpful and the food was actually really good right next to train depotcons- right next to train depot major construction. for at least another year or two worn, small and we were facing the courtyard so it was noisy. not bad, but i might have chosen something else.

<Content>Convenient I agree with other reviews, this is a convenient alternative to staying in Amsterdam or at the airport (Schiphol). There are regular direct trains to each from the train station which is almost attached to the hotel - a skybridge links the hotel to the station and there is an elevator/lift in the skybridge so one doesn't have to lug their bags up or down several flights of stairs.The hotel is clean and the staff is helpful. There is a restaurant on the premises with room service although I didn't try either. My room was comfortable but some of the fixtures were dated, such as the roughly 10 year old 12/30cm TV screen which was very dark as well as much smaller than what is in most hotels now. There was a bathtub/shower combo with a tub large enough for my legs to be completely underwater (I'm about 6'/183cm and have long legs).There is construction adjacent to the hotel on the other side of the skybridge. I was told by hotel staff that it will be a complex that includes a new rail station and a new Golden Tulip hotel that will replace the present hotel. The new hotel will be across the street so I expect the current hotel will remain open until the new hotel opens. Seems to me they were aiming for a 2010 but I'm not positive. My room, which faced the construction site, was not bothered by noise. This may have been due to the nature of the work being done during my stay which seemed to be two cranes moving things rather than pounding or loud heavy equipment.The nearest restaurants are about 5 to 10 minutes away by foot in Zaandam. Eating in Amsterdam made more sense to me. Don't make the mistake I made by thinking the large building nearby with Albert Heijn banners contains an AH supermarket - it doesn't. It's the corporate hq.

<Content>A great alternative to city centre Amsterdam My wife and I booked this hotel to be close enough to Amsterdam without the high car park prices and busy city centre.The railway station is adjacent to Golden Tulip. It is a ten minutes ride to Amsterdam Central Station for a modest fare.The rooms are the average size for the Netherlands, well maintained and clean. The wifi makes it a good choice for business travelers as well.The staff was very helpful and provided valuable information to help us to take the best of our stay. The Zaanse Schans park is a must. It is a short drive/bus ride or, ideally, by bicycle. The cycle tracks are excellent everywhere.

<Content>Good Value - Next to Quiet Train Station We really enjoyed our 6 night stay over the Christmas holiday. Friendly, attentive and helpful staff. We forgot to bring an electrical power outlet adapter (from US to European) and the front desk gladly loaned us one (a real time saver as we needed to use our laptop). Located right next to a very very quiet train station. Only a 10 minute train ride to Amsterdam Central and 20 minute train ride to the airport.. Trains run on very frequent basis. Awesome public transit system! Restaurant was very good and a bit pricey (in US dollars). Intimate bar area with a fireplace and great service. A PC is available in the lobby area which came in handy to check email.. Small rooms with very clean and modern bathrooms. Our bed wasn't firm enough for me.A short walk to local (Zandaam) shopping, restaurants and two nightclubs. This area is where the locals go. The exterior of the hotel was being quietly refurbished. Across the street some construction was going on and the noise was noticeable one morning when we tried to sleep in. Overall we'd recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location if you take the car Great location if you have a car - free parking at hotel. Just got back this morning from a wonderful trip. We took the car (Harwich to Hook - overnight on Thurs- dinner in Pier resaurant in Harwich, on boat 9.30pm straight to cabin which we had paid extra for to get double bed and free bar, well worth it). Satellite navigation got us straight to the hotel no problem although I think it would not have been too difficult to find with a route planner. It is a four star hotel but I would say equivalent to our three star in UK. We booked via Late Rooms and paid 99euros plus I rang the hotel a few days before and upgraded to Superior room for 15euros more (not incl breakfast which we did not bother with). This gave us a King size bed, bathrobes (which we never received), it was not a particularly luxurious room, but clean with v comfortable bed. Everything you needed. But the best bit was that it was right by the railway station (never heard any train noise but they are so quiet, (why do we not have a rail system like this?), literally a few steps and trains went to Amsterdam every 10 mins, always on time and fantastic double decker trains! Two stops (about 10mins) to centre of Amsterdam. We had two full days in Amsterdam completely hassle free. I will return and change nothing about our trip. If you want more information on any of our trip, by all means email me. Only downside in short term with this hotel is it could be noisy during weekdays as building work going on - but probably would not bother you as in Amersterdam during day. Did not eat at hotel but got a great meal in Zaandam at local restaurant - Porto Fino.

<Content>Lovely Hotel We stayed at the Golden Tulip from 27th to 30th September and were very pleased. The train station is literally 60 seconds away, although we heard no train noise from the hotel at all, and the friendly reception staff made us very welcome. The leaflets, maps and general information they gave us were very useful. Access to the hotel was a bit restricted to due to building work and the workmen directly across the road made plenty of dust and a fair bit of noise, starting at 0730, but we spent the day out of the hotel so weren't bothered.  Rooms are not exactly spacious, but very clean and more than adequate with a lovely bathroom, tea- and coffee-making facilities and a free safe. Breakfast was excellent with hot and cold selection and a reasonable 14.50 Euros per person. Trains to Amsterdam run every few minutes, take about 15 minutes and cost, at time of writing, 3.80 Euros for a return ticket.  Everywhere is easily accessible from Zaandam, we found it a perfect base from which to explore and the Golden Tulip is, all in all, a hotel we would recommend to everyone.

<Content>Best place to go riding! We stayed at the Golden Tulip for 3 days and had a fantastic time. We booked through last minute and got a good deal. The hotel is right next door to the metro which takes 10 mins into the centre of Amsterdam and is very frequent. The hotel is a good option for budget travellers but still accessible to the main city.The hotel is quite basic but it has all you need for a short break. Our room overlooked building work but it wasn't too noisy and the room was clean. The bathroom is quite big. The restaurant serves fantastic food, though a little pricey. The staff were friendly and helpful, giving directions, maps  money-off vouchers for certain attractions. A bonus is the free internet (one PC by reception).Zaandam itself is the best place to ride a bicycle - we hired bikes from the shop next door to the hotel and rode for several hours around the town, stopping to eat and go shopping. We visited the windmill and had a great meal at the Japanese restaurant there.Amsterdam is fantastic and I will definitely go back as we couldn't do everything. It's easy to get around and people are friendly.

<Content>Great location but many problems I stayed in this hotel for ten days. I booked it through United Airlines vacation packages. As I told one of the very rude staff women at the front desk, I have been to 35 countries and traveled the world since 1978. When I ask a question, I want an answer not a smark remark. I would ask simple questions and get either a blank look or a curt reply. I had read in a book that the Dutch were down to earth and direct. Well, at this hotel that translated to rude and nasty. I asked one front desk person the same question twice because I forgot the bus number she had given me the day before. Didn't I tell you that yesterday, she snarled. The room service was deplorable. I got a very small bath soap which after some four days, was reduced to a nub. I had to leave a note to get a replacement. Since I am a participant in the Green Movement, I did not request that my linen be changed daily. Therefore, my towels were tossed in the tub by the staff instead of being folded. Two days in a row, my trash can was not emptied. Maybe I was on the wrong floor, but this service was deplorable. The coffee was cold in the breakfast buffet and I had to wait 25 minutes, yep, 25 minutes for scrambled eggs when they ran out half way through the posted breakfast time. When I needed ice, I had a 15 minute wait at the bar. No ice machine - you stand there and wait until they get damn good and ready to give you ice. As I said, the location was good and noise was not an issue. But the service and the staff: deplorable.

<Content>Great Experiance! I stayed with my family at the Golden Tulip for a week over the summer. The rooms are somewhat small, but the beds are incredibly comfortable and the bathrooms are a good size. The staff was really friendly, the hotel was clean, and the food in the restaurant was fantastic, if not a bit expensive. A 10 minute train ride puts you in Amsterdam, and it was very easy to use. We took over the bar most nights for drinks or coffee, and they were so great - very accomodating to a large group of people! Not in the greatest neighborhood, but a 5 minute walk takes to you the shops. I would stay there again!

<Content>Out of Amsterdam but good for visiting the city The proximity of the hotel to the railway into Amsterdam makes this a serious contender for any visit; when I stayed, it was impossible to get a room in a good hotel in the city. Rooms are well furnished if a little on the small side. No meals taken at the hotel.

<Content>Fantastic stay, Great location!! I adored this hotel above all others that I stayed in during my European trip. It is located right next to the train station so access to Amsterdam central is only 5 - 10 minutes. You get a fantastic hotel at a fraction of the cost compared to the same standard hotels directly in Amsterdam. The rooms are wonderful and the beds are fantastic! I slept like a baby each night. The breakfast was wonderful as well. You couldn't ask for better staff. I stayed in 3 seperate hotels while in Amsterdam due to my daughter playing in a soccer tourn. I wish I had stayed in this one for the entire 10 days. Live and learn! I highly recommend this hotel to everyone!

<Content>A Smashing time in Amsterdam We stayed at this Hotel because of its location to the train system,it is only 10 minutes from the city centre by train costing 15.20 Euros return for 4 persons ( 30 Euros one way in a taxi )The Hotel is next door to the Station, trains run very often with the last one leaving the city @ 1.05 pm.Bed rooms very clean with good beds and nice clean bathrooms.Zaandam the town is a good example of 60s planning gone very very wrong, miles of poorly laid block paving and concrete.Do not get into Amsterdam before lunch time, the City needs to be emptyed of tons of rubbish and it looks a mess.The Red Light area is full of action if thats what you like, bars and cafe' selling funny smelling cigs.It is a very safe city and all areas are walkable, but look out for cycles they come from everywere.We would use this Hotel again.John  Marie Jim  Sue

<Content>Average Hotel We spent 2 nights here last weekend. Other viewers are absolutely correct about this hotel. Basic room and quite noisy from the traffic (the room was in the front of hote; the back side might be better), the 4* standard is obviously lower than we expected. However, all hotels in Amsterdam are very expensive. You got what you paid for; we got the special deal for the 鈥淕olden Tulip 45 Years鈥?so we should not complain. The location is very convenient; the hotel is literally beside the Zaandam train station, 10 minutes you are in Amsterdam central train station. The last train is 1 am from central station. The bathroom is clean and the breakfast is reasonable ok. We would stay here again next time if there is a special deal.

<Content>Better for business guests than tourists We enjoyed this stay, but found the hotel to be full of business travellers rather than tourists like ourselves. Food was excellent and the whole place was spotlessly clean. The journey into the centre of Amsterdam was quick and easy, so we avoided the problems which might've occured if we'd stayed in Amsterdam itself (we visited slap bang in the middle of a Soctland/Netherlands football match!) The room was fairly basic, not the biggest I've ever stayed in and did face the road so there was quite alot of traffic noise at all hours of the day and night (ear plugs soon sorted that out!) Overall though, I would return to this hotel next time I go to Amsterdam.

<Content>Very Good The Golden Tulip Zaandam is a very nice hotel. The rooms are not very spacious but are sufficent. My only complaint would be that we specified a double room (with a double bed) but we got a twin room which had 2 single beds pushed together. We didn't complain as we are not the type but we were not impressed. The main thing is the rooms are clean. The restaurant is lovely and both the food and the service is very good.

<Content>Take your Earplugs.. Stayed at the Tulip during Feb 2007.I stay in Holland quite a bit and this was a perfectly satisfactory.Unfortunately the hotel is suituated right on a busy junction but as I always take earplugs this wasn't a problem for me.When you ask for a double room you get the usual Dutch trick of two single beds pushed together.These spend all night trying to part company and you'll be lucky not to vanish down in between.Evening food was good but the buffet breakfast was cold and uninspiring.Hotel was way way too hot but each room has (a slightly fiddly) aircon.A bonus is the train Station very close by.Direct trains from the airport take about 20 mins.

<Content>Nice Hotel We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights on a visit to Amsterdam, it is conviniently situated right next to Zaandam railway station, so you can't miss it when you leave the station, which is very handy when you are carrying your luggage. The station has frequent trains to Amsterdam Central, which is only one stop and about 15 minutes away, also a trains runs direct to Schipol Airport, although I believe it was only one an hour, but that wasn't an issue. The hotel itself was clean and had a friendly atmosphere, whilst the room served it's purpose more than enough, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was clean and well equipped, a mini bar was also present, although a little expensive, but that's to be expected in most hotels, although having the fridge was handy as we used it to keep our beer and fruit juice cold. A cycle hire shop was located outside the hotel, so was easy to rent a bicycle, although we didn't. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel so am unable to comment on the standard of food available, but all in all an enjoyable stay and a hotel I could reccomend to others who may not want to be based in the Amsterdam city centre.

<Content>Clean, Quiet, Central, GREAT This hotel was booked by a relative as part of a surprise trip. When i found out it was on the outskirts of Amsterdam I was a bit concerned. i needn't have been.The hotel is right outside the train station, Zandaam station is 2 stops from the airport and 2 stops from central station. Usually you have to stay near the sirport and travel for long periods to the city centre or vice versa. This hotel was excellently located as it was close to both (no more than 20 minutes by train, without having to change).The hotel was clean and very pleasant, the staff were friendly and the facilities good. The menu was a bit strange and breakfast was quite expensive though.I would definitely stay in the Golden Tulip again and can heartily recommend it.

<Content>Lousy reservation system but great hotel The good news. Stayed for 5 nights in a Superior Queen Room. Room had a King bed. Quiet despite being 40 metres from train station. Staff very helpful. Very easy to get into Amsterdam 12 minutes by train (approx 6 trains per hour) and 3.70 Euros return.The bad news. Website did not accept Australia as a country so tried to book by email - no reply to initial or followup emails. Eventually called only to find the rate had gone up in the interim. Surprisingly the hotel refused to honour the rate that had been posted at the time of the emails.

<Content>Lovely Hotel Really enjoyed our weekend in this hotel. Read some other reports and decided not to stay in centre of Amsterdam. Train station was next door and took very little time to get into Amsterdam.Hired bikes outside hotel on our last day and had a terrific time cycling all around Zaandam - check out the lovely restaurants in Zaandam!!!MA Romsey Hampshire

<Content>A pefect stay. We arrived late at night and were greeted by the friendliest, welcoming receptionist who made us feel comfortable straight away, asking about our journey and how we were. When we went to the room it was obvious straight away that we had chosen well. Everything was new and in perfect order, clean and modern, king size bed. The room wasn鈥檛 over sized but this wasn鈥檛 a problem, everything we needed was there. All the staff were very professional, courteous and friendly.The breakfast was pricey at 14 euro but it was worth it for the convenience.Getting to and from the airport and into the city by train was not a problem at all. Public transport fills me with dread but it was so simple to get about and trains were every ten minutes where ever you were going and cheap too. I would recommend this to anyone; it was nice to get away from the hustle and bustle but not to far out either to enjoy the city. The last train at night was 1.06am!

<Content>Great hotel Me and my partner stayed at the hotel at the weekend just gone. we were a bit woried about the location as it looks quite far from Amsterdam. However it was only a 10 min train ride wich was very easy to use and cheap at only 2.30 Euro's!! The hotel its self was very nice, clean, comfortable and courteous staff who were very welcoming. The breakfast was also very nice although I still can't figure out what an American breakfast is yet.We would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Golden Tulip Zaandam - Will Definitely Return After spending a long week end at the Zaandam Golden Tulip we were surprised to read the comments of a previous reviewer. We found the hotel to be very well managed, rooms and public areas were attractive and immaculately clean. The staff was friendly and courteous and in which UK chain hotel would you be served the largest Johnnie Walker and Gordon鈥檚 GT just because you happened to mention that we were having a week end break to celebrate our birthdays? The food in the restaurant was excellent albeit there was some confusion as to what constituted a Hollandaise sauce. We queried it and the chef immediately offered to prepare an alternative which we declined as there was nothing wrong with what he had cooked. The manageress then presented us with another drink on the house to, as she put it, apologise for the misunderstanding as she felt bad about it. The location of the hotel couldn鈥檛 be better; being immediately adjacent to the railway station from where you get frequent and fast connections to Amsterdam and Schipol. As mentioned by other reviewers, the hotel鈥檚 location allows you to get away from touristy Amsterdam which can be a bit frantic. Admittedly the area around the hotel is a bit drab but a short walk through the shopping area takes you to the town square and the waterside. As for there being druggies in the shopping area, it must have been their week end off as we didn鈥檛 see any nor did we ever felt threatened other than by the odd errant cyclist. For some reason Dutch cyclists seem to ride around oblivious to anything or anyone. How they avoid the trams is a mystery. There are numerous relaxed cafes and restaurants in the town square and no wonder Monet spent time there, the views down by the waterside are superb. We would have no hesitation in returning to the Zaandam Golden Tulip.

<Content>An excellent hotel in a great location to enjoy our visit to Amsterdam My wife and I chose this hotel because it was out of the city centre of Amsterdam. It was a short train journey to the Centraal Station in the city. We couldn't believe how easy it was to roll out of our bed and walk about five minutes to the railway station ! Couldn't be easier ! Probably much easier than if we stayed in the city ! Also easy to get to the airport.The rooms were very nice - spacious, very clean and comfortable - and very quiet. The area around the hotel isn't particularly scenic; it's near a main road but there is a shopping precinct nearby. But why come to Amsterdam and stay in the hotel or want to walk around a city suburb when you can explore such an interesting city ? Although the precinct is like any other outer city precinct, there is a very interesting walk down to the canal where you can watch the barges go up and down and watch the road bridge lift to allow the barges pass through. An interesting sight in the city suburbs. It's also a pleasant walk.We didn't eat in the hotel - the city is so convenient we usually ate in the city and got the train back to the hotel whenever we wanted. There are also restaurants we visited in the centre of Zaandam, about 15 mins walk from the hotel. In the centre of Zaandam there is an interesting statue of the young Peter the Great (I think) who learned the art of ship-building in Zaandam !We would also highly recommend the tasty breakfast in the station cafe/restaurant - brilliant !In summary, we would definately stay in this hotel again. It was very comfortable and cosy after a hard day's walking round Amsterdam. But best of all - the location was terrific - a few minutes walk to the railway station and straight into the city centre in no time.

<Content>Great Hotel For us this was simply a great hotel in a great location.Access from the airport is direct, hourly ,takes about 20 mins and costs 7.4 euros return.The hotel is virtually part of the station (but no noise) so with the great passenger facilities at the airport it is almost like getting off the plane straight into the hotel.The hotel room was spotless,of adequate proportions and very well equiped....in fact just what a weary traveler wants.You have control of the heating and air conditioning ( the windows also opened) and the hot water for a shower or bath just kept coming and coming.We traveled daily to and from Amsterdam central with the trains running about every 10 mins at peak times ( 7.2euros return) This we didn't find a problem as we always try to stay a little removed from whatever centre we are visiting.Shopping (supermarket included) can be found locally within 5 mins from the hotel and we noticed a number of restaurants within easy reach.To sum up...the weather was pretty cold and nasty during our 4 day stay and the quality of the hotel and comfort provided really helped to 'save' the trip.We would,without doubt,recomend this hotel.

<Content>Never again - a disgrace I had a terribly disappointing stay in this hotel. It is in a very run down area of Amsterdam - there is a small shopping area in Zaandam, but you have to walk through an area which is graffiti-covered, shops are boarded up and unsavoury characters are lurking around, before you reach the nice area 鈥?this is not a place to be at night time.My friend and I had booked a Deluxe Twin room. The hotel is supposed to be 4*. In my experience, the hotel did not qualify for 4 star status and the room was not Deluxe in anyone鈥檚 terms. I called straight down to Reception to say that there must be some mistake about the room, but was assured that it was indeed their definition of 'deluxe' - I would hate to have seen a standard room. The room was small with nothing more than the standard facilities. A grossly overpriced mini-bar was the only thing out of the norm. We arrived there expecting that breakfast was to be included in the price we had paid. On check-in, no-one advised us that it was to be any different. We arrived for breakfast on the first morning and were very disappointed at what was on offer. The staff were rude, the serving plates were not replenished, the cheese was hardened from sitting out for so long. It was awful. Nobody offered us any tea or coffee and there were only flavoured teas and hot water available, so we ended up having hot water and a bread roll on both mornings - simply because we thought it was included. The tea and coffee making facilities in the room were never replenished. You could die of thirst waiting for someone to serve you in the bar. When it came to checkout, they tried to charge me 鈧?6.00 for two mornings of bread and water and I flatly refused. They then took the money anyway, after I had left the hotel. I am still disputing the 鈧?6.00 charge that the hotel put on my VISA card. I wrote to them twice and eventually received an extremely rude reply telling me that it was my problem that I expected breakfast! I would very strongly recommend that you avoid staying here 鈥?you will be disappointed.

<Content>A good experience Trains from schipol airport only when direct to Zaandam every hour. However you can go via Amsterdam and change trains. Hotel was right beside train station and bus station in Zaandam. Shops and restaurants were just 2 minutes walk. A good locationRooms were small put clean and had everything you need. All rooms had hair-dryer, mini-bar,tv. Room and linen was changed every day.Restaurant had a good selectin of food. Bar was small and could only fit about 14 people. Good service provided in both.Staff were very friendly and provided print outs of train schedules and tours when asked.

<Content>I would stay here again. The room was clean and the hotel was nice. The staff was friendly and there was a computer down in the lobby you can use for free.The hotel is right next to the train station so traveling to the hotel from the airport or from Amsterdam is quite easy. Going back and forth to Amsterdam from the hotel can get a little expensive but it's location is nice. The rooms are not very large by US standards, but it held me, my wife and all 200 KG of our luggage, so it was certainly big enough.Overall I would recommend the hotel and stay here again.One word of warning, make sure you check the price list before snacking on anything from the minibar! :)

<Content>Very nice place I had a very clean, modern looking room. It wasn't real big, but then in europe rooms aren't typically large anyway. The hotel is right next to the train station which is very convenient. Staff was very helpful. For the price, it was a great deal. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in for the price.

<Content>Out of town location but just 2 minutes from train station and bus station We stayed at the Golden Tulip for 2 nights. It was easy to get to via train from the airport as soon as you come off the train its only a two minute walk into the hotel.The hotel is located behind a busy main road(not noisey) and the local town centre Zaandam which has a good range of shops and resturants. but this did not cause any problems. The only downfall is that the distance and time that it takes you to get into Central Amsterdam; 25 mins on the bus or 20 mins on the train. You can purchase a bus ticket for under 7 euros which you can use over 3 times depending on distance of your journey. For convience it would be better to stay in central amsterdam.The hotel staff were very helpful and pleasent and there was always someone on call. The rooms were tastfully decorated and clean, but we did have to ask for more clean towels. The hotel has only 1 computer connected to the internet which everyone likes to use (if they can) so if you are wanting to find out about local tourist info just go into town.Overall a good clean pleasent hotel which deserves its 4*'s

<Content>Ok hotel bad location We stayed in Zaandam because I had hoped to get a better hotel for less money outside of Amsterdam. The hotel was a bit worn, but the rooms well well appointed and okay-sized. Our travel baby bed was a bit tight in there, but fit. The breakfast buffet was overpriced so we avoided it. The only real complaint I have was not about the hotel but the area. Very shady. We should have chosen Haarlem which has a much cuter town center. Also I should note that the 12 min trip by train was great, UNTIL we were stuck in the Amsterdam train station for 3 hours because of a total train outage. Not the hotels fault but if we has chosen a hotel in the city we would have walked!

<Content>Great BUSINESS hotel. If you are doing business in Zaandam, this is a great hotel. The rooms are beautifully soundproof ( concrete floors), the finishings are superb- especially the bathrooms- and the whole place has a modern, efficient atmosphere. The staff are polite and friendly and the food is excellent. Lastly, the hotel is right next to the station ( almost part of it!?!) and is handy for the bus terminal and taxi rank. The only fault we found was that the (new) bathroom floor tiles were very slippery. This hotel is pleasant in the extreme. If however, you are a tourist visiting Amsterdam, it's quite a different story. OK the trains are punctual and efficient but you soon get tired of this grimy commute. The view from the train is relentlessly urban ( concrete covered with graffitti) and Zaandam itself- from what I saw- is anything but quaint. Rather it's a heavily industrialised town, constructed mainly from concrete. I felt that over the 3 days of our visit we had spent FAR too much time hanging round draughty platforms. And please note that at the present time, the area round Central Station in Amsterdam ( including the station itself) is just one huge construction site.
