<Content>Tiny rooms An excellent place to stay if you are a monk. Our room was tiny and bare. When we ran out of bottled water I had to go down to the front desk. The room was spotless but the price was high when compared to Hotel Catedral or Gillow. We left after the first night.

<Content>Great location and lovely hotel This place is perfect for tourists looking to explore the city. Definitely worth paying that little bit extra for one of the rooms with a view onto the square - you can see the flag going up and down (including ceremony and army) each day. Breakfast on the balcony is a lovely start to the day. The food is good and if you have a seat at the edge of the balcony there are hummingbirds (I think) flying in! The terrace is also a great spot for dinner! Hotel staff (especially Jose Luis) were helpful organising tours (make sure to visit the pyramids) and offering recommendations. Felt very safe on the nearby streets at night and there were police on every corner.

<Content>Good Location, Terrible Service The Holiday Inn Zocalo has an excellent location and a friendly staff. I woudl qualify the rooms as OK, clean and fine but small and not particularly luxurious.Lookout if you need anything though. The staff is very friendly, butcfrequently seemed unable oto solve small problems such as the ATM being out of cash (I just wanted to know where another one was), or connect me to the concierge when I called the operator. They sent the bellboy to my room instead. The guest services button on the phone goes to a message saying the extension is out of order, while when room service closes at 11pm th number just rings and rings without a message or transferring you to the front desk.The gym is a small room with a treadmill and two weight machines in it. It has a TV and water, but could use better ventilation.The worst is the internet. There is none! There should be wireless on all floors, but the signal is so weak I have to reload basic pages over and over, reconnect every few minutes to whichever signal is strongest (never more than one bar, sometimes all connectivity is lost). I need to get work done and this is catastrophic for me. Every time I complain, and I have been for three days, I am given a different story - the wireless wont work because of the rain, we will reset the router and it will work (they did not) we are replacing the cables etc. No one at the hotel knows how to fix this key issue, and no one seems to be trying. When I explained that I confirmed that Internet was available and NEEDED to email things that day I was told to use the two computers in the lobby. I cant access my coroprate network through these computers. I asked for the location of a relieable connetion, they also didnt know wjere else I could go. I appreciate a friendly staff, but I appreciate them at least trying to fix the problem instead of just telling me a different story with every person I speak to a lot more.DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS TRAVELLER OR NEED TO GO ONLINE WHILE TRAVELING.Do go here if you want a nice location at a reasonable rate and are willing to go down to the front desk to straighten out every question or request.

<Content>What a dump I was here for a one week conference and was assigned this hotel. It is a Holiday Inn. The beds are uncomfortable, the linens are poor, and the pillows tolerable. The comforter slides off the bed while you sleep. The rooms are noisy, since you are next to Zocola square. The staff is OK but just do there job and do not go out of their way to help you. For instance, my room was not cleaned well; i was to receive a fed-ex package and they were no help in locating it (I had to call fed-ex), my laundry showed up at my hotel room at 10:30 PM when I had the privacy on. The only merit is the location to Temple Mayor, shopping, and restaurants (there is a McDonalds and 7-Eleven next door). The restaurant at the hotel for breakfast was fine. It has a great view of the square and service was good. I would stay elsewhere like the Sheraton Historico or Four Seasons next time.

<Content>At home in Holiday Inn Zocalo If you're a history and culture buff, then Holiday Inn Zocalo in Mexico City will be a hit for you. Located at the corner of 5 de Mayo, one of the streets surrounding that great square called the Zocalo, you will be near the Metropolitan Cathedral, the National Government Building, the Mexico City Government Building, and some archeological finds like the Templo Mayor within walking distance. We arrived at about 10 pm on a Thursday. When the reception clerk couldn't understand us, the English speaking Mr. Carlos Mata was called to help us. We were shown to our room with a double bed and 3 pillows. The bathroom has a good hot and cold shower which was easy to adjust to the right temperature. Bathroom amenities incuded 3 big towels, three hand towels, three small towels with 1 bath robe, plus the usual soap, shampoo and conditioner small bottles. Surprise! there was a small can of shoe polish, interesting, isn't it? The room was equipped with a personally controlled airconditioner (which was a big bonus since we can decide when we want it cold or warm inside the room).Breakfast is more than sufficient with the buffet table laden with fruits, fruit juices, french toast, pancakes, Mexican breakfast staples. There was a corner to order eggs as you like it, sunny side up or scrambled, with a lovely senorita cooking on the spot for you. Endless coffee refills as you wanted. But the best part is the view of the whole Zocalo square ...where the 8:00 ritual of flag raising is done. You have to see it and feel the Mexican spriri of pride as a retinue of soldiers emerge from the National Government building, complete with a brass band, then raise the biggest flag I have seen at the middle of the square.The hotel staff is another wonderful thing. If you're ever booked there, look for Mr. Daniel Aguilar at the Concierge's table. He speaks very good English and is a wealth of information on where to go, what to do, and is a big help on your travel needs. He was a big help to us when we were anxiously waiting for our tour guide, approaching us without our even asking and taking charge of the situation. Very friendly man, this Daniel.Mr. Carlos Mata was also a big help especially when we found out our reservation for our flight to Vancouver had been cancelled. He called up Mexicana and arranged eveything for us.The best thing though is the price. Our travel agency was able to get us a room for 6 nights, with buffet breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, half-day city tour, tour to the Basilica and the Teotihuacan pyramids and the Xochimilco floating gardens for only US$590 per person. Thumbs up for this hotel!

<Content>Excellent hotel I was supposed to arrive at 7.30 PM. I remember when I arrived at 2:35 AM (because my American Airlines flight got delayed) . The check in staff asked me why did I check in that time. When I replied it was a flight delay, they immediately gave me everything (room card key, breakfast coupons and helped me with my luggage). When I reached my room, I gave a tip to the employee, but he said it wasn't necessary. My room got everything, even a jacuzzi (I did not expected it). During my stay, all staff were friendly and courteous. The hotel is near many stores and it is quite interesting because you can hear and see the Mexican army raising the national flag at 6AM and lowering it at 6PM. I'm likely to return to this hotel.

<Content>Perfect Historical Location We spent seven nights in Acapulco and took a bus to Mexico City for nine nights. The Holiday Inn Zocalo was my first selection as our hotel. I made the reservations with the free Holiday Inn 800 number. The location is perfect. Everything anyone would need is within walking distance. For example, the post office is just around the corner. The subway stop is in the zocalo square. If you like fast food, McDonald's is a few doors from the hotel. And, there are various restaurants and bakeries all around the area. The national pawn shop is across the side street, and there are venders throughout the area. The maid service was very, very good and the front desk helpful. Above all, the bell boys were outstanding. English is not generally spoken, but Rosario, David, and Carlos knew enough English to answer all our questions and assist us with directions and locations. There is very much activity in this area, especially on the weekends. It can get noisy, but it is also very enjoyable and entertaining. There is much history, and this hotel is located right in the middle of the historical area. We did not take cabs, but used the subway all the time. The fare was 20-cents. Sometimes it was crowded and other times not...just like NYC. Many of the tour books advise you to take a cab from your hotel. It's less complicated and much cooler. We had no problem with the metro/subway, but we also did not stand around looking like schmuck tourists trying to figure out directions on a map. There is security throughout the metro stations. They are clean and well maintained.Since the government buildings and the national cathedral are in the zocalo area, there were police and security everywhere. They were helpful and courteous. The pyramids - We took a metro to the north autobus terminal and took a modern air-conditioned bus (for 30 pesos $3.00 ) to the pyramids....left at 11 a.m. and arrived at the pyramids at noon. If you climb to the top of the pyramid of the sun, be sure to touch the silver spot at the very top that marks the middle of the pyramid. The silver spot is approximately the size of a 50-cent piece. We caught another bus back to our hotel by the pyramid of the moon. The cost was a little cheaper. Chapultepec Park - We went to the park on the weekend when all the venders and the local people gather at the park.The Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe - We took a metro which stops approximately two-three blocks from the basilica. There are venders everywhere except on the church grounds. We visited many more sights and the hotel staff was very helpful in explaining the meaning of customs and traditions. All in all, it was a perfect location to a perfect trip.

<Content>Superb location  Stayed here for a week during 28Aor08 to 3May08. Overall this hotel is very good value. The location is unbeatable as you can walk to everywhere within 10 mins. During my stay the lobby bar was being renovated and the restaurant bar had no atmosphere. The food is okay, not excellent but just average. Service is below average. That said, there's no need to stay in the hotel for meals as there are some excellent restaurants in the vicinity. I highly recommend the famous Cafe Tacuba as well as the excellent El Vegetariano on Filomeno Mata (about 5 mins walk). Within a short walk are the old temples (Templo Mayor) as well as several old cathedrals. The old city has wonderful architecture and great boutique restaurants. If you crave the nightlife, Polanco has a lot to offer and is only 12-15 mins by taxi. I did not feel any concerns walking around by myself at night (sometimes as late as 1 am!). There are people around at all hours and also there are lots of police everywhere. Tip: If you don't like the noise then ask for an inside room. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>On the Zocalo, but quiet! My family of 3 needed a place in DF before heading out after a week in Mexico. We knew we wanted to stay near the Zocalo, a central location with great restaurants and sights. The hotel was quiet (be sure to ask for a quiet room -- not on the street). The staff was helpful... and the roof top restaurant has a magical view of the Zolcalo and beyond.Had been concerned in the past about staying on the Zocalo because of the noise issue..... but this hotel proved me wrong.

<Content>Watch the price you are quoted I reserved a room here for 4 nights through a travel website and was given a quote for the time I planned to stay. On arrival this quote had risen by 100 USD and I was told I had to pay or they would charge my credit card 25%. Not a great start. Room was clean and comfy but don't expect to sleep, organ grinders play from 10am all day, I think I can still hear the tune in my head. Plus drums and church bells too.Great location though for the historic places to see but very quiet at night, I tried the places in lonely planet and they were pretty dead, caught Metro to other areas in the end and got taxi home. Roof top restaurant is a great place for food and drinks if you can get a seat, its very popular with everyone. Wouldn't go back I have to say but it good value( well on my original quote) Enjoy Mexico

<Content>Awesome Location! This hotel is about a 3*, it is basic, clean and comfortable. It is located right near the zocalo (Mexico city's main square). The National Palace is also very close by opposite the square and so is the Metropolitan Cathedral. The street on which this hotel is located is quite busy and there are many interesting shops but even so it is quiet at night and I didn't find any noise. Staff was very helpful.The only downside is that the restaurants around the area are not to my liking. If you want to go to the clubs/nightlife this is not the area, for that you need to go to the heart of Zona Rosa.The metro station is a short 10 min walk across the square on the other side. The metro goes EVERYWHERE and is pretty damn good, it costs only 2 pesos so before using a taxi check it out.

<Content>Location, location, location The Holiday Inn is located PERFECTLY directly at the breathtaking Zocalo in the center of historic Mexico City, steps away from the old temple and the cathedral. It looks like it used to be a grand hotel and maybe one day, an investor will conduct a major makeover of this place and reopen it as a five star hotel for well off tourists. In the meantime, anyone who is interested in the culture and sights of this fascinating city can stay at the best possible location in the D.F. for a bargain price. Having said that, the rooms are clearly substandard (compared to other Holiday Inns) and the service is extremely disorganized (even by Mexican standards). I would still recommend this place because of the triple A location and the good value (which is so great because of the location).

<Content>Good central location  I recently stayed in this hotel for 3 nights, I choose it primarily for its location as it is very central and as a single woman traveller I wanted to avoid public transport and visit the town centre by foot as much as possible. I had initial concerns about noise, especially once I saw that my room window faced a fairly congested road however I felt better once I saw the windows were double-glazed and the rooms have thick curtains. I had sound sleep all 3 nights though no sleeping till late morning, by 8 -9 am you hear car honks and traffic. If you plan on sleeping till late I would not recommend a room which faces the street. I found that the computers in the lobby are really good for internet and e-mails however it is shame they only have 2 and at times you need to wait for your turn, they could do with adding another 2 or 3 computers for guests. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, rooms were clean and pleasant, the only area I was not too impressed with was breakfast, they could do better and offer a better presentation  selection of fruit. I recommend this hotel if it is for a few days and your priority is location and cleanliness.

<Content>Great Location, Friendly Staff I stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip while filming a commercial for my client. The location was fantastic, being a single female traveler I was a little concerned but I felt safe walking around Zocalo alone. Cute street vendors, book markets, and live shows speckle the large Square. I had no issues with the drummers in the Square but I did not stay over a weekend. I would say this is probably the safest area in Mexico City to stay if it is your first time visiting. I agree the rooftop view is awesome and that the staff is very friendly. My room was tiny but extremely clean and well kept. Room service was nice and prompt, beautiful presentation as well. The hotel arranged for a cab driver to take me to the pyramids, saving me from the drivers that station themselves outside the hotel trying to get tourists as a fare.Overall a great place to stay and would stay there again if the opportunity arises.

<Content>Almost Great The Holiday Inn Zocalo is located in the historic center of Mexico City across the street from the Square (Zocalo) and the National Cathedral. It is a fantastic location for visiting the Aztec Ruins (Templo Mayor) and the Govenor's Palace (Diego Reviera's murals). There are lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance.The staff of the hotel are very friendly and helpful and our room was very clean and comfortable. The rooftop restaurant offers a fantastic view of the Zocalo and the city.There are a few things that one should consider if choosing this hotel. First, if you get a room close to the Zocalo, the Aztecs will anoy you with their very loud drumming until 10:00 or 11:00 PM. The drum is so loud that you not only hear it, but feel it as well. I took ear plugs and I couldn't shut it out.Second, don't get in a rush at the rooftop restaurant. Service is extraordinarily slow. I'm not talking about normal Mexico slow, I'm talking slower.Third, we ordered room service each of our seven mornings there. The service was friendly, courteous, and fast. That is, until Lydia came on duty. That day we were treated rudely and we were served day old fruit (we didn't order fruit) and stale toast (we ordered Pan Dulce [Mexican Pastry]). When questioned about the order, Lydia became very argumentative. Language had nothing to do with it since my wife is fluent in Spanish. We complained to the Capitan about the treatment and received an apology and a complementary breakfast our last morning there.Fourth, the hotel will get you a fixed price taxi. The cars are clean and the drivers are courteous. The only problem is that every one of them will work you to take you somewhere else so they can line their pockets. We had one that wanted to take us shopping at a special market that ended up being just an oversized curio shop (only 100 pesos additional). Another one wanted to stop by a special museum and another that wanted to come by and take us to the airport for 200 pesos (the standard fare to the airport is 100 pesos).Fifth, leave specific instructions for water, towels, linens, etc. for the maids. A tip of 10 or 20 pesos will work wonders also. Since you can't drink the water in the hotel, you will use bottled water to brush your teeth. Ask for a couple of extra bottles.Sixth, don't bother exchanging dollars for pesos at the hotel. They were giving 10 pesos for 1 dollar and that is the rate vendors use if you pay for goods and services on the street. The exhange rate 12/12/07-12/18/07 was about 1 dollar for 10.65 pesos and about 10.90 pesos for 1 dollar.Seventh, most of us don't travel to watch TV. If you stay here, they have a limited selection of channels. 3 channels offer English programming: HBO Family, CNN International, and AXN (shows American reruns; some from the current season).Bottom line is that when we go to Mexico City again, we will likely stay in Colonia Polanco or Colonia Condessa in a hotel that offers a higher level of amenities and a broader selection of restaurants and lounges.If you want to stay in the Historic Center, try this hotel. Armed with knowledge of the seven cautions above, you will have a pleasant experience.

<Content>Great Location and Friendly Service We stayed in the Holiday Inn Zocalo in early December, 2007 for 5 nights. I agree completely with those who praised the location, cleanliness and the friendly staff. The hotel has been renovated and is kept in excellent condition. We will definitely stay here when we return to Mexico City. I cannot comment on the breakfast buffet as we liked the Caf茅 El Popular just down the street. The view of the Zocalo from the large restaurant terrace is impressive (see the candid photos posted by pocson鈥攊t looks just like this) and we found the serving staff at dinner to be very helpful and friendly.

<Content>Great Historic Dist Location Hotel Just spent 5 nights at the Holiday Inn Zocalo and have no complaints. We booked a Jr. Suite, which is a larger room with a window on the Zocalo. Only down side is that the Conchero dancers in the Zocalo go all night on Saturday. We found by turning the air con or heat on it created a white noise that helped block the non-stop drumming. Hotel has free wireless internet, so if you travel with laptop with is a great feature. Desktops available for guest use in lobby. Staff was great. Breakfast on roof is very nice, but a bit pricey. Hotel Majestic does the same thing as does the Gran Hotel. For a cheaper real Mexican breakfast go down Cinco de Mayo to Casa de la Blanca. Don't be put off by the formica. Also Cafe Bertico around the corner on Madero has hearty breakfast lunch dinner and stays open late. We have been visting Mex DF since the 70's and have to say we found it cleaner and safer than ever. Traffic control measures makes it much easier to walk around and there is a traffic cop on almost every corner.Would stay at this hotel again as the location can not be beat and compared to Gran Hotel (just down the square) the price is much better.

<Content>A Good Place We stayed 7 nights there. Our room was spotless. The Hotel clean and safe. The staff was extremely helpful. The location is perfect. All in all,we could not have asked for a better experience.My wife and I are not bar hoppers, so we didn't staty out after 7 p.m. at night. But we never felt threatened on any of the streets around the zocalo/almeda. Took the normal precautions.Would return in a heartbeat. Just sad that they don't offer two double beds or suites.

<Content>Perfect Our stay at the Holiday Inn-Zocalo last week was perfect. The more I became familiar with the rest of the city, the more I appreciated our choice. As a photographer, I found the streets surrounding the hotel vibrant, authentic and surprisingly safe. The staff and service was excellent. The rooms are small, the bed is hard, yet it didn't really matter when a few steps out the door you were in the middle of where Mexica culture started and continues today. It really felt like home and was an incredible value, IMO.

<Content>Best deal in Mexico city Great hotel to stay in, right next to the Zocalo. Everything was very nice, I stayed here twice and the service was constant both times. The price is expensive if you are travelling on a student budget (as I was) but can be worth it if you are staying only for a couple of days.

<Content>Really nice hotel We happily stayed at the Holiday Inn Zocalo for four nights between tours of Guatemala and Mexico. We were very pleased with the location next to the main square (National Palace, Diego Rivera Murals, Cathedral, Templo Mayor and Museum) and many good restaurants. It had a sixth floor partially covered rooftop restaurant (the uncovered part had umbrellas) which overlooked the plaza and had very nice views. We ate only breakfast there, but it was delicious with a variety of Mexican and American dishes, nice fruit, cereal, yogurt and eggs cooked to order. There were two subway stops nearby so there was easy access to the rest of the city.The rooms were on the small, side but spotlessly clean and newly renovated. The closet was big enough to hold an opened suitcase.Our only down side with the hotel was the - is it a hurdy gurdy? - that played outside the hotel from around 11 am to 5 pm - the same song over and over and over. We weren't in the room much, but if we had come in tired from a flight we would not have been happy. We never saw anyone give them money so I've no idea how they earn a living.We would recommend this hotel for Mexico City.

<Content>BE CAREFUL - Lovely hotel, but we had our camera stolen My husband and i stayed twice at the Holiday Inn in the Zocalo - the first time when we arrived in Mexico for our honeymoon in December 06, and then on leaving in January 07. Obviously, the reason we returned to the hotel was because we really liked it - it was good value, the rooms were fine, and we enjoyed the breakfast buffet. It's in a great, if noisy, location too.Unfortunately, our honeymoon ended on a real sour note. We'd had a fantastic time travelling round Mexico, and everyone had been very kind. I guess because we were feeling slightly complacent, we didn't worry when we were walking round Mexico City on our last day, and realised we'd left our camera out in our bedroom and hadn't put it in the safe. We didn't feel it would be necessary to rush home to the hotel and pick it up. Sadly though, our camera had been stolen by the time we got back. It was absolutely gutting - every single one of our honeymoon photos were on the camera.The hotel were helpful to a certain extent - the doorman was lovely, and came with us to the Police station to file a report. The next morning, they arranged for us to meet with the maid, to ask her what happened. However, that was it - the hotel were unwilling to entertain the notion that one of their staff members had entered our room and stolen our camera - but that is undoubtedly what happened. They've also done nothing since we left Mexico - we sent 4 emails to ask whether any futher investigation had been done - but they've only sent one in response, to state there's been no progress.So - clearly, for very personal reasons, we would never stay there again - and a word of advice to those going to Mexico - always use hotel safes no matter how secure you think the hotel is!

<Content>A good, characterful hotel, though some might find noise offputting Staying at the Holiday Inn Zocalo is not the usual kind of bland, reliable and forgettable experience associated with most Holiday Inns elsewhere. The place has a particular character that makes it memorable, largely (though not entirely) for the right reasons.The location is excellent, within effortless reach of all of the tourist sites in the Centrico Historico. By day, the liveliness of the surrounding streets makes casual meandering an enjoyable experience (and one that鈥檚 much less in-your-face than might be expected). By night, I wouldn鈥檛 say the area is at all threatening, but the crowds of tourists 鈥?and the even bigger crowds of people trying to sell things to tourists 鈥?tend to disappear after about 9pm. The hotel itself has a nice ambience, its communal areas lacking the usual sterility of the big chain hotels. It feels very much a Mexican undertaking 鈥?rather than an American one. The bar is small and pretty lifeless, but a perfectly decent meeting place before heading off to the rather more lively offerings elsewhere. The restaurant is on the top floor, with an outdoor terrace with agreeable views of the city. I only sampled breakfast, but the food on offer was good and the cost, although high by Mexican standards, was low in comparison to North America or Europe. The rooms again are some way off the usual you-could-be-anywhere experience associated with Holiday Inns et al. Their stripped down simplicity was for me a plus point, though some might miss the availability of internet access or zillions of channels of unwatchable US television. The overall feel is not unlike a decent quality Mediterranean hotel. The only real downside is the endless daytime noise from the uniformed hurdy-gurdy player (and his monkey) perched on a daily basis outside the front of the hotel. If you plan to stay in your room for any length of time during the day, the barrel organ and its depressingly repetitive repertoire could well be a major irritant. Proximity to the Zocalo - the epicentre of protest for Mexico - can also create noise at by day or night (though that's offset by the incredible spectacle of watching these serial protesters at work). All in all, though, the Holiday Inn Zocalo is a perfectly good place to stay, whether as a tourist or on business.

<Content>A Gem of a Hotel for Tourists For those on vacation to Mexico City, you can't get any better than this lovely hotel. Its location is perfect, overlooking a beautiful cathedral, the national palace, the ruins of the Aztec pyramids, and one of the largest squares in the world. More historical and cultural sites are within walking distance than we could possibly see in our 5 day stay. We arrived in the evening and had dinner on the terrace at the hotel restaurant, looking out over the historical center and the twinkling city lights. A breathtaking view by any standard. As late June is in the rainy season, the air was quite clean. The hotel's breakfast buffet is bountiful and delicious, and the prices reasonable. Our room was small, but very clean and had a nice high ceiling and a safe. By international standards, the price of the room was very reasonable. We recommend visiting the excavation of the Aztec pyramids next to the national cathedral, about a five minute walk from the hotel. Also, the food at the nearby Cafe de Tacuba is excellent. For visiting sites in other areas of the city (we loved visiting Frido Kahlo's Blue House in Coyoacan), the hotel will arrange for taxi service. The driver can take you from place to place, for a reasonable price. This is much safer and far more convenient than hailing taxis from the street.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed two nights at this hotel. The location was great as it is only a short distance to the main attractions in the downtown area. The hotel itself was beautiful and spotless. Our room was a little small, but it was very nice. The restaurant was good and the eating area outside was so very enjoyable during the day. At night, it was a bit too chilly to eat outside. The entire hotel staff was very accommodating and helpful. They provided us with all kinds of information, from safety to entertainment, and made all of our arrangements that we needed. The price was very reasonable for the quality. I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Good value, good location This is my second time staying here. I was there in May, 2005, also, while they were remodeling.The hotel looks much nicer after the remodel, plus they now have in-room wireless internet, which is handy. They also have a tiny business center where you can use their semi-high speed internet free for 30 min/day, plus print if you want.The room was clean, the safe worked, there was plentiful hot water and the toilets always flushed. If you have a street side room, you get a bit of street noise, but it's quiet by 8:00 or 9:00pm. Last year I had an inside room, and found the people noise echoing up the shaft to be much more annoying. Plus, with a street side room, you can open the windows, as the temps are very pleasant in Mexico City.When you figure in location (Zocalo), price ($82 for one double bed), and the Holiday Inn reputation, I just couldn't find a better value for mid-range tourist travel.

<Content>Great Hotel with one draw back I recently stayed at the Holdiay Inn Zocalo, located in the historic zone of the city. It is located just of the historic square, two blocks from the subway and near many fine restauruants and shops. The rooms, at least the one I had was small and compact, nice TV, large bed, shower in the bathroom. The room was immaculant, extremely clean, and well kept. My room looked out onto the street, 5 Cinco de Mayo. The lobby was nice, with a small bar, and internet service, free, limited to 30 minutes a day, after that it is 50 pesos, you can find much cheaper internet locations throughout the city. The staff was friendly. Two blocks up the street on 5 Cinco de Mayo and on the same side of the street was a great restaurant, La Capilla, I really suggest this restaurant. The hotel has a restaurant on the 6th floor, buffet for breakfast but a bit pricey for my liking, around $12.00USD, there is a Mac Donalds around the corner if your so inclined. Now for the one draw back of this hotel. During the day, and in the evening, into the late evening, 11pm or later, the Aztecs perform on the square and the sound of the drums beating constantly can be heard in the hotel rooms. If your a light sleeper, you are going to have a problem, no doubt about it, so take ear plugs with you, or you will not sleep. Other than that, this hotel is one that I can suggest, saying that, I would probably not stay at this property again due to noise from the drums at night.

<Content>Amazing!!!!!! We stayed for 3 nights and I wish I could've stayed longer! The location is stunning, I loved looking outside and see the historic side of the city! The hotel is in excellent condition and is very cute. The bathroom is very confortable and the room in great shape and super clean. The area is not dangerous and it was great to walk around. I would definetely stay here everytime I go back. The breakfast buffet was delicious and the terrace on the top was great to get a bautiful view of mexico city. The service was superb. Everyone was very friendly at anytime of the day.

<Content>liked the zocalo Stated twice in march, first visit was for one night only and was given room facing side street which was slightly claustrophobic with a little bed (we are both near 6 ft) service was excellent, breakfast superb, and left 5 pieces of luggage for 9 days while we flew to Cuba. On return were given room / suite on 5th floor facing the Plaza, room size and bed are excellent as well as service, all our luggage was bought to our room within 15 minutes of arrival all exactly as we had left it 9 days ago.Security is excellent and staff are helpfu but at times the lack of english and our lack of spanish has been challenging! Would stay again if returning to Mexico City in the future.

<Content>Beware gay travelers and people of color I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Zocalo two years in a row in December. My caution about this hotel is that you need to be aware that NO ONE other than registered guests are allowed in the hotel (at least this was the rule imposed on one occasion, though I was told it is always enforced). I only discovered this after a couple of friends of mine who live in Mexico City came to pick me up on our way out one night. Not only were they stopped at the door, they were not allowed in even after I called the manager to tell him they were coming to get me (they had called me from a cell to tell me they were not allowed in). It was very embarrassing. These were two well dressed, well mannered, well educated individuals. The only plausible rationale was that they were being discriminated against because of their darker skin color or, possibly, homophobia. I have a number of friends in Mexico City (whiter, perhaps 'straighter acting') who have come in without incident. If you do decide to stay here, you might want to inquire in advance if you plan on inviting friends or relatives from the area to see you.

<Content>Loved the Holiday Inn Zocalo I stayed at the Holiday Inn Zocalo for 8 nights in the second week of December. I was traveling solo, and worried a bit about security but I needn't have. The hotel was reassuringly attractive, clean, well-staffed, lively, and friendly. It is perfectly situated in the city, particularly for this time of year with all of the musical and holiday festivities on the (extremely well-policed) Zocalo. My room was spotless, quiet (get one that faces Cinco de Mayo street), and there was always computer access (and free fruit and candy!) in the reception. You could have a beer from the lobby bar and do your email after calling it a night; and the cable tv had so many channels that there was always free entertainment after the pleasures of a day traipsing around the city. The location could not be better; the staff was friendly and neither pushy nor stand-offish. Ideal. I'll recommend it to everyone and use it again.

<Content>great location Very pleasant stay in a sometimes hectic city. Easy access throughout the city but use their taxis and drivers, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DRIVE ANYWHERE IN OR NEAR MEXICO CITY - WE WERE LOST FOR FOUR HOURS JUST GETTING FROM THE AIRPORT. The view from the terrace restaurant is great and the breakfast is good. skip the dinner.

<Content>Noisy but nice. Before you decide to stay on the Zocalo, consider this: Sounds echo around the plaza and the Aztec drummers/dancers perform from 10:00 - 10:00 making it difficult to take a siesta. Other than that, we had a wonderful 4 day stay. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and switched from Spanish to English and back easily (we speak Spanish). The 6th floor terrace restaurant is a must even if you don't stay at the hotel - fantastic views although you will find more exciting food elsewhere. Have the $10 breakfast buffet or, later, coffee or a drink. You will see the cathedral up close, the volcanos, and the action in the plaza. We decided to spend the exta money and had a somewhat nice 5th floor suite that was more like a loft with large windows on 2 sides and a great view of the Zocalo. Service and attention were great. Some rooms have windows over a busy street (5 de mayo) and others have windows into a light/ventelation shaft. Overall, a pleasant hotel in a great (although noisy) location.

<Content>Great value - clean, good location, very friendly staff Stayed at the Holiday Inn Zocalo for one night at the end of September. Did not notice any funny smells and thought everything was great. The room did not seem too small - good closet space, had a/c and tv with a few channels in english. Location right next to the Zocalo cannot be beat! The staff was super-friendly the entire time, from check-in to the restaurant to calling us a taxi at check-out. Would definitely stay there again if I went back to Mexico City!

<Content>good stay here, friendly staff stayed here in january 05 for 3 nights and 1 night additional. nice hotel, but with a mystery smell inside. not bad, but for a german guy, a little bit smelly ;), like the whole city. room was clean, beds are ok. one thing: ask for a room with window to the outside! had my window to the inside, what means, that you麓re looking down on the bar and the lounge. with window open, you will often hear the ping from the elevator. but that is no problem, after one night you don麓t even seem to hear that sound anymore (thanks brain ;) )stayed here at start and end of my mexico trip. if i would visit d.f. one more time, this will be my hotel. if your are looking for a payable tour (sightseeing and interesting locations), ask the guys in front of the hotel or the ones on zocalo (our drivers name was alex), they will give you a good overview to the city and other things like the pyramids for about 600 pesos.

<Content>A great Location A great Hotel, clean and a great terrace on the roof with a decent enough restaurant. It is close to everything in Centro Historica district. Easy to pick up a turibus and a subway entrance in front of the Catedral. Very helpful staff. And the rooms are actually quite large and spacious for a non- US hotel, we upgraded to a Junoir SuiteWould stay here again.!

<Content>OK for dwarfs Stayed at the Holiday Inn in March 2005. The rooms were the smallest we have ever encountered in a hotel. Otherwise, the position was great, if a little noisy at times, and the breakfast on the rooftop restaurant most enjoyable.

<Content>Wonderful stay Stayed at the Holiday Inn for three nights in January and loved our time there. The staff were helpful, helping us with whatever problems we encountered along the way. Despite the early afternoon check in time, we were taken to our room immediately after arriving from the airport at 8 in the morning.The rooftop restaurant was spectacular for both views and food, the bar downstairs very convenient. The bar downstairs was nice and the internet at the lobby extremely convenient. Despite there being a half hour free 'trial' of the internet, we used it a great deal more and were never charged for the privelege. Rooms were comfortable, although the beds were a little hard. Certainly nothing worth losing sleep over though.All in all, a very enjoyable time spent in the Holiday Inn.
