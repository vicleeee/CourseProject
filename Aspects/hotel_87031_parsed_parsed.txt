<Content>Boutique Hotel with a personal touch! The thing we liked most about the hotel is the how you the staff gets to know you and you them over the week of stay. This is almost not possible in the big chain hotels.Hotel:1. Very close to the beach (just a 5 min walk). Leads to right to the duke statue depending the direction you take.2. Very close to the bus stop (if you plan to use the bus; more on the bus in my Oahu trip review)3. Hotel decor is very modern with an Asian influence (thailand is what the hotel wants us to believe)4. The pool area and cabanas are nice (never used it though)Rooms:1. The rooms has modern look with flat screen TV.2. The washroom is decent3. The only complaint I have it the AC. I could not barely reach the on/off switch (I am 5' 9). If I had to adjust the temp; I had to use some other extension (like a comb or a pen)4. The lanai (balcony) was big enough to put your chairs and kick back (we did that when there was no power in Oahu for 12 hrs).Staff and other amenities1. Very enthusiastic (esp Tony)2. Parking is 22 bucks a day if you valet or 20 bucks if you park across the street3. Breakfast is ok4. Pool and Spa services are on-premises; but we never used itAll in all a good value for money. Rating of the Trip Advisor Hotel Ranking should be higher than the Best Western Coconut (due to the location).

<Content>We will be back to the Aqua Bamboo The Aqua Bamboo is in a great location. It is close to the beach at Waikiki, it is close to shopping, and close to public buses. The hotel is a great value. The hotel offers amenities that enhance one's stay (newspaper, continental breakfast, weekly cocktail hour). However, most important is the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. The personal touch made one feel welcome and very much at home. We look forward to our next visit.

<Content>Nice Stay We didn't know what to expect at the Aqua Bamboo, but we were pleasantly surprised. It has recently been renovated and the foyer was very modern with an Asian feel to it (bamboo theme). The pool area was very relaxing and never crowded. The only negative comment for this area would be the size of the hot tub. only 4 people could squeeze into it at once. The rooms are also renovated and in very good condition, comfortable and clean. We stayed in a room with a full kitchen which was very handy for a family of four. If possible, request a room at the back of the hotel because the rooms at the front get a lot of noise from the street. The hotel is only a block away from the middle of Waikiki beach and we had no issues walking there with 2 young kids. The complimentary breakfast consisted of muffins, pastries, apples, bananas and juice. Nothing fancy but adequate for the kids. I chose to eat a healthier breakfast prepared in my room. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. They made our stay very enjoyable.

<Content>Could not have asked for better The Aqua Bamboo was just stunning, especially the foyer and the inner sanctuary the pool was a little cold but the warmth of the spa made up for that. the location in Waikiki was fantastic 1 block from the beach. Our room the studio deluxe was everything we were expecting, the room was it was very clean when we arrived and the cleaning service we received over the 10 days we were there was just as great. The king size bed was very comfortable and the view from the balcony was beautiful. Being provided with the TV in the room was well welcomed after long days touring the Island. The service provided by the Bamboo staff could not be faulted, Joy was so lovely and approachable she and the other staff really made David and Myself feel very valued and welcome. The complementary breakfast every morning was a great way to start the day and the take away breakfast option is also a great service.We were extremely happy with the Aqua Bamboo.  Lauren Marett

<Content>Celebrating Birthdays  Aloha Spirt at it's finest is what you find at the Aqua Bamboo  Spa! From the moment we arrived to our day of departure, the staff were so wonderful to us. Joy, Leonor and Angela made our trip a fabulous one. We had business to conduct as well as quality family time to enjoy....we were able to accomplish it all.You feel like you're in your very own private paradise among the palm trees and plants surrounding the salt water pool and jacuzzi. Very nicely renovated rooms!Close to everything...Waikiki Beaches, shopping, dining, grocery store, International Market Place! Very convenient!We would recommend this property for small groups, families, honeymooners, and girl trips.Can't wait to go back!

<Content>Aqua Bamboo was the right choice My wife and I are former Hawaii residents. We go back every year - at least once - for our anniversary. We typically stay outside of Waikiki (Northshore, Kailua, Waimanalo, etc.). This is the first time in 20 years we actually booked a room in Waikiki. We were a bit skeptical and our expectations were low - after all, it's Waikiki.The Aqua Bamboo turned out to be the perfect choice. It's a small boutique hotel, one block off the beach, in the heart of Waikiki. If you're looking for a resort experience - this is not for you - but if you want a private, comfortable place to relax and still be close to the beach and Waikiki night life, this is a solid choice. We booked a studio room overlooking the courtyard/pool. The room was comfortable and just the right size for the two of us. The room has obviously been renovated recently - fresh paint, new carpet, etc. There were still signs of age however - the ceiling has some crumbling spots, the toilet didn't always flush completely. But all in all, it was a clean and comfortable room.The highlight of the hotel is the staff. WOW! Joy and her team are first rate all the way. Eager to help with any question - directions, access to the internet, etc. - always friendly and looking after the best interests of the guests. We were always greeted with a smile and an offer of is there anything we do for you today and when we had a question, we were helped right away.The Aqua Bamboo exceeded our expectations.

<Content>A Great Place to Stay The facilities at Aqua Bamboo  Spa are more than acceptable. The beds were excellent. The rooms were spotless, and we truly enjoyed sitting on the lanai after a day of touring/sun on the beach. You couldn't ask for a more convenient location, and the each and every member of the staff was pleasant. I would recommended it to anyone.

<Content>Best Hotel Staff This was my first trip to Hawaii and I could not be more pleased with my stay at the Aqua Bamboo. When I booked my hotel with the agent at the 800 number, I booked a room on the pool side away from the street noise. Upon check in the woderfully friendly staff sent us up to our room under the impression that they'd given us a free upgrade. However, when we got to our room it was street side only 2nd floor up. My boyfriend and I were initially worried that the street noise might keep us up all night, but decided to try it for at least one night before asking to be moved. We did decide to move rooms, and contacted the Guest Services Manager, Joy Adler. She really went above and beyond to appologize for the mistake and to accomidate our original request, including sending someone up with the bell cart to assist our room change. The above and beyond part is that Joy gave us a double upgrade due to the remaining poolside rooms being full and put us in the Honeymoon Suite!!! This room was STUNNING! But other than the room upgrade......the hotel staff were all very friendly and welcoming. Every time we entered and left the hotel we were greeted warmly. One tip: don't miss out on Bamboozle!!

<Content>Great location, great price! I was so surprised at how glamorous my room was. The bed was really comfortable, and the was a huge flat screen TV in my room. From my room, I could see Waikiki beach over the buildings. The location was excellent, just 2 streets back from the beach which was nothing to walk. The price was great considering the location and my room. I found that the hotel's website provided a better deal with prices that the cheap hotel booking websites. A simple breakfast was included in the price, however I generally missed it because it finished about 9 or 9.30. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone - singles, married couples, families and would indeed stay there again myself.

<Content>Best Personal Service in Honolulu! Like staying with friends and family! Upon check in at Aqua Bamboo, after a long day of traveling mania, I could not have been more welcomed by any other resort. The eager and happy doorman immediately led me into the serene entrance for Aqau Bamboo that has a calming waterfall and many other nerve soothing affects that appeal to your senses of sight, smell and sound. The staff handed me a cold bottle of water immediately. Joy Adler and Lenore Wong, the best Guest Service managers in town, treated me to incredible spoiling treats and amenities for the complete duration of my stay. From an incredibly relaxing Lomi Lomi massage that they arranged to such surprising amenities in my beautiful one bedroom suite such as goodies in gift baskets and bringing me a breakfast tray one morning, I could never find such personalized service anywhere else. Lenore Wong even made me a special Lei out of yarn and cloth that brought tears to my eyes. I have it on the wall of my living room here at home and it still brings back all the happy memories of my stay with Aqua Bamboo this month. The last day I was there she presented me with a fragrant Ginger Lei and everyone was asking what the occasion was all day long! The complete staff at Aqua is extremely helpful with directions and special dinner reservations and information. They treat you like close friends and family!I highly recommend Aqua Bamboo  Spa to anyone seeking a relaxing and rewarding visit to Honolulu.

<Content>Great place to stay A very clean hotel and some of the most friendly front line staff we've meet. Actually most the people we meet were very happy to help. The hotel is nicely located 1 block from the beach even though we spent most of your time at one of the many other beaches (less crowded ! )We definetly would return to this property and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone who's travelling on a somewhat of a budget, we had a room with a small kitchen which really helped !

<Content>A hidden gem for anyone traveling on a budget! Unbelievable value for the money. I stayed at three different hotels during my stay in Waikiki including the #1 ranked hotel on Trip Advisor (Hotel Renew - an Aqua Elite Hotel) and a similar-priced hotel called Resortquest Waikiki Sunset, and I was by far impressed with this hotel. They let me check-in my bags early in the morning while I was out and about in Waikiki. They also answered any questions I had including a place to rent a scooter. Later that night, they let me park my scooter free-of-charge. The room itself is smaller than the others I stayed at, but it never felt that way. It was modern in every regard- except for the bedding. There was a large flat screen TV, a desk with an Ethernet cable for my laptop, a mini refrigerator, and a microwave. It even had a small balcony! (Don't expect a great view though). I stayed in a double on the 10th floor because I was traveling by myself so I can't speak for the other rooms, but this hotel was perfect for me. It had everything I needed for less than $100! I would highly suggest this to people looking to travel on a budget or single travelers. The double rooms are cheaper and if you're with a friend or significant other you should consider it to save money.Bottom line: this hotel is clean and modern, perfectly situated near everything in Waikiki. Definitely a hidden gem.

<Content>Great Hotel! My husband, 2 small children and I loved the Aqua Bamboo  Spa. It's a very clean hotel and centrally located in Waikiki. The staff are so helpful and very friendly... they really make you feel like you are their special guests. They were very helpful with any questions you may have about activities, places to eat, etc. They are very attentive to your likes and dislikes... I can't rave enough about it! We would definitely go back there again!

<Content>Great Hotel! My mom and I wanted to get away for a while and chose to stay at Aqua Bamboo  Spa. This was the best choice ever! The rooms were very nice and comy (having the robes available during our stay was a nice touch). The location was very convenient as it was within walking distance to everything (the beach, shopping areas, restaurants, etc). The staff was friendly as well. I guarantee this will not be the last time I stay at Aqua Bamboo  Spa.

<Content>Loved the bamboo, loved the bamboozles We stayed at the Aqua Bamboo and Spa for two weeks, and had a fabulous time. It's a boutique hotel in a super location, and surpassed our expectations. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and really looked after us during our stay. The weekly manager's drinks introduced us to the hotel's signature cocktail, the Bamboozle, which is a tradition we're hoping to continue :)We originally checked into a twin room with kitchenette, but were upgraded at check-in to a one-bedroom suite with kitchenette. The suite was fabulous - two big plasma TVs, two very comfortable double beds, two balconies, including a huge lanai looking out over Diamond Head, two bar fridges, living area, and kitchen area. The bathroom had a bath and a shower. We had concerns about sharing a room for two weeks and getting on each other's nerves, but the suite was big enough to give each of us a bit of space!There was an early hiccup where the previous tenants had not moved out of the room on time, and we were delayed checking in by a few hours, but the staff gave us vouchers for free massages to make up for it, worth about $140.The location of the Bamboo is superb - just two very short blocks from the beach, and about a five minute walk from all the action with nightclubs, etc. It's a perfect spot on Kuhio Street, because it's far enough away from the clubs to be quiet at night, yet a short walk to all the restaurants etc.While it's not a full-service hotel (ie, no room service, hotel bar etc), we found that for a lengthy stay, it was perfect. We had the pool on site, the ability to get a massage or a facial downstairs, a supermarket a few blocks away so we could have the occasional home-cooked meal, and super close to the beach and the ubiquitous ABC stores to buy essentials.We kept sleeping-in, and missing the free breakfast in the courtyard, so the housekeeper began bringing us plates of pastries and bowls of fruit to keep in the room - and upon check out, we were presented with boxes of chocolate-covered macadamias - it was truly above and beyond anything we expected.We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a boutique hotel experience, in a great location and a friendly atmosphere.Nikky and Laura, Sydney, Australia

<Content>Great stay at the Aqua Bamboo and Spa We loved our stay at the hotel. Our room, a deluxe studio, was very tastefully done in an 'Asian ' theme. It had reasonably good views of the city and the mountain side. The Hotel staff is very friendly and attentive. We also used their spa services which were terrific. I'd highly recommend staying at the Aqua Bamboo, if you're looking for something quieter off the main Waikiki strip and yet within 5 mins of walking distance to the beach.

<Content>Comfy beds! This is well located hotel on the main street of Waikiki, only a block's walk to the beach and surrounded by ample restuarants and shops. The beds are so comfy, they have this 3 inch thick overlay which makes them very soft. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment with kitchen, double bed in the bedroom and 2 singles in the living room, it was quite noisy though because that room faced the street and the bus stop was directly out the front of the hotel. The pool area is nice with a couple of bungalow type lounge areas and chairs  tables. The 'free breakfast' consists of a small muffin, small pastry, piece of fruit, small cups of juice and tea/coffee...the coffee is available for free 24 hours a day and is surprisingly good for machine coffee! There are 2 computers in the lobby for internet access, 20 cents a minute - paying cash its minimum $5 (25 mins) and credit card minimum $4.95...you can log off and use your remaining minutes at a later time. Staff are very friendly and helpful...if you want a bargain for activities ask them to direct you to the place on the corner next to the liquor store, the lady in there will do you a good deal. All in all a great hotel, not too expensive, and let's face it, if you've come to Waikiki for a holiday you're going to want to spend most of your time out and about, on the beach, shopping to your heart's content...but its nice to know you have a clean and very comfortable hotel to come home to each night :)

<Content>Very comfortable beds! This hotel was great if you're looking for a comfortable place to sleep and a close walk to the beach. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are nicely decorated, a modern bamboo Hawaiian feel, and beautiful bathrooms, much better than the average hotel. The only downfall is there are only 14ish floors, so don't expect to get an ocean view. I can't say enough how comfortable the beds were, as this is very important to us when we travel. You have to Valet your car, but since it's a smaller hotel you'll get your car right away with no hassle at all. We were in and out multiple times a day and never had a problem. We will stay here again, no need to find another hotel in Oahu!

<Content>Loved the Bamboo! I loved the Aqua Bamboo and Spa. My husband and I spent 5 nights there and got a room upgrade at no extra charge. The location was excellent -- 1.5 blocks from the beach, and close to all the action in Waikiki. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The Thursday afternoon manager's cocktail hour with their signature Bamboozled drink was very nice, too. I would definitely come back here if I ever return to Hawaii! I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved Aqua Bamboo  We have just returned from a week at the Aqua Bamboo  Spa in Waikiki. After a lot of research on Trip Advisor and reading many traveller reviews we were still a little apprehensive about what we would find on arriving at the hotel. But as soon as we arrived we were very pleasantly surprised. The foyer of the hotel is beautiful and the check in staff were fantastic. They got us into our room earlier than the stated check in time and were always extremely friendly and professional. Our room was great with 3 balconies, a view of the pool and a great kitchen with fridge, microwave and cook top. The pool with waterfall and spa area was fantastic and very relaxing. The weekly free cocktails by the pool with a complimentary 5 minute massage thrown in was wonderful and all the staff were so friendly, nothing was a problem. We had planned on only spending 5 nights here and then spending our last 2 nights in a more upmarket hotel but after our first night we extended our stay and spent our entire holiday at the Bamboo  Spa. The hotel is close to the beach and is only a short walk to the centre of Waikiki. This hotel was definitely value for money. We had friends staying in other hotels in Waikiki and they were extremely impressed on seeing our accommodation compared to what they were getting for their money. All in all a big thumbs up for Aqua Bamboo  Spa. We will definitely stay here again when we are in Waikiki and i have already begun recommending it to our friends. Special thanks to Leonor Wong for our fantastic room  leis and to all the staff that made our trip fantastic!!

<Content>Love the Bamboo! Can't wait to go back.... :) I LOVE the Bamboo! I was lucky to stay there for 9 days along with 2 other friends and we all had a FABULOUS time... Our room was on the 11th floor facing the ocean, my favourite was waking up early each morning to the sun coming in from the balcony and being able to lay in bed and enjoy a Great view of the water and the surfers! It's in the perfect location, walking distance to everything you could want or need! It's close to the beach, it's near great restaurants, and also Wonderful shopping once the sun goes down...Another thing I love about staying at the Bamboo is the pool, it has a cute waterfall that drowns out any traffic going by and it's usually not crowded like larger chain hotels.... Being a boutique hotel it has a warm cozy feeling and the hotel staff is very helpful and friendly with any questions we had! I'm already looking forward to my next trip back.... :)

<Content>Just great I cant say enough for all the staff at the Aqua Bamboo Resort. I was there on my own and they where just wonderful to me. Always had a smile on their faces. And when i went back the second time was greeted by my first name, which i found to be most inviting and made me feel as if this was home. The room was just enough for me. and had everything i needed. So my CONGRATULATIONS to all the staff there You are just GREAT. Gina heriot

<Content>I loved the Aqua Bamboo The Aqua Bamboo is a great boutique hotel right in the heart of Waikiki. It has a fantastic pool area with tiki hut and rock waterfall into the pool. Great gardens too. Personally I love smaller hotels and this one is great. I was on the 11th floor and had ocean views along with a cute kitchenette and 3 lanai's (balconies). The staff were all extremely nice and accommodating. I was there for 4 weeks and have nothing but good to say. The rooms were recently updated and remodeled too so the Bamboo is really looking good. There is also a Spa by the pool and the staff there do great massages. They have a small continental breakfast but other than that no other food but there are so many restaurants around the area that it is fine. The hotel is located 2 blocks from the beach.

<Content>A great boutique hotel! As newlyweds, my husband and I stayed at the Aqua Bamboo  Spa from the 5th to the 12th of September 2008. After a very tiring and hot flight we were greeted at the front desk with a cool drink and towel to freshen up, this little gesture made us both feel very welcome. Our room was tastefully decorated and very homelike.. The beds were so comfortable, we both enjoyed sleeping in most days.The pool and spa area of the hotel was very well maintained and provided a perfect venue in which to relax and enjoy the quiet surroundings. The hotel is only two blocks from the beach, but the lush garden surrounds of the pool area made us feel like we were perhaps on a quiet island,All of the staff were very helpful and went out of their way to make us feel welcome, attending to any requests in a timely and friendly manner.Overall our stay at the Aqua Bamboo and Spa was fantastic and we will most likely stay there again when we next visit Hawaii. Aloha from two very satisfied guests.

<Content>Bamboo is Paradise! Being my first stay at the Aqua Bamboo I was unsure what to expect. What a pleasant surprise! The lobby is warm and friendly with a beautiful pool area out the back doors. Upstairs, we rented two units that have huge lanais with a gate that opens to allow one to access each other without going outside in the hallway. Our families were very comfortable in the newly remodeled units which sleep an honest six and include a kitchenette. My kids were very happy to be one block from the best part of Waikiki Beach. We will be staying at the Aqua Bamboo again next summer when we return.

<Content>welcoming and helpful The Bamboo and Spa was exactly what I was hoping for in a hotel in Hawaii. The best part was the decor. Really simple and calming. The pool area was really nice too even though we didn't spend that much time there. The front desk staff was always more than helpful. We were lost trying to find a restaurant and called the front desk and they helped us get to the street we needed. The beds were very comfortable. It is not a five star hotel, but it met my needs above expectation.

<Content>Fresh air at Aqua we had one initial hic-up when signing in only to discover the error was on our part. All agents have bad days so maybe it was a bad day for that agent. However all of that was erased with the hospitality and kindness of the other staff they were super. I would love to have Lenor Wong as my PR here on the main land she was excellent. She rolled out the welcome mat full blast and when she heard we were honeymooners she took it to a different level. Who could forget Angella at breakfast with saff like these your buisness will only grow. Thanks Euen and Louise

<Content>Easy, breezy place to stay Aqua Bamboo and Spa is a lovely, small hotel with helpful and courteous staff. I didn't realise Waikiki was so small, but it is and Aqua Bamboo is close to everything. There are many shops and restaurants at the doorstep and it's also only a three minute walk to the beach - literally! The hotel is clean and tidy and they even have free apples available in reception for when you need a snack. My room had a fridge, microwave, coffee machine, hot plate, iron, ironing board, hairdryer and an inroom safe. What more could you ask?There were only two things I could fault them on...one is that the hotel pool is in shade for most of the day due to the hotel next door (east). The other thing is that I stayed for 11 days and my sheets weren't changed once.Other than those two minor things, I cannot fault the place. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Loved the Bamboo The excellent service starts with check-in and only gets better. If you want an elegant hotel this is not for you, but if you want a comfortable hotel in the middle of town, this is it!!! The staff is great starting with the manager, Albert and going to housekeeping, in our case Teodora. Outstanding staff were - Angela, Joy, and especially Leonor. Make sure you meet all of them. If you want to learn a Hawaiian craft ask Leonor to teach you how to make a ribbon lei. We would stay here again and again.Tom and Diana - Lake Havasu City, AZ

<Content>Wonderful Hotel!! We stayed at the Aqua Bamboo  Spa for 2 days. This is a wonderful hotel. Check-in/out was fast. Check-in staff (Dan) was very courteous and helpful. The hotel has key-card security access that limits only hotel guest past the main door after 11pm. Our room was very spacious and has a 鈥渒itchenette鈥?area, equipped with pots  pans and dinning ware. The beds are big and comfortable to sleep in. Complimentary continental breakfast is of limited choice/variety (pastries and fruits only). This hotel is very close to Waikiki beach and shops. This hotel exceeded our expectations.

<Content>Our Stay in Honolulu The rooms were newly remodeled and nice. The tub needs to be remodeled!!!! The elevators could use an update as well. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel was conveniently located about 2 blocks from the beach and about 10 blocks from the aquarium. Rooms at the front of the hotel probably have a lot of noise from the street. Our room was at the back, looking at the pool and was very pleasant. The continental breakfast could start a little earlier. Over all, our stay was enjoyable and the hotel as a good deal for its location.

<Content>Great Enjoyment To stay longer would mean to continue to enjoy Aqua Bamboo  Spa forever since its worth every bit of it. Not only does it have bigger beds than other hotels but its prize beats them all when breakfast is included and all of those serving you makes their help with a big smile and with much love. Its truly a paradise with some views to the beach and the surroundings. The place was just renovated two months ago, that in itself makes it of AAA value.Whenver you have a question they surely know the right answer whether your lost or need to find places of adventure and swimming. We got more than what we expected especially when your vacationing with your parents. No parental control with me since I'm older, but the place surely makes your family feel part of the city and country. The Hawaian culture sits within the service given and with the pool and spa surrounded with plenty of natural vegetation and decors of bamboo.The place can be filled with guests, but it never feels congested as with those more popular names or bigger hotels. You really have plenty of parking in the vecinity as well as here in a more secure form. The place cannot be any more central since within two blocks your closer to the beach, shopping center, and the mall. The location, the people, the service, and the laughter will always stay close to your heart. I cannot wait to go back again.

<Content>Amazing Hotel for a the Cost! I live in Honolulu, but wanted to surprise my boyfriend with a night in Waikiki where we didn't have to worry about driving or being bothered by our neighbors. I got a room at Aqua Bamboo for around $90- getting the lowest priced room. The parking was $18- which would have cost me the same by cab RT- but it was a tight fit, even for my little car.The staff was very polite and they offered free bottled water and a hot towel while you checked in. The room was spectacular. No view, but it was clean, and was completely up-to-date. They even had a flat screen TV! There was a nice patio to hang out on, and the bathroom was clean and had a shower that worked very well. When we moved to Hawaii, I wish we knew about Aqua Bamboo since we stayed at a place nearby that was run down and cost more!I completely recommend this for everyone. Its in the heart of Waikiki, a block from the beach.

<Content>Sea, Smiles and Aloha Our tour group of 30 hikers was welcomed with Aloha for a six night stay at the Aqua Bamboo. Previous reviews ranked this hotel in the budget category. My experience far exceeded this expectation. Recently renovated grounds, reception areas and rooms offered a nature-inspired, modern atmosphere. The nicely-landscaped pool area ,with tables and cabanas, offered a calm location for morning continental breakfast ( juice, fruits, baked goods), daily swims, and evening chats. In the garden pool area, it was easy to forget the hustle of Waikiki outside. Rooms were very clean and well-equipped. The hotel's location is ideal: 2 short blocks from the beach and within walking distance of all of Waikiki's attractions. The Bus, Waikiki's public transit system, stops just across the street and will deliver you most anywhere you want to go in Honolulu. Hotel staff will Google map the bus routes for you in a snap. The Bamboo's extra amenities are good: well-equipped mini-kitchens, beach towels, rafts and boogie boards, wi-fi in the lobby, and a hose/garden area where 30 hikers washed off muddy boots. I have high praise for the hotel managers and staff members who provided many extra touches to make our stay enjoyable. Yes, Kuhio is a busy street and can be noisy at times, but that is a minor glitch, measured against the reasonable cost and the benefit of being treated as a valued guest in a boutique hotel. As for the annoying bed corners? Prop a decorative pillow on its end at the corner, and you won't bump into it again. I will go back to the Bamboo, and I've already recommended it to friends and business associates.

<Content>Nice for the price Hotel was fine for the price. I would recommend. Rooms are small but clean and nicely decorated with all the amenities. My room faced the apt bldg next door which was not a pretty site. Staff was very friendly except on one occasion when I asked them to confirm directions. Good location. The spa is not a true spa, just a room next to the pool. Although there was a $69 special on a 50 minute massage, hotel tax and 18% gratuity was automatically added. Massage was average.

<Content>Pan-asian paradise Finding a good hotel via the internet can be challenging, especially when it is for a very special occasion such as a one year wedding anniversary. I encourage anyone looking for a great value, nice room and convenient location to consider the Aqua Bamboo for the following reasons.Decor - Tastefully decorated older property, even my wife who works in the luxury design world loved the renovation done to the property.Rooms - Our room on the tenth floor had a balcony, ocean view and small dining room. Flat screen tv and comfortable bed. We loved the dark wood furniture and the zen like ambiance of the decorPool area - Cool waterfall, tile pool, comfortable chase lounges and bungalow type areas. Lots of green plants and trees to distract you from the metropolis surroundings. Don't miss out on the Bamboozle welcome party on Thursday nights. They even have a BBQ by the pool.Location - Close to International market, very close to the beach and surfing. Plenty of things to do.Staff - Stellar. Joy and Fe were amazing. We love you guys!! Thanks for the recommendations for the best shaved ice on the island (Wialoa Bakery)Spa - We booked the room with a romance package since my wife and I were planning on getting romantic for our one your anniversary. The duel massages at the spa were awesome!! Great value and boy we needed it after all the surfing we did.Price point - I was in Honolulu for work and had to stay at another hotel just half a block away prior to staying at Aqua Bamboo. Even with my companies corporate rate it was still more expensive than Bamboo and the rooms were downright tacky. That hotel shall remain nameless since all you need to know is about the Bamboo.My opinion - I work for one of the largest airlines in the world, so as you can imagine, I have stayed at many hotels and I can tell you that Bamboo will always be my choice while staying in Waikiki.

<Content>SarahAnneMarie My Husband and I were looking for a nice place to stay within our budget in Waikiki for our honeymoon. Aqua Bamboo and Spa was the perfect place for us. You are a short walk away from everything you can think of. Its perfect!I contacted Aqua Bamboo to let them know it was our honeymoon and they went above and beyond!We arrived to the hotel and were greated with beautiful leis, fresh pinapple juice, chocolates and champagne. Leonor is the guest service manager who made everyday in Waikiki a memorable one. She would bring us fresh flowers, fresh fruit, and a nice aloha hug everytime she saw us! We stayed in a studio kitchenett. The bed was amazingly comfortable, and the lanai is nice to sit out on first thing in the morning. Everyone at the front desk was always nice and friendly. I highly recomend renting a car for a day and going up to North Shore, specifically Waimai bay and Halewa (sp?) Both amazing for snorkling, surfing, and cliff jumping!! If you want to stay in Honolulu you can get a shuttle to Hanauma Bay to snorkle which is also amazing but go early cuz it gets crowded around noon.

<Content>A recommended place to stay My wife and I were looking to spend 4 nights in Honolulu, prior to moving on to Maui and were recommended this hotel by our agent. They were not wrong as we enjoyed our stay immensely. The staff were very willing and helpful, which made our stay so much more relaxed.A simple but adequate breakfast was served outside by the pool and there was a 24hr complementary coffee machine in the lobby. There is no restaurant, but a complete range of dining options is available within a 5 minute walk.The hotel had recently been refurbished and we had a non-smoking 2 bed room on the 4th Floor, which contained all we needed or wanted. We did not expect a kitchen, so it was a pleasant surprise to find the room was equipped with one.The only minor downside was that our room faced the main road and the noise from the traffic took some getting used to, but this almost ceased at night. (Double glazing would help here.) One advantage though is if you want to visit Pearl Harbour the #42 bus stops just across the road and $2/head gets you right into the site in about 1hr.When we'd done with the sea and the beach, just a moments walk away, we went back to the hotel so we could use the pool and found it very relaxing, providing a quiet environment to catch up on our reading.I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone looking for a small friendly hotel, but remember it is not for those who want all the trappings of a 400+ bedroom hotel.

<Content>Home away from home at Aqua Bamboo We enjoyed the staff especially Leonor Wong who went out of her way to not only spend time with us but also to make sure our visit was special. We felt right at home. The accomodations were also tastefully done with recent upgrades to the room that included flag stone flooring, new wooden cabinets, granite counter tops for kitchen and living room. The spacious Lanai also gave us extra room to spread out since the weather outdoors is always accomodating. Even with 4 of us we never felt crowded or cramped in the room.We enjoyed also the continental breakfast which they always found fresh fruit or pastries which we could enjoy. The bamboozle night where the staff had a special reception for guests and was fun too.We were so thrilled with the Aqua Bamboo and staff that we cancelled our stay at Sheraton Princess on our return to Honolulu for our final 4 nights to Aqua Bamboo.

<Content>Leonor Wong makes the Aqua Bamboo Extra Special We booked with the Aqua Bamboo after viewing their promotion for stay 5 nights and get the 5th night free. Our itinerary was to stay at the Aqua Bamboo for 5 nights, fly to Maui for 4 nights, and back to Oahu for our last 4 nights at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani. We enjoyed the staff so much at the Aqua Bamboo, especially Ms. Leonor Wong, Director of Guest Relations, that after checking to see if the same room was available for our return from Maui, we cancelled our reservations at the Sheraton to return to the Aqua Bamboo. Leonor was extremely professional, accomodating, and made our vacation extra special. I think we all wanted to adopt her into our family! Our family suite included bedroom with 2 queen size beds, family room with pull out futon and small fridge, large bathroom with 2 showers, 2 sinks, and soaking tub, kitchenette with 2-burner electic range, another small fridge, sink, microwave, small table w/2 chairs, two flat-panel tv's, and the best part was the over-sized lanai complete with teak furniture. Continental breakfast served poolside (tropical oasis) with coffee, tea, juices, fresh fruit, and fresh pasties that were absolutely delicious. Thursday night is Bamboozle Night a guest welcome and appreciation night, featuring their Aqua drink special the Bamboozle, yummy, or tropical fruit juice, pupus of cheese, crackers, and fresh fruit and one of my favorite parts: complimentary 5-minute neck and back massages by one of their own massage therapists. What more can I say? Some say that bigger is better, but in this case the personal touch at this Aqua Boutique Hotel and Spa superceded our expectations. Mahalo once again to Leonor and the staff at the Aqua Bamboo for making our family feel at home. A hui hou.

<Content>Loved Hawaii We stayed in Oahu for only two nights. The hotel was very nice and the staff were very helpful. The location of the hotel was great, close to wonderful restaurants, the bus line and Waikikii Beach. The sunset was magnificent. Very good hotel and very good pricing.

<Content>Huge Disappointment I chose this hotel because of it's high ratings and glowing reviews on trip advisor. I was expecting a special hotel nearer the beach, but two blocks behind the Hyatt is not near. The only glimpse I had of the beach was if I craned my neck just right from my 8th floor One Bedroom Superior. If this room was superior, I would hate to see the inferior.The street it was on was also very busy. It just wasn't my vision of paradise.The staff was nice and smilely, but that hardly makes up for the disappointment of the tiny pool  poor location. We hung in there for two days, but were pretty miserable so we checked out and went to a different hotel for the balance of our stay on Oahu.I am not sure what people are used to when they give 4 and 5 star ratings to this place. It is a two star at best.

<Content>Highly recommended! We spent three weeks at the Bamboo celebrating our anniversary. We felt like we were treated like family. We recevied chocolates, flowers and even a cake. The rooms were comfortable and the service was very good. The Continental Breakfast and the get together on Thurs were most enjoyable , giving us a chance to meet other travellers. We would recomend this to all. Would like to give special thanks to Lenore for the extra attention . She always had the time in her busy schedule.Barb and Gord

<Content>A great choice on a budget, great location  Stayed at the Aqua Bamboo for 6 nights. The staff could not do enough for us. They were always pleasant and attentive. They upgraded our room to our surprise. We enjoyed the small kitchen to store and prepare snacks and meals. Lenore and her staff went out of their way to make us feel special and even took special requests from our group for the continental breakfast on mornings we were in a hurry to catch a bus. They had a gift in our room when we arrived and had a gift waiting when we departed. They supplied clean beach towels as often as we needed and even had nice rafts and boogie boards for our use at the beach. The location is wonderful, just a few blocks from a wonderful beach. The pool and hot tub are small but just the right temperature, we used it several times a day. It looks like the rooms were very recently renovated. The furnishings were new and very nice, but the beds posts stick out and cause a hazard. I ran into it several times a day and left with a nice bruise on my shin. The street noise is very loud, but with the sliding glass door closed and air conditioning running it wasn't a problem to sleep. Overall a great hotel on a budget. I was very skeptical reading the reviews before we arrived, but I can tell you from first hand experience that they appear to be going out of their way to please their guests and it exceeded my expectations. I expected a clean room but not this level of service.

<Content>Great location The hotel was only one block from Waikiki beach and across the street from the bus stop so it was very convenient.The pool was on the small side, but had nice landscaping with lots of plants and trees which made it an inviting area to relax in.My room was comfortable and very clean but there was some street noise - double paned glass sliding doors would help.It's probably better to request a room on the higher floors.The hotel was small so it didn't have that impersonal feeling like some of the large hotels. The continental breakfast was a bonus and overall my stay there was comfortable.

<Content>great overall stay, wonderful location (for the price) We stayed at the hotel twice, once at the beginning of our trip and then at the end. We liked almost everything about it, from the renovated room with a very big and well equipped kitchenette to the red apples always available in the lobby. The complimentary breakfast is more european (juice, muffin/scone, fruit), but there was also great coffee in our room during our stay.Both of our rooms were recently renovated, the flat screen TV was large and we liked the modern asian-inspired decor. The bathrooms were smallish, but on the other hand we liked the quality of the cosmetic products.Most of all, we enjoyed the location. For paying 90$ per night for a studio room (not too big, but enough for us), we were in central Waikiki, two blocks from the beach! We were especially thankful for the free internet (via cable in the room, wireless in the lobby). The staff was nice and helpful. The garden with the pool looked good if rather small, but since we were close to the beach we never really used it. Maybe the only complaint we could note was the street noise at night (our balcony faced the street in the direction of the beach).In conclusion, next time we are in Oahu on a budget, we will probably want to stay in an Aqua hotel.

<Content>Aqua Bamboo - the best kept secret in Hawaii Re ' The Bamboo Hotel in Waikiki This was one of the nicest hotel experiences my husband and I have had in Waikiki . We were delighted with everything--but the very best of all was the wonderful staff ! They were so kind to us-far above the ordinary ! Thank you to them all--for the lovely surprise Anniversary Flowers, chocolates and Champagne-we enjoyed them all! Our room was very comfortable -and kept spotless by the people there--Continental Breakfast enjoyed by the pool each a.m was just right ! Special thanks to Leonor Wong-who was so happy to greet us each day--and always had time for a chat whenever we saw her. This lovely lady even made us two special Mango Cakes to take home with us. Leonor--they are delicious! We have spent many holidays in Hawaii--and this hotel has to be our favorite !!  Mahalo  to you all--and God Bless Gordon  Mona Mason

<Content>Aqua - one of best I have stopped at After completing a 5 week tour of the US mainland, my wife and I had pre-booked the Aqua in Hawaii for 5 nights to recuperate and take it easy before returning to Australia. Because the accommodation charges at the Aqua were very reasonable, we were concerned because many of the 5 star high priced hotels we had stopped previously were very disappointing.Wow.......we had no need to worry. The aqua was fantastic...best hotel we had stopped at by far. We had a suite on the 10th floor which had obviously just been renovated. It was huge, spotless, excellent fittings, very comfortable bed. The hotel provided a complimentary breakfast (a surprise), had a great pool and hot tub, very helpful staff who could answer all my silly questions about how to get to places, shops to go to and where buses went etc, very close walking distance to the main areas of Waikiki, great nearby restaurants, internet access etc etc. We would not hesitate to stop there again and would recommend it to our friends. To top it all off we met Lenore Wong, a hotel employee who could not do enough for us. She made it a stay to remember.Aqua Bamboo...........you are the best..........great hotel and the best staff.

<Content>Loved this place I had read some earlier reports on the Aqua Bamboo which were not very complimentary, and I even contacted the hotel direct airing my concerns. Don鈥檛 know why, this hotel turned out to be one of the best, friendliest, most comfortable home away from home. My daughter and I had booked 9 nights at the Aqua Bamboo, and 6 nights at the Sheraton Princess Kauiliani, well when it came time to checkout we simply did not want to leave. Our room was great 2 x double beds, large flat screen TV, great shower/bath, washing machine at the end of the hall, a great swimming pool, free internet, fresh apples all day every day, yummy muffins and pastries for breakfast, and lovely reception staff and service staff. I don鈥檛 know what I was ever worried about WE LOVED THIS HOTEL! And I loved the lounge coat thanks Aqua Bamboo we had a great time

<Content>Aqua Bamboo Just like family My wife and I were looking a for a medium priced hotel for our holiday in Hawaii when we came across the Aqua Bamboo  Spa.Beside the price, what sealed the deal to book was the fact that the room came with a kitchenette and not just a fridge and coffee maker as is the case in most of the hotels.At the Aqau Bamboo the staff make you feel right at home just like a relative does and they are so friendly and ready to help you no matter what the request.Thursday afternoons they have a meet and greet with free cocktails and nibbles, a chance to meet other quests and the staff.Location is great being only a quarter mile from the beach at the Dukes statue , easy walking to the popular Waikiki shops and the International Market Place.The free internet available in the lobby was great for being able to contact our family back home in Australia and there are connection also in the rooms for laptops etc.The Aqua Bamboo had a makeover not long before we arrived and they have done a really good job with rooms being a nice place to be when not out in the sun.The pool and BBQ area is tastefully set up with day beds and lounges should you not want to go to the beach.We highly recommend the Aqua Bamboo  Spa for a stay in Waikiki for those on mdoerate budgets and looking for a boutique style accomodation.Cheers CA , Bondi, Australia.

We also loved the Thursday afternoon's drink's  nibbles with staff other guests,it was a fun time. Leonor made us feel very at home the Hawaiian way.

<Content>MAKE ME FEEL LIKE PARADISE! ***********************************************************************Accolades are due for the Aqua Bamboo!Usually when u stay in a hotel ure just a guest among many, but at the Aqua Bamboo, they have a way of making u feel as if u r the only guest they r taking care of. The staff is delightfully hospitable and informative (kudos to Christine F. my personal fav, she is an asset to the Aqua establishment). Every morning a healthy breakfast is available. The rooms are clean, stylish and serene. There is a quaint little spa on the premises. Really a hidden gem, located in a prime section of Waikiki. Only a hop skip and jump to the beach. If u want more for your $$ the Aqua Bamboo is fairly priced, and is an example of excellence at it鈥檚 best!Encore! Encore! Encore!

<Content>Hooray for Bamboo we stayed at the Aqua Bamboo for 9 nights during our honeymoon trip to Waikiki and had such a great time!Upon arriving at the hotel we were surprised to have a bottle of champagne and box of chocolates delivered to our room, since we were honeymooning there.My wife and I are into healthy cooking so we enjoyed the in-room kitchenette, and the stainless steel, gas-grill on the pool patio. The rooms are clean and there's a nice flat screen TV on the wall. Thursdays they have a free cocktail hour with a nice little spread of fruit and cheese. Plus, with the price of fruit in Waikiki, it's nice they provide free apples for a snack anytime of day.Our guest service agents, Leonor and Angela, were great. They talked to us every morning at breakfast to make sure we were having fun and give us tips on any attractions we were planning to see. We'll definitely be returning and can't wait for our next trip to Honolulu.

<Content>Great for the price We stayed at Aqua Bamboo for five days. The kids loved the pool. The spa was great for a quick massage at a great price. The staff and the service were both wonderful. The Staff members remembered our children's names and always had something to offer them. The rooms were a bit small, but they were clean and comfortable. The location is also perfect, only a block to the beach. It's a great place to stay on a budget.

<Content>the Bamboo rules I loved our stay at the Aqua Bamboo. Our room was clean, stylish and lovely. (a studio deluxe. smallish but perfect , great balcony, big bath, kitchenette, big tv, fantastic comfy bed.)The staff were amazing. always really kind, helpful and friendly. One time I needed to make some international calls and rung the front desk to check on their international rates. She advised me that it would be heaps cheaper for me just to pop over the road for a 5$ phone card, as their rates were much higher. There were lots of other occasions where the desk staff gave us great tips and helped us out. I guess they just all seemed like really lovely people. It sounds really corny to say that I understood there what the spirit of aloha was all about. But I did. the breakfast was great - muffins, juice, fruit, coffee and the newspaper - nothing spectacular, but a perfect start to a day at the beach or wandering around.the pool is fantastic - salt water with a waterfall. a little hot tub beside it, a sauna and lots of pool chairs. It felt really good to be in a smallish boutique hotel, rather than one of those vast beachfront towers. More personal. More fun. The Bamboo rules! The lobby smells like flowers. It's sleek, well designed and clean. It's in a fantastic spot and the staff are the nicest people you could wish to meet. Like someone else wrote. Sshhh. Don't tell anyone.

<Content>Great Spot! Just got back from a wonderful holiday in Waikiki. We stayed in a condo within the Aqua Bamboo hotel. While I cannot comment on thier hotel rooms, I can comment on staff, facilities, location etc. The Bamboo is a wonderful find, centrally located ( 5 mins - 1 block or so to the beach) In busy Waikiki where huge hotels are abundant, I really appreciated the intimacy that the Bamboo provided. The staff were genuinely sweet and helpful. It was nice to see the same faces every day. The lobby is immaculate and newly re done. They have complementary newspapers and a bowl of apples out everyday. Breakfast, while we didint partake, from what I saw consisted of baked goods, fruit, juice, coffee  tea. There are two computers with internet access for guests to use ( free!). The pool area is lovely, lots of teak lounge chairs and tables and 2 cabana like areas. They light tiki torches at night which are very pretty. There is also a BBQ down in this area which was very nice - the bbq is new and works very well. We used it twice during our stay. A word of advice, the Food Pantry grocery store acouple of blacks down on Kuhio, will just hose you price wise (close to $10 for 4 litres of milk!!). I think this may be due to the fact that it is the only grocery store in this part of waikiki. Both Foodland and Safeway offer much better prices and are maybe 5 minuites away by car. I digress....there is also a spa at the hotel, which we didint use but offered alot of massages and body treatments. There isnt alot of parking at the hotel, we parked next door at the Pacific Monarch for $12 a day, which is an okay price but very convenient. Loved the Bamboo and would reccoment it to anyone in a heartbeat!

<Content>Better Than Expected We checked out the Aqua Bamboo from the internet before we got our travel agent to book it. We could only go by the photos and description on the site which looked quite good. After a dissappointing experience in a web-booked motel in San Francisco we weren't sure what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised.The hotel and it's lovely surroundings were clean and neat and the room had everything we needed and was very comfortable. It even had a small kitchenette. While not on the beachfront it is only a short walk to Waikiki Beach, shops and restaurants.The staff were friendly and helpful. My only gripe would be the continental breakfast which I felt could be expanded a little to include some toast and cereal as not everyone enjoys cake for breakfast. The customer relations manager was wonderful and went out of her way to ensure we were happy. It was definately great value for money and we would certainly stay there again next time we are in Hawaii.

<Content>Wonderful Surprise! The Aqua Bamboo was a truly pleasant surprise upon arrival. Just 3 blocks from the beach, and great walking distance to anything and everything. All of the staff at the hotel were extremely friendly, and were more than willing to meet our needs. The price was good for what we got. Basic room, with small kitchenette and lanai. Didn't need anything more. Was cleaned on a consistent, daily basis, which is important! The room even had free WiFi access. The only downside was the price of parking at $18 per day. Didn't rent a car for more than a day because of this.Would highly recommend this hotel to travelers who need a comfortable place to stay, which is walking distance to everything you need.

<Content>Great hotel in Waikiki The Aqua Bamboo is just two blocks from Waikiki beach. The rooms are spacious and clean. and decorated with simple elegance. We booked a one-bedroom suite for our family of four and we had plenty of room to spread out.The staff were terrific, from the front desk to the room attendants! All were friendly, gracious, and very interested in making sure our stay was comfortable.Aqua Bamboo also serves a wonderful continental breakfast every morning. And, they have onsite spa services,a pool in the beautifully decorated patio, free daily newspaper, and 24/7 coffee or hot tea. They also have onsite coin-operated laundry facilities.The surrounding area is safe and just a short walk in any direction to shopping, eating, and beaching activities. A bus stop is across the street although we did not need this. We were very pleased with our hotel experience and couldn't have asked for nicer staff who know all about the Aloha spirit!

<Content>great honeymoon I loved the hotel and the staff was friendly and accomidating. Great little view of the beach off the terrace. The pool was great and I loved the cabanas to shade me. I enjoyed a great massage and felt really relaxed, The only problem was the maid service often missed things such as clean glasses or cups. The maid didn't arrive till 5:00 or so right when we were trying to nap or take a shower from the beach, Over all loved the Bamboo and hope to come back on our aniversery.

<Content>Wonderful Stay at the Aqua Bamboo My stay at Aqua Bamboo was more then I expected. After find out about the hotel through my Entertainment book I was a bit nervous booking with them because I had never stayed there before. Upon my arrival I was very surprised. After walking into the lobby and seeing how nice it was, I only started to imagine how nice the rooms were. Let me tell you the rooms were just was wonderful as the lobby. My three night stay was amazing. A 2 minute walk from the beach and great food in all directions, I could not have asked for a better location to be in. All of the employees, esp the guest services manager, were all very welcoming and friendly every time I left and returned to the hotel. I will definately be returning to stay at the Aqua Bamboo in the future!

<Content>Mahalo Aqua Bamboo! My friend and I stayed here on a girlfriend getaway, and absolutely loved it. From the moment we stepped inside, we both agreed that we'd won the hotel lottery.First of all, it's beautiful. The fountain out front, the lobby, and especially the pool area outside are all scenic, relaxing, and inviting-- without being overly pretentious, as some hotels tend to be. Our room was clean and remained clean the entire week due to the awesome staff, who very kindly put up with us tracking sand all over the floor (mahalo!).There was a continental breakfast every morning with food enough to get us ready for the day, and some pretty amazing coffee. We enjoyed coming back from our adventures and having an afternoon coffee break out by the pool. I can't stress enough how pretty it was out there: quiet, calm, plenty of seating... really the perfect way to unwind and get ready for evening fun.I loved the fact that the hotel was small enough that I recognized the faces of the other guests and the staff. It felt a little more like home than a bigger luxury hotel might have been. Lenore Wong always took time out to talk to us and make us feel welcome, and every other staff member we met was friendly and accommodating.If I ever return to Waikiki, I will definitely be staying at this hotel-- I won't even look anywhere else. I seriously think the people who gave it negative reviews are a little crazy.

<Content>Birthday Celebration We just returned from our trip in Hawaii and our stay at Aqua Bamboo Hotel is excellent compared to those 5 stars hotel we stayed before.We have a very nice room with view of the ocean on one side and the mountains on the other side. The room is very clean and the hotel employee's are very accomodating, courteous and friendly.The pool is lovely and clean and we enjoyed staying and relaxing by the pool side.Locations is great, closer to the beach, restaurants and shopping and nite activities.Overall, this is the best hotel we have ever stayed in our family vacations. I would highly recommend to stay in this family friendly hotel.

<Content>Don't Stay Here: Terrible Reception Staff We are very disappointed with the reception staff at the Aqua Bamboo. We are a family with several small children and had to sit in the lobby for five hours waiting for the room to be ready. We arrived at noon and they said checkin was at 3 and even though the room was vacated by noon we would just have to wait. We were polite and asked about once an hour but they just acted like they did not care. They made no effort to help us and seemed pleased that the room took until 5 PM to prepare for us. Terrible service. Don't stay here, or ask for a manager when you check in.

<Content>Loved Bamboo VERY nice staff, good, clean, small hotel, close to the beach (two blocks), beautiful pool (open from 6 a.m. till 10 p.m.!) middle in the small garden, waterfall, banana trees, flowers, torches in the evening (I very liked it). Small kitchenette in the room, all necessary in the kitchen available. If you need something, you get it. Nice hotel lobby. On the internet you can get some photos from this hotel, they correspond to the reality. One important thing - please ask for the room pool side or higher floor, your view outside will be better. The worst you can get is lower floor and back side (view on the wall of neighbor hotel ), try to avoid it. Rooms are spacious, furniture are new - this is good feeling. Color of furniture is black - I liked it. Breakfast - different muffins (with macadamia nuts or banana), fruits like bananas, oranges, apples, juices, coffee.Car place : Garage - 18 usd/day !!! Children? not really hotel for family with small children, pool deep, no small pool for children.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay very much! Great staff. The Aqua Bamboo isn't a fancy hotel, but it is a charming and comfortable hotel. My niece and I enjoyed a 5 night stay and we were very pleased with the property. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Daniel at the front desk helped us with bus routes, dinner suggestions and each time we returned from a busy day of activities he asked if we enjoyed ourselves. We were also treated to massages at the poolside spa.......ahhhhhhh!!!!! The hotel is a 2 block walk to the beach, there is shopping and restaurants in each direction and the bus stops right across the street. We couldn't have asked for a better location and reasonable price. The fresh ground coffee available at anytime in the lobby is a nice treat, too!

<Content>Great stay We stayed here for 5 nights , I was very pleasantly surprised; the rooms were very nice, bed very comfy and staff was great. Not on the beach but it was very quiet and overall just a really nice stay. Their signature drink Bamboozle was quite tasty (Thurs. night mgrs reception) and we enjoyed chatting w/Joy, guest services mgr who was extremely pleasant and welcoming. We later checked into Aqua Equus and while the rooms were nice, we were wished we were back at Bamboo. (Will post my review on Equus as well. This location, among other things, was much better!)

<Content>Pretty good This is a decent hotel for it's location. The place is a bit outdated but the main reception area is nice. The room we stayed in was alright, it had the bare essentials but it was pretty gloomy since we were on the 2nd floor- but really, who could complain for the price.... The only bad thing I can say is that we should have been warned about the renovations going on when we were there because it was pretty noisy in the mornings. However, the construction noise was a good alarm clock and we were too jetlagged to care.

<Content>Bamboozled My wife and I stayed at this hotel due to a budget we were trying to keep. The hotel ran us around $100 a night and seemed like a great deal considering the location. In Honolulu all hotels are a little dated and most of them have been reinvented through remodeling to a more modern chic appearance and this is the case with this hotel. I was pleased when we arrived and saw the lobby. IT was alittle older but appeared clean and nice. When we arrived in our room, it was nice as well kind of plain bare bones small but nice. Though again we were on a budget trip so no arguments yet. The next day is when we found holes in our great budget hotel. The second evening when we came into our room we were shocked to see a lot ot roaches not the Big Ones but small ones on our furniture and bed. We think it was because we kept the light off that evening and they came out to play. We called and the hotel staff was very accomidating and sprayed our room for us and even offered to oswitch us into a different room.. we switched rooms but had the same little problem. So what we had to do is leave the lights on all night to keep these nocturnal creatures away. Not the most relaxing Hawaii vacation but we made the best of it but if I was someone coming o Hawaii I would stay in one of the main hotels. It seemed like hotels in Honolulu are in two levels Luxurious and Lower level budget. I would be careful with budget hotels in Honolulu.

<Content>we plan to return to our exact room when we come back! The biggest factors for my wife and I were of course price, but also atmosphere, room quality, breakfast, a pool and location. The location was to die for, 2 blocks away from the cener of waikiki beach with a view overlooking the (albiet slightly distant) pacific. The lobby was very inviting and the staff was amazingly friendly and helpful. The pool was fantastic and very clean with plenty of comfortable lounge chairs and seating nearby. As far as the continental breakfast is concerned, it was adequite but not what we have come to expect from botique hotels in Wisconsin where we live. There were as many muffins as you could ask for, coffee, juice, milk and water along with a large selection of fresh fruit. Not amazing but good enough to start the day. When my wife and I booked our hotel and flight package through hotwire.com, I would be lying if I said that price was not the major deciding factor. On this level, the Bamboo was a real performer and for a 5 night stay we paid significntly less than other travelers in our group, (we were there for a wedding). On Thursday we were treated to complimentary drinks massages as are available to any guest present Thursday afternoons. The room itself was wonderfully furnished with a very comfortable double bed and beautiful and tasteful bamboo themed furniture. The structure itself was in need of an pdate, but we were happy to see that said updating was being done as we stayed and although construction equipment was evident and a room on our floor being renovated, we were never bothered by any dust or noise. Overall I think my subject line summed it up. We loved our hotel, the staff, the amenities, the location and our room with its beautfiul view off of any of the 3 balconies (not even a suite mind you, just an economy double). We look forward to returning and seeing what our room will look like after the renovation, but the fact that the structure was a little out-dated in no way counteracts al of the positives we experienced!

<Content>Reasonable accommodaions for the price When the travel agent booked my son (age 9) and me into this property, I read some reviews here and was quite concerned. For the price we paid, however (under $100/night with 5th night free), the hotel was reasonable. The room was small and had a bit of a musty smell, but an open window took care of it. We had requested a room overlooking the pool and instead got a view of a brick wall. The street is very busy and has a lot of noise, even late at night. But we didn't go to Hawaii to hang out in a hotel room! The hotel is a five minute walk from Waikiki Beach and is also within reasonable walking distance of the zoo and aquarium. On our final day, we checked out by the 11:00 am check-out time. The hotel stored our luggage and we had a lovely day on the town. We returned to the hotel, exhausted, around 5:00 pm (the shuttle didn't arrive until 7:30) and were permitted to relax in the lobby until the shuttle arrived.

<Content>Loved the sun deck and pool A large group of us booked three rooms here for a week. When we arrived, two of the three rooms did not meet the specs that we had asked for. The two rooms had an awful smell; after complaining the next day, we were moved to adequate rooms and we had no problems for the rest of the trip.The location is great. Only a five-minute walk from Waikiki Beach and located right in the middle of tons of restaurants, shops, and local markets.The sun deck at the resort is amazing. The pool looks really nice, and there's lot of places to sit and enjoy the sun. What I really enjoyed was the free wireless internet here. The connection was excellent. Keep in mind though, I couldn't get any wireless in the hotel rooms; only one wired connection was available, and this may be difficult for two laptops in one room!Breakfast was good. Free muffins, coffee, fruit, and juice.I would recommend this place for people who are just looking for a place to stay with nothing fancy.

<Content>Would stay here again This is probably the best located budget hotel you'll find in Waikiki and for that reason alone I would definitely stay here again. I was very disappointed when I arrived that after having specifically requested a room with two beds (through the hotel's own website), our room only had 1 bed in it, and this after a very long journey all the way from London to Honolulu. They gave us a rollaway but I don't know why it's so difficult to allocate people the correct sized room. We were moved into a 2-bed room the following day without any fuss, but we were never offered a discount or much of an apology for the mix-up. However, the next 3 nights were very trouble free, the room was huge with 3 balconies and we felt very at home there indeed.I didn't use the pool or the spa and we never took advantage of the free breakfast, so I can't comment on those. But the location is fabulous - you're a very short walk from the beach and it's very central. Kuhio Avenue has loads of great bars and restaurants, whatever your tastes.

<Author>Aloha-U
<Content>A Peaceful Place to Be Researching hotels through travel books and the internet, I found the Aqua Bamboo, a small boutique (feng-shui) hotel which has the reputation of being a gem, and which sounded like the perfect place for a peaceful two weeks, yet located in Waikiki near the beach. When I arrived, I was stunned by the beauty and atmosphere of the lobby - which also had a large flat-screen TV showing ever-changing landscapes of Hawaii. There were various comfortable places to sit and a spacious outer courtyard. No photos or descriptions could possibly translate the actual experience. As a woman artist traveling alone, wishing for a retreat near the white sand beaches and inviting waters of Waikiki, and where there is a fabulous bus system so I wouldn't even have to drive a car, and wishing for a hotel that would be quiet, safe, and with a Hawaiian atmosphere, I couldn't have found a better place to be. My room was amazing. I had a balcony with sunrise on one side, a large lanai with the sunset on the other side, and a to-floor window, I looked down on the inner courtyard (with pool, jacuzzi, spa building, big wooden chairs, tables  lounges, a thatched Hawaiian shelter to one side, a waterfall over lava rocks, jungle-like plantings all around), and, looking out above it, I could see the gentle incoming waves and surfers. In the room, the art was varied, all deeply spiritually Hawaiian, the colors relaxing, and there was a flat-screen TV which showed more than a few programs of Hawaian musicians and vistas of Hawaii. Every morning in the courtyard or lobby, there were warm and friendly Hawaians serving a continental breakfast of juices, fruit, coffee and assorted muffins. The staff at the Aqua Bamboo are full of information and always helpful and friendly, with true Aloha spirit. As you can see, I am always ready to recommend this hotel for a peaceful home-away-from-home, and, speaking for myself, - I didn't want to leave! Enjoy your stay! - Marlina Rinzen

<Content>Big Mistake! I recently stayed at this hotel to potentially arrange a group booking for 20-30 pax for my up comming wedding in Hawaii. Being a travel agent there was no mention of any redevelopment which I soon discovered when I checked into my room. Prior to arriving I sent an email to their group reservation manager to arrange a tour of the hotel, this was ignored, instead I received an email with attachents of their rates. As an agent this is quite poor as I had many meetings with managers during my stay. Apon arrival, I was given a room on the 8th floor and when entering the lift there was a letter stating renovations were being done between 9-5pm with 'minimal noise' on floors 5-9. When I came to my floor the hallways vinyl was all ripped and masking tape was everywhere. When I came to my room I soon discovered that not only was I on a floor with rooms being renovated, one being the room next to me, that the room beneath and above me were also being renovated. The minimal noise that they advised was far from that! As I was purely there for business I was in my room for most of the week working. So I went down stairs to see about changing my room, I was rudely brushed away. Saying that the renovation was last minute and they wouldn't do anything for me. With respect for the room I was in it had been already renovated, however, it was of poor quality. There was mould in the bathroom, the bed was not made properly, the cushions were still in the wardrobe and the new paint work and furniture was chipped and paint work was very unprofessionaly painted. The kitchette looked like something from the 1960's. As for the 'continental breakfast' what a joke! The next morning I went downstairs as the noise was unbearable and my room was shaking from the drilling. Luckily there was new staff on and I actually spoke to a receptionist that was professional. My room was changed to level 5 so it was a at least a bit more quiet. Unfortunatley, being a small hotel all floors heard the noise. The temperature of the pool by the way is freezing, the self serve paying coffee machine breaks down, the night staff have friends hanging around at reception, and they watch tv at night on a plasma. This is rather unprofessional, just like the front office manager parking his white mercedes to show off out front of the lobby where taxis etc for GUESTS pull in. Instead of parking underneath in the carpark like all staff should. It is a shame that this hotel lacks any real professionalism or care for their guests as it has such potential. To add to my disasterous stay they over charged me an extra nights accomodation. I am still waiting on my refund which they apologised and said would be processed immediatly, I am not holding my breath. I witnessed and spoke to many disgruntled hotel guests during my stay, and the comments box I noticed when I checked out was full.I can only imagine what was written nothing positive I bet!! Obviously they have not only lost my business for my wedding, but for any future client referrals being a travel agent. VERY dissapointed!!!!

<Content>All you need in a hotel! I was very afraid of staying at this hotel because of some of the bad things I read on here, but there was nothing wrong with this property! My boyfriend and I stayed in a moderate room from the 2-9 of April. Upon arriving we felt very welcome. The staff is excellent. When we first arrived we had a problem locking the door to the patio and as soon as we let Howel know, he came up and fixed it. Also, on our way out the door to dinner the woman at the front desk stopped us and told us she forgot to give us our bottled water, we thought that was extremely nice of her to remember. Our room was on the 12th floor. It was a little dated and small, but the balconies and the views made up for it. Our full sized bed was right next to the sliding glass door, which was great for sunny and breezy afternoon naps! We had plenty of closet/drawer/counter space for all of our stuff and the TV was nice. The bathroom was average. The only thing that bothered me was the carpet because it felt old under my barefeet...but I got over it. The pastries at breakfast were great and the cocktails on Thursday night were excellent (we made them when we got home!). Overall this is a great hotel and by the sound of drilling and hammering it's going to get even better!

<Content>Well past it's best My family and I stayed at the Aqua Bamboo Hotel and Spa, 2425, Kuhio Ave`, Waikiki, between the 20th and 24th March 2008. We booked the hotel with a US travel agent after checking the hotel web site and being impressed with some of the previousWe have travelled to the US ( from England) on a number of occasions and expect the hotels to be of a good standard. The Aqua Bamboo and Spa was particularly disappointing and in our opinion fell well below the standard that we are accustomed to during our holidays in the US.It has to be said that the staff are excellant, very friendly and helpful. The hotel is also clean. However, the condition of the hotel is very dated and the furnishings are very well worn. It was probably great in the 1970`s. The pool and spa area are also rather shabby and not a place where we felt we could sit and relax.The furniture in our room was also well past its best, old, dark scratched and not particularly good to look at. The refrigerator and air conditioning unit was rusty, the shower faucet was also rusty and came off of the pipe in my hand. The T.V didn`t work and was not replaced or repaired during our stay.Our room was on the front of the hotel and the traffic noise made it almost impossible to sleep at night. The hotel staff said that there were no other rooms available to enable us to move.The hallways and elevators were also in desparate need of being refurbished.A fellow guest and her family, ( from California) shared our thoughts and moved to a nearby hotel. Unfortunately, our budget did not permit us to make that move.This hotel is in fact saved by its friendly staff. The hotel is in desparate need of being fully refurnished. The photographs do not give a true refelection of the quality of this establishment.After travelling all the way from the UK, it was very disapointing to stay in such a poor quality hotel.The Aqua Bamboo is well past its best.Bkenyon. Yorkshire, England.

<Content>Great Value Booked this hotel directly through the Aqua Groups website after I found it through a 'wotif' style website. Saved approximatly 55USD per night by booking it on the Aqua website itself. Room: Good size, could of used a couch (would of fit). Plenty of cupboard space. Two balconies, one with view of the pool. Nicely decorated with a comfortable bed, good T.V and room safe. Kitchen  bathroom very outdated and slightly grotty looking, however clean and functional.Pool: Small but nice surroundings and well kept. Only used it once however, much better off down at the beach. Breakfast: Free continetal, good quality muffins etc. Service  Staff: Reception not so friendly but very helpful and did their job well. Cleaning staff etc very friendly and great job. All staff happy to assit in problems and give advice of local activities etc. Free internet access in lobby.Overall I thought this was a great hotel for the price, the room was nice and comfortable and the service was great. My only complaint with the hotel would be parking - small and between two sites (opposite eachother) and 19USD a day. Rip off!

<Content>Great location I got this hotel through a web site, which I let them pick my hotel. After knowing where we were staying I read the reviews, and I was a little concern, because I was making plans for 2 other couples. Arriving the lobby was clean and inviting. All of our rooms were different. My room was small with a double bed ( I wished the bed was bigger) the first thing I did was check for bed bugs on the mattress. NONE! I did love the view of the mountains and water from my patio. The patios are small, but how many people do you expect them to hold? (ninth floor). The second room was a lot bigger with 2 beds, but they had to deal with the noise, and it was not a problem with them. (second floor) The third party changed their room twice  upgraded to a suite. (seventh floor) All the rooms needed updating, That is why their renovating this year. All the rooms had a stove, refridgerator  microwave. I do have to thank the front desk; they treated us as if we owned the place!! Housekeeping kept our place shining and always had a smile on their face. We had a small problem with a TV in one room and maintenance was right there. The pool area might be small but it is not used a lot since you have an ocean 2 short blocks away. Every day we had free breakfast (juice, muffin,  fruit) free internet in the lobby  a cocktail party once a week. Not to much more you could ask for, unless you plan on to spend all your time in the room, than pay 300.00 a night!

<Content>Aqua Bamboo  This is a gem for so many reasons. Super staff, terrific location to Waikiki Beach, very reasonable on the budget, not a hotel to consider for only geting your night's sleep....it is a place you want to be. A beautiful pool area including jacuzzi, tropical plants, hip lobby area.Yet , the reasonable rates will allow you to discover the islandwithout that nagging feeling that you should be making more use of your hotel. Will I return? You bet!

<Content>Excellent location! Excellent centralized location. It is close to the beach/restaurants and shopping centers. The service was great. Thursday's Happy Hour was an unexpected added touch!

<Content>Great boutique hotel We loved the Aqua Bamboo...It is a well run, clean, well appointed hotel in a great location...two blocks behind the Hyatt Regency in Waikiki. The staff were all very friendly, especially the women who served the continental breakfast...checkin was easy, the desk staff were all very helpful, and the cleaning staff was very patient with our late sleep-ins. I would definitely stay there again..in a minute. Thanks so much.

<Content>Location great but rooms suffer. The hotel has a great location. Recent updating including modern lobby and outside pool area. I think they forgot our room. It was small and very dated. No chairs other than mismatched kitchen chairs. Kitchen area dated and worn. Bathroom fixtures rusty, toilet leaked and paint in room was minimal. We stayed for 4 nights and will not return to this hotel. However, the location was great, staff helpful and price is well under area hotels. The flat screen TV was new but not much else.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay We enjoyed our stay at the Aqua Bamboo. It is centrally located so very easy to walk to other sites for catching tour busses or just shopping. The room was very inviting and clean. The staff always had it cleaned when we returned for the day. We liked the computers that were available in the lobby to check our email. It is a nice service. The front desk was very helpful with any questions we had.

<Content>Bamboozled The staff at Aqua Bamboo were very helpful with every request that me and my wife had. The view is great, and the hotel is only located a couple minutes from Waikiki Beach. A definite price break from the major Waikiki hotels. The hotel staff treats their guests to a complimentary drink every Thursday as well as free coffee/danishes every morning. The only drawback to this hotel was the parking lot (located below the hotel) was a tight fit.

<Content>Honest Review Location: Very good, close to stores, bus stop, trolley, beach, restaurants, and attractions within walking distance.Front Desk; Everyone was very helpful, friendly, we were accomodated with our requests like a microwave and folding bed.Housekeeping: Friendly, helpful, accomodated us with request for extra towels and plastic cups.Rooms; The decor was dated no doubt. However, we checked out trip advisor reviews before we left and knew basically what to expect, The room was just basically a place to sleep in, clean up and watch tv. You could hear the traffic outside but that was to be expected being on Kuhio Ave.Pool Area: Small, quiet, nice jaccuzi, cold pool water, relaxing, nice wood furniture. Breakfast: Coffee's, tea's, muffins, juice, apples, bananas. I would suggest switching muffins with something else every other couple of days. After a 10 day stay its too much. However, our daughter loved the muffins. She wants the recipe. We had a danish type bun after our second day there. Apples were available all day long in a bowl at the front desk, and coffee, tea, and (speciality coffee's for $1.00 ) were available in the back lobby area. Internet: Free for 30 minutes to guests in lobby area.If I wanted to stay somewhere higher end I would have gone to the Outrigger on the beach or elsewhere.

<Content>Bamboo Bummer The Aqua Bamboo has a beautiful website, which I felt was misleading. The lobby area is beautiful and tastefully decorated; however, when we got to the third floor, things started to change. It's very dated and dark in the hallways. When we got to our room, we became disappointed. The room was very humid and smelled like mold. The air conditioning ran for an entire week and was rather loud. I just felt like the room wasn't very clean. Every time we took a shower, the water leaked onto the floor of the bathroom. Our view was of all of the balconies of the apartment building next door. This included their clothes being hung out to dry. It felt very third-world-ish.Since this was a family trip with our son, there were three of us in the room. We informed the housekeeper of this and had asked to get three towels in our room on a daily basis. Our stay was six nights long, and of those six nights, we had to ask for an additional towel on three different occasions.There were a few nice things about the hotel: the price, the proximity to the beach, the continental breakfast (which was included with the price).I would not book another stay at this hotel. Next time I go to Waikiki, I will save enough money so I can book a more-expensive room (which it seems like the old saying is true here: You get what you pay for).

<Content>Not a boutique hotel but pretty good overall The Aqua Bamboo bills itself as a boutique hotel, which is definitely a bit of a stretch. That being said, it is a good value for those needing fairly basic accomodations in Waikiki. It has a good location on Kuhio Ave., although you do get a good deal of street noise if you are on the lower floors. It's a two block walk to the beach and there are tons of restaurants and shops nearby. The rooms are definitely dated, with noisy window air conditioning units and decor that needs updating. My room was very dark as it faced another building and got very little natural light, and there aren't many lights in the room.They were very clean though and the shower was great--excellent water pressure. The pool area is actually the best part of the hotel, the grounds are well taken care of and there are plenty of lounge chairs. The continental breakfast isn't much, when I was there it was a muffin, one type of juice, and some green bananas, so if you have a hearty appetite be prepared to eat out. There is free internet access in the lobby which is an added benefit. Since you probably won't be in your room much in Waikiki, this is a good choice for active people, probably not for families or those who are light sleepers due to the street noise.

<Content>Completely Disppointing Stayed at the Aqua Bamboo with girlfriends for 3 days in July. I am a local and my friends were visiting from California. I have stayed at boutique hotels in other cities, but never in Honolulu - usually I head to the big chains (the Hyatts, Sheratons, Marriotts, etc.) when I stay in Waikiki. I had heard about the Aqua chain - formerly the Waikiki Marc, a dilapidated budget hotel - as a chain of renovated boutique hotels and was curious to see how good it was. The website was snazzy, the pictures looked nice and although it was located on Kuhio Avenue and farther than we'd like from the beach and main shops in Waikiki, we thought we'd give it a try - perhaps it's location would actually turn out to be a positive thing? We were wrong. More Budget than Boutique, this hotel seemed to translate to poor quality and facilities, rude customer service and poor value.  Every day, the tiny on-site parking lot was full - so we were directed across the street towards another hotel's lot. I expect parking fees in Waikiki to be expensive (easily $25/ day), but what I did not expect was a tiny parking structure that was so small and steep that the bottom of my car scraped the floor ramp driving up each successive level. I don't have a compact car or even a dropped car, for that matter. If you have a rental car, you won't have to worry about damaging your car, but if your rental car is anything larger than a economy compact, you may be in trouble - the spaces were small and narrow. The hotel guest parking fee for parking across the street was nominally cheaper than parking in the hotel lot. The hotel representative at the front desk was consistently rude to us our entire stay - she must have personal/attitude problems bc my friends are very polite people and regardless of how nicely we asked her for help, she appeared annoyed that we were even alive. On the other hand, the other hotel staff we encountered was very nice and helpful. Our suite was clean but in poor condition. The door lock was broken, the beds were uncomfortable and the sheets smelled. The balcony was extremely tiny (only 2 people could sit outside at a time, with their knees hitting the rail). The suite was supposed to fit 4 people comfortably, but more likely, I'd say 3 people. The noise from the street was loud. The pool was small and disappointing. One perk: a large plasma TV and the suites come with a kitchenette. After our experience the first day and feeling as if we were mislead by the website claiming the hotel was hip, we decided against trying their highly touted spa services.   Before booking this hotel, we had researched it on this website and while there were a few negative reviews, we figured they were rare instances, not the norm. After staying there, I'm sorry to say that we are joining the ranks of those who rate this hotel negatively. Interestingly, when we had read the reviews in May 2007 (while researching), there were no responses by the hotel management. Judging from the hotel management posts, they are trying to mitigate the negative reviews of their hotel - let's hope it brings some real improvement. My friends and I submitted feedback forms (as did another group of our friends who stayed there right after us) - detailing our experiences and I hope the hotel management read it. We would have called the number of the owner, Paul, listed on the hotel brochures in every room - but we kept believing everything would get better.  This is not the hip boutique hotel advertised on the hotel website. In my opinion, the value is poor. You can find a room in a better location, with better service  quality, for a better price. If the room rates were more in line with the quality and service, I would not have a problem with this hotel. I am not recommending it to friends and relatives who visit O'ahu in the future.

<Content>Great place, but a bit worn The hotel is a great value for money and with that said, do not expect luxury. The rooms are clean and spacious, but - at least in our room - the furnishings were a bit worn and dingy. They were more old-motel like than hotel-in-Waikiki like, which was a bit incongruous with the brand new flat screen tv that was in our room. The location was great - only one block from the beach and it was near an excellent sushi restaurant called Morio's Sushi (not a fancy place, but really excellent sushi). We paid under $200 for our room during really high season and that included two one hour massages. The staff was friendly and helpful. The massages were very good and the massage area was peaceful and well appointed. The bed was comfortable, but not stable enough for my liking. If you wake up whenever your partner moves around if the bed isn't absolutely still, then you might want to opt for two single beds. The bathroom was a bit small with little space to place one's toiletries. I liked the lobby - it was retro and unfussy. The pool area was small, but delightful and the architecture of the hotel is interesting. Overall, we had a very nice stay here and would stay here again or try one of the other Aqua properties. I should also point out that I believe that many rooms have been and/or are in progress of being refurbished.

<Content>Okay, but some probs My boyfriend and I were very dissapointed when we walked into our room to find 2 single beds, when we had booked a double. When we complained, we were told they were booked out, and that we had to stay in this room the night, but the next day the moved us to a double room. The new room had an ocean view which was fantastic. However, talking to other couples staying in the hotel, the same situation had happened to them as well! So if u stay here, make sure that when u make the booking u clarify what sort of bed u want!!!!Also, get up really early if u dont want to miss out on your complimentary sweet muffin for breakfast, they run out very quick, u are not guarenteed your complimentary breakfast.Other than that, it was comfortable, the staff were great and its in a great location.

<Content>Hotel was good value, but deceptive pricing I felt cheated when I checked out at the hotel. I booked the hotel on line and got a confirmed email with my rate. When I looked at a detailed bill at checkout time, they arbitrarily raised my rate. I asked why, one comment was that the rate was raised on the weekend(one of the days was a Monday). I asked to see the management. The manager said that the rate had jumped for the last 3 days of my stay. I reprinted my email showing my rate. She didnt care. So I am really upset. Check and multiply out your bill after at checkout. I feel they were very dishonest.

<Content>loved being Bamboozled at the Aqua Bamboo! Excellent location combined with clean, orderly and polite service.The continental breakfeast is timely and good, the only recommendationbeing that perhaps a differet offering of other than the sweet roles be available for the more 'diet' carbohydrate concious guests, lol. Very well located for walking, beach, bus and car rental. Affordable and as quiet as a hotel in Waikiki can get with the poolside being relaxing and letting one get away from Kuhio streets normal everday hustle and bustle. Also, the Thursday host Bamboozle bar get together is a super way to meet other gusts.

<Content>Bamboo Experience My family and I enjoyed our stay in Aqua Bamboo hotel. The staff was very friendly and accomodating particularly Ms. Fe (I forget her last name). I'm giving your hotel an excellent rating because of the following:1) The looby was very cozy to begin with. The room that was given to me was also very good and always clean. 2) Friendly staff3) The location is very good -- near shops and restaurants4) Amenities are very good.If I may suggest that a little renovation/touch up would definitely give the hotel an additional plus factor and satisfaction to the guests.I would definitely recommend your hotel to anyone who asks.Thank you very much and mahalo

<Content>Loved the Staff and most of the Hotel but the bed was way to small I was pleasantly surprised upon arriving at the hotel. It was very clean, well cared for and very nicely decorated. The staff especially Christina was the best. I have stayed at Aqua properties before and every time the staff was great. It was the Ocean Tower and Leanor was the greatest which I thought no noe could be any better but I was wrong Christina made us not want to leave to come back home. I would not only go back but it is the only place I want to stay when I come to Waikiki which I come at leaste once maybe twice a year. I think more hotels should actively look for employees like Christina to hold on to the people you that have already stayed at your hotel and you will not need any new guest. I also stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court and I do not remember any thing about the hotel, staff, or property except over charged for everything.Do yourself a favor stay at the Aqua Bamboo Hotel and Spa you will not regret it at all

<Content>Noisy little haven I booked being specific about room needing three beds when we arrived there was only one bed. Simple mistake but not great when you arrive late at night. That was sorted to a room that seemed to be on the freeway. The noise from traffic was incredible, the balcony door and air-conditioner did not seal adequately, which did not help. Rooms can be described as clean but very tired, as are all the rooms that I saw.We had booked for 9 nights but could not cope with the noise and even a room change did not help matters.All amenities outside the rooms are fine as are the staff.We moved to a sister hotel The Aqua Aloha Surf Which is sensational and less expensive.

<Content>Great Little Hotel!!! Loved it :) We just got back from a 7 night stay at the Bamboo. It was my 4th time in Oahu and absolutely the best time. My husband and I went for our 10th anniversary and it was made very special by the excellent service at the Bamboo. I had called the hotel prior to our arrival and confirmed that we had reserved a One bedroom Ohana Suite and that we were coming for our anniversary. Upon check in we were surprise that they honored our request with a suite on the 12th (top) floor. We were greated with smiles and a warm welcome as well as with two bottles of water and a box of chocolates. The lobby of the hotel was very warm and inviting with it's decor and the scent of the topics coming from a large candle at the reception desk. We got our room and key card and immediately went up to our suite. It was a short elevator ride and no wait. The suite was surprising well decorated and clean. We had a full bath and a separate shower with a vanity with two sinks. The furnishings were up to date but were showing a bit of wear and tear. We had technically 3 lanais but only one was big enough to walk out on, this came in handy to dry our beach towels and swim suites. If we walked out on the lanai and looked left we saw a glimpse of the ocean. We could hear the traffic if the glass doors were opened but once it was closed we did not not hear anything. We had a washer and dryer on our floor that was just down the hall. This was very handy when we went to the beach in the am and were planning another swim in the late afternoon. We had a small kitchenette but we were only planning to use the fridge to keep our water cold. It was well equipped but could have maybe used a microwave. There were always apples in a large bowl and coffee or tea all day.We loved the pool area. It was like a peaceful tropical sanctuary. We enjoyed the salt water pool and hot tub every evening after a long day of sun and surf. We also enjoyed the breakfast of muffins, fresh fruit, juice and coffee every morning before heading out to the beach. Kuhio beach was less than a five minute walk and you pass two ABC stores on the way, which was handy to get our inner tubes refilled or grab a quick snack or drink. We used the free computers in the lobby almost everyday and it was never busy. Everytime we had a question for the Front desk it was handled with a smile and done very quickly. I did not write down the names of the individuals that assisted us during our stay but they were all wonderful. Our son and daughter in law decided to come and stay with us for a few days in the middle of the week, the staff was very accomodating and asked if we needed anything like extra cots or towels. We will definately be back soon. Thank you Aqua Bamboo for a wonderful and memorable anniversary trip.

<Content>Aqua Bamboo - avoid the private condo rental [POSTED OCTOBER 19, 2007]The Aqua Bamboo is on a very busy and noisy street. It is nice, overall, and you can get discounts to about $75 per night for the basic room. Just search on-line.We are staying in a privately-owned condo in the hotel (owned by Linda Lee, room 302) and would not recommend this to anyone. The carpet is stained and smelly, the AC leaks all over the Lanai, and the bathroom sink is plugged up. The owner doesn't take a lot of care with cleaning, and the refrigerator was not working when we got in for our month-long stay. We are paying $1,875 for the month. Linda Le did drop off a new dorm-style refrigerator within three days of us letting her know that the built-in one wasn't working, but she HAD to have known that it was not operational before we started our month stay.The location of the hotel is only a block from the beach (and to the Duke webcam that you can find on the Internet.) The bus runs right up the street and there is a lot to do within walking distance.Besides being somewhat old, the hotel is in good condition and if you stay up in the higher floors, I imagine the road noise is not so bad.They have one hour free happy hour on Thursdays that is not so bad!And, the staff seems friendly.The hotel seems to be full on Fridays and Saturdays, but has open rooms during the week.There is high-speed internet (Cat-5) and basic cable in each room.Oh, and they have a ground-level pool and small hot tub (only big enough for one couple at a time.

<Content>It worked for us We read all the reviews before we booked and decided to take a chance as we got a fantastic rate. All in all it worked fine for us. The location is fantastic-- right on the busline  about 3 blocks from the beach, the staff very friendly, the 2 guest computers were great, loved the little pool area with CABANAS!, room size was fine  clean, toiletries were excellent, huge TV . Air conditioner was noisy, it was hard to keep the room dark, the bottom sheet didn't go all the way to the end of the (double) bed, breakfast was oranges/apples/bananas, canned pineapple juice, blueberry muffins and one other kind of pastry-- sort of a dinner roll with a small amount of apple or cream cheese filling smack in the middle. You had to pay for hot chocolate. Would we stay there again? In a heartbeat!! If you don't expect the Ritz and understand what you are getting it's a great deal for Waikiki.

<Content>Loved the bamboo - wanted to stay longer We stayed at the Aqua Bamboo for 4 nights in September and we loved it. We booked a superior studio - and stayed in room 1106. I've read recent reviews and while we appreciate the experience that other travellers may have had, our experience was flawless.The rate for the room, considering its location is fantastic and central. The hotel is one block away from the beach - we had 3 lanais - two facing the beach and one facing the mountains. The furnishings in the room are new and contemporary. The door locks were being upgraded while we were there - we stopped in during the day to find dust, but when we returned in the evening, the room was absolutely spotless.The hotel was full, but during the time we stayed, there was no problem in finding lounges by the pool. The rate included continental breakfast, which was plentiful. The hotel also has free internet access.Every single member of staff gave us 5 star service. We are experienced travellers and stayed in 5 star hotels during our trip.We loved the Bamboo and will return.

<Content>Would not stay again We stayed here early September with a group of friends, each couple had their own room, at first, we were really attracted to the great price and the pictures on the website looked good, however, don't be fooled by the pictures. The room does not live up to the expectations of the pictures. The kitchen and bathroom were really old. The room smelled like mildew and the sheets were dirty and the towels were stained. After complaining first about the dirty bed sheets, they did not replace it but actually reversed the sheets upside down so we wouldn't see the stains but we still saw the stains because we had blood stains on our sheets!! Then, the towels were stained with yellow and dark gray marks. Overall, the staff was nice but I would not stay here again ... the price was cheap but I think this place is overpriced for the crappy room that you get.

<Content>"Have A Great Time At The Aqua Bamboo!!!" This is my 8th stay at this lovely hotel. Every time I had a great time at the Aqua Bamboo. I usually stayed a Non-smoking Deluxe kitchenette which faces the ocean. Every room is a clean, adequate, safe and comfortable.The location is very convenient for every purpose, 2 blocks from the Waikiki Beach, Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center and other wonderful shops and restaurants, 1 block from a 24-hour supermarket Food Pantry, the nearest bus stop is located on the front of the hotel! Also, there is two high-speed internet PCs which can be input and displayed in Japanese in the lobby.The Spa Package plan has a 2 FREE Aqua Spa treatments (Choice of two 1-hour treatments of massage), that was very relaxing and refreshing. Free happy hour on Thursdays evening is very fun, you can drink the wonderful tropical drink at free.For the last thing, every staff was very nice and friendly, especially Ms.Zenie Butay - Guest Service Supervisor, she is very kind and hospitality. I would greatly appreciate their hospitality, For my next visit to Waikiki in next March, I will definitely stay at the Aqua Bamboo again!

<Content>Avg Room, Nice lobby/pool, good location Stayed at the Bamboo for a week last Dec. Were it not that I was attending a conference nearby, I would have tried a BB or something more cozy. Despite the claims that it's a boutique hotel, IT IS NOT. The lobby is kitchsy-chic and the pool area is nice but the room was definitely less than average. The full bed was nothing special, and despite the fact we had two balconies -- we hardly used them since it's downtown Waikiki and loud as hell. I was expecting more, even though I only paid around $115/night.

<Content>Friendly, convenient and comfortable This hotel is cute and pleasant, the decor is very modern oriental and contemporary, even though the hotel itself is a bit older. It was a comfortable size, with a small kitchenette so you could do some basic cooking and keep cold foods etc. The location is great, 5 mins or less walk to the beach and close to the main strip of Waikiki, we couldn't ask for a more convenient location.The staff there are very nice and helpful as well, one of our friends left a valuable item there and it was not until we arrived back home in Australia that she realised. We emailed them and received a prompt response. They found the item and offered to send it back for us, all we had to do was pay for postage.Mahalo Aqua Bamboo!

<Content>Had a great time at the Aqua Bamboo We had a great time at the Aqua Bamboo. The room was small, but adequate. The pool area was very nice and a relaxing place to wind down in the evening in either the pool or hot tub. The hotel was clean and the staff was very nice and attentive. We didn't have a good view from our room, but some rooms overlooked the pool area, which was a nice view. It was still enjoyable to sit out on the lanai and enjoy the weather, even without a view. The location was wonderful - it was a very short walk to Waikiki beach, stores, restaurants, and whatever else we needed. We even walked around and down to the beach at night and felt very safe. There were two computers in the lobby that we were able to use, which was very handy. They had some nice little extras as well, including a free massage and a free happy hour on Thurdays which was fun. We would definitely stay at the Aqua Bamboo again!

<Content>Value for money We stayed at the Aqua Bamboo Spa for four days lateJuly 2007, flew onto Kauai for two weeks and then spent four further days at this hotel mid August. The location was very good; a couple of blocks from Waikiki Beach/3 minute walk. Lobby and reception staff very pleasant. For our first stay, we had a family room on the fourth floor, then a family room on the fifth floor for the second stay. Both rooms overlooked the street. The room on the fourth floor had a separate bedroom and two twins in the living area with a kitchenette area and bathroom. On the fifth floor there was a futon and rollaway bed in the living area. We prefered this arrangement as the rollaway could be stored away in the main bedroom and the extra space was welcome. Additionally, this particular room was more up-to-date with a better quality kitchenette area. With both rooms (fourth and fifith floor) water temperature of the shower wasn't that easy to get correct. The biggest problem of both rooms was the noise from the street (even with the patio door shut tight) and the air-conditioning units. Unfortunately, we were told that these family rooms were only on this side of the building. There is, of course, a spa but we didn't use it. There is a small, but nice swimming pool with chairs and tables, sunbeds etc. This is a great area in the mornings to snack on the complimentary continental breakfast consisting of fresh fruit, muffins and fruit juice. There is also complimentary coffee available 24 hours. To conclude, this is a very pleasant small hotel, convenient for the beach and, for a family of four, much better value than going for two rooms. Just be aware that it is noisy!

<Content>Fantastic Location and staff Lovely lobby and pool, at first we were disappointed by the rooms and linens, (we are used to a higher thread count) but the staff and location made up for it. (we were hardly in our rooms anyway) Nice little breakfast of fruit and rolls every morning and a lovely little cocktail party. If you hate traffic you may want to ask for an off the road room. We played hard so slept well even with a road side room. Pay-Parking is limited at the Hotel, we did have a rental car and although pay parking is available nearby it is pricey and we were able to find free spots 4-5 blocks away. We would rebook.The Van Dams

<Content>Huge room, minutes from Wakiki Beach We ended our Hawaii vacation with an overnight stay in Honolulu after having spent nearly two weeks on Maui and the Big Island. The Aqua Bamboo was a welcome way to reintegrate back into city life.Having stayed in boutique hotels before, we were expecting a tiny room. Our deluxe suite on the ninth floor (which I booked after finding an online deal at the hotel's site) was huge: large bathroom with jacuzzi tub and separate shower, a small kitchenette with seating for two, small tv area with full-size pull-out couch, office space with desk and bedroom with king-sized bed and flat-screen tv. The room had also three, city-facing balcony spaces: an outdoor seating area outside the kitchenette, a large outdoor space outside the living room and a smaller balcony outside the bedroom. Much more space in our room for the discount price than what our friends paid for at a big-name hotel right across from Wakiki Beach -- and we were about a 3-5 minute walk from them!If you look closely, you can tell the Bamboo is an older hotel that has been renovated but it is a comfortable, friendly place. Small, cozy pool area out back, tropical/Thai-inspired lobby lounge and rooms, free in-room internet and wireless internet in lobby or free computers (30 min. limit). Free breakfast with danishes, fruit, juice and coffee daily in the lobby. There is a small spa next to the pool also.All in all, we were thrilled with our brief stay at the Aqua Bamboo and it made us wish our vacation was just a few days longer.

<Content>Great Family Vacation Our trip was planned 5 months in advance online so we were able to see what the hotel looked like,and what was offered.When we arrived for our stay we were happy to see that all of the research and online photos were exactly as we had hoped.Our family suite was smaller than we had expected,but it was clean and comfortable.The folks at the front desk(morning noon and night) were amazing.The Thursday night cocktail party is not to be missed;the BAMBOOZELSwere wonderful.We were treated very well and our kids had a vacation of a lifetime.We would be more than pleased to stay at theAQUA BAMBOO  SPA in Waikiki again. ~MAHALO~The Sleepers

<Content>Needs some changes, but would recommend I was pleasantly surprised about some very basic amenities which other hotels don't offer. It was wonderful to have two computers available for usage 24/7. There was also coffee and tea available in the lobby 24/7. Between 7:30 and 9:30 a.m. there was free fruit, juice and some type of muffin or sweet bread each day. I hope that first time tourists know that this is a rarity.My room was kept clean every day! When there were times housekeeping forgot something such as toilet paper, etc. it was delivered immediately! I found a few small coakroaches in my room. The front desk offered to spray w/pesticide the next morning, but I opted instead to buy sticky traps at the local grocery store: though they weren't that costly, I was somewhat surprised that the personnel at the front desk didn't offer to reimburse me (perhaps they weren't authorized to). Many of us cannot tolerate the fumes from pesticides!Location of the hotel was great! Front desk employees were friendly and professional. Daniel was especially kind and helpful; though all staff was very kind and helpful including housekeeping.Suggestion: how about Pay Movies? My trip was mostly business, so when I returned to my room it would've been nice to have the option to purchase a movie to view. Overall, I enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would definitely recommend it to my friends and colleagues!

<Content>Loved it! I have been meaning to write this review. We stayed at the Aqua in October 2006 and were there during the earthquake. The staff were excellent. My only suggestion would be to have sufficient flashlights for each room on hand in case of a future emergency.Our room faced the Monarch but we had partial views of the ocean and the city. It was a bit noisy but the hotel cannot control that. If you are expecting the Ritz, you will be disappointed. We got what we were expecting. Although the room was worn and tired, we were pleased with it. The only problem we had was the bath/shower didn't drain very well. The pool area is very nice and we enjoyed how it felt like a little oasis from the city - the greenery surrounding the area just makes you feel like you're not beside a major road.We will certainly stay again, if we ever return to Honolulu.

<Content>Good deal at the Aqua Bamboo Overall a very good find. Great location and good price. We stayed for the first 3 days of our trip on the 9th floor with a view across to the ocean and the city and the hotel website did have the best prices. Loved the large LCD telly, free internet, free bananas, free newspaper, free local calls, coffee and water. Do be careful that when you check in you get a floor that you asked for. The second time we stayed there, we had booked a room on the 10th to 12th floors (anything from the 9th floor up is fine), but we were put in a 7th floor room.... not nearly as nice... but we took it as they were nice enough to allow us an early check in. And don't rely on an early morning call if you've got a flight to catch... we didn't get ours. Still, for the money and location, you'd find it hard to beat for a price around 100 dollars per night.Julian Weekes and Ranko Kojima

<Content>Disappointing United Vacations billed this as a four star hotel for an excellent price with fifth night free. We had arranged for two double beds, they tried to pawn off one of them as a roll away. The view was non-existent. The decor outdated, and clearly it had been a smoking room at one point because it was still stale.The pool area was pleasant enough, and the location was fine. Do NOT rent a large car if you plan on using their parking lot under the hotel. (United, by the way, had neglected to tell them that we had a rental car, so we parked a few blocks away the first night, at a sister property).Don't expect much out of the housekeeping staff, even with tipping nightly.If all you're going to do is leave luggage in the room, it's OK, because of its location, but keep your expectations low. The promo photos look NOTHING like the hotel rooms.

<Content>Prepare yourself for the worst mattress in Hawaii We arrived expecting this hotel to be a bit dated and pretty basic but had chosen it because Lonely Planet had recommended it highly. We were a bit disappointed. The decor is extremely outdated, the shower was poor, but the worst thing of all was the bed - it was absolutely appalling! I literally ended up sleeping on the floor for 3 nights in a row and my hips and back were aching during the day as a result.It seems bizarre that they would put flat screen TVs in each room but not replace the beds.There's some good parts to this hotel but don't expect much.

<Content>I will be booking the Bamboo again for sure My boyfriend and I just returned from a 5 day stay at the Bamboo. We were lucky to get a room where the kitchenette area was very spaciousand far from the sleeping area. The view was from the side and of thenext door apt building but it didn't bother us. We didn't have any lanai furniture, but it was easy enough to bring the kitchenette chairs outside. The kitchenette sink was cracked needed replacement, though. But, we didnt need it anyway. Our favorite part of the room were the LCD TV and the robes that they provided. The pool and hot tub were also great, very quiet. The cabanas were tucked away and we even fell asleep there in the early evenings a couple of times. The hot tub was really small but it wasn't too busy so we didn't really have to wait for it. Our flight home was in the evening so i was very happy that the front desk staff was able to lock up our luggage for 6 hours without any extra cost.I would stay at the Bamboo again based on the location alone. Waikiki and Kuhio beach are right around the corner (the Duke statue is just right there). Also, Kuhio Ave is filled will great restaurants and bars that are easy to walk to.

<Content>Adequate for the price The hotel was not quite as I expected after booking a room from the website. My 3rd floor room did not look like the room pictured online, and the furniture was worn. The kitchenette had no microwave and was immediately next to the bed. The room had a great view into rundown apartment units merely feets away. Parking was very sparse, and I had to park across the street for the first 3 days. However, service was wonderful, and the hotel provided for my basic needs during my 10-day stay, though nothing more. Upon my request, a microwave was provided. The amenities were nice, including the large flat screen TV and the high speed internet. The continental breakfast was more of a morning snack consisting only of juice, muffins, and fruit. Finally, the spa and spa services are very limited. I recommend booking your spa date at a larger hotel; the prices will be comparable.

<Content>Will be back next year for sure!!!! The representative at the front desk treated us like family; we felt at home from the 1st moment. We were offered flowers for my wifes hair, and fruit while we checked in. I loved the comfortable beds and the nice bathrobes for us in the bathroom (so, nice, I purchased one to bring home). Our housekeeper greeted us with true Aloha spirit, each and every morning, never saw her without a smile. The Bamboo serves a continental breakfast and every Thursday evening they offer the Managers Cocktail party, and I might add, you just have to try the Coconut Bamboozle! The pool area is cool and relaxing with tropical plants and a waterfall. They offer a spa area, which just put the finishing touch on my trip.

<Content>Perfect pick! I was lucky to be able to stay at this hotel for my prom night. It was a very comfy hotel that offered everything i could possibly think of. Spacious room, a bathroom with a tub/shower, kitchenette that happened to be perfect size with every ementity, two twin beds, and on top of that another master bedroom. The hotel is in a conviniant location located in the busy center of Waikiki. Another plus was that parking and check in and out service was fast and easy! It was a friendly and comfortable atmoshpere. I felt very welcomed by staying at the Aqua Bamboo. I'll definitely be looking into staying there again and also telling my family and friends about it! -Natasha David

<Content>Great budget hotel I stayed at this hotel from May 17th-24th with my boyfriend and another friend. We had a one bedroom suite with a kitchenette which was great for preparing breakfast sandwiches on several occasions and storing beverages in the full sized fridge. The lobby of the hotel is very nice and comfortable with places to sit and read, relax or use the internet. The pool was nice, although it closes at 10:00pm and the hot tub was barely big enough for the three people in my group to fit in at the same time. There are some nice loungers by the pool and even cabanas with nearly full sized beds that give it a spa feel. However, not many people hung out around the hotel since the beach is just a few blocks away. This was a great location for walking around day or night with easy access to the boardwalk and major shopping areas in Waikiki. It was also close to restaurants and nightclubs and there is a full size grocery store just a couple blocks away. Overall, a one bedroom suite for three people including air from Seattle booked for $500 p/p was a steal, but don't expect anything fancy (or even Motel 6 quality) in the rooms themselves. I wasn't disappointed though because we hardly spent any time in the room except for sleeping, bathing and the occasional meal. When looking at the website, 1 bedroom suites go for $177+, which we paid less than half that price.... my suggestion, book through a different site to get a package deal because this hotel is not worth paying full price for.

<Content>Our hotel room was robbed! My first visit to Hawaii was absolutely terrible as a result of our hotel room (penthouse suite) was robbed on our first night! Fortunately for my family and I, we weren't in the suite when the robbery occurred. All of our valuables were stolen (i.e. laptop, two GPS', iPod's, family jewelry, handheld game systems, etc.). I'm curious as to why only these items were taken when there were flat panel TV's, DVD players, and CD players in the rooms that were capable of being taken also. When we brought the robbery to the attention of Aqua's staff, they appeared as if they could care less. Being the hotel's first robbery, I would expect to see embarrassment, remorse, sympathy from the hotel staff and MANAGER. NOTHING. Were were left to fend for ourselves. That same night, we left immediately and headed straight to the JW Marriott where we were treated much better. Be forewarned. Things are not what they appear to be at this hotel.

<Content>We were disappointed! We had a bit of expectation about the Bamboo based on the reviews here and the pictures on their website, and so we very were much let down when we arrived at the room in person:- Our room (superior studio?) was small and very basic. - There was a kitchette right next to the side of my bed literally. I was staring at the sink and fridge sitting on the bed. - There was no lanai.- The bathroom was old and not as clean as could be.But what made us leave the Bamboo the day after we arrived (instead of staying for the next 6 days) was that the tub didn't drain well, even after we took off the drainer and exposed the pipe entirely so that water could drain better. It didn't. Bath water sat in the tub for a very long time. Two people will not be able to shower back to back without standing in a tub full of cloudy water.The saving grace for the Bamboo was its staff and people. Everyone was courteous and so nice. And the lobby was much better looking than the room we were in.

<Content>Do NOT Believe the Pictures We arrived at the Aqua Bamboo at the designated check in time and were made to wait over an hour before our room was ready. When we went up to the room, the place was filthy. We peeled back the sheets and discovered hair and sand in the bed - as though the bed covers had simply been pulled over, rather than washed and remade. There were also cockroaches on the floors and when in the bathroom, the soaps had been used already and the toilet did not appear clean. We asked to see another room, and were told that we could upgrade our room for an additional charge. The upgraded version was simply a larger version of the first room. We were extremely dissappointed as the hotel was nothing like the brochure pictures had represented. We did not end up staying at this hotel, we were able to call the company we booked the hotel through and they found us another hotel.

<Content>Way better than expected! I did a lot of research before picking Aqua Bamboo . . . mostly on the internet, but after narrowing to two, I called a wholesaler . . . [--] and spoke to Hermine . . . she had been to both locations and suggested Bamboo . . . it was less expensive, better managed and better location for the money.She was right on all counts! We stayed in room 906 . . . not a huge room, but 3, count'em, 3 balconies. Sit up in bed and look through the sliding door at a decent (slightly obstructed) view of Waikiki Beach. The room has a small but functional kitchen, a comfortable queen size bed and a 32, cable fed, flat-screen TV. We figured out that room 1106 would have an even better view with about the same layout for the same advertised price.The room also overlooks the pool area and some of the nearby shopping areas . . . it is on the quieter side of the hotel away from Kuhio Street.Breakfast was muffins, fruit, juices and coffee . . . fresh and enough to get your day started. They also have apples on the counter all day, every day. Location . . . turn right out the front door, first corner (50') turn right, go two blocks, cross onto Waikiki Beach . . . 74 seconds without running!Now the you-get-what-you-paid-for . . . the shower could use one of those curved shower rods as it is a little narrow and the shower head sticks from the wall at 5'6. . . I'm 6'2 . . . The a/c sticks through the wall and runs fairly loudly all night . . . it tends to freeze-up and then starts to crackle as it is deicing itself. If the sound was just consistent it could have been good white noise to drown out the motorcycle noises. Instead, we left the sliders open for cross ventilation and turned the a/c off at night.The staff is absolutely delightful! They always went one step further than they had to . . . even telling me the FREE internet computers were right around the corner!!!After 3 days at this hotel, my company shifted us over to the Sheraton Princess K two blocks away . . . At twice the price of the Bamboo, we were on the 19th floor and the view of Waikiki Beach is unblocked . . . but for personal service at a reasonable price, Bamboo is hard to beat.

<Content>Great Experience My experience at the Aqua Bamboo was wonderful.The accomodations were very clean and the room was overlooking the pool. Beautiful facility.The staff was very professional, courteous and helpful.I couldn't have asked for a better place in which to stay when I made this visit.This hotel is across of the street from the public transportation therefore no car is necessary. Hawaii's public transportation system will get you where you need to go.All in all a Great Experience!

<Content>everything is good so far at the bamboo Booking our trip online, just two days in advance of leaving, Iwas a little nervous about staying here. Didnt want to come all the way to hawaii, and be stuck in a miserable hotel...turns out I was nervous for nothing.The bamboo has a great location, and so far, the staff has been freindly and accomodating. Turns out that there is a lot of stuff within walking distance of the hotel, so thats a big plus also.For an extra 12 dollars a night, we were able to get a one bedroom suite with a seperate bedroom. Really, its like a studio apt. We wanted to make sure we could cook to try to cut down on food spending. Lil tip here....Groceries are very expensive here, so ..it may be cheaper to just eat out.The whole hotel is very clean, relatively quiet, and very small and intimate feeling. The pool area reminds me of a rich friends backyard. Small and cozy. very comfortable. It is shaded though most of the day so sun lovers only have a few hours in the early day. The rest of the time mostly warm breezes but no direct sun.The pool furniture is excellent, the pool water clean, and the hot tub was even warmer than most hotel hot tubs. Theres even a BBQ grill available for guests use. Our room is pretty comfortable. AC works good, 32 inch flat screen tv, coffee maker, full size microwave, two burner cooktop, ICE cold fridge, futon coffe table, dining table for 2, queen sized bed in bedroom, plenty of closet and dresser space, safe, tub and shower, and much more.The only downsides so far........Laptop will NOT fit in safe. Hate leaving it out. Most theft occurs not from the housekeepers themselves, but Probably from other guests while they have yourdoors opened for cleaning.The hotel does NOT have wireless internet in the rooms..It is possible to get a wireless signal from our fifth floor room, but it isnt from the hotel. They do have good ole fashion wired ethernet though..Just make sure you bring a cable. They have wireless in the lobby, but not in the roomsAll of the one bedroom suites face the street(kuhio) and the other reviewers arent kidding when they say it is noisy. I found myslef just checking to make sure the doors were closed because it is so noisy, I just knew they had to be open....Other than the noise from the street (which isnt the hotels fault) Everything is ok. we still have three more nights here so I'll write a more detailed report when we get back.Aloha

<Content>Enjoyed the stay at the Bamboo I stayed at the Aqua Bamboo from 10th January 2007 for six nights with my colleague on a conference/holiday. We found the staff friendly and helpful on arrival and instantly liked the laid back style of this hotel. (We have vast experience of hotels of all stars around the world). The room was compact but comfortable with everything we needed, i.e. coffee maker, toaster, fridge, safe (free to use). As we were on Kuhio we expected a little noise but our side room was quiet and comfortable with morning sun on the balcony. Room cleanliness was good with minimal staff intrusion on our privacy. The pool terrace breakfast of fruit, muffins and tea/coffee was just right for a start to the day. The hotel location was superb, just a few minutes walk from everything you needed, be it coach trips, restaurants, shops, entertainments etc. It's not four star, but it's a great place to stay to enjoy Waikiki without paying top dollar for flash that you just don't need. I would go back again and be happy with my choice.

<Content>A great value for what you get I stayed here with my mother and sister for a little reunion and found, for the price, it was a great value. We first stayed in a room on the street side and you'll need ear plugs it's so noisy from the traffic and the bus stop on the other side of the street. We requested to be moved to the other side of the building and were very happy with the room. Both rooms were clean (didn't see a single roach), if a bit rundown, but you can see where the hotel is really trying. The lobby and pool are very pleasant. I actually preferred the pool to the beach just because it was so quiet and relaxing. It's a great little location, only two blocks from the beach and within a few blocks walk from everything else. Tons of great shops and restraunts nearby. My only wish is if they would put a microwave in the rooms.

<Content>I loved it and you can't beat the value for the $$ Been to HI a dozen times and this was hands-down the best low priced hotel I've stayed at. People who slam this hotel are just pampered and silly, and the sort of folks who go to HI to sit in a hotel room 24/7. Clean, well maintained, super location on Kuhio, easy walk to everything, easy access to public transport. Front desk staff were charming and graciously upgraded me to a suite. Nice fluffy towels, clean bathroom. I was there during the earthquake and the hotel staff performed professionally and with great patience. There are 17 underground parking spaces. Forget about a car. I took very convenient shuttle service to the hotel from airport ($15 roundtrip). If you should need a car for a day trip, there is a car rental place two doors down from the Bamboo (prices start at $12 a day and go up). The free breakfast packs in the morning are a nice touch (a snack, really). I put mine in the mini frig and munched on the muffins later in the day.

<Content>Just Good Enough We spent 4 nights at the Aqua Bamboo. Overall, we would say that it was just adequate. We certainly wouldn't recommend it for honeymooners, but it would probably do for the casual vacationer who checks their expectations at the door.Pros:-Good location, 2 blocks from the beach-Nice views-Lovely pool and hot tub area (tranquil when no kids are present)-Free internet in room-Spacious rooms with comfortable bedsCons:-Quite dated looking, rooms need update-VERY slow service-Terrible, tiny, overpriced underground garage; spots are so tight you're likely to damage your car (get rental insurance!)-Kitchenettes and bathrooms are aged and gross-Ridiculous breakfast, insultingly small amount of substandard food (ours was delivered late every morning)

<Content>Good value My sister, her 3 month old son, and I stayed at this hotel for one week in August and we were very happy with our experience. We decided on the Bamboo because of the availability of the kitchens with microwaves  refrigerators - traveling with baby is not always easy and we wanted to be able to wash  warm bottles, etc. quickly and easily. My sister and I have stayed in all types of hotels - from crappy pensiones in Europe to 5 star hotels in the US and S. America - we figured the point of a trip to Hawaii is to go to the beach/pool, not to spend time in our hotel room. But traveling with a baby does bring up extra concerns...While the Bamboo is by no means a 5 star property, it certainly is a very good value for the price. The staff is super friendly and helpful! A couple of tips:-if you want a microwave, be sure to call ahead and request one-also call ahead to reserve a parking spot. And, yes, it costs to park, just like in any good city. Also, just like any good city, parking is at a minimum and spaces are small. If the hotel is out of spots, you can park at the hotel next door for a few dollars less.-you can get internet access in your room or on one of two computers in the lobby for a small fee-the spa is small (it only accommodates one person or one couple at a time) but it's easy to get appointments and the treatments are good and very well priced.-the pool area has been nicely upgraded and is great to hang out at (we loved the covered cabanna areas for keeping baby out of the sun!) great lounge chairs and plenty of fresh towels in the lobby (and no annoying towel check out)-room was large and simple. we weren't thrilled with the rust on the tub or kitchen sink but the place was thoroughly scrubbed and super clean (and considering the price of the room, we easily lived with the rust for a few days)-breakfast was nothing fancy but just fine and it was nice to have it brought to our room or at the pool (the coffee maker in the room was great too)-we booked a deluxe room - it was on a corner, had a great view of the pool and 3 balconies! The kitchen was in a seperate room and included a small table and chairs.-Kuhio street is filled with ABC stores, restaurants, etc., Super short walk to the beach and less traffic than Kalakaua Ave along the beach. Kuhio is great for snacks, souviners, etc. We would buy lunch at the ABC store and bring it back to the hotel pool or beach almost every day.-There is no hotel restaurant or poolside service but there are tons of places just around the corner for dining, refreshments.-We really liked the notebook in our room where other visitors had recorded comments/memories of their stay in Hawaii at the Bamboo - it was a very sweet and touching addition to our room.This place is a good value for the price. We felt very well taken care of and were happy to spend our money on other fun stuff than on an expensive hotel room that we wouldn't be spending much time in anyway!

<Content>Do not believe the website pictures Just returned from Hawaii and stayed at the Aqua Bamboo and Spa. Caution: The pictures on the website is false. Every guests that we came in contact with complained about the website advertisement compared to the real thing.The first room had roaches crawling around. The staff issued us a new cleaner room with a two hot eye stove top and no microwave. The parking garage with maybe ten slots at the price of $15 per night is awful. This hotel has twelve floors and only an average of ten slots parking garage. Also, the garage is awkward and can possibly wreck the car if not careful. The space is not adequate to pull in or back in. The continental breakfast for two people is a one tiny muffin, coffee, two Hawaiian can drinks (not even 100% fruit juice), and two yogurts. On a positive note, the staff is extremely friendly, Kuhio Avenue has a lot of restuarants and stores, and the walk to the beach is only two blocks.

<Content>Very disappointed I was originally excited about booking this hotel. On the website we booked it on rated the hotel as a 4 star, which is too generous. I would rate it about 2 if that. The hotel was hard to find. If you blink you might miss it. The only thing good about the location is its very close to the beach and shopping areas. I wouldn't have mind the parking fee if they had adequate parking. The parking for the garage probably holds about 10 economy cars if that. If you need additional parking there are two other places to park, one right next to the hotel and the other across the street. The first day the lady at the desk said we had to park at the hotel parking garage next to it which was $12 a day. She failed to tell us that the hotel would not let us use their hotel elevators or stairs to get down to the street, so my wife and I had to walk down from the 5th floor the same way we came up.The room was not well kept(better rooms at the Bates Motel). The bedspread was stained with i don't know what? We did have a pretty good view of the water though. The best part of our stay was the continental breakfast they serve to your door every morning was very good.All in all not a great stay. Will not stay again.

<Content>loved it, great service checked in July 19th - 26th. Reserved a one bedroom w/ full kitchen. Were allowed to upgrade room. Yes the rooms are on the older side with furniture outdated BUT the rooms are clean and the staff is fantastic. We asked tons of questions they answered all of them gladly. Breakfast is fun delivered to your room - coffee, can Hawaiian juice, yoghert, sweet rolls too. Saved us lots of $$ though we also brought cereal and bought mild and bread at the grocery store. Pool was small but clean and it is salt water, Water fall makes it relaxing, lounge chairs have comfy padding, tranquil area. Lobby is nice, quiet and the free apples were a hit with my kids. Walk to beach is only a few minutes, ABC stores out every turn, close to lots of places to eat (don't miss the plate lunch around the corner - across from the Pacific Monarch) Street noise is loud as previously mentioned but does quiet down when The Bus stops running. Never saw street walkers - EVER! Would recommend to families, singles not sure about honeymooners though....... Free internet is great too.

<Content>Great location, the rest is not so good Just returned last night after a week at the bamboo. I'll keep it brief and to the point.CONSThe bathroom smelled of urine, the room of mildew. FREE Breakfast consists of a tiny muffin, a can of hawaiian soda or iced tea, and a yogurt. The pool is tiny, the hottub very intimate if more than one person is in it. The balconies facing the street are so small your knees rub the railing sitting on the bench. Kuhio Ave is rife with prostitutes and drug dealers after dark.PROSBeds are comfy enough, only 2 blocks from Waikiki beach. Massage services was a good value. Don't throw away the Diner's Club coupon book they give you, you will save a lot of money at great restaurants and attractions with it. High speed internet was free (in the room, not in lobby).ADVICEReserve parking ahead of time if possible. Very limited parking spaces, you don't want to park 2 blocks away.Probably not the worst budget hotel in Waikiki area, but substandard.

<Content>A Little Short on Comfort This hotel oversells itself. It describes itself as a spa and newly renovated. I disagree. It looks like it got a make over at a yard sale. We had a studio unit with kitchenette. Hot plates no microwave. Extra small coffee pot. Only one nightstand on one side. Hot water valves working improperly left us fiddling with the temperature to avoid getting scalded. One towel per person. The TV was an old model with limited channels. Internet access through ethernet cable. Parking is available in garage on 1st come first serve basis. Only 8 stalls available to the hotel. Barely get out of your car squished together type parking. They charge you $15.00 a night. The staff is a little sour. I felt a little jipped. The pool area is nice but it looks much better on the website than it actually is...Thought you should know...

<Content>Loved it I reserved this hotel w/ the recommendatio of a travel agency. I asked for a hotel convinent to Wakiki, clean and w/ budgeted price. However, after I read several reviews on this web site, I was really worried. I wanted to change my reservation but I paid the package in full already.  I got to the hotel on 6/22. Let me tell you, what a relief. I booked a suite and was upgraded to the delux suite. Not only the room is big, clean but it is very nice. The bedroom and kitchen is very nice w/ modern furnitures, The bathroom comes w/ a big jacuzzi tub and a shower. The bathroom is not sparkly clean but it's clean. The kitchen shows some ages but everything you need is there and works. Oh, We have one small patio facing the side of the buiding and one big patio ( as big as the room) facing the street. The room number is 904. My son loved the patio. it's the best thing to the room. You get to sit outside enjoying the city in the morning and night.  I saw 3 ants and 1-2 very small cockroaches in the kitchen. I know, I know. Cockroaches! Let me just tell you my friend paid closed to $ 300 staying @ Wakiki sheraton for a O.K. room facing the ocean the same time we were there. The first thing she saw when she walked in the room were cockroaches. She was furious. She called the front desk. They told her to chilled down and stated that it's normal to have cockroaches and ants in Wakiki because of the weather. And her room and patio was much smaller than ours.  Some people complained about the continental breakfast. Hey, at least they offered it. This is the place where a head of lettus cost about $ 1-2 dollars and a bottle of 1 L water is $ 1.50 depends on where you go. They give you one piece of pastry and one haiwaii drink for each person staying the room. I don't eat the pastry but mine family did. It would have cost us $ 5-8 dollars each day had we have to buy them ourselves. They also have coffee and tea in the lobby.  The swimming pool is new and nice. The staffs are extremely nice and helpful.The housekeeper comes every day. Sure, the room is kinda noisy because there is so much traffic in Wakiki. But it comes w/ location. The hotel is 1/2 miles from the beach. If you want quietness in Oahu, you have to stay in the Turtle bay hote in north shore. I live in LA, the traffic in Wakiki is Comparable or worse than LA. There are about 10 ABCs stores w/ in 5 mins of walking distant. Yes, the parking is $ 15.00 per day. But you get to park downstairs. The lobby isn't the 5 stars hotel setting it's very nice. I have to say that I was really happy w/ the room. My friend paid $ 300 for a night for a hotel w/ luxury lobby and ocean view but the room was stinky small. I paid under $ 180 for a delux suite w/ big patio and full kitchen. We would denifitely stay there agiain.

<Content>It was great I had a good time at the Bamboo.. The staff was very nice and helpfull.. At first I was uneasy about staying at this hotel. By looking at the pictures that other people provided.. The hotel was not the best but the room was clean. Housekeeping came in everyday and changed our bedding and gave us new towls in the bathroom. They did a very good job with keeping the place clean.. No the hotel is not up to date but it was nice.. It was close to everyting food the stores and the beach.. What more can you ask for when everything was in walking distance..There was not that much street noise.. But I feel if u wanted to go to quiet island you should have went to Maui.. So I disagree with all the negative reviews that I read before I expierenced the hotel for myself.

<Content>The Bamboo was Great! What a great little hotel! The lava rock fountain pool is surrounded by tropic decor which was relaxing and refreshing. The location it fantastic, block and half to Waikiki beach, tons of places to eat and shop. My room was on the 12th floor facing the ocean which gave us a great view. Make sure you don鈥檛 have a room facing the street side it will be very loud being the hotel is set on a main street. My room had a microwave and refrigerator which was nice being they bring you a continental breakfast every morning. The spa is nice and the front desk people are very nice and helpful. The only bad thing was the small full size beds; otherwise you can鈥檛 beat the value the Bamboo offers. I would stay here again鈥?br/>

<Content>Great Location for Budget Minded Traveler Had the priviledge of staying at the Bamboo on a recent vacation to Honolulu. The hotel is clean and well managed. The front desk staff was professional, attentive and courteous. The lobby and pool area are updated, well appointed and pleasingly decorated. Our room was small but comfortable...typical of most older buildings. You can't beat the location unless you want to pay 2-3x more for your room right on the beach. Top notch, elegant or fancy wouldn't be words I'd choose...but for a budget minded traveler looking for a clean place to sleep, bathe etc... you've got one. Run your air conditioner to kill some of the street noise that is abundant everywhere in Honolulu. The higher floor rooms obviously are better for this as well. Traveling by profession...I found this to be a very acceptible alternative to the high priced mainline hotels leaving more $$$ for the stuff you really want to do and see in Hawaii.

<Content>Great Value For everyone complaining about street noise and outdated hotel....You get what you pay for. You can have what you want at the Hyatt for $250 a night. I loved it for the price and location. There is street noise in every city, so you folks probably aren't from the city, didn't bother me.

<Content>Book somewhere else After reading every review and checking out the Bamboo's website pictures directly,I decided to book a week here.From my understanding the hotel had been completely renovated. This is not the case at all.The first room we were supposed to stay in smelled so bad and the kitchen was original 1960's tile and oven/range.We asked for a different room which was a little better but not much.The showers had mold growing in them.The balconies that we had faced Kuhio St. so it was noisy,not to mention they were so small we had to scale the railing just to sit on the bench.They were also doing repairs on the front drive so all day it was nothing but jackhammers going.We didn't find this out until the day the work started. The pool area is about the only nice feature of this hotel.I will never stay here agin or recommend it to anyone. Stay next door at the Pacific Monarch. Much nicer.

<Content>Nice value, great location We stayed here from March 11-16 and were generally pleased. We had a top floor room with a great view of the ocean.The furniture is all new and there is even a nice size LCD tv and mini-fridge in the room. Yes, the bathrooms were a bit dated but they were clean.The location is fantastic and only a 5 minute walk from Waikiki beach.The front desk staff are great and very friendly. The lobby and pool area are nice as well.I've read alot of the bad reviews and frankly can't understand where they are coming from. To stay someplace else that was appreciably nicer would cost $50-100/night more.I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

<Content>Aqua Bamboo Not For Anyone I would not recomend this hotel to anyone. We stayed here March1 to March14 2006 and I was a bit concerned because of other reviews I had read and I should have listened. Everything bad they said was true, from the stained bedding to the ants in the bathroom and the run down rooms. As a added bonus it was almost impossible to get housekeeping to clean our room. we were lucky if they did it 6 times while we were there. The only positive thing I have to say is the front desk staff were very pleasent.

<Content>not! for families We only stayed two nights and changed to another hotel. There was so much noise from the street that we could not sleep. Definitely not a place for children and families. Pool was shut down and one elevator was inoperative. Air conditioners were old window style units (very noisy). Do yourself a favor and book another hotel.

<Content>Not what I expected We booked for a family room...not what we expected with the pictures we've seen. It looked just like a suite. The price we paid was not worth it. I was very disappointed, our first time there w/ our families. Will not ever go back to the hotel.!

<Content>Not what we expected! On our 10th anniversary and first time to Hawaii and expected something better than this. Entrance from street is not that pleasing, lobby has very low ceiling, elevator very small (hard to fit us and our bags in the elevator at the same time!!!), room had new furniture - but was moist/mildew smelling covered with sprayed cleaner, bathroom was VERY dated with dirty tub/sink/toilet, window in bathroom was open and let in lots of bugs before we arrived, pool very small, etc. etc. etc. Stayed only first night then moved to Ohana East - 1 block away from Aqua but in a lot better location and hotel was fabulous! Sure it cost a bit more, but it was well worth it for the 14 nights we stayed in Hawaii.

<Content>Standard room - not so great, upgraded room - fantastic! First few nights at standard room - not very impressed, small, moist, mildew.asked to upgrade for just a little more money (forgot how much) and the suite we got was exponentially better - huge room, and much cleaner, great balcony, great view.location is very convenient.there's a pineapple/coconut candle in the lobby that smelled really good!

<Content>Bad with the Good In April of 2005 I stayed at the Aqua Bamboo for 7 nights. The room was dirty and needed cleaning and upgrading. After the initial shock and calling for housekeeping, we grew to love the location. It is 2 blocks from Waikiki beach. The pool area was nice and we had free massages from the poolside massage therapist. They barely accepted a tip. It was nice to sit by the pool in the afternoons. The continetal breakfast was either a piece of fruit or danish either in the room or poolside in the A.M. They have a free cocktail night called the Bamboozle and the drinks were great. It was a bargain..for the package deal we paid..but I'm not sure I would stay here again unless I had an upgraded, cleaner room. It is what it is...we had dinner and spent time in the much nicer hotel bars/lobbies near by. The location is great if you don't spend alot of time in the hotel.

<Content>Mixed feelings If this is a good value hotel in Honolulu, then it just goes to show what bad value Honolulu is as a holiday destination. For your money, you get a pokey little room overlooked by loads of other people in much nicer condos who are out barbecueing and having a jolly good time most evenings.Pool area looks nice enough and enough reception is deceptively alluring.'Breakfast' was served with a snarl and ladies of the night seem keen on this area.Last word - get into one of those condos next door or move on to someplace else.

<Content>Love it or hate it I agree with one reviewer that it's hard to rate this hotel. You'll either love it or hate it--there were good and bad points to this hotel. My husband and I stayed overnight on our way to the Big Island. We arrived in town early and asked if we could get an early check-in. They were very accommodating. And they gave us an automatic room upgrade (we got a partial ocean-view room with a kitchenette for $123/night). The staff was friendly. Upon arrival at the hotel, we made note that all the hotels in the area were showing their age. Still, the Aqua still seemed to try to make a unique impression. The location was great--a couple of blocks from the beach, a few blocks from the tourist center where the shops and restaurants are, near an ABC store (it sells everything from food to clothes and sundries) and next to a major bus stop. Since the Aqua is small, it seemed to be more quiet than other hotels we've stayed at, which we appreciated. The Aqua did a decent job on their recent remodel--a lot of the area hotels have not bothered--and it looked like they were still doing some work. But we did notice that the hotel still smelled like fresh paint. Our room was fine. It was roomy, had two queen beds that looked small, a nice sitting area with a sofa, and a tiny kitchenette. The Asian-inspired decor was nice. The bathroom was a decent size but dated. There was a small shower stall and a separate tub. Too bad they did not focus on removing the bathroom tile during the remodel. The shower tile and floor tile was cleaned, but looked grimy from long use. The kitchenette looked like it had been neglected in the renovating--the table and chair looked like it was from the Salvation Army, the counter looked unfinished. We had lots of windows and a lanai that offered a partial ocean-view, which was actually nice. The hotel does have a small but nice pool and a spa building, but we did not use them.This hotel is a step above a budget hotel, but it isn't what I call a treat, because of some of the age and grunge factors. And from the other reviews, it sounds like the quality varies from room to room. For the area and the price, we liked this hotel for a fairly comfortable place to stay a few nights while you are exploring the island. But if you want to treat yourself, pay the extra money for a nicer hotel along the beach.

<Content>Amazing upgrade at the Bamboo!! We stayed at the Aqua Bamboo for the first night of our honeymoon, since we were in Oahu for one day before flying on to the Big Island. Our stay was excellent... but I will say that it probably was not representative of the typical stay at this hotel. We had reserved a package that included a standard room, rental car and parking for about $189. We arrived at the hotel at about 2:30, and were told that our room was not ready. The check-in time was 3:00 so this wasn't a big deal. We wandered around Waikiki then returned to find that our room was the Ahi'i Suite. I don't know precisely why we got this TREMENDOUS upgrade, but I was very happy with the room! Here's why: it was 2,500 square feet (the entire top floor of the hotel), had a balcony that went almost all the way around the outside, it's own hot tub and sauna, washer/dryer, living and dining rooms, full nice kitchen, two bathrooms and two bedrooms (ours was a king bedroom, the other might have been a full but we didn't really go in there). When we returned from dinner, the manager had left us a bottle of champagne. Wow. Like I said, our experience might not be typical but was amazing.The location was great. We had a good time wandering around Waikiki. We had breakfast at the nearby Hyatt which was quite tasty. I can't comment on the maid services since we were only there for one night, but our room was very clean when we arrived.

<Content>Horrid Didn't actually stay here - it was too gross. Checked in, our room smelled like cigars, and was filthy. Looked at 3 other rooms, all of which were dirty and smelly. Old rickety elevator, gargabe in the halls, indifferent staff, strange layout to rooms, grimy bathrooms - not a nice place. Got all of our money back (very efficient I might add, like it happens all the time), and went to the Hawaii Prince, which is great. Listen to me - I know I didn't actually sleep here, but I looked at 4 rooms! All horrible!

<Content>Not bad We stayed for 7 nights. Our room had two double beds - not much else fitted in the room. I was a bit grossed out by the mould in the bathroom - on the ceiling and the shower curtain. The chair on our lanai was broken too - anyway, was too noisy to have the door open. The AC was wicked. It was noisy, so you'd turn it off, turn it back on, then it'd get too cold, and go round in circles all hours of the night! However, very friendly and helpful staff. Fantastic location - 3 mins walk to the beach, bus stop across the road, etc. Great pool area. I would probably insist that the room was cleaned better before I moved in.We had booked a bigger, nearby hotel for the second week of our holiday and this hotel stood out for its atmosphere (smaller is better), staff and pool area ... so it's a pity they didn't put a bit of elbow grease into the mould!!

<Content>Was OK for short stay Room was OK. Had a 1 bed room. Somewhat smaller than I had expected. My stay was for 12 days. Room became VERY SMALL after day 4. The smoke alarm in the room went off at 2 am in the morn. before I had a very important mtg at 7am the next morning. The girl at the desk had no idea what to do, but she did move me to another room so I could finish my sleep. The Bamboo is good for a short stay and if you dont plan to stay in the room much. Very nice walk to the beach and other area around the beach.

<Content>Cozy, good value During our visit to the Aqua Bamboo, we did a bit of exploration and investigation regarding this property. Since there are such different reviews for the Bamboo, we did a pretty thorough check. First, we had a pleasant experience, both with the room and the staff. We arrived at 11 am and found that check in time is after 3pm. During our wait, the front desk staff watched our bags and recommended that we check out the masseuse in the pool area. She was lovely and offered us a free 5 minute chair massage each - actually lasted much longer. She was so good that I booked a full hour massage later during our visit - also very nice.  The location of the Bamboo is 2 blocks from Kuhio beach (there is no actual Waikiki beach, the entire area is known as Waikiki) - turn right out of the front lobby of the hotel and go around the corner to the right. Next to the hotel on Kuhio Ave. if you turn left(going away from Diamond Head) is an apartment building which does not seem to have the very best quality residents. Next to that is a building with numerous small shops, including a tatoo shop, and a bikini shop. If you continue on around the corner in that direction, you wiill be well into the high dollar Waikiki shopping area. If you continue on Kuhio Ave. for another half block is a Denny's, several small shops and the back entrance to the International Marketplace. Across the street within the same block is a nice grocery store. Within a few blocks of the Bamboo is the Hyatt, the Princess Kaiulani, the Sheraton Moana Surfrider and numerous nice and affordable restaurants. There is a bus stop for the local bus ($2 to anywhere on the island)) across the street from the Bamboo.As far as the condition of the Bamboo rooms: We discovered that each room of the Bamboo is individually owned. Aqua only manages the rooms for hotel usage. Some of the rooms are occupied as a permanent residence - however as the residential rooms sell for over $250,000 the few full-time residents are good folks. Since each room is individually owned, the amenities in each room may differ slightly - most have kitchenettes, but only a few have microwaves. Rooms overlooking the street may be larger but also are noisier. Rooms on lower floors on the west side look right out on the not-so-nice apartments. Only rooms ending in 01 and 10 overlook the pool, and they have multiple balconies. Because of the pyramid shape of the building, the rooms on upper floors are smaller, but they have better views. Lower floors are cheaper, but have little or no view. We also learned that the management company is in the process of replacing the carpet and painting the rooms in the hotel pool, so any issues regarding carpet and paint (we didn't have a problem with either) should be resolved within the next few months.Because each room is different, it would be helpful for others if when leaving a comment as to the quality of the room you would advise which room number you are referring to.We have posted a couple photos of the room we stayed in (602) on this site. It was clean, simple, and had a decent kitchenette with refrigerator, microwave, cooktop, sink, dishes, glassware and utensils. We have stayed in many different properties, both better and worse, in Waikiki and our recommendation is this: If this is your once-in-a-lifetime visit to Hawaii, break loose with $250+ per night and stay in the Hyatt, Sheraton or Hilton and have a luxury vacation to remember. If you are looking for a basic clean property at a good price and a good location, the Bamboo is worth considering. I

<Content>Don't let the lobby fool you.....this hotel is horrible Nice lobby, but that's pretty much it. Our room was dirty, dingy, and ant ridden. Would not stay again if the hotel paid me.

<Content>fantastic experience! We booked this hotel based on ratings from tripfinder. We couldn't have been happier with our experience there. Our room was spacious, with 2 balconies. Front desk staff were always helpful and cheerful and gave us a choice of rooms. There were laundry facilities on every floor, which was very convient for our 8 day stay. Location was ideal, with great restaurants, bus nearby. A 4 minute walk to beach. We would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Okay but... My wife, daughter, and I stayed at the Aqua Bamboo for three nights (5/17-19) in two rooms. We had booked into the nearby Aqua Aloha Surf but when we arrived there they told us they were undergoing renovation and had upgraded us to the Bamboo. At the Bamboo we were given an upper floor room with a tiny view of the beach two blocks away if you stood on the tiny lanai (balcony) and looked between buildings. However the room was very small and had an overpowering deodorant like odor. We went back to the lobby and registered a complaint. While the staff was trying to locate another room, my wife and daughter went back to the Aloha Surf, examined the room we could have there, and came back and said the rooms offered to us there were even tinier than the ones at the Bamboo. We were then offered a room on a lower floor that was larger, without any odors and without any view from the lanai. The staff was extremely helpful and cooperative throughout our stay. The ice machine for the entire hotel shared an outside balcony spot on the seventh floor with paint, brushes and debris that was a hazard and challenge to overcome to get near the machine. As noted in earlier reviews, parking is extremely limited and we had to park next door for a fee (now $14) and hike up and down to our car. The second day we were able to obtain parking at the Bamboo (now $12 a day). In our opinion location was fine with great shopping and dining nearby. Ultimately, if you are looking for bargain rates for motel like rooms on Waikiki, the Bamboo is okay but if you want nice rooms go elsewhere.

<Content>nice lobby,dingy room The most impressing thing about this hotel was the ability to make a run down dingy building with run down rooms look so beautiful on the fliers and the website pictures! When my husband and I arrived to the hotel the lobby was nice(much smaller than it looked on the flier) and the staff was very friendly, our room was not ready and they watched our bags so that we could explore the city.  First impression of our room was old, run down and very quickly cleaned. The room was not at all like the picture. We made due and stayed here for 7 nights. We realized that the guests in the room next to ours actually lived there. Location was okay, only a short walk to the beach. Many restaurants and shops(including tatoo and very promiscuios clothing stores nearby). Breakfast was a nice lady who came to the rooms with stale pastries and a pitcher of juice mix pouring cups. Grocer nearby, fridge came in handy.I would recommend this hotel to those looking for good location for minimal price, who will not be spending much time in their room.

<Content>Horrible Check in took almost 2 hours-- ..Just give me a room that looks like what's on the internet! Sorry, we gave that room to your cousin. Tattoo parlor next door, ample hookers on sidewalk. Loud traffic. Lanai's-- two broken chairs, but not wide enough for your knees to sit. Moldy bathroom, burned and soiled sheets, cont'l breaksfast: 1 fruit and 1 sahran-wrapped old roll, sometimes delivered. Pool closed for few days of our stay. Pool area small and we were too afraid of ibby-jibbies to use hot tub! Elevator and halls smelled. Chipped tiles, stained carpet-- you name it. Filthy and very very run-down. I suspect the only time this hotel has guests is when all of Waikiki is sold out-- which was the case with us. The pro: (only one) staff can listen to complaints without becoming angry. The joke: when we were there the Honolulu newspaper featured The Bamboo as a neat new boutique hotel- along with a picture (you guessed it) of the one decent room rented to my cousin.

<Content>Not Fancy But Great We were first timers to Hawaii and had no idea where to stay(our travel agent didn't really either). So, I got on the net and started looking. We wanted a kitchette, close to the beach and main area. The reviews for this hotel were mixed but about average - for the price. So we booked this hotel for 13 nights. We were very impressed with our room (8th floor, looking over the pool and ocean). It was more than we expected. The bed was very comfortable.The breakfast every morning was great and delivered to our room(fresh fruit, muffin, roll and juice). Reading the reviews since our return in mid-March, it seems that the people who were there for short stays were in rooms on the lower floors and the street side, which probably accounts for the poor reviews.

<Content>Perfect! First time visitors to Waikiki we find this hotel on the internet. Clean rooms and hotel, nice staff, moderate designed rooms. Nice lanai, view to the beach, mountains and not noizy. Very nice pool area, and great price! Perfect location. We stayed at three diffrent hotels on our vacation and this was the best regarding the price - highly recomended! (warning for our second one atston waikiki beachside hotel, dirty, filty and moldy smelling rooms, and bad staff!)

<Content>Decent hotel  The Aqua Bamboo, surely a boutique hotel, which has its own flair and sophistication not to be subjected to high-rise hotels in Waikiki. I鈥檝e visited the hotel a few times and love the atmosphere I experience there. The pools size is typical to Hawaii鈥檚 hotels. The staff is friendly and tries their best to accommodate my needs. As I have gone through this website reviewing others comments on this and that about the hotel (and many more) one things keeps coming to mind. If any traveler makes a decision (to purchase a booking at any hotel) based upon 鈥渆ye-candy鈥?photos on the net then you are deceiving yourself. Every hotel from a budget to five-star rating will produce photos of their show rooms that look so dazzling, comforting and inviting that you dive into booking with that hotel. Marketing on the net鈥OL!In order for one to fully experience that hotel you must do some actual searching of your own based on many aspects, but not selling yourself on 鈥減hotos鈥?because you have no idea how long ago that was taken. Another point is that not everyone has the same tastes as yours when basing your decisions on others comments. I have heard a few people who are quite frankly 4- to 5-star clientele who have stayed in a 2- to 3-star hotel (unbeknownst to them as they were told it was up to par in their eyes) were so unhappy. An example is a Sheraton or Radisson client who booked at the Continental Surf. Clearly different star ratings but I think you will get my point. Not all hotels that claim to be in a particular star rating on the net will actually have that appeal.I鈥檝e found a few who claim to be a 2-star yet in actuality they are lower than a budget. You the consumer need to do the research. Leaving it in the hands of online sources or your local travel agent will not bring you a clearer picture than those who actually live and work in the area you are visiting. Of course we want the room of our dreams when we are traveling to a tropical destination鈥ven more reason to dig deeper. There are many options out there and you will never know all of them until you finally get off that plane and experience both the good and the bad of any area you visit鈥hey all have them any where across the globe. As for my travel desires I range from 2- to 4-stars gal depending on what I am looking for at that particular time period, but I won鈥檛 shy away from other choices (high or low) if the needs arises.My best advice to anyone traveling to Hawaii:1) Find discounted hotels (few out there)2) Be sure that anywhere you book that you aren鈥檛 locked in 鈥?meaning that if you aren鈥檛 happy with the choice you made that you can find another and be able to back out from the original one you set up3) When you travel anywhere鈥ick up on every known magazine and brochure to get a feel for what is out there鈥ou鈥檒l be amazed on what deals you can come across4) Call around and do some smart shopping鈥ind the best quality for the best price as you would when you鈥檙e buying items for your home5) Ask the locals in the area what they think when you are there6) You are your best judge鈥ake in the information needed鈥rocess them accordingly鈥ou do what is best for you and your family and don鈥檛 blame anyone for the choices you made

<Content>Bad Experience There were 6 couples of us that arrived on February 2nd with our Travel agent booking the rooms at Aqua Bamboo, being a big mistake on her part truly not researching the actual condition of this hotel and making it a very unpleasant experience for our trip to Hawaii. Upon arrival we should have all just left the hotel and moved elsewhere to much better accomodations but we all did stay in this Hell Hole as we were leaving on the 6th to go on the Norwegian Cruise Pride of Aloha. The rooms were very disgusting with carpet and drapes that appeared to have been there for many years and don't think they have ever been cleaned. The maids/housekeepers were very inefficient with their cleaning abilities. I only wish now that we had taken the time to pull up the reviews of other customers on this property before we arrived in Hawaii, but we all had faith in our travel agent that she knew what she was doing when she booked all of us in the hotel, but now is rather obvious she did not do her research for us to provide us decent accomations. I would never recommend this place to anybody.The blankets they had on the beds were disgusting and I really think they purchased them at an Army Surplus store. All in all this was a very bad experience for all of us staying in this hotel.

<Content>Horrible hotel Before we booked through a travel agent I took a look on the internet to see the hotel before making a final decision. The price was right but you never know. We based our decision on the internet pictures and they are totally misleading. They used a wide angle camera to make it appear the lobby was large and the guest room was probably the penthouse suite. Our room was small, filthy, smelly, and the bed was not a double it was a single with an extra foot added for width. Immediately, we went down to the front desk to get an upgrade and they didn't have anything available. We wasted two days of our vacation looking for a new hotel but everything was sold out due to the Pro Bowl. We were forced to stay there. Upon further inspection our bathroom had hair from the previous guests stuck to the wall. Mold everywhere and the light switches were grimey and the door jams, door knobs had finger prints all over them. The noise from the street was so loud my husband and I thought the sliding glass door wasn't closed. As we looked we noticed a large hole in the sheet rock in the corner of the room. We were up at five in the morning and didn't return until midnight just to avoid the room. The pool is not heated very small and the jacuzzi tub was out of service during the weekend. A tent at the beach would have been better than this place.

<Content>I am not fussy but this place was very bad!!! I looked at the reviews in Tripadvisor before booking and thought..okay..no palace but should be okay...wrong!!!! We paid over $120 a night for a very ugly, beaten-up 1 bedroom unit. After checking into a unit we asked to be moved, the dirty kitchen and cigarette butt in the middle of the floor didn't convey it was very clean. The hotel moved us to the 6th floor. This room was marginally better. The kitchen was completely filthy. The fridge was very dirty, old food and crumbs were in the cupboards, couch was very dirty with a big hole in it. Before using the fridge we bought a cleaning solution and cleaned it ourselves. The carpet was also very soiled. The bathroom had what looked like black mold or fungus all along the ceiling. The room smelled and the snot/hair mix on the bathroom wall was the last straw. The cleaning staff at this place should be ashamed. We were glad we were able to check out early and stay at the Iilikai. Using Hotwire, we had a 300% better room for the same price. The Iilikai made you feel you could relax versus the Bamboo. I don't understand what rooms people stayed in in previous reviews but both rooms they gave us were terrible. I will NEVER stay there again and I have stayed in so..so places before without complaint. I am not picky but for $120 you should be able to expect more...Stay somewhere else...do yourself the favour. I have never written a review before but felt compelled to help others by writing this one. The one good thing about the Bamboo is the lobby looks attractive and has some nice peices of Asian art/furniture. The staff were also friendly but didn't do much about the room situation.

<Content>deceptive photos and terrible maids! This summer my husband and I took our first trip to Hawaii, and since it was our first trip ever, we decided to stay at a nice hotel. After searching through the internet, we decided on the Aqua Bamboo, because it was depicted as a cute, boutique, hip hotel. Unbeknownst to me, this was the worst decision we could have made. The only thing hip about this hotel is the lobby, which you wouldn't want to hang out in for too long because ther is no restaurant or bar. Our room was large, but old, dirty, and poorly lit. The kitchen and bathroom had small bugs everywhere. The only thing worse than the visual deception at Aqua Bamboo would be the completely unattentive staff, whom not only never cleaned our room, but didn't even make our bed! One of the days we were in Hawaii, we took a jungle tour and returned to the hotel with some dirt on our shoes, which ended up scattered around the room. This dirt (not ground in mud - just clumps of dirt) stayed in the room for the rest of our trip. The room was never vacuumed - not once in a WEEK. The only time we had clean (not really clean - smelled bad, were thin, and had stains on them) sheets and/or towels, we had to ask for them - TWICE. Oh, and FYI - the building was being shown to potential CONDO buyers while we were there - which might be the reason they have done so much work in the lobby, and none in the rooms. In conclusion, Aqua Bamboo is dirty and poorly attended to, and far from the boutique they portray themselves as running. It's not worth your money - no, not even if it's that cheap. Go somewhere else.

<Content>Worked, but barely... We stayed at the Bamboo for 10 nights over the New Years holiday. I do have issues: maid service was horrible (found an old dirty diaper under the bed), they tried to bill me twice for a $400 partial payment that I had to dispute with the gentleman at the front desk (apparently my payment had disappeared, but they found it when I produced a receipt???), parking was a joke (especially for 12 dollars a day), I still have a large hold on funds even though my bill has been paid in full (apparently they can't release until 10 days are up, in case some other charges appear????), the guy that works the overnight shift was very unhelpful to the point of being rude, I asked why the kitchen had no microwave and was told they only had 15 and that I should have asked for one when I checked in (who knew?), the room had a very distinct odd odor, the bed was extremely uncomfortable, etc., etc., etc. However...I did not expect the Taj Mahal with the price that I paid...the location was excellent!!!!...the street noise was very bad, but the hotel can not be blamed for that (with the door closed and AC on, it really helped)....Kahea the manager was very pleasant to deal with, several other young woman that worked the desk we're very nice...they comped my in room safe fee....honored the original price for parking when it had apparently gone up on Jan 1 (even though the guy previously mentioned was unwilling to do so)....pool area was very nice...cool decor in the lobby....we felt very safe and welcome...free paper in the morning...comp cocktail on Thursday night...hot jacuzzi (but small)...very pretty property.Now the million dollar question, would I do it again? Probably not, but mostly because of the street noise. The hotel could kick the maid service up a notch, add additional microwaves and give the rooms and overall cleansing...but all and all it was nothing we couldn't deal with and again the location was unbeatable!I did check out a hotel called The Breakers on Beachwalk...about the same price, bigger rooms, VERY QUIET...we'll more than likely stay there next time. We travel with two children so we need a private room wherever we go. Frankly if it were just me and the wife, I would pass on both of these hotels and go with a beach front property (i.e. the Moana or Sheraton, but most of those hotels do not have reasonably priced one room suites w/ kitchens).I know I can be long winded, but I hope this will help someone. If you want a place to crash, with a great location, and you can deal with small but irritating issues...enjoy the Bamboo...if not...go somewhere else...Aloha!

<Content>Deceived When arriving to Hawaii we were a little lost. We finally found the right street and jokingly said oh my god what if that is the hotel, wouldn't that be the worst Well it turns out it was. The outside of the hotel is run down and dirty, the rooms actually have these air conditioning units that we call window shakers One of the balconies outside had a washer and dryer sitting on it. We decided to stay at the Hyatt down the street. We could see the hotel from our new room and let me tell you it looks worse from above. The hotel ended up charging us $450.00 anyways. After calling them about this I was told that I should not have judged them by the outside. This sounds crazy to me seeing that the outside is the first thing people see. I guess I will just have to accept that I got screwed and hope that my letter helps someone else.

<Content>Not very clean, also very noisy I decided to stay at this hotel because of all the good reviews... and despite some of the negative ones. I really thought it would end up being okay but the experience ended up being kind of disappointing. We got a room for $72 per night on Orbitz. I called a few days prior to checking in to see if I could get a room facing the courtyard. They couldn't guarantee that but the guy I talked to said he would make note of it. When we showed up to check in, they said that a room facing the courtyard was going to cost an extra $40 a night... the guy I talked to failed to tell me that. Instead of paying extra, we opted for a room on the side of the building. We could still hear the street noise no matter the time of day and had to leave the A/C on the whole time to drown out the noise. Also, even though the hotel tried to spruce up the decor recently, some of the decor was still outdated and dirty. The carpet looked really gray and dirty. And the shower curtain had orange mildew all over it. I felt really uncomfortable the whole time I stayed there. I think that when you're vacationing in Hawaii and want to be comfortable in your hotel, it's worth the extra money staying in a nicer hotel like the Hilton Hawaiian Village, Sheraton, or even the Double Tree hotel that I got for $50 a night on priceline. I used to live in Hawaii and I must say that their standards there are much lower... some of the places I lived in were old and dirty.

<Content>~~BAMBOO CHARM~~ Me and my best friend planned this trip for quite sometime, did some research and decided not to stay at one of those big fancy hotels on the sand. Instead we took a friends advice and found this place called Bamboo. The lobby was sooo cute and the staff greeted us with, as they say in Hawaii, much Aloha! I thought surely this cant be that bad. We booked for a $100 studio w/ 2 double beds. The room was clean and comfortable, and had a really unique feel if you ask me. I felt very welcome, not like the corporate giants we usually stay at, Hyatt, Sheraton. This was different, very CHARMING, we fell in love with the property, staff and met some really great people there as well. Well will come again, only difference, we'll stay a little bit longer next time, oh yeah, no more flying DELTA!! Dont pay any attention to the bad reviews, if you think you need a fancy schmancy room, book at the Sheraton and dish out the $$$$$, if you want something sweet  charming, for an EXCELLENT VALUE, go for the BAMBOO!! Hey that ryhmed:-)

<Content>Made my trip I have stayed at the Bamboo several times. Everytime I have stayed, I find the staff friendly and helpful, making me feel welcome and comfortable. The rooms have been comfortable regardless of the class. The hotel is in Waikiki and I still felt safe and like I could escape' the noise and hustle and bustle by entering the relaxing atmosphere of the hotel, it's quiet safe pool area, and the calming atmosphere of the rooms. Weather it's been a one bedroom or a suite, the rooms are a comfortable size with nice decorations, which have a spa-like Asian motif. My stay has always been very pleasant and made my trip to Hawaii more relaxing. If there was ever a question or a recommendation I had, the staff would reply with courteousness.

<Content>Aqua Bamboozled We stayed here durign our third vacation to Hawaii. The hotel has been renovated in the lobby and pool area with some flash additions like a flat screen tv above the check in area, but his seems to be where the money ended as all the rooms are osmewhat lackign in new decor. The decor is old, uninviting, dingy, and dirty especially in the cheaper 100 per night rooms. We were first shown a room that we had reserved but his was filthy and uninviting. When on vacation and seeign pictures that are pretty, you expect iot to be what it is represented as. Aqua Bamboo misrepresents itself. This essentially is fraud. We chose to upgrade for $30 additioanl per night to a suite which had a kitchen and better accommodations. Unless you are prepared to pay additioanl money for one of their suites, then head for some other hotel which probably will be cleaner, newer, and more interested in your welfare.

<Content>yuck!!! We stayed at this hotel recently. It was terrible. We had to wait 2 hours in the lobby for our room. We were in a one bedroom with a kitchenette. Room was small and very dirty. Food on counter and floor in kitchen and hair on floor in bathroom. Called down to the frontdesk and asked for someone to clean the kitchen and bathroom. Maid thought room was fine and ran the same cloth on the counter as she used on the bathroom floor!!!! I went to the lobby to ask for a different room. A clean room is not too much to ask for. Especially when you are paying $100 a night. I tryed to find another hotel to stay in but everything was full since in was over the 4th of July. They upgraded me to a suite but had to pay $50 extra per night. I am not picky. I stayed at the Coral Reef which is supposed to be a 2 star and it was fine. Only good thing about this hotel is the pretty pool and garden area. Will never, ever stay here again. Beware!

<Content>Hated it! Aqua Bamboo has a great location. That was the only perk of staying there. The room was dirty. I found the staff uneducated and rude. The pool was closed during part of my stay. I asked one of the staff member when it would open she said she didn't know since she just got back from vacation. The continental breakfast included a coffee, small muffin and an apple wrapped in plastic. The phone in the room was broken it couldn鈥檛 call the lobby directly and kept flashing that we had a message when we didn鈥檛 I was very unimpressed. I would never stay at this hotel again. Next time I will stay at the Hilton or the Hyatt.

<Content>This hotel is a joke! We did our research on this hotel (read the reviews here), so I knew that there was the potential for problems. We decided to give it a try. Overall, the stay was ok. Our fist room SUCKED. The Ohana Suite with the kitchen right next to the twin bed was not cute. I specifically asked for a room overlooking the pool, because I wanted to take everyone's advice. We were assured that those rooms were smaller than the one we were getting. Yeah right. We stayed in our cramped little room for 2 days. On the second day I just happened to be walking by the open door of a room on poolside, and boy was I surprised! It was light, airy, spacious, and a had a nice view of the pool. We instantly went downstairs and requested a move. We moved the next morning. We really enjoyed our new room. BUT this hotel had other problems. For one, the cleaning staff is a joke. By 4pm on our first full day, we had no fresh towels, our beds hadn't been made...no cleaning at all. We had been out and about all morning, and returned to the room for a quick outfit change and were going to head back out. Of course, while we're sitting there, the lady comes to clean our room. We asked if she could come back in about 20 mins after we were gone...you know what she said I'll be going home by then. EXCUSE ME? You had all freakin' day to clean our room! Needless to say, she didn't go home until our room was spotless.The second problem is that the pool was closed for 2 days for chemical cleaning. When we asked what arrangements were being made to offer guests other pool options, they pretty much said Take your --- to the beach. They did say we could use the pool at their sister property, but that was a $20 cab ride away, and of course, they were not offering shuttle service or reimbursement.When we checked out, they didn't ask how the stay was, ask us to return, nothing. I found the people at the front desk to be very frustrating and lacking in knowledge in several areas. If we had not changed rooms, I'm quite sure we would have tried to move to another real hotel. We will definitely NEVER stay there again. Oh yeah...I agree with what others have written about the so-called renovations. Clearly all of the money went to the 50 inch plasma TV and the marble flooring in the lobby. If they did anything to those rooms, their contractor should be fired.One last thing! We left on Thursday, but when we left there were signs posted that they were going to turn off the water to the entire hotel for the morning on the following Friday to do repairs on ONE ROOM. I've done a lot of traveling in my day...from various sorority functions to school conferences. I've honestly stayed in Red Roof Inns and Holiday Inns with better ammenities, cleanliness, and service then this place.

<Content>Great location, friendly staff Stayed for 2 days. Staff was very friendly and helpful with questions  directions. Rooms are small but were clean. Great location and good price. If you are looking for luxury this is not for you. If you want a reasonably priced room, located in the heart of Waikiki, can't beat it.

<Content>We were "bamboozled"...... Checked in for one night only. We paid for an upgrade pool view, but were unhappy with the room for various reasons. The other sliding glass door view was of someones dirty mattresses sitting on their balcony. The bathtub was full of rust stains and the windows in the bathroom were broken, thus letting in all of the warm air so the air conditioner was worthless. The carpet was filthy and had been patched in various places. The lobby looks great, but obviously all of the renovation went into the entry of the hotel. We felt the hotel was misrepresented on the site; it is not newly renovated and the interior of the room was very shabby. The location is convenient to many things, but it is not worth the money. We moved after one night for the remainder of our vacation to the Hyatt and we were very happy. Bamboo needs to be more honest about their hotel. We were bamboozled.

<Content>Would stay there again in a second! We stayed at the Aqua Bamboo for 14 nights and absolutely loved it! We were impressed by the excellent location of the hotel (just 2 minutes walk to the beach, a few minutes more to the intermational market place, a bus stop right across the street from the hotel). The Bamboo has a lovely, serene Asian decor. The pool area was wonderful -- fairly quiet, surrounded by palms, nice, comfortable loungers, and fresh towels for guests to borrow. Our room was very clean and comfortable: we had 2 double beds and a kitchenette with good sized fridge. We were able to save quite a bit of money eating most of our breakfasts and some lunches in our room. The staff was very friendly and accommodating!

<Content>Home away from home.... If you want a hotel that makes you feel right at home, Bamboo is the place to be. I stayed there with my family for a week and absolutely loved it. The staff there was excellent. They make you feel right at home. The rooms were equipped with everything we needed. The location was excellent as well. Block away from the beach, close to shopping, dining, activities. Tip: Be there at 5pm on Wednesdays. The General Manager, Joseph (whom is really nice by the way!) serves up their drink called the Bamboozle. And best of all, it's free! I would recommend Bamboo if you are looking for a more intimate property right in the heart of Waikiki. Thanks Bamboo!!

<Content>OK say at the Aqua Bamboo We stayed here for 3 nights (June 5-8). The room a studio superior with kitchenette, we got for $99 (regular $175). We booked by phone but the staff honored the internet rate. Next time we'll have to request the pool side. The street side was really noisy at night even when the lanai door was closed. But it was real close to the beach, parking was next door for $10/day. Try the Korean BBQ restaurant and shave ice store near the hotel. They were a good deal. The staff was really helpful.

<Content>Great value, nice decor We loved our stay at the Aqua Bamboo! Thanks to another tripadvisor posting we got a Studio Deluxe with a pool view, so we had a great view of the lovely pool area and it was quiet. The area wasn't seedy as far as we could tell. We were often walking around at night, but felt very safe. It's in the heart of Waikiki and very near the beach. We have no complaints about the room--the amenities weren't as luxurious as some of the bigger chains, but it was clean and nicely decorated. It was also great having a kitchenette and refrigerator. We really liked the hotel's decor--a very Japanese/Thai look. The staff were very helpful and nice--we'll definitely be back there. Generally it's a GREAT value for staying in Waikiki. (Note: mention the deal in the Honolulu Advertiser and they give you 50% off. Our deal was $89/night for a Studio Deluxe with kitchenette).

<Content>You get what you pay for We stayed here twice and enjoyed it both times. We decided on this hotel largely due to other travelers ratings (which were better at the time than they are now) amd enjoyed it enough the first time that we stayed there again when we came back 6 months later. Rooms are okay, they are clean. The hotel is in a prime location, walking distance to the International Market Place and Waikiki beach. I do reccomend that you get a room facing the courtyard and NOT Kuhio because the street noise is loud. For $79 a night, you get exactly what you pay for.I would definetley stay here again.

<Content>Okay for one night Although the Aqua Bamboo claims to have been renovated, I do not see where any of the money was spent inside the rooms. Their lobby looks fabulous and I suspect that that is where the money was spent. My husband and I were flying through Oahu on our way to Maui and booked a room here for the one night. Upon arriving, we were told that they had overbooked and we were going to be upgraded to a 'suite' at no extra charge. Also, their parking garage was full and we would need to park next door. I never tried to cook anything or use any of the kitchen appliances, but by the looks of them, I would have been VERY suprised if any of them worked. This hotel is located right on Kuhio Ave. and is VERY busy and noisy ALL night long. I could still hear music playing, people talking, and vehicles driving down the road at 4 a.m. This place may be okay if you plan to do like us and stay one night, but otherwise, I would spend a little more money and stay somewhere nicer.

<Content>Great hotel in Waikiki We stayed here over Easter weekend, with a group of 13. We had 3 rooms and had a terrific time. The hotel was very attractive with a far-east/polynesian theme. The pool area is great-on the ground floor with beautiful landscaping. The on-site massage was very relaxing. The rooms were ok, with comfortable beds. We had a full kitchen in one room, with minimal utensils however. We saved a bundle cooking breakfast and having most lunches in our room.The location was perfect-right behind the Hyatt hotel and two blocks from Waikiki beach. We did not feel that it was in a seedy area. It was in the heart of Waikiki!The staff was very pleasant and helpful. I think for the price, this was the best bargain we have found in Honolulu! We have been here many times and will return here.

<Content>Stay Away We stayed in Sept. 2003 and found the rooms to be run down and just plain dirty. Yellow dried liquid on bathroom walls and the kitchenette, well questionable at best. The air conditioner leaked onto the carpet. We changed rooms into a suite but it had a funny insulin type smell to it and was still not really clean. I recommend shelling out a little more cash and being satisfied instead of just settling on your Hawaiian vacation.

<Content>Seedy location You get what you pay for at this cheap hotel. The rooms are small, the staff are unhelpful and the location is seedy, that is unless you need the services of the street-walkers in the adjacent red light district. Then you may get more than you pay for!

<Content>Staff make the difference My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in february of 2004. We reserved a 'deluxe suite' and requested a pool/ocean view but none was available on check-in. Our room faced the street and had a double bed which was disappointing. The front desk called 5 minutes after we got to our room and offered us a new room the next night, with a king bed. We switched, the staff moved all of our luggage, and the room was this hotel's version of the penthouse suite: very nicely furnished, large, with 4 lanais that overlooked the city/mountains. A very nice accomdation. As other reviewers have noted, the hotel has a nice pool area and is rather spartan in amenities, but the staff does put out a good effort and the place is comfortable and the location is convenient.

<Content>One of the best values in Waikiki The Aqua Bamboo Hotel is recently renovated from the former Marc Hotel. The address is 2425 Kuhio Ave., local telephone 808-922-7777. Manager: Joseph Yamaoka. I author the Driving  Discovering Hawaii guidebooks and stay in Hawaii hotels at every price level. I gave the Bamboo an excellent rating because the price was outstanding, the room sophisticated and well laid out, and the service very efficient. There is a washer and dryer on each floor on the service balcony, much appreciated beacuse of wet and sandy towels and clothes. I loved the little pool area because it's of lovely design and usually I was the only one there despite a nearly full house. Free internet connections are located in the very cool lobby. Upper floors, as in any hotel, quieter than those nearer street level. I agree there is some shabbiness, strange considering all the efffort that went into the remodel. E.g.:the door to our room was very beat up, yet the interior was as attractive as many Hawaii hotels of great repute at 3 times the price. The Bamboo's lobby [with large plasma screen TV] is hip and fun, and in our room there are a lot of great features, including custom designed furniture, crown moldings, quality carpet, glass brick shower stall, a double sink curved vanity, slatted wood bathroom ceiling. With an official summer rate of $145 for the very spacious room [significantly cheaper on the internet], it includes a kitchenette without a microwave, a sitting area with TV, sofa and desk, a separate bedroom that is behind a louvered wood shutter wall, three sliding glass doors for great ventilation, a lanai, and the room is located high enough above the street not to be too noisy. The problems here were just cosmetic, but I filled out an opinion form my third day, and the problems were fixed, so high marks go to the Bamboo for quick response. The rooms are a very good value, tastefully decorated in a kind of Metropolitan Home magazine sort of modern Asian theme, and for my needs [computer, photo equipment, paperwork, my need to cook], just about perfect.

<Content>Had Better, had worse We decided at the last minute to fly to Honolulu over the Christmas break. While flights were no problem, there were very few hotels available anywhere in Waikiki. We knew nothing of the Aqua Bamboo but really didn't have too many other options. The hotel is a just a couple blocks away from the beach but, depending upon room location, you may not be able to see it from your room - our room looked directly into the hotel next door. The king size bed was really two twin beds pushed together. We considered moving to a room with two separate twin beds but the view was even less desirable than what we had. However, the room was clean (except for the refrigerator), the staff was friendly and the price was reasonable.

<Content>Did the job... We just came back from Oahu and stayed at the Aqua Bamboo for the second time. Both times we had very good service from the time we walked in the front door, till we checked out. It's nothing spectacular, but for us, it did the job and that was a place to sleep and breakfast in the morning. The rooms were kept up well, even though years of wear do show in certain areas. The compalints I've read from other previous guests sound too much like someone who is use to staying at The Ritz but not willing to pay the price. We'd definitely recommend the Aqua Bamboo to people on a budget and not into all the foo-foo that fancier hotels provide. I'd give them a B+.....

<Content>Ignore the critics Ignore the negative reviews! That's my advice. My wife and I just returned from Honolulu, yesterday, October 23. We stayed at the Aqua Bamboo Hotel for 16 nights and loved it. We had a great room overlooking the pool with two double beds, three lanais, and a kitchenette. The location is perfect with restaurants, the beach, food stores, bus service, etc.-- all easily avbailable. Of course there is street life, and some of it is unsavory, but that's what makes it fun, after all, these are real people living their real lives. And it's safe too, as long as you're not roaming the streets at 2:00am. A bonus at this hotel is that the people who run it are lovely, friendly folks. Search the internet, get a good rate, then book yourself a room (overlooking the pool) at the Aqua Bamboo hotel!

<Content>great hotel/great rate Was in Waikiki for work in June (I know, I know) and decided to stay on my own for a few days of va-ca after job was completed. Walked around Waikiki looking for cheaper accomodations than the $110/night Radisson that my company had booked me, and was delighted to find Bamboo, 2 or so blocks from the beach, a boutique hotel with a nice pool, ocean view, quiet enough, rack rate $145, got it for $50 a night. A steal.
