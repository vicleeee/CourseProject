<Content>disappointed I guess finding good value accomodation in Hong Kong is difficult. I thought I was going to find it in this YMCA-run place but was pretty disappointed. There was loud construction from 830 to 6, surprise! The view was half obscured even though we splurged on the premier harbourview room. The location's alright, the room was satisfactory but I wouldn't stay here, or even in Wanchai again. Head somewhere else, Stanford Hillview, and even the Ramada in Kennedy Town was better.

<Content>Good value for Hong Kong Needed a clean place to stay in Hong Kong for a few nights at a reasonable price. Found that I could book this hotel on hoteltravel.com for $76US a night ( half the price of going direct to the hotel! ) . Hotel was good - small rooms but it has all the facilities you need and has recently been remodelled. Hotel does not offer free internet service but there are cafe's nearby that you can use by buying a coffee. Location is a bit out of the way - it's about a 20 minute walk along overhead walkways to the nearest MTR station. However, it is not too far to walk to sights in Central or the Star ferry. There is also a bus that stops in front of the hotel (Bus #18) that will take you to Central station for 2.20HK dollars. From the airport, you can take the airport bus ( A12 ) , that will drop you near the hotel. No breakfast is included in the hotel price. There are few nearby restaurants so you will have to walk 15-20 minutes to find one. Learn to use the system of walkways as the sidewalks along the roads are hard to use - also there are many restaurants/stores located along the overhead walkways.

<Content>OK We had a 'Harbour View' Superior twin which cost around 900 HKD per night - pretty cheap for HKG as far as i can see. The reception staff were very polite and helpful on our arrival and throughout our stay, there was always plenty of people on hand at the front desk to offer advice, book taxis etc. The room was cleanish (didn't want to look too hard if you know what i mean?!) The bathroom dated (but v clean) and the public areas spotless (although a lttle drab.) I would stay again as the harbourview provided safe, quiet accomodation for 2 female travellers in a fantastic location. If you could spend a little more then maybe the Renaissance round the corner would be a better bet. I have also stayed in the Novotel Wan Chai and would say that it is better than the Harbourview. Just ok but no real complaints.

<Content>Good value This hotel, which has some affiliation with the YMCA, was comfortable. The room was a bit small, but its location was very good. The room also had a very good view of the Harbour. It served as a good place to spend a couple of days between flights from the US and Cambodia.

<Content>Great Hotel...Great Location....Fantastic! I have recently returned from HK, after staying in this hotel. It is a great hotel in a good location. The room price is also good. I stayed in a refurbished Harbour View Room (the best they have) on the 20 floor and the cost was only 700 HKD per night plus tax/service charge. It is only a 3 minute walk from the conference centre and roughly the same to Lockhart Road, the entertainment area of Wan Chai. I recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to stay on HK Island for reasonable rate. It there is a gripe, it is that the Wifi is expensive and there is no bar area. However, you can overcome the wifi issue by purchasing a 24 hour access card from the 7-11 store (many of them in the area) for $20 HKD. You will then be able to sit near any phone box and connect to the internet. In fact, there is one just outside the hotel and even from the 20th floor I was able to connect and go online from my room.

<Content>Great budget option Stayed one night last week. Have previously stayed in Kowloon but all the budget options there were sold out so I went with this one.Comfortable bed (if a little on the hard side, but I like that), clean bathroom... that's all I need, but added bonus of a great view of the harbour across to Tsim Sha Tsui.One point - the taxi drivers in Hong Kong Airport Express station all looked blankly at the name and address of this place and they didn't seem to understand when I pointed to it on a map either. In the end I asked for the Hyatt. As you pull up to the Hyatt which is on Harbour Road on the left, the Harbour View International House is on the right and slightly behind you. Costs around $20-25 plus $5 per bag and I advise using a taxi if you have luggage. Wanchai MTR station is a 10 minute walk and a few flights of stairs or escalators away.

<Content>Great budget deal I went to the annual Hong Kong Book Fair last week and stayed there for 1 night. I booked through HotelClub and it costed me just USD$75. I am from Macau and kinda familiar with Hong Kong, and I really think that I got a good deal this time.Pros:- Located at WanChai, right opposite to the HK Convention  Exhibition Center.- Bus stop right in front of hotel, easy access to Central.- Rooms are renovated in 2007. Everything is new and clean.- Bathroom is small but clean, with bright and chic design.- Staff is friendly and helpful.Cons:- 5 minutes walking distance from MTR station.- Surrounded by not shopping malls but government buildings and offices.- No bath tub, pool, gym.Recommend for budget travelers and those visiting HK Expo Center.

<Content>Great hotel at a great price I stayed at the Harbour View for 8 nights in May 2008, and all up I was very pleased. I'd searched long and hard for a reasonably priced hotel in a good location, and the Harbourview was certainly the best option.First up, the location is fantastic - it's right across the road from the Grand Hyatt, and about 100m from the waterfront. Terrific if you like jogging along the water. It was also only a short walk (~5 mins) into Kowloon, and a 5-10 minute cab ride to SoHo and Lan Kwai Fong - plus cabs are everywhere in HK. It's also a 2 minute walk from the Convention Centre, which is where I was attending a conference. There are a couple of good coffee shops across the main highway, about a 3-4 minute walk, which have free wifi and free computers.The staff were excellent, and always very attentive to needs. I was checked into the hotel promptly when I arrived, and with a few thigns I needed help on during my stay the ywere always ready and available. I stayed in a premier double room, and the room was quite large, with all the mod cons you'd want. The bathroom was clean and new. The only bad thing was the bed was absolutely rock solid, but housekeeping put a pillowtop on the mattress for me which helped quite a bit. The room was cleaned everyday, and I was never disturbed whilst in the room. I wasn't in a Harbour view room unfortunately, so the view was of an grey office block, but this isn't something that really bothered me.All up, the hotel was in an excellent location, and since it's about half the price of other hotels in the same location, I think it's an unbeatable deal.

<Content>Great option in an expensive town Was referred to Harbour View by someone who had lived in Hong Kong. Didn't realise it was a YMCA until after I had booked however based on the reviews here i had booked. Had low expectations but was suprised. the foyer is not the most stylish however my room was great and clearly had been refurbished in the past year or so. Bathroom was tiny but refurbished as well.Staff were pleasant and helpful when I needed anything especially directions.Breakfast buffet was average fare but if you are early enough the chef will cook your eggs for you.Didn't have a harbour view however would ask for one next time. Definately stay here again, great location and just out of the noisy area in wan chai but close enough to be there in 5 min walk.

<Author>whatisnottaken
<Content>Be careful when booking this hotel. This is definitely a hotel with 2 personalities. All the rooms are the same small size (smallest I've had in HK - maybe I've been lucky up till now) but the standard rooms are tired and worn out where as the premier rooms have been renovated in the last few years. It seems that the rooms up to the 11th or 12 floor are the ones that haven't been renovated recently and as I said are quite grubby (scuffed wallpaper, stained worn carpets, threadbare furniture, poorly set out tiny plastic bathroom which requires you to step up and over approx 18 into the shower/bath (etc) ie. generally worn out) and have less facilities that the premier rooms eg. no in room safe . All rooms types I experienced had the same rock hard beds often found in budget hotels. Not a problem for me but may be an issue for others.I got to see 4 different rooms in this hotel (2 standard and 2 premier) so I feel I have a good picture of what they offer.Facilities...They have wireless Internet available for a fee HK$40 for one continuous hour or HK$100 for 24 continuous hours. It is 802.11b so performance is not great. The premier rooms also appear to have wired access available but I did not try that so can't comment.As mentioned above, the standard rooms don't have an in room safe but do have plenty of signs telling you that it isn't safe to leave things in your room. There are safes are reception but this is not very convenient for all things.I used the restaurant for breakfast (buffet) and it was ok but as with all these things if you know where to go there are undoubtedly better cheaper options available elsewhere.Convenience...Yes it is about 5 minutes walk from the nearest MTR exit (Wan Chai A5) mostly along an elevated pedestrian walkway but 5 minutes in summer humidity can be a challenge for some people. Also there is a requirement to descend via stairs after hours which may be an issue for those with some mobility issues.It isn't too far from a A12 Cityflyer bus stop (Stop 5 Academy of Performing Arts) for people coming in from the airport. It cost HK45 as opposed to HK$100 for the Airport Express train but it also takes a bit longer.I did not use the Airport Express bus so can't comment on the convenience of its location. That said the taxi/cab fare including luggage fee to the HK Airport Express station was about HK$22 so the bus may well not be an issue. There is a bus stop right outside which will get you to Central and beyond. Get the 18 not the 18P as it has more stops in tourist areas. The stop for the return journey is less convenient but still not too bad.Staff...Friendly and efficient for the most part but generally not willing to go too far out of their way to deal with complaints or make the guest happy.In summary...Speaking personally I'd recommend that unless you need easy access to the convention center or must have a view of the harbor and aren't prepared to pay too much for it, other similarly priced options have bigger rooms with better facilities. If you must stay in this hotel make sure you get a renovated room.

<Content>Great value, all you need. I trawled long and hard through Tripadvisor before booking the Harbour View International House. Everything else that looked decent or had a harbour view was at least twice the price but boy am I glad I picked this gem. Staff were lovely, really attentive. Room was everything you need - smart, clean, good shower, complimentary toiletries etc, modern, harbour view, coffee/tea making facilities, complimentary bottled water, flat screen TV with BBC, CNN etc - actually beyond what you get in a lot of 4 star places (I know, in Kyoto the 4* Hotel Granvia which was twice the price and had the surliest receptionist ever had the cheek to charge for the tea/coffee facilites in the room - who does that?). Approx. 5/10mins walk from either Star Ferry terminal which worked out very handy for us. All in all a great little find at half the price.

<Content>Everything you need We stayed for 2 nights at this hotel and found not only the price good value for money but the staff and room great too.Our flight got in very early in the morning and even though check in isn't till 2pm, they gave us a room at 8am.The hotel is near the star ferry and MTR station, so a great location. It is also a short walk from the exhibition centre, where the free Airport Express bus stop is located.Our room was comfortable and clean with a great harbour view for approx 拢60 a night. The bathroom was very tiny but clean and with a great shower!The only thing i can complain about is that the half room rate (from 12 midday till 6pm) was nearly 拢30! If you are going to Hong Kong, i would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>A Hidden Gem This hotel is part of the YMCA group and is about 10 minutes walk from the underground train station and Star ferry.We were a family of 2 adults and 1 child and with an extra foldaway in the room space was a bare minimum.Staff are extemely friendly and efficient and always eager to help or answer any queries.Breakfasts are buffet style with an enormous choice.The hotel is in Wanchai (Red Lght area) but situated in a quiet zone. Only critricism is that there are not many restaurants in the vicinity- 10 minutes walk to high traffic areas.Families will not be hassled by ladies of the night and Hong Kong is generally safe even in this area.Thoroughly recommended

<Content>Conveniently located Stayed here for two nights this past weekend and thought it was a good value for the price. (They upgraded me which also helped.) The hotel is very close to the MTR as well as the Wan Chai Star Ferry. (~10 min walk to both)There is a buffet breakfast offered in the morning but I'd skip it. It's not really worth the price you'll pay. You're better off holding out for dim sum elsewhere.Also, if you don't mind some exercise, you can walk to many of the major sights in HK Island from the hotel. I didn't take the MTR at all on my first day but made it to Victoria Peak, Central/Mid-Levels escalator (and surrounds) then just took the Star Ferry over to Tsim Sha Tsui.

<Content>Great view, very clean rooms and friendly staff We paid HK$1450 for a room/night with an extra bed thru the HKIA Hotel Agent. I thought that it was pretty expensive for the hotel rating of 2 stars (as indicated in trip advisor hotel rating) but later I realised that it's worth it. When I reached the hotel, I was surprised to find that the rooms were cosy small but very clean. it comes with a 20 LCD tv attached to the wall. Although the toilet was very small too but I still loved it as it's very new, modern and clean. So, I thought that this hotel should be given at least a 4 star or 5 star hotel.The view from the hotel room was splendid at day or night as you'll be facing the harbour.The location is near the convention centre, Central Plaza (one of the highest building in HK) and MTR but shopping mall is quite some distance away. However, you can find some good food restaurant  night market that sells good and cheap stuff just below the MTR station. The lobby was pretty small but it's cosy with hotel staff smiling at you and greeting you. Check-in  check-out was no hassle as I'm with a 2 year old toddler.So, I think the $ that I paid for is worth it based on my 1 night stay. I'll sure stay in Harbour View International House again.

<Content>Million Dollar View I recently stayed at the Harbourview International House for 4 nights.Our room on the 16th floor overlooked the harbour which was spectacular both day and night. Handy location and very quiet! The room was spotless, although on the small side (think NYC hotel room or cruise ship cabin.) The staff were very friendly and I would be happy to reccomend this hotel to anyone unless you were looking for a 5 star luxury accomodation experience. I will be staying here again.Halifax, Nova Scotia

<Content>Friendly, clean and good locale I stayed here for 3 nights although planned for 5 nights. Left on an earlier flight and the staff was excellent about it. The rooms are small, but to be expected in Asian countries. It was a very nice room. It was clean and comfotable. They upgraded my room for free because my husband was to arrive the next day. They sent a baby bed and extra bed for my two kids within 5 minutes of arriving for no charge. The concierge and reception were always exceptionally friendly and helpful. It was located in a very convenient locale and I had a great view of the harbor. The ferry to Kowloon was a 5 minute walk as well as the Admirality train station. I would definitely stay here again!!!

<Content>Great even if... We (my girlfriend and I) stayed one week and were happy of the choice. Sure one choice to be repeated had we to go back to HK.Concise summary:globally a great trade-off quality/price and very good locationpros:- premium room with Harbour view: great, recently refurbished, 20 LCD TV, new bathroom, kept very clean by the housekeeping, good soundproofing from outside the main room, nice view- central- good service (e.g. very quick to rectify the error in the assigned room (twin instead than the requested double))cons:- radio with 3 (!) channels in chinese- tv with few english speaking channels (but we were not there to watch tv anyway)- airconditioninig a bit too loud - bed a bit too hardcannot comment: restaurant or breakfast as not used.

<Content>Good Hotel but Location not Ideal It was our first visit to Hong Kong and we chose Harbour View International based on predominantly positive reviews on tripadvisor.com. Using Rates to Go, we made a reasonably priced reservation --3 nights stay in a standard room with daily breakfast for 2.Check in: We arrived at around 9 pm. We took the A 12 bus from the airport but overshot our stop, ending in Causeway Bay. Apparently, we were supposed to stand by the exit and be quick pressing the stop button since the stops were close together. We took a taxi back to Wan Chai which cost us an extraHKD33 + HKD10 for 2 pieces of luggage. As per the advice of other trip advisor members, we asked for but did not get a room upgrade with a harbour view. Instead, we got a renovated room with a distinct odor of paint--not too strong though. Room: The room was smaller than what we're used to but it was clean, and adequately furnished. The window faced a wall so we just kept our drapes closed. There was a small fridge with drinks (fee)and a daily supply of bottled mineral water (free). There was a good sized safe which was very useful to keep our passports and cash secure. We loved the strong water pressure of the shower--a godsend after hours of walking. My husband looked for but did not find an ice dispenser in the hotel. House keeping instead brought us up a pitcher of iced water.Location: If you were in Hong Kong attending a seminar in Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, this hotel is a perfect alternative to the pricey Renaissance Harbour Hotel and Grand Hyatt across the street. To hit the tourist sites, you can't do anything on foot if you want to conserve energy, keep cool and maximize your time in Hong Kong. The Wan Chai MTR is a 15 minute walk (unless you are unusually fit--you can do it in 5 minutes). You have to do several flights of stairs and several blocks as well. The bus stop is about 30 meters from the front of the hotel--very convenient except that only the 18,18P, 46X buses stopped there. In Gloucester Road are other bus stops but to get there, you have to do the previously mentioned stairs. I asked the concierge for a map indicating all the buses that enter Wan Chai. I cannot believe that he did not have one! We would have enjoyed our stay more if we had route maps for all the buses. The Wan Chai Ferry to Kowloon is a 20 minute walk from the hotel . We ended up spending about $150 HKD per person just for fares (MTR, buses, ferries) to and from the tourist sites and shopping areas. Next time we are in Hong Kong, we will get another hotel that is closer to any MTR station. In that way, we could get the 3 day tourist pass that allows you unlimited MTR rides for 3 days and either a one way or round trip airport express ride.

<Content>Good location and value First timer in Hong Kong so didn't really know what to expect. This hotel seemed very reasonably priced considering it is on Hong Kong island itself and near the Convention Centre as well. I paid in advance and my room cost about 拢66 a night. I would imagine it is lot more expensive when there is a big convention on. The room was a bit on the small side but nicely furnished and had a good view over the harbour. Quite well located for the Wan Chai MTR station, though I would have said it was nearer 15 mins walk. Didn't use the restaurant so can't comment. Staff were very efficient and friendly. Overall, an excellent experience and I would certainly recommend.

<Content>great location Having never been to Hong Kong before i was abit on edge about what we were letting ourselves in for. We arrived at the airport an caught the express train to central which was clean and very quick. From then we got a taxi to the hotel which cost us 30 Hong Kong Dollars. Upon arriving the staff were extremly friendly and upgraded our room. A porter help us with our luggage.The room was spacious and very clean and comfortable. The bathroom was on the small side but plently of hot water. the view was amazing. The only thing is there is some renevation work going on, but it is only during the day and starts late.Location wise it was excellent, just 5 minutes walk form the Wan Chai tube station. The BEST way to get round Hong Kong is to buy an Octopus card form the services desk at the station which will cost you 150 HKD each and you have to pay in cash. With this you can use it on all trains (excpet the airport express) busses, the peak tram and the star ferry. The price includes a 50hkd deposit which you get back once you return the card along with any credit you didn't spend. I would definetly retunr to this hotel. Every one was so helpfull and friendly.

<Content>Great value! I stayed 1 nite alone in the Deluxe room. It was a pleasant surprise, as the room was clean and new, with LCD TV. However, the bed was a bit too hard. As I had a late flight, the hotel gave me a late check-out at 3 pm. It was about 10 mins to the Star Ferry and Wanchai MTR. Renovation work is undergoing on the 14  15 Floor, but it was ok since I was out most of the time. Staffs were helpful. I will recommend this hotel to travellers who want a no-frill and clean hotel.

<Content>Lovely hotel, renovated, excellent service After a horrible experience with the Regal hotel (also in Hong Kong) this hotel is a complete oasis of hospitality, friendlyness, service and good food for me. Friendly and helpful staff, a good check-in (and checkout) process without hassle and money-hungry clerks that demand a bloody fortune as security deposit in cash, clean nice rooms, with quite a couple of rooms offering a great view of the harbour. They have smoking rooms too if you like one. Much of the hotel is being renovated so everything is new, clean, and tastefully decorated. Nice LCD TV's too. The staff is professional, friendly, service-minded and clearly understands the concept of hospitality and service perfectly. As someone who travels weekly and has seen literally hundreds of hotels over the years, I can only highly recommend this no-hassle, no-fuss, high-quality hotel.

<Content>quite good value for money booked hotel when we arrived at hong kong airport, seemed good value for money, friendly staff when we arrived asked for harbour view which was ok. room was small and bathroom even smaller, the beds where the bigest problem very very hard made it difficult to sleep. no tea or coffee but a kettle was provided. no hairdryer in the room had to call housekeeping everyday requesting it, apart from all that the room was clean. dont think i would stay there again because of the beds and it was quite noisy with different people in the corridor all night.

<Content>Equivocal: OK and nothing particularly wrong, but overpriced for what you get I stayed at this hotel because the YMCA has a reputation for running good hotels, and also because of its location: it's overlooking the harbour and is only about 5 minutes walk from one of the Star Ferry terminals (the one at Wan Chai, where you can catch the ferry across to Kowloon side) and about the same distance from a lively area with nightclubs, girlie bars, convenience stores, and great places to grab a quick Asian take-away, or catch the MTR (subway). It's quite a good location from which to travel around Hong Kong because of its proximity to the ferry, MTR and major bus routes, and this is the main advantage of this hotel. That said, it's not in the centre of things: if you want that it's probably better to head for the Kowloon side (Nathan Road area: Tsim Sha Tsui to Mong Kok) or Central if you want to stay on the Hong Kong Island side.I paid for a 'view room' overlooking the harbour and felt ripped off. I certainly wouldn't pay for this view again -- the view was angled so I was really looking at a neighbouring building covered in bamboo scaffolding unless I made an effort to go right up to the window and look the other way. Even then, it was a partial view and not of a particularly beautiful part of the harbour. Next time I'd save my money and just take a walk along the harbour foreshore at Tsim Sha Tsui instead: the view of the harbour is much nicer from the Kowloon side anyway.For visiting business people or those attending the convention centre (diagonally across the road), the location is likely to be better than for tourists. For tourists, there are more convenient locations but this is OK.The hotel was clean and the staff were professional, though the standard of their English was sometimes surprisingly poor considering how many HK people speak great English. When I stayed the floors directly above and below were being renovated, so hammering began in the relatively early morning and didn't stop till evening. It even continued on the weekend. This may be necessary to renovate the hotel, but isn't really acceptable from a guest's point-of-view: I think they should have charged less in light of this, or at least have given advanced warning at the time I booked. I asked about changing rooms but was told there were none available.The room I stayed in was renovated. It was small but comfortable. Given the choice between an unrenovated and renovated room, I would pay the extra for one of the newer rooms (but check first that you won't have people hammering away when you're trying to sleep -- very annoying).CONCLUSION:HK is an expensive place to stay but I felt this hotel is somewhat overpriced for what you get in comparison to other HK establishments. If you don't mind this, it's a reasonable location and a clean, safe place from which to base your explorations of HK. It wouldn't be my first choice of place to stay next time I'm in HK, but it's not a bad place.

<Content>Great location and views My wife and I stayed here for two nights in March 2007 and paid GBP 75.00 per night for a Premier Harbour View room. This is a great hotel in a great location, Wan Chai. Having said that Wan Chai does from what we could see have a fair number of adult oriented clubs so those with families may wish to avoid. The room on the 17th floor was spotless with fantastic views across the harbour to Kowloon and to the west, the mighty IFC2 building. The bathroom was quite small but more importantly was clean and reasonably modern. The desk will arrange an airport shuttle bus which goes on the hour for HKD140 per person. Public transport and taxis in HK are so cheap that other members' comments re the MTR didn't present a huge problem. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. Top place !

<Content>Great Value My first visit to Hong Kong was off to a great start when I arrived at this hotel. The location is in the district Wan Chai which is easily reached by the island line subway from central station. The location is very close for the Star Ferry Terminal Wanchai. It is in a nice area with very large hotels and the HK convention centre 5minutes walk away. The downside is that you have to walk about 15minutes over a footpath to get to the subway, a slight incovenience. The wanchai area is great for shopping bargains aswell as many small eateries, bakeries etc. The hotel itself is a very tall building with several floors, a restaurant and a coffee lounge with internet access. My room was on the 14th floor and was very acceptable size, comparable to usual 3star western hotel. The bathroom was compact but spacious enough to not feel suffocated. The room was perfectly clean and the maid service was excellent. The hotel has a free safe facility to store valuables, I made good use of this. The staff were friendly, helpful and always available. The hotel felt very secure and service was discreet. It was perfect for my 5 days sightseeing and I recommend it to anyone who wants a nice no-frills place to stay at a good price.
