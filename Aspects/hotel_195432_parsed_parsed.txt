<Content>Central location The location is great, right on Via Dei Calzaiuoli which is a pedestrian street connecting most of the main sights. It is also 3 minutes aways from a lot of great restaurants. The building is very old but the rooms are ok. When booking ask for a quiet room not facing the main street. The breakfast was ok but not great, not a lot of selection. The day stuff at checkin was always friendly and helpful.

<Content>Excellent Location, Clean Rooms This hotel has an excellent location. It is right in the middle of it all. The Duomo is at the end of the street and everything else is within a short walking distance. You can pretty much eat at any of the hundreds of restaurants in the area, tour the city, and then stop back to the room to take a break. Very convenient. The staff and owner were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was okay, but included with the price of the room. As a courtesy to its patrons, they book tours and whatever else you might need help with. Our room was very clean and decorated nice,as well as the bathroom. It accomodated the four of us very comfortably. They have two computers in the lobby as a courtesy for patrons to use. We booked a tour with Cor Magis to Siena and that was amazing and well worth the money. Great place to stay all in all.

<Content>Great location, clean rooms This place has a great location if you're looking to walk to Florence's main sights. We priced several other options and decided that the few extra Euros were worth a more central location than constantly having to hoof it in to town or always be waiting for public transit.The room was comfortable, though not exceedingly spacious. It was clean and everything worked properly. We had a back room (i.e., not facing a street) and the only city noise we ever heard were the church bells ringing.The breakfast was nice as long as you're not looking for sausage and eggs.... It was mostly mueslix, coffee, yogurt, croissants, etc.The staff was professional. Though I would only classify one of them as proactively friendly they were all hospitable and helpful whenever we approached them with questions. Booking via their own website saved us 5%. Paying in cash saved us another 5%. Very helpful given the weak exchange rate.

<Content>Great location, basic accomidations My husband and I spent 4 nights at the Maxim while in Florence . The location cannot be beat as it is within easy walking distance of all the major sites and the train station. It also has an internet point in the hotel, which is a plus. The room itself was very basic but large. The bathroom could have been cleaner as could have the floors. The staff was very friendly. I would recommend this hotel for the traveler that isn't concerned with a lot of amenities but who would still like to stay in the heart of the city.

<Content>Ok Hotel My wife and I stayed there for three nights. the location is excellent, just a block from the Duomo and a short walk to most everything else. For such a location, the price of 108 Euro was perfect. It's a15 min walk to the RR station, certainly do-able. Our room was adequate in size, overlooking the inner courtyard. We could never figure out the layout of the hotel, as the corridors wind all over. The hotel is located on the third floor, and when you first arrive at the street entrance and go in, you feel like you may have made a mistake picking the place, as it has no attractiveness at all, and a tiny elevator. But when you get off on the third floor, it gets much more homey. The front desk has a lived in living room charm to it, with sofas and older upholstered chairs, along with a computer for internet access. The room itself was adequate in size and clean, but the TV was mounted on the wall and watching it from the bed was a bit awkward. But we didn't come to Florence to watch TV anyway! The bathroom was the main thing we disliked about the whole experience. It was incredibly narrow, so much so that you could hardly get off the potty without carefully adjusting your limbs!! The shower stall was also small, with a shower head that was defective, so water went everywhere. Thank God there was a plastic shower curtain that was somewhat effective.There was also a mold problem in the bathroom, too.Breakfast was good, in a large room, with a good selection of cereals, juices, fruit salad, yogurt, breads, and croissants. Among the better ones we have had in Italy. All things considered, it was an ok experience. I would consider staying there again, but would look elsewhere first. The price was right, the location excellent, and the food good. But I am not sure that I would recommend the place to my best friends for fear that they would be distressed over the bathrooms.

<Content>top notch I highly recommend this hotel and it's partner, the Axial. Starting with an easy to use website, everything about our stay at this hotel was wonderful, arrival through departure. The hotel is beautiful, clean and conveniently located and the staff are incredibly kind, helpful, and accomodating (thank you Nicola)! I cannot believe the value for your money, esp. if you book online (breakfast and free internet are also included in most packages)! A refreshing and welcome experience I suggest to anyone staying in Florence!

<Content>Great location I stayed at this hotel in the middle of February, taking two friends with me who had stayed there before.Yes the location is great, the staff are friendly, the rooms are basic but clean.No coffee/tea etc. in the room, but this is not a problem when you have so many shops/caf茅s just a few footsteps away.The bathroom is small but adequate. Three of us girls managed in there perfectly well.I think it is good value for money.

<Content>Great Location! Excellent Price! Nice hotel within one block of the Duomo. Hotel entrance right on main walking street in the heart of downtown Florence. Within 10 minutes of all major attractions- Uffezi, Accademia, Duomo, etc. We walked back and forth from train station, was approx. 15 minute walk. We had a courtyrad room and it was very quiet. Rooms are a mix of old and new (10 ft wood beam ceilings, modern bathrooms- including tub), and well maintained. Staff was very helpful (good restaurant recommedations) and spoke English fluently. Only issue was heat- it was unusually cold during our three nights and radiator could not keep up. Good breakfast selection (included). Good value and excellent location. They also have free internet access with 2 terminals in the lobby. On third floor, so elevator is must especially with heavy bags. Would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Fantastic location and room The Maxim is right in the centre of Florence, but once you leave the busy street, it's like an oasis of calm. We requested a room facing the courtyard, and received it. The shutters blocked out all light, and also the bells of the Duomo (funnily enough, we heard them only once in our room when we were awake with the shutters closed - maybe they start only at a certain time of the morning?).Our room was enormous by European standards, with a double and a single bed. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The towels resembled sheet material but performed just as well or better than the type we are used to.The free internet in the lobby was really handy. We had to wait for it a few times, but there were a few couches and lots of books to read to keep us occupied. There was a flight of stairs to reach our room (and a couple more if we couldn't be bothered waiting for the elevator, and we never could) but they keep you fit. The air condiitoning was a godsend!My only advice in Florence is to walk 10 minutes in any direction away from the centre to find a good restaurant. Most central restaurants cater for tourists, so are overpriced with average food. I can't believe how much more we got charged for gelato in the centre, compared to outside it (almost 3 times more).I most definitely would not even consider staying anywhere else on future visits to Florence. Hotel Maxim offered the best value for money I have received on several trips to many towns and cities around the world.

<Content>Basic, but comfortable, accomodations in a great location We originally found this hotel in Nov 2005 through the Rick Steves travel book, and we loved the location. Tip: pay in cash and have a Rick Steves book to get discounts.The family that runs the hotel is wonderful, and will go out of their way to make you feel welcome (in your language when possible) as well as book you reservations and make recommendations. The location is amazing, very near the Duomo (if you are a light sleeper this can be bad for the tolling bells), just around the corner from the Piazza Republica and down the street from the Uffizi museum and square.The rooms themselves are comfortable, but a little on the older side. They are well maintained though (even if the bathrooms could be helped by a little bleach). They offer handicapped accessible rooms which are more spacious and located at the enterior of the hotel (which I would recommend as those staying with rooms facing the streets often complain of the noise).All in all, not bad for the convenience.

<Content>1 star at best Location was great but room left alot to be desired. I'm not sure if it was because we arrived at 8 o'clock and it was the last room available (even thought we pre-paid in May) but it was not what we expected. The room was very dark and the bathroom was an obvious converted closet with a folding door. The first morning our make -shift shower backed up and there was water covering the entire bathroom floor. There was no other rooms available so we were stuck with that room for the next 3 nights. The owner of the hotel fixed the shower problem but after that first morning it left a bad taste in our mouth. The free internet was nice and the breakfast was good but i dont think our room was worthy of 2 stars. Will not return

<Content>Great Hotel! This was a great hotel. It is certainly not fancy; like some reviews have said, some bits of it are a little scruffy. This is not the Ritz. But for those of us who are on a budget, this place is a very pleasant surprise. If they fixed this place, it would be just another expensive, fancy, American-style hotel. But I didn't come to Italy for that. The people really made this hotel for me. All the staff are generous and enthusiastic. This makes a huge difference when you are traveling. The cleaning and kitchen staff were always cheerful and really cared about what they were doing. The staff at the front desk know and love Florence and are good at what they do.The rooms are basic but functional; the beds are metal frame and the blankets were old. I liked the breakfast; good fresh croissant, bread, yogurt, coffee, and fruit. They also had cereals and milk. You could have as much as you wanted which, if you know Florence prices, makes this a great bargain. There is also a free computer in the lobby. This alone will save you 3 to 6 euros. Our room was located towards the center of the building and the window opened up on the center vent/courtyard. You want this. You do not want a room with a view here because you will be seranaded all night long by the non-stop party below. I really appreciated the quiet. After all of this, yes, you have to stay here for the location. It is one and a half blocks away from the Duomo and two blocks from Piazza Vecchio. It is a stunning location and you will not find a hotel anywhere near this area for this price. Towards Vecchio there is a cafe called Cafe Perseo which has a free appetizer bar in the afternoon. You go in, stand at the counter, order a drink or a glass of wine and then help yourself to the food. To sum it all up; great neighborhood, good people, and a fantastic price.

<Content>Noisy, but great location and price! This hotel is right between the Duomo and Uffizi gallery making it an excellent place to stay. The room was very large (double) with air conditioning you get to set. The bathroom was large with a small shower and thin, but large, towels.The breakfast was all-you-could eat rolls, crossiants, cereals, yogurt, juices, etc. and was a good start to the day. They have two computers with internet for all guests and it wasn't too much of an issue getting on them.Our only complaint was the noise of the hardwood floors. In the mornings (~7 am) it was impossible to sleep in since people were up and about early for sight-seeing. We asked for a courtyard facing room and I can't imagine what a street side room would have been like! (The rooms face the pedestrian street, but still loud at all times.)Even so, I would stay here again due to the location and price. Heck, we should have been up earlier anyway!

<Content>Hotel Maxim offers reasonable price  We (two of us) stayed here in March 2007. This hotel takes up the entire third floor of a building that still serves as a penzionne. In the same building (another floor) is also a BB establishment.Our room has a double bed and a single bed--i.e. it can accommodate up to 3 people. Room is good size, but decor is a little spartan (i.e. white walls can probably use a fresh coat of paint and the bedding can use brighter colors. The look is very utilitarian.) Breakfast is included. Location is wonderful--within walking distance of train terminal, on a busy fashionabke shopping street of Via Calzuoli. On the two ends of this street are the two most popular attractions--the Duomo of Florence and the Uffizi Palace. The check-in desk is in a room with a social area where you have access to a computer with on-line services (free) as well as tour books for other parts of Italy.

<Content>Great Location. Suprising gem. Hotel Maxim is in a very easy to find location down the street from the Duomo. Very convenient. It had a computer that was free for use for its guests. The hotel staff was not overly welcoming but was available for answering questions at any time. The room we stayed in was on the same level as the front desk and the computer. It was a rather large room with very high ceilings. We were able to open our windows which faced a corridor. For light sleepers it might be slightly noisy but we had no problem in general. It was a good value.

<Content>Great Hotel, Location, and Hosts!! My husband and I spent 8 nights at Hotel Maxim. We absolutely loved the hotel for several reasons. #1 Our Room. Everything in our 鈥?st Floor鈥?room (the 2d floor in American vocabulary) was immaculate. All that we needed for a most comfortable stay was provided, along with daily maid service. The all tile, squeaky clean bathroom was complete with toilet, shower (with very hot, strong water), large sink, heated towel rack and hair dryer. There were two coat/hat hooks next to a full length mirror as you enter the room. The room itself had a tile floor, a large bed, two side tables, and a large free standing closet for our clothes. There was a desk with a large mirror above it with a small fridge concealed within the left side. There was a large, tall window and the lighting throughout the room was very good. A television with 30 or so channels offered BBC and CNN channels which was great for catching up on the news. We asked for a quiet room and got one overlooking a small patio - it was very quiet. #2 Location. The location is absolutely central to all of Florence. It is a 5 - 10 minute walk in all directions to any of the sights. #3 Our Breakfast. The breakfast was a great start to each day, consisting of fresh fruit (we had yummy kiwis), canned fruit, croissants, hard rolls (even whole wheat ones), cheese, jellies, jams, honey, etc., three types of cereal (including a delicious granola which I fell in love with), coffee, warm milk, espresso, cocoa to make hot chocolate, and juice. #4 The Owners. The Maxim is a business run by the Maioli family (Paolo, the father, Sylvie, mother, Chiara, daughter and Nicola, son). Their friendly professionalism and assistance was what made this such a special place. They spoke near-perfect English and were always available to help with making reservations, calling a cab, or finding a particular restaurant or store. #5 The Extras. The hotel provides a computer room with two high speed computers which we found extremely convenient. Miscellaneous travel books, reading books, magazines, a small table, a bathroom with shower, and a television were also in this room. Another computer was also available in the third floor lobby. Next to the computer room was a small bar area, with alcohol beverages to purchase, and another television.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Florence. It is an excellent value in a magnificent city!!! Ask for a first floor room for the most modern accommodations.

<Content>Staff was amazing!! We were stranded in Florence and I came across this hotel in one of my guide books. They were able to put us up for a very reasonable rate with last minute notice. The staff was so helpful in recommending restaurants and helped us book a trip to a spa about 30 miles away. I loved this place..definately recommend.

<Content>Great Value When I choose a hotel, I want it to be clean, well located, confortable and safe. All this qualities I found in the Maxim, plus a good price (59 EUR/night).It's located in a busy street that links the Duomo to the Piazza della Signoria. 50 m to the Duomo. 150 m to the Piazza.Although the front desk has a students place look, the hotel is very professional. I had a big and clean room (n. 26) with a spacious bathroom.The breakfast is very good (italian stile) and the staff very polite and eficient. They are prepared to help you book your visits to the museuns in advance (very important to avoid long lines).Conclusion: I would definetely stay there again!

<Content>Better that you would expect at We stayed at this hotel for one night. Our room was very nice, spacious with large bed, AC. Rooms, bathroom etc - everything was spotless. It seemed that they redecorated it recently. Actually I didn't expect anything close at this price and ... with this entrance: the hotel is situated at 3rd or 2nd floor and the entrance is relatively dump. Also, rarely for a hotel in the central location it was very quiet and calm. Again about the location: it was really great, actually it is difficult to imagine better one. Close to Duomo and all the sights. You might have problems finding it - a sign at the entrance is not large one. Also we were coming by car and it was really a serious problem to find our way through the city. But it could be because we did not have a good map showing traffic directions: most of the streets in the centre are one way. Anyway, staff at the hotel was very friendly and was happy to guide us through the city (I think I called them 3 times...). Also we had a really great dinner at L'Osteria di Giovanni on Via del More, rabbit in wine sauce was just perfect (as the wine line). It was not cheap, but worth money. Enjoy your visit to Florence!

<Content>Two Star hotel with a Three Star value Located half way between the Duomo and the Uffizi gallery, this hotel has a situational advantage that is hard to beat. And as you enter the hotel, you are greeted by people who are eager to tell you all you may want to know about Florence and its treasured monuments.Its prime location is not without disadvantages. Driving to the hotel through narrow and crowded streets is not easy, and parking is impossible. The hotel has an arrangement with a garage, but that is an additional expense that you have to bear.It is a two-star hotel with a price to match: so don鈥檛 expect luxury here. With no bell boys to help you with your luggage, you will have to carry it on a flight of stairs, if your room is on the 4th floor, as there is no lift between the 3rd and the 4th floors occupied by Maxim. The room is functional and the breakfast is not very exciting. But with so much to see and do in Florence, you could be looking for a convenient and decent place with friendly and helpful people running it. Maxim would certainly fulfill that need.

<Content>Great Location We stayed here a couple weeks ago and the location could not have been better. You walk out and if you go left you go the the Duomo or the Accademy. You go right and you head to the Uffizi and Ponte Vecchio. There are places to eat around the hotel, the hotel has AC and breakfast was nice. Would stay here again!

<Content>Perfect location! My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Maxim for two nights in April. The location couldn't be better. Both the room and the bathroom were very clean. The room was a little dark, but otherwise it was fine. The breakfast was more than adequate and the staff very friendly and helpful. The price is great, especially when you compare it to other hotels in the area. I would definitely stay at Hotel Maxim again!

<Content>Great Value...Awesome location!!! Just returned home from Italy, and our first trip to Firenze. The hotel Maxim was the awesome. Great location, big room with nice bathroom on 1st floor facing the courtyard. The desk was very helpful, making museum reservations, and restaurant recommendations. Only negative was the breakfast. After the first morning, we opted to walk across the street to a local bar (coffee shop) Be sure to ask for a courtyard room to avoid all the street noise, as hotel maxim is on a busy street. If your looking for a tour....take the all day tuscany tour offered by walking tours of florence. It was great and well worth the money. Caio

<Content>Not bad for 80 Euros/night After 3 days in Rome, my husband and I stayed in Florence at Hotel Maxim (based on Rick Steve's recommendation). This is not a fancy hotel -- and we didn't expect luxury. It is a bit industrial and utilitarian with not a lot of amenities but that was just fine -- until we both caught nasty colds and had to spend a bit more time in the room trying to get some rest. NICE MATTRESS! I think it was foam and I liked it a lot, but our room was on the first floor (one flight above the street) and faced an inner courtyard and we could hear every word reverberating off the courtyard walls at all hours of the day and night. THAT was annoying. If we had known, I would have asked for a room NOT facing this courtyard. This hotel is conveniently located, but the street is extremely busy (people not cars) and it is next door to a Disney Store which tends to attract large crowds of teens and 20-somethings who stand in front of the hotel and block the entrance. The staff were very friendly and helpful and there is a computer with internet connection (but no printer). All in all, this wasn't bad for 80 Euros per night, but if I return to Florence, I think I would try another hotel just to experience another place.

<Content>Lovely central hotel We stayed in this lovely hotel in Florence for 4 nights in October 2005. The staff were very friendly, both on reception and in the breakfast room. It was good value as breakfast was included and there were no problems with the room or bathroom. The location is very central being a 10 min walk from the station and a short walk away from many of the main sights such as the Uffizi. Our room faced a courtyard so none of the noise from the street outside or any other rooms affected us. We could only hear the bells of the Duomo nearby. Great for people coming to Florence to do some sightseeing.

<Content>Hotel Maxim My family and I just returned from a trip to Italy and really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Maxim in Firenze. It was a little tough to find a quad room in Firenze but this hotel suited us very nicely.The front desk staff were friendly and helpful, making museum reservations and recommending excellent restaurants. Breakfast (continental) was very satisfying. We used their complimentary computer for internet access to check train schedules and send E-mails home. The location was fabulous, between the Duomo and the Piazza della Signore (Uffizi). Quiet and clean.

<Content>just be realistic We chose the Hotel Maxim as it had got consistently good reviews on Trip Adviser and it was also recommended in most guide books.It still gets top marks on the key facgtors of location and overall cleanliness. The shower was good and well tiled and very clean. Make sure you request a courtyard room in any of these hotels as the street is noisy.The smell of damp in the building and the damp patches even in the bedroom are a bit off -putting however. The hall at the main door off the street is also dull and even shabby with dim lightling but this is a communal area until you reach hotel reception on the third floor by lift. If your room is on the first floor you have to go up to third for your key. Lastly, and a small detail, the diluted synthetic orange drink at breakfast was a poor substitute for orange juice especially when no fruit is provided. The bread rolls were hard each morning. The free internet room with two machines is well laid out and should not be overlooked as a positive.I cannot compare the Maxim with others in the area. However, once your chosen hotel is in the historic centre you are always within a half mile of anything and can walk it easily.Reception closes from 1 am to 6 am. I had indicated we would be in after midnight and had given the flight times. At no stage were we advised of the closing of the place and we nearly missed getting in. I don't see this important detail on the web either.There is definitely room for improvement in the Maxim. They don't ask for customer feedback so I hope they read this and take note!

<Content>Excellent value for your money Stayed there during the All Saint鈥檚 weekend. Excellent location, very affordable. Pretty basic breakfast, nice bathroom standard with shower cabinet, OK room size (which might sometimes be on the smaller side in Italy). Friendly and helpful staff. Stayed on the first floor, which supposedly is more modern than the third floor... Will definitely choose this hotel again. Free Internet access with two PC:s available to customers is also a great thing.

<Content>good location hotel We stayed at the hotel Maxim in October you could not beat the hotel for location and price you are really in the middle of Florence and the reception staff were very helpful and friendly, the room was on the first floor the reception is on the 3rd, the room was spotless clean as was the bathroom, the breakfast was the usual fare of cheese rolls and cereal but we enjoyed it, we will stay there again, we are going in the spring and will stay there.

<Content>Clean, Cheap Hotel at Bargain Price in Florence I stayed two nights at the Hotel Maxim in June of 2004. The room was small but quiet, and although there are certain inconveniences (see some of the other reviews), none of those would keep me from staying there again. The location couldn't be better, the internet access was fast, the lobby (such as it is) is comfortable and filled with lots of potboiler paperbacks, and at least one concierge, Niccola, went far beyond the norm in helpfulness. I will gladly return.

<Content>Great location, reasonable price My husband and I stayed at the Maxim hotel for 5 nights, and we are both very happy with our stay. The staff members were very helpful with booking tours, and making reservations. The locations can't be better! We are within walking distance to about everywhere. Will definiately stay here again.

<Content>Worth a try My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Maxim recently. Its definitely worth checking out as for the price it does give value for money. Its nothing fancy, in fact you think you are going into a block of apartments when you enter. You have to go to the third floor to get to reception, but we were given a room on the first floor which is in a separate annex to the hotel. This part of the hotel has been recently refurbished so the room was clean and modern. They also had wooden shutters on the windows which blocked out all light at night, something I find very beneficial when trying to sleep in hotels. There was some outside noise from the street at night mainly from street cleaning machines but as it is in the centre of town some noise would be expected. In fact its in a very good location. Its 2 mins walk from the Duomo, 5 mins from the Uffizi and about 10 mins walk to the train station. Breakfast is the usual continental buffet style - bread rolls, cereal, cheese etc. There are also free internet access until 12 midnight. The staff at reception were very courteous and helpful

<Content>Perfect location. Clean, safe and reasonably priced. My friend and I stayed at Hotel Maxim for four nights in October 2004 during our visit to Florence. We were very happy with the hotel. Its location was perfect - we could see the Duomo from our 2nd floor window and everything was short walk away. We had a room with twin beds and a private bathroom which the maid cleaned everyday. The facilities were simple but clean (my friend and I are both neat freaks and have high cleaniness standards). The several staff we talked to all were friendly and helpful. We also enjoyed the simple continental breakfast (included in the tariff) each morning in the quite little breakfast room. The hotel offers very good value for the price. I will stay at this hotel if I go to Florence again.

<Content>Surprisingly good Out of all the hotels I'd booked for our trip to Italy, this worried me the most. The reviews seemed to be all over the board.However, we were pleasantly surprised. This is, indeed, a no frills hotel. The entry is an uninviting double door with a buzzer to let yourself in- right next door to the Disney Store. The elevator is the size of a small pantry. I was put off by having to let go of our passports for a couple of hours after checking in. Apparently, they do this for all their guests. The staff was helpful, if not friendly. They have a luggage room to leave large objects during your stay (we left our kids' stroller).The decor is dormitory style. Unlike a previous review, we found this room to be very clean. There is no internet connection in the room but there is one high speed terminal at the reception desk. Breakfast is average, bread, cheese, yogurt and cereal.The best thing about the hotel is the location. As you step out, you can see the Cathedral Santa Maria de Fiore in one direction and the Piazza della Signori in the other. We walked to everything. All in all, we would definitely stay here again. This was the least expensive quad room we had in Italy. We paid 138 EU per night. What a deal!For eating, we highly recommend a Rick Steves suggestion, the Antico Ristorante il Sasso di Dante, directly opposite the Duomo. Reasonably priced and very good food.

<Content>Great Price  one staff member was so friendly, but the other staff members weren't so helpful.the hotel is located in the center of everything - a block from the Duomo, a block from the Piazza Republica, and two blocks from the Uffizi. The street has a ton of shopping and places to grab food (the Disney store is next door). The entrance to the hotel isn't very inviting. You open the double doors and walk down a dark hallway to the elevator. You take the elevator to the 3rd floor to get to the lobby. The lobby is just fine, but to get to our room we had to go back to the 1st floor (no big deal). The room itself was fine - clean, nice size, good size shower - but it was a long, winding walk from the elevator. The towels were like sheets and the bathroom reaked of bleach. The location on the 1st floor is somewhat loud but we weren't bothered by that. The TV had a volume maximum that was inaudible. Everytime you leave the hotel they want you to leave the key at reception - so since we were on the 1st floor we had to walk up 2 long flights to drop off the key, just to go back down. That was the worst part!!!The best part of the hotel other than the location? Free internet terminals! Although some cranky guest yelled at me when using it at 10:30 at night after dinner one night - the typing woke him up. The computers are available until 12 midnight each night.Prices were affordable, if your budget is tight its not bad. (PS If you ask you can get the room without breakfast to make it cheaper, 4 nights here were cheaper than our 2 in Venice!)
