<Content>Close to Love Field, close to freeways Stayed here three nights during a family gathering in Dallas. Price was $102 (including tax) per night. Hotel is just a few miles from Love Field (note: this is NOT DFW Airport), and just a couple minutes from a freeway, which is pretty much the only means of transport in this metroplex. Room had phone, full bath, free WiFi, and 50 channel TV. A restaurant was on-site, but no breakfast was included in price. The only other restaurant within walking distance was one fast food place.Staff was quite courteous. Hotel had pool and gym. Parking was free, but the covered parking garage was closed while we were there. In Texas in summer, leaving a car in the sun is NOT recommended.

<Content>OK hotel, they're trying; Security problems? Stayed 1 night on June 5, 08; Close to Love field. Neighborhood a little scary. Most memorable was 1st impression: A little golf cart patrolling the parking-lot with the words Security on the side. The people riding the cart are super-serious--think mall cop on steroids. Every new car that pulls in, they pull up behind you and watch you unload?? Wierd. Oh, and they took the trouble to install a headlight and a litte disco-light on top; Maybe the siren will be here for Christmas!!! Anyway, I questioned how secure the place was because of this. Signs everywhere to hide belongings in your car. Front desk denied that they had any crime problems. Looks like an old hotel with a fresh paint job. Actually smells like paint in the hallways. Room was HUGE, sitting area, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom(tiny). Bar and restaurant pretty good, fair prices; Staff seems very willing to help. Outdoor Pool was tiny, no one there, but they had a neat little concrete island in the middle. Poolside bar was closed up, not sure if they're open regularly or not. I think I got a larger room because I'd joined the Radisson Goldpoints program. Coffeemaker and free bottled water in rooms. Bring some microwave popcorn along.

<Content>Disappointed When my mother (who was at the hotel for a meeting) and I walked in on May 5 to book our room, we were told that the blocked room rate of $105 dollars for those attending the meeting could not be given to us because we 'booked out of the block.' The meeting started on May 6 at 8am and ended at 3pm on the same day; therefore, we got to the hotel the day before (like most people who come from out of town do) and found it strange that the hotel wouldn't extend the rate to the day BEFORE the meeting. The front desk staff was also not professional in my view (particularly the gentleman--and I do use the word lightly--that was there). We were told that we could not get a room for the $105 dollar rate and were put into an 'executive suite' which cost $149+ tax. The room itself was not bad with a sitting area, small kitchenette and adequate sleeping quarters, but it smelled so horrible on the 5th floor where we stayed! Apparently there was some renovation going on, but it smelled like several people had been smoking out in the hallway. The room itself had a so-so view (if you consider looking at a bank across the street a view) and the bed was a Sleep Number that didn't work all that well. The pillows were squishy and offered no support. The climate control was all right, but the air conditioner is disturbingly noisy when it's on. Street traffic was also noisy, calming down around 11 at night with the occasional siren interrupting our sleep. The television had three channels that were not tuned in (appeared to be local channels like ABC or CBS) and there was no television guide in the room. The bathroom was very small with the sink outside and the toilet and tub in a compact space behind a door. There were two very small trash cans in the room which I thought was ridiculous for a so-called executive suite. We ate at the hotel restaraunt--The Windows--the next day for lunch and it was good for the price ($9.69 total per person). We heard the other place to eat inside--Ray's--was not good so didn't bother. All in all, this is not a hotel I would recommend to anyone who wishes for quality or friendly service. Definite thumbs down.

<Content>Radisson Love Field - ONLY as a last resort! I book through Priceline and Hotwire, and I just cringe when I get this hotel. The staff is certainly friendly and helpful - they do try. But, their efforts just can't overcome what is otherwise a dilapidated structure that just needs to be torn down. (This used to be the Sheraton Brookhollow.) They recently completed a major renovation, and the first floor (AVOID AT ALL COSTS!) still reeks of paint or some such thing with very strong fumes. Despite the renovation, they kept those stupid doors between rooms that I don't think anyone ever uses (although this place does host large groups). The doors are NOWHERE near sound-proof, and if you have a neigbor, you will be privvy to their TV program selections, conversations, and whether or not they have a snoring problem. The combined shower/tub/toilet area is little bigger than a closet. And if you have a lower level room overlooking the pool - be sure to ask them to shut off the piped-in music to the pool area. It's now 1 AM, and I asked them to shut it off an hour ago, and it's still on, despite the fact it's WAY too cold for anyone to be out there. I will say, the private patios with chairs overlooking the pool are a very nice touch. Also, skip the hotel's breakfast buffet. Even with the $2 off voucher you find in your room, my breakfast buffet (and a rather limited buffet it is) came to $13. You can do FAR better at a Denny's. If there's a trade show in town, and this is all you can get, it'll work. But there's just no places to go and eat around this hotel, and it is on the fringes of what I consider to be a very marginal (read: risky) area replete with adult book stores, and sleazy bars.

<Content>Decent hotel As the other reviews said only one elevator worked, the room was clean. I had an amazing view of downtown Dallas from my 12th floor balcony. I was surprised I go that room since I only paid $49 per night on Priceline and the hotel was booked. Overall this is a decent hotel, I would not spend their going rate on it, however for the Priceline rate it was fine.

<Content>Older but nice New Year's Eve: Big pary going on, but no noise on the 4th floor. Hotel is older, but very clean and room was well appointed. Service was very helpful. From other reviews the hotel has been remodeling for some time (still going on) so lots of construction workers painting etc. Only one elevator was working so that was annoying, but we were on the 4th floor so took the stairs when we had to wait too long. Very good value.

<Content>Great Weekend We spent from Thursday through Sunday at the Radisson Love Field. In town for a meeting and holiday party. The weather wasn't the greatest...but the hotel was. Everyone was helpful, friendly and the hotel looked great. Our room was clean and comfortable. Upon returning at the end of the day we found that housekeeping did a really good job (we are not the neatest hotel guests I think). While riding the elevator a gentleman asked how our stay was - it turned out he was the GM, he seemed genuinely interested in our experience and was very nice.Saturday night we stopped by the bar for a drink - a bunch of cowboy fans had just arrived for the game the next day. They were having a great time  really made the bar fun.We will be back for sure.

<Content>Great service, average hotel Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel. When I had originally booked the room, they only had rooms with 2 double beds available. Although I wanted a king room, I booked anyway because hotels were filling up quickly for the big football weekend. This hotel offers a free shuttle to and from Love Field Airport. Upon arriving, I was switched to a king room and allowed to check in 2 hours early. Cynthia at the front desk was extremely helpful, friendly, and accomodating.One of the elevators didn't work properly and parts of the hotel were under renovation. The Sleep Number bed was either very hard on the high settings, or sunken in on the low settings.I'm not sure if I would stay here again.

<Content>How long can it take? In September 2006 I stayed at this property and left a review on the property. Ditto review for November 2007. They are still remodeling, and still have a clean room. I don't know if only one guy is doing all the work or they are just real slow but there are still coverings on the floor in the hallway, still have a limited menu on room service, still have crap everywhere,and still make you scratch your head and say, this place is weird. But the room was ok and the staff was nice. The only way I will stay here is if Priceline puts me here. It certainly is a nicer property than the Crowne Plaza down the street.

<Content>Fix the air conditioning and you would have a great hotel I stayed at this hotel for one night in January and liked it enough to book my week-long summer stay for the following June. However, in January I guess the air conditioning was not working either but it was not needed due to the cool weather. As soon as I stepped into the lobby I was greeted by the sound and effect of several (10+) fans and portable air conditioning units. The units seemed to do little to cool the place and it was very hot and humid - I felt sorry for the front desk girls that had to work in that heat. I asked about the problems and was told that the A/C was functioning fine in the rooms, which it was. I was subsequently told by another employee that the A/C had been broken as long as she had worked there, which she estimated at 18 months! Not sure why it would be broken for this long, but that seems excessive.Other than the lobby and hallway area A/C problems, everything was great. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The hotel shuttle took me to several different places within 5 miles of the property. I think downtown would have been outside of their range, but they may take you anyway.My room had a sliding door out to a balcony (10th floor, I think) which was nice as I could get some (hot) fresh air. Bathroom is a little small, but not to the point where it was a problem. Sleep number beds are OK, but I prefer a normal mattress. Seems to be more marketing than actual function, but whatever...The wireless internet access was free and worked well, after I figured out that the wireless radio nearest to my room was apparently not connected to the internet. I had to select a radio on another floor, but it worked fine once I did that.The bar was spacious, had 2 pool tables, and a decent menu. I received a free breakfast at the restaurante every morning, which was above average for a buffet style. It was very good and the waiter was very attentive to my needs.I stayed here while attending a show at the Dallas Market Center, and free shuttle service was provided to and from the complex. I did not spend much time at the hotel as I was either at the show or with business associates at dinner elsewhere.Overall, I would say that for the price this hotel is a decent value. If they would get the A/C fixed it would be great. I would stay here again, despite the A/C problems.

<Content>Renovation! Putting lipstick on the pig. They are currently putting the finishing touches on a renovation. It's like putting lipstick on a pig. The lobby and all common areas were 90 F because the AC had recently broke down and they had to order new. The pool was also close, no reason given. Not to fear, in the rooms there are the motel AC wall units that kept the room sort of cool yet it seemed humid at all times. My renovated room was nice size, with king bed, on the 10th floor. The window was so dirty on the outside it was difficult to see through. While it was freshly painted and papered there were water stains and peeling wall paper on the walls. The bathroom was SO small you had to leave to towel dry.There were new vanity, fixtures, and furnishings. But, theSleep Number bed is a silly gimmick with an vacuum blower attached. Just give me a decent bedding with clean decent linens and pillows and I'm good to go.I cut my visit short - it was terrible.No pro's at this one. Very dubious location on Mockingbird near Harry Hines. Panhandlers and creepy people abound.

<Content>A terrible place for a conference -- or anything else Wow, I wonder if the most recent reviews could have been staying at the same hotel. Because I just stayed there this week, and had one of the most terrible experiences I have ever had with a major hotel chain.We were there for a small conference, and our organization had to book there to get a hotel proximate to Love Field, from which one of our speakers would be flying just after presenting. The first night there, we felt as if we were trapped in a Seinfeld episode. There was no air-conditioning in the lobby because of the renovation, just temporary units wholly inadequate to cool it in Dallas in June. The bathrooms our conference attendees had to use were completely un-air conditioned, so it felt as if you were stepping into an oven. The woman working the front desk was a model of bad customer service. When someone asked her a question or raised a problem, she would loudly explain why it wasn't her fault, and eventually staff took to arguing with each other in the presence of customers. The bellman kept arguing with one of our party about where a restaurant was, couldn't figure out how far it was, offered to take us in the van, then said he had to pick someone up from the airport instead, and then when we asked for a cab, said isn't there one in front? We said no, we were just outside. He wouldn't believe us, and went out to look for himself. It still took five minutes after that for him to order us a cab. Of course, he had to take time to fight with the front-desk receptionist some more.At that point, we just started laughing, it was so bad. And while one can't blame the hotel for this, even the cabby wanted to argue that the restaurant was not in the Mockingbird Station (guess what -- it was!).The catering staff were, on the other hand, wonderful, the bar staff did its best to be helpful, and the sleeping rooms were OK. But the entire property was just not up to even minimal standards to hold a program. As a result, our attendees did not havea good experience, and our program suffered as a result.I would NEVER schedule another event at this hotel. And I am not a picky customer. But I do expect decent customer service, and this was just abysmal. Every day brought new horror stories from our attendees, most involving the front-desk staff, which is key of course in any hotel.

<Content>We loved the Radisson! We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Radisson Hotel Dallas Love Field, the staff was very friendly and helpful. We were impressed with how clean the rooms were. The hotel had a cafe that was open from 6am until 2pm, and a bar and grill that was open from 2pm until 11pm. Both offer room service for a nominal fee. The hotel isn't close to any malls, and restaurants are about 3 miles away. Overall it was nice to have a hotel that was so clean, and a staff that was very friendly.

<Content>Rennovation must have done wonders! I was a bit nervous after I booked this hotel through priceline (for a fantastic rate, by the way) when I read all the bad reviews from this site and others. However, after staying two nights at the Radisson this weekend, I have to say that it was one of the best hotel experiences I've had. The staff was friendly and helpful. The location was great. And the Sleep Number bed was the best hotel bed we've ever had. We had only minor complaints about the parking and the lack of a towel rack near the sink. But overall, it was an unbeatable deal through priceline for our weekend. It looks like the bad reviews came before the renovations or were just wrong.

<Content>Amazing Value--they get it! An amazing value, convenient to all Dallas has to offer. Two caveats--I got this room for $41 on Priceline, and was housed in an eight floor room; some have complained about the rooms in the lower building, and I did not see these accommodations. The hotel is very convenient to the highway without being noisy, and parking is plentiful and free. Lobby makes a great first impression--clearly newly renovated, it nearly sparkles. Front desk agent was perky and quite helpful--when I asked her for a king bedded room high up, she found one for me and added This is the kind of room pilots get--I assumed they get a lot of airline crews here, and there is a pecking order among these employees, pilots at the top of the list. Elevators were quick, and room, while not huge, was pleasantly sized and clearly fresh from a renovation. Beds are great, with Sleep Number mattresses and crisp, clean snowy white linens and fluffy duvets--all hotel rooms at every star level should take a cue from these. Bathroom was small but worked well--new granite topped vanity is inside the hotel room, while the toilet and bath/shower are inside the bathroom; curved shower rod--again all hotels take note--expands feeling of space in shower. Pressure adequate but not great. Wake up calls were on the dot punctual, albeit automated.Nice room for the money, but better still was the absence of nickel and diming that so many other hotels subject guests to--parking was free and guests have a choice of covered or openair. Wireless internet was free and available throughout the hotel--good, quick wifi too--and if you didn't bring your laptop, there is a small business center that is free with two computers and a printer (note to hotel--keep this in good repair; mouse was flaky)--great for printing airline boarding passes. Fitness center is free, and while the room was recently renovated, the equipment--three bikes, a treadmill, a stair machine, and some weights--could use an update. Was told that will happen in a few months (note to hotel--make it happen sooner than later, as for this workout fan, it was the single biggest disappointment) Bottled water was free in room and free in the fitness center. Just these things alone in some hotels would have cost $41, even if the room were free. . .Hotel location perfect--with Las Colinas and the Cedar Springs crossroads both just 10 minutes drive--Highland Park Village is about the same distance, and downtown isn't much further. Love Field for SWA fliers is right around the corner, and the hotel provides a free shuttle; DFW is about 20 minutes away.At $41, this hotel was an exceptional value, and kudos to the hotel's management for a nice experience in this category. If this hotel is an apt reflection of Radisson today, I'd gladly try more of this chain's properties. And certainly, I'd stay here again in Dallas. . .

<Content>We did fine I have to say that we thought we did well at this Radisson. It looked like the renovations were done. The room was clean, quiet and comfortable and the staff above average. The first floor lobby and conference rooms are very strangely laid out and disorienting (at least to me). The covered parking is not convenient, but those things cannot be changed very easily. We particuarly liked the access to Love and it's central location. There was heavy ice and freezing rain that weekend and it was a great place to return to quickly and easily as the weather changed.

<Content>poorly maintained I booked the Radisson to be reasonably near Love Field for a quick in and out business trip to Dallas. The hotel was booked through my office rate of about $100 with taxes. I found it to be a poorly managed and maintained property and I won't return. I first was given a room with obviously stained and dirty carpet. I changed that room and ended up in a handicap room with no heat , and with shower water which varied from ice cold to scalding hot and nothing in between. There was also poor housekeeping in the room, without going into detail. There is something particularly gnawing about being in an expressway hotel in central Dallas with a well-known name where it is obvious that the owner puts back in as little as possible without regard to the traveler. Other reviewers talk of renovations. The hotel may be doing something in part of the hotel but do not believe for a minute that this is a fully renovated hotel. This is the type of property which gives the American travel industry a bad name.

<Content>A clean quiet hotel Clerks are nice. They meet my extra requirements. I bid from priceline and got good deal. The construction is almost done. It's quiet. I got the room beside the swimming pool. Although the party in ballroom is noise, it stopped before midnight. Overall it meets my expectation.

<Content>Renovatrions.....call me when you're finished! Picked up a room here on priceline.com at $49. I was concerned after I鈥檇 read the reviews. I got a room in the 鈥渢ower鈥?that was just ok...at least it was non-smoking and with a king bed. The furniture was a little frayed, esp. since this was a 鈥渘ew鈥?room. Basically I was pleased with cleanliness. The attitude of some employees left a lot to be desired! I had to call the bell stand 3 times before they stopped hanging up on me鈥ot 鈥渆xcellent鈥?service! The rooms are small with the vanity in the room entrance. Very 1970鈥檚! The renovations seem to be progressing. They are on the 3rd owner in 3 years! No matter what they do here, it will always be a 鈥?0鈥檚 Sheraton! BTW, don鈥檛 rely on the numbers on the phone鈥ll are incorrect! Not terrible, just sloppy, very sloppy!

<Content>Needed Renovation in progress at the Radisson When we arrived, we heard a guest that was checking out complaining about service. When we stepped up to check-in, the hotel staff could not find our reservation from a third party site. They finally found it. We were given two twin beds when my reservation was for a single king sized bed. The carpet was in bad shape and the room smelled. We went back to the front desk and requested a new room. We were given a king sized bed in a different room. This room was ok. No refrigerator, no microwave so we could not even store the drinks or leftover food we brought with us on the roadtrip. The ice machine on that floor was unplugged. The TV reception was horrible. I discovered the hotel was being renovated, so I hope it will be in better shape in the future.

<Content>A good hotel Reading some of the reviews in this website I was a bit apprehensive, particularly since I booked the room thru priceline. I requested a non-smoking room with a king bed on check-in and was given one and it was a corner room overlooking the highway which was nice. Thankfully they didnt put us up in the short tower which seems to be the most problematic portion of the hotel. The room was neat and the entire floor was non-smoking but the room still smelled like a smoking room. The hotel was very old looking from the outside and looked more like a 2* on the inside unlike the 3* it is supposed to be. The bathroom was too small and the high speed internet didnt work. The room was tidy and the facilities were good. The swimming pool was real good. Me and my girlfriend enjoyed our stay here. I guess if you are put up in the tall tower it is ok. And if you book thru priceline remember to go as close to the check-in time as possible so that you can get a better room!

<Content>No Love Loss for this Radisson I was pleased with the bargain price and location close to several expressways and easy to get to downtown Dallas. However, we had paid for a room with a king size bed and high speed internet access in advance through [------]. When we arrived at 4:00 in the afternoon, no room with a king size bed was available. We were given a dark, dingy-looking room with double beds near the back of the hotel. Plus, neither the LAN nor wireless internet worked in my room, which meant that I couldn't do any work.We almost left the hotel and checked in to somewhere else, and if it hadn't been just a 2-night stay we would have, but it was just too much work to try to choose a better alternative. After complaining to the front desk, we got moved to another room with a king size bed, which was an improvement, but they NEVER could get the internet access to work in our room. Even in the nicer room, there were some noticeable cracks in the wall and the ceiling.The food was reasonably priced but mediocre. We ate most our meals from outside restaurants. Only one floor in the hotel had a vending machine, and most selections remained sold out during our entire stint at the hotel. They had a great pool that was rarely used by guests, and the fitness area was a disappointment.I didn't mind the Radisson being an older hotel. The bottomline is that the accommodations were subpar. Perhaps it will be better when all their renovations are completed. Nevertheless, no way is it a 3-star hotel. We came from a 3-star hotel traveling in from Los Angeles, and they were worlds apart. I would not recommend the Radisson Dallas Love Field to anyone, and I don't plan on staying there again.

<Content>Good deal My husband and I stayed at the Radisson for two nights in the middle of May. We booked a NS King room with a sleep number bed. Im not 100% that the sleep number bed is worth the extra $15, but it was fun to try out without purchasing it. My number was 35 ;)Anyway, we checked in pretty late and were given a room right across from the elevator (811). I was nervous about noise but I never heard anything. Our room was clean, didnt smell like smoke. The bathroom is a little small, but about what to expect from a 3 star. We left early morning the next day and didnt return until 4pm. Our room hadnt been made up which isnt the end of the world, but disappointing since we had been gone a long time. We did have breakfast at their breakfast buffet, which I do not recommend. For $9 a person I expect a little bit more selection that some scrambled eggs, bacon and fruit. Id definately go down the street somewhere else.The location is great and I think if we ever do back to a football game we will stay here. Its a good value, not upscale by any means, but clean.

<Content>Not recommended I stayed here with my wife and baby daughter on a weekend getaway. Overall we were disappointed by the hotel. Most importantly for us, the hotel website states that cribs are available- on arrival we were told that the hotel has no cribs.Aside from this, the hotel location is good for Love Field airport and a short drive from downtown Dallas.The general standard of the accommodation was poor- our room had seen better days and the bed linen was not clean. Also our non-smoking room was on a floor with some smoking rooms and the corridors smelled strongly of cigarette smoke.This hotel might be ok for a night if all you want is a bed but was not up to the standard of a Holiday Inn.

<Content>Not Radisson Quality The pillows were terrible and my air conditioner did not work so the room was muggy. It is an okay place to stay if you have a cheap deal but don't expect Radisson quality. It is equivalent to an average Holiday Inn.

<Content>Good Deal We got a very good deal on this hotel on Priceline. Here is a rundown:The Positive - Close to highway and usually within 10-15 minutes of attractionsBusiness center with free high speed InternetStaff was very friendly overall (although we aren't too demanding like some)Didn't use the pool but they have oneGot an unbeatable price!The Negative-The hotel is a bit on the older side. Our room had stains on the carpet and could have used some updated, but was over all clean.Only one elevator was working which could be a painThere was only 1 working computer in the business center so we often couldn't use the Internet when we wanted.If you get a good deal, and aren't one of the picky elite that often aren't pleased by anything, I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Don't be fooled Don't believe the prior negative reviews of this hotel. I was very pleasantly surprised; this is a solid 3-star hotel. Very nice room, although I did ask for a renovated room. Nice lobby area also. Did not have any problem with this hotel at all. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Does not even deserve to be rated I booked the hotel through hotwire, and the hotel staff charged my CC for the time being there. After calling them so many times, and speaking to the manager and the accountant, and everyone else, they still refuse to give me my money back. They keep saying, that is done and that it should be on my bank account any second- but it is all bunch of bs.

<Content>Be sure o get a good rate I was part of a group of 4 people who stayed at the Radisson Hotel Dallas Love field for a total of 13 nights in January 2006.Odd. Very odd.I came back one day and found my dop kit all packed up, when I had left my toothbrush, dental floss, etc., on the bathroom counter. One day I had creamer for the coffee, next day I had no creamer, and the day after no creamer and no sugar.One day I had left the cap off of the shampoo, and since it was 2/3 empty, I assumed that I'd get new shampoo. Instead, I came back and found the 2/3 empty bottle still in the shower, but the cap was gone, and no new bottle was left to use.One of the guys in our group came back to his room and found all of his bath towels gone...which was unusual, since he was staying by himself.If they are truly remodeling, there's little or no supervision of the physical plant and housekeeping.Dented Lampshades, Marks on the new wallpaper, stains on the new desks.OK...Convenient, clean, safe and quiet.But, get a good rate.

<Content>Not getting better. I stay in hotels three weeks out of each month...I'm young and can hadle a lot of things. This is my second time staying here. The first time I was not impressed but was assured that things were on the up. I have to say that the staff was doing everyting they could do, but definetly reflected the weaknesses of the hotel...the food was horrible once again. I thought that because the resturant wasn't open the first time, that this hampered the room service food, boy was I ever wrong. The steak and the chicken were mostly fat and way over spiced.The rooms are only renovated on three of the floors, so if you decide to stay there ask for one of them, b/c like the past reviews the ones that are not are absolutely horrible. Open vents with bugs in them, stained furniture, carpets, ect..I'm not that picky, I don't care if I get a king or dbl. or if the staff is busy they don't attend to me right away...but when I pay hotel prices for food I expect a better than Denny's quality, so even after renovations I won't stay here again.I actually met the owner, whom seemed really into getting feedback from guests in the bar, but he was kind of a airhead also. I wouldn't do business with him.
