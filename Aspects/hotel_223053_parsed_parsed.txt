<Content>Very Pleasant Stay at this Hotel This hotel just went through a very nice upgrade. I stayed here on business and was pleasantly surprised at the improvements. My room was clean, the staff was wonderful. I enjoyed the on-site restaurant, which had good food and excellent service. I had a TV problem, called the front desk and maintenance had it fixed in 10-minutes! I travel regularly and I recommend this hotel and I will not hesitate to stay here again!

<Content>Office Holiday Party Recently our office had their holiday party at this property.Hugo and all of the staff were extremely helpful and made it a wonderful event. They were very accomodating even when we made some last minute requests and changes to our needs for our banquet room. Everyone one there went over and above to make our event the best yet. Hope that we can continue this annual party there next year.

<Content>Great rates, but at what cost? I recently went on a trip to dallas and stayed at this hotel. The rates per night where great for the quality the location, but I cant say I was overall satified with the service of the staff. I had to wait an hour to check in all the while people where checking in. The shower drain doesnt drain very well and the water pressure is very up and down. Also I found a roach behind the couch. I am now experiencing difficulties with overcharges from the hotel and no matter how many times I call I can never seem to get a manager. Overall I do not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good value After reading the other reviews I was very nervous about staying at this hotel, but it was a great deal and close to my meeting so I decided to brave it. I was pleasantly surprised! The carpet in my room was brand new and it looked like they were making many other improvements as well. I was not at all inconvenienced by any work going on in the hotel and the staff was very eager to please if there was a problem. The breakfast buffet included an omelet bar, pancakes, oatmeal, and fresh fruit. I felt like it was a great deal and I didn't have to settle for an egg mcmuffin (although there is a McDonald's just outside the hotel if you like that.) The rooms are not huge but I only needed it to sleep in and for the price I paid it was more than adequate. I would definitely come back.

<Content>Just ok Our standard room was under $100 so probably a good value for north central Dallas. They were painting and switching out all the linens so the hallways were a mess. Perhaps they tried to overcome the paint smell with carpet frangrance but it was too strong. Our room just plain smelled bad. When we arrived our room was missing pillows and wash cloths. They corrected that quickly. Our room had little floor space and felt cramped. This is an older facility. No complimentary breakfast was included. We will not go back.

<Content>Stay away from this dump. Horrible property, dirty and cheap. You might think this Wyndham should be a nice place but it is comparable to a motel 6 and attracts the same type of guest. Renovations that they promote are poor at best. Front desk staff is rude and flat out lied to me. I was given a room that was already occupied! Check your sheets for cleanliness. Don't expect much if you plan to stay here and I recommend you look elsewhere.

<Content>Worst Hotel Experience Ever The room was very small, the bathroom only had room for a standing alone sink. The AC wouldn't work on low. We didn't have a pillowtop mattress as advertised. The worst part, the elevator door closed on my husband's arm and left a large bruise and blood running down his arm. There were 3 employees of the hotel in the elevator and did nothing. The halls were very hot. The door into the hotel closed on me while going in.The employees at the front desk were very rude. Not ample parking.

<Content>Good hotel value Although check in was a bit slow, they needed more help at 4:30 PM, and I was accidentally sent to the wrong room on a smoking floor which was immediately corrected to the non-smoking room I had booked, but after I had to stand in line 15 more minute, it was on the most part a very nice hotel. It was a good value for the price, they had a great breakfast included with the room on the package I purchased online. We are talking a complete buffet with fruit, made to order omelets, juice, coffee etc. Very good. They also have a very nice bar with 1/2 price margaritas at happy hour. The restaurant was closed the night we wanted to eat there, but they will serve you a complete southwestern menu at the tables in the bar, and since no one was smoking, it was quite pleasant, and the food was really good and reasonably priced. The room was VERY clean, and the beds extremely comfortable. I would guess that the bedding was new since it was so comfortable. All and All it was a pleasant stay, about 30 minutes East of DFW and well located right off of 635 East.

<Content>The Worst Hotel Ever We chose this hotel because we were going to be in Dallas for an extended stay (11 Days) for my daughter to be in the hospital. The rate was good and that was the only thing good about this hotel. It was dirty, service was horrible. Our room was not cleaned for two days. We ran out of toliet paper and took hours to get another role. We had to have our key cards changed or redone over 30 times. When I brought this to the attention of the manager, she said that happens!. The hotel ran out of coffee so there was none in the rooms. The restaurant food while decent was horribly overpriced, orders were incorrect, and the staff inflexible. The shuttle service was discontinued in the middle of one day without notice, leaving my daughter and elderly mother on their own to find a way back to the hotel. They were supposed to call a cab for my elderly father and did not. The staff would say they would do something and then just not do anything, or the front desk would not answer. Marie at the front desk tried to be helpful. Most complaints were not handled well and some never even attempted. I gave a list of complaints on the way out the manager did not offer to do anything except blame me and give me her card and ask to come back. I have stayed in hotels in many states and several countries and for many different prices, and this was by far the worst experience of them all.

<Content>Horrible! One of the worst hotel expereinces I have had in a long time. As a frequent business traveler, I only require a clean room/hotel and a courteous staff. Though the hotel is in the midst of a remodel, that is not an excuse for dirty rooms and a poor staff. I was sent to three different rooms that already had guests asleep in them (note, I arrived at 10:30 pm). The fourth room had dirty carpet, not to mention the 2 bugs crawling on the bathroom floor. Too tired/late to change hotels, I was put in a 5th room (a smoking room and I am a NON-smoker). Within 15 minutes another guest used a key provided by the desk at his check-in, to attempt to get in (he apologized profusely!). The next morning when I told the front desk about all of the issues, I simply got a Sorry about that!. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again - and sadly, will approach all Wyndams with caution in the future.

<Content>Rough hotel in a rough part of town Where do I begin? - The hotel is run-down and in desperate need of a renovation. Examples include stains in the carpet everywhere - even in the lobby, mold in the bathrooms, burned out lightbulbs, - Unfriendly staff. I'm a Wyndham ByRequest member and I verified when I made the reservation that my member number was included in the reservation. When I checked in, they had no idea I was a member and I did not get my complimentary drink or cookie. - The second day of the stay my room key card did not work. Twice. Three sets of keys and three trips back down to the lobby before they figured out the issue. Not one apology or mention of my time being wasted or inconvenence. Just a shrug from an indifferent front desk clerk.- The bar is too dark and the bartender is clueless. She may be a nice person but she has no idea how to bartend. The gin and tonic I ordered was water. The draft beer she poured was fine, but then again it is hard to screw up a draft beer!There are plenty of other hotels within a few miles. Most are more money and I will gladly pay more - a lot more - versus staying at this hotel again.

<Content>Could use some improvments, but good location I stayed here on a recent business trip to Dallas. The room seemed old and musty smelling. The bed was extremely uncomfortable and the pillows didn't have much support. I expect a bit more from the Wyndham.The bathroom was not exactly clean as I found several hairs that did not belong to me. I also seemed to have problems getting the A/C to stay on and not continually shut off.My group did enjoy the bar area for a few cocktails and the complimentary shrimp cocktail was a nice surprise. I probably would look for another hotel in the area if visiting Dallas in the future.

<Content>Not up to expectation I would have to agree with all the negative reviews! I just stayed here on the 19-20 Aug 2006. I booked the webrate. I have stayed at the Wyndham Corporate overlooking Six Flags in the past and was looking for a comfortable hotel near the Smirnof Centre after the Dave Mathews concert. I guess you get what you pay for. I had a king size bed that basically took up the whole room. The internet, what a joke. $10 a day extra charge, get with the current times. The hallways smelled of an ashtray. I guess if you are into just laying your head down and not looking for the pampering this might be the place for you. The location I will say is great but I expect more from the Dallas park area. The hotel reminded me of a low end motel. They spend all this money on the lobby, bar and resturant, they might want to consider updating the rest of the (motel). I find the appearance to be short coming as well. I had a great view of a dumpster and alot of overgrown foliage. I would most definately not stay here again. Oh I almost forgot, I stood at the lobby desk upon check out for nearly 10 minutes before saying to the desk clerk in a back office, I'd like to check out before the cut-off time.

<Content>Not the best out there The rooms are extremely small (I could not have stayed a week). There was some mold on the tile around the tub faucet. I felt that I needed to put towels down on the bathroom floor to walk through it. You have to pay for internet access. TV viewing is very limited, although, you could pay $12.99 to watch a new release or $3.99 to watch a sea lion program on the Discovery channel. We did watch a program on National Geographic channel for free. Breakfast buffett is $9.95 for one buffet. I made one local phone call for 50 cents.  They have advertised on the website that a sony playstation is included with room and I called to find out what games/movies they have available and was told they no longer have playstations in the room. I asked if we could bring ours and hook it up and they told me that we could, but when we arrived there was no way to hook a playstation the way they have the TV hooked up. I do have to say that all the employees are extremely friendly. I forgot my shampoo and the shampoo that they provided was really good shampoo. I normally use pantene and was afraid my hair would feel icky, but it did not. I would not recommend this hotel to a friend.

<Content>Great Deal My fiance and I stayed at the Wyndham for the weekend. For the price we paid, we were shocked at how nice the hotel was. The staff was excellent and everything was above our expectations. You could tell that the hotel was a little older, but who were we to complain. The only thing I could find wrong was that the pillows were a little lumpy, so you might want to bring your own. Other than that, the hotel was perfect for us.

<Content>A good stay at a really good price A great location right off LBJ and around the corner from the galleria....we had two nice and quiet nights at the Wyndham. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the restaurant (Sophie's) had a nice breakfast buffet and the rooms were clean and comfortable. A very good deal at the $75 a night rate I got, especially after shopping Manhattan hotels for next month!

<Content>Good hotel in a good location A good hotel which served me well for a week's exploring the area. The only down-side was the quality of the rooms. The carpet was badly stained, the shower head had come away from the wall, the bath plug was broken and the tiling dirty in places.For the price I paid, it was OK.

<Content>Great deal in Dallas This hotel is a great deal for a nice room. We paid $43 for a Saturday night stay. This price was way less than lower quality hotels. The location is close to 635 and 75 making it easy to get around Dallas. The lobby is very tastefully decorated with granite floors, a library area, and a bar. Check in was quick and easy. We were on the 5th floor. I didn't get a chance to eat at the restaurant but it looked nice. The rooms are very nice with a comfortable bed and lots of pillows. The TV is large and sits within an armoire. There is ample living area inside the room. The bathroom is very nicely decorated with a pedestal sink and iron rod towel holder. The shower is nice sized and has a adjustable shower head. The shampoo and soaps are an upscale brand and smelled very good. The AC in the room works well and although the property is close to the freeway you don't hear it. The only problem is that the elevator is a way down the hotel and is very slow. The ice maker is located right in the middle of the property making it easy to get ice. The room is well lit with two nice lamps and a desk light where you can connect to high speed internet ($10 charge). For $43 this was a great deal and I would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>Not as great as the reviews say I'm currently sitting in my room at this hotel connected via a 10.00 per day extra charge and I have to say that I am dissapointed in this hotel. While the price was cheap, for the reviews I saw on this site I expected a very nice room. When I got to the hotel the lobby is very nice and the person at the desk was curteous and efficient, but as I went to my room on the second floor the smell of smoke in the hallway was very strong. The room itself has a very very musty smell. The carpet looks very old and the wallpaper looks like it's about to start peeling at the seams. The room is rather small. The bathroom is clean and functions well, it seems like it might have been remodeled in the not too distant past, but it is very small as well. There is no counter at the sink only a pedestal basin. There is basically no soundproofing between the bathroom and the room itself, and the fan in the bathroom does pretty much nothing for the steam from the shower. The channels on the TV come in fuzzy as well. I haven't yet checked out the rest of the hotel or the pool. But basically, it's okay for the price, but it's small and the musty smell bothers me.

<Content>Wyndham Fan For Life! This had to be the best hotel I have ever stayed in! It had the most beautiful, cleanest bathrooms, best staff, and nicest rooms, especially for the price. I am extremely happy with how everything turned out. I was a bit worried because I got such a great webdeal, but it was perfect! This is the ONLY hotel I will ever stay in the next time I visit Dallas!

<Content>Represented Dallas well The 2 night stay back in October 2004, made our mini-vacation so much more relaxing than expected. My husband  I travel often and don't mind settling for a hole in the wall hotel for a quick sleep over. BUT, this vacation was a real treat. NOT a hole in the wall at all!!. It was TOTAL LUXURY for us. We didn't know what to expect since we had a very good room rate from an on line booking service, but we were more than pleased upon arrival. The staff was exceptional and so were the very, very nice rooms. Thanks.

<Content>Best Deal in Town There are many hotels in Dallas leading to some good prices in comparison compared to cities that offer fewer rooms relative to the number of visitors to the carea, so finding deals on room rates is no surprise. But being able to get a room at this little Wyndham property for $40-70 is a real steal. The only issue with the hotel is that the elevator is somewhat inaccessible unless you park by a particular door, but that hardly seems such a big deal with the nice rooms and excellent atmosphere. There is a library like sitting room between the lobby and bar that just beckons the traveler to sit and rest a while.

<Content>Quite Pleased I found this hotel online with some great amenities for the price. The lobby is very stylish and the restaurant is wonderful with a great view of the pool. The staff is attentive and they made sure that I was comfortable. My room was clean and comfortable. It is close to the highway which made traveling through the city very easy, but not so close where there was a lot of noise. I would definitely stay at this hotel the next time I'm in Dallas.

<Content>Treated Like A VIP! Upon arrival at the hotel after driving for 4 hours, and looking tired and rumpled, we were graciously welcomed by a friendly, smiling front desk agent. After a quick check-in, we headed down the interior hall to our room. When we opened the door, much to our surprise, we found feather pillows on the bed, and a snack and cold drinks waiting for us on the desk! In the bathroom were luxurious Golden Door Spa toiletries. The room was clean and had a fresh scent. The furnishings appeared to be new and were very stylish. A few minutes later, the front desk called and asked if we were satisfied with the room. What a nice gesture! There is a sitting room adjacent to the front desk that has exquisite furnishings--the perfect place to meet or converse prior to dinner--or afterward--or anytime! Dinner in the restaurant was excellent--great food, great service--and the prices were very reasonable. The pool area is also an excellent place to wind down after a busy day shopping. I will definitely stay at this hotel again next time I visit Dallas!
