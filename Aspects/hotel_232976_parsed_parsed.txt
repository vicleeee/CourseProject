<Content>Fair...not horrible, not fantastic - great location Okay cleanliness, but because we had a small sitting area outside our room, we were comfortable. If we didn't have that, I think I would have a different review. It is noisy, but really easy walk from the SMN train station. The mattresses were saggy, the people were wonderfully friendly. One good thing..one bad thing...wasn't perfect, but definitely not a trip spoiler. Patrizio was so enthusiastic about his city that it made it feel very welcoming despite less than stellar rooms.

<Content>A Nice Hotel in a Convenient Location with Great Staff This was a great find in a convenient location. It's close to the train station, right next to the river, close enough to the touristy sights that it's an easy walk, but far enough that you get a break from the chaos.Our room was clean and spacious (with a HUGE bathroom) and was very quiet. Between the silence and the shutters, we slept like we were in a tomb!The front desk staff were incredibly accommodating and helpful with both hotel-related things and sightseeing help. There are lots of good restaurants in the area and breakfast at the hotel was good and offered an incredible cappuccino.

<Content>Good stay Hotel was clean and the staff were pleasant and willing to help. Train station was a five minute walk away and the river only one minute away. Rooms were clean and bathroom well equipped and clean as well. Anyone who is not happy with their stay really should book a more expensive hotel. This hotel is reasonably priced and no complaints from me because we were made very welcome and the friendly staff were very willing to help. A pleasant stay in a nice little hotel with good staff and service and I would return any time.

<Content>Wonderful hotel Had read other reviews and think they must have stayed at some other hotel. I traveled with 2 other women and we found room very sufficient, bathroom HUGE and well equipped, breakfast filling and healthful. We loved the antique decor and found all aspects of the hotel very clean. We especially commend the hotel staff; one of my friends broke her wrist and staff helped us with cabs, translation problems, phone card , etc. The wonderful Andre even made us coffee when we had to leave at 5:15 AM to make our flight home. Only problem: no working phone in our room, but we were able to use the one at desk any time we wanted.

<Content>Not too bad. not that great - Has the basics My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in the middle of November. We stayed in room 9 (1st floor). The staff was great - friendly, helpful, and very attentive. While the hotel is not located in the middle of the city, it was a short walk to the main sites and the train station. A short walk is not a big deal at all - when you visit Italian cities, you walk and you walk a lot. In 10 - 15 minutes you'll be at Ponte Veccio and the Uffizi. The room was medium sized although the tv was extremely small. That said, who really cares about the tv . . . you are in Florence! (the only english channel was CNN). The bathroom was enormous - tub, shower and a ton of floor space.Breakfast was alright, but our experience at 2 other hotels in Rome and Venice is that breakfasts in Italy are generally nothing great - nothing like American breakfasts. This place had some different cereals, scrambled eggs, bread, fruit, and juice.The main issue was that the hotel room did not have heat. The heater/AC unit did not work. After the 1st night, I told the staff and was told it would be look at it. We came back later in the afternoon and it still was broken. I asked for another room - Florence was cold at night in mid Nov - and was told there were nothing available. The following morning we again mentioned the issue and were told that it would be fixed that day. We came back in the afternoon and were told it was fixed. We checked and, of course, it did not work. We asked to move to another room and were brought to room 3. I first checked the heat before we moved and it did not work either. We stayed in our room since we only had one additional night.Another issue was that the phone in the room did not work. After the first night, we were told that the problem was somewhere in the walls and was complex to fix. The staff offered us the use of the phone behind the desk or in their office, even offering to have the people leave the office and close the door. The phone in other room we were brought (but did not move to) worked.If it wasn't for the heat issue, the rating would be above average - but it was cold.

<Content>A dissonant view I will be one of the few to recommend this hotel and I really can't understand all the bad reviews.I got a room on the first floor, facing Via Curtatone, with a small balcony. Room was small, but enough for solo traveller, and bathroom too. Telephone, TV and fridge worked well.Hotel staff was courteous and breakfast was a nice surprise for italian standarts: a large selection of cakes, breads, rolls, cheeses, eggs and a great espresso.I don't know if I got lucky and picked up a renovated room or something else, but my experience seems far better than the ones described in other reviews.

<Content>Craphole Cons: Disgusting rooms, filthy and ridiculously tiny. Noisy, no AC. Have not been updated in perhaps 30-40 years; terribly overpriced for the quality provided.Pros: Pleasant stuff, close to the train station (but not to the main attractions); breakfastBottom line: STAY AWAY; consider ONLY if you absolutely don鈥檛 care where you stay.

<Content>Reasonably priced for a reason We stayed in room 112, right next to the very noisy lift which you could hear every time it was used from the toom. The building and room is very dated and the air conditioning was very weak. Our so called double bed was just two beds pushed together, the TV was tiny and very old. Our window view was of an open space facing a dirty old building which left the room very dreary and dull. The breakfast was nothing to write home about either, we ended up just leaving most of it on the plate and went hungry for the day. The receptionist was very welcoming and helpful and had great English but we would look for another hotel next time if we went there.

<Content>Wonderful Place to stay We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Argentina. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location was very good for the price. Close to Santa Maria Novella Station. Breakfast was great and it was very convenient to have internet access available (computer supplied by the hotel). Our room was a good size by Italian standards and everything was very clean although the placement of the toilet, bidet and tub were very tight...anyone over 5'9' might have an issue with knees up against the tub. Our room was air conditioned with an individual unit. It didn't work very well, but was tolerable. The truth is we spent very little time in the hotel room . We left the hotel each day fortified after a delicious breakfast and wonderful coffee. We returned each night after full and exciting days discovering Florence tired and happy and ready to sleep.We would stay there again.

<Content>Worst night in Italy Ever We dropped our bags in the room then spent a wonderful evening sighseeing and drinking in the atmosphere. of Florence. We then returned to the hotel later in the evening after a superlative meal to a very dingy and loud room permeated by vespa's shooting off from the crossing below. The sound proof doors didn't close, the walls were marked heavily and the atmosphere was dingy. The hotel was rated as 3 star but felt well below this. We decided to check out at 11:00pm and found much better accommodation down the road. The night clerk was totally unhelpful and charged us for the night despite the fact we hadn't stayed at all!! Abominable service.Steer clear of these guys, the star rating of 3 is well above the reality here.

<Content>Good hotel, with some problems The hotel itself is lovely, but we did have a few problems. There were four of us traveling so we booked 2 rooms. Both were supposed to have 2 twin beds but when we arrived we were told that they had us down for one room with 2 twin beds and one room with a king size bed. As a result, my mother and I were forced to share the room with the king size bed. Another problem was that the internet was not working and was never fixed throughout our 3 night stay. Also, there were no english speaking TV channels, not even CNN. All of the other hotels in other countries I have stayed at have at least had CNN. The positives were that the location of the hotel was good, the room was nice and the bathroom was large and modern. The breakfast was good - hard rolls, meats and cheeses, yogurt, cereal, baked goods, juices, etc. The staff was fine - I wouldn't say they were overly friendly or helpful, but they certainly were not rude or unaccomodating. One of the people at the desk did give us a good recommendation for a restaurant on our first night there. Florence itself was wonderful! Here's a tip - if you plan on going to the Academia to see the David, which is phemonenal, book your tickets ahead of time. We didn't and waited in line for 2 1/2 hours. The same goes for the Uffizi, or any other big tourist destinations in Italy, such as the Vatican museum.

<Content>A good stay! Excellent location for train and access to sites. Really odd shower, with shower head reluctant to cooperate, and funny little seat in the bottom. Very small bathroom. Really great breakfast. Free internet in lounge. Close to supermarket and laundromat.

<Content>Very pleasant hotel Pleasant hotel, located 5 mins walk from the SM Firenze station. Large double room with patio doors opening onto a small terrace. Terrace was overlooking a busy street which was great for people watching, but the shutters and double glazed doors kept out the noise when required. Mini-bar and roomy clean bathroom.Small breakfast area which could be a bit chaotic, but good variety of breakfast - cereals, fruit juices, yoghurt, cheeses, hams, bread rolls and pastries.PC available with free internet access. Luggage storage following checkout. Pleasant staff. Great pattiserie underneath, few minutes stroll to some great trattorias and the river Arno.The hotel is an amalgamation of two hotels, we stayed in the former 'Curtone' section.Nice location, not in the main tourist centre but within a few mins walk.

<Content>Do not book this hotel Hotel Argentina Florence Do not stay hereMy husband and I booked a 2 night stay in May. We were told that they had no electrity on the 2nd floor so they had booked us into a better hotel. We travelled acoss the city to find a grotty 2 star hotell and not the 4 star as promised. We phone tha Argentina and Andre Gardenti had the cheek to say the hotel had just been awarded a 3rd star that day. Total lie. Our stay in Florence was totally ruined by this hotel. We also think they had just doubled booked us and the electricity story was also a lie.

<Content>Awful The Hotel Argentina bought the Hotel Curtatone next door and opened a door in the wall. It has all deteriorated to the Argentina's low-level standards.When we got there we were confused because there was a paper arrow taped to the door of the Curtatone pointing to the Argentina entry. The lobby is a miserable hodge podge of furniture with deteriorated finishes. My heart sunk when I saw it. The desk clerk tried to give us rooms on an upper floor of the Argentina although I'd booked the Curtatone. I flatly refused to follow him and made him give us the rooms we had booked.Unfortunately, the Curtatone side of the hotel has not been updated since we were there several years ago and the lovely carpets, drapes and furniture are filthy. The walls haven't been painted and the bathrooms could use a good cleaning instead of a damp mopping.The breakfast is just shy of better than starving and it is delivered by the surliest waitress in Florence. She'll give you a coffee grudgingly at least. The room was 80 Euros for a double booked through Venere.If you can find anything closer to the center of town with a good review...book it! We didn't mind the remote location of the Curtatone before because it was such a charming place. We would never stay at the Argentina now.I wish I could have discerned this change in recent Tripadvisor posts before I went. I hope I save someone else some disappointment.

<Content>A definite NO This is the worst hotel I hav ever stayed in, It was old and tatty-despite what the pictures look like. The lift was really small and really old. The room itself was fine but no extras at all. Bed and wardrobe, no safe box, no hairdrier etc. The ensuite was tiny and the shower was really old. The manager was totally rude and I would definitely tell people not to stay here. I have never written a bad review before and wouldn't be picky, but this just was a really bad hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel We visited the Hotel Argentina trough the suggestion of one of our firends. We were extremely surprised at the fact that this site did not have any reviews for this little jewel! We found ourselves extremely well, the staff was very accomodating and well mannered. The building is very old but the hotel seems to have been restructured recently. The rooms are very nice and cozy, the buffet breakfast was extremely good.We were extremely surprised to find a hotel that is within walking distance of the center of Florence (we walked all day everyday) but far enough that it was quiet at night.I would suggest it to anyone that asked me a suggestion on where to stay on their visit of Florence.
