<Content>Smallest Hotel Rooms Ever ! I don't know why this hotel still in business ! Heck the rooms are so tiny and you don't have space between twin beds and if you got a big luggage like me and my sister you will likely to have problems moving around the room. The only good side on this hotel is that it is near the MTR and Nathan Road and it pays of real well if you are really tired because of the long walk and in front of our room has Ice dispenser which came in handy at night when I need a drink of beer. Stay away from this hotel. You are way better off on other hotels near the area.

<Content>Overpriced and tiny rooms The Kowloon is past it's use by date and needs a total refurbishment. It has traded on its location for too long and is not up to international standard. As mentioned by many others, rooms are too small to leave open a large suitcase as beds took up total space in room and very minimal cupboard space.Bathroom showing signs of deterioration around shower and toilet base. Internet very expensive; used it about four times for less than 15 mins each time and it cost nearly as much as fee for one month at home.Will choose another hotel next time.

<Content>Never Again When we arrived at the front of the hotel we thought wow.We walked to reception to check in, then one of the friendly staff started telling us about an upgrade special for the two nights to a bigger room with harbour views,buffet breakfast,free cocktails from 6pm to 8pm,after hearing all this we asked the price several times and we kept getting told the same price about $105 total in Australian dollars for 2 nights we said ok.As we still had 2hours to check in we went for a walk the came back.We went to the our room which was so tiny and they called this an upgrade (hate to see normal room) plus it absolutely stunk of cigaretes smell.We rang reception and told them about the smell and they said they would change our room.After 30min we went to our new room,it did'nt smell but was still tiny and the so called harbour views were a joke.When we went to check out we got a bill for double the price we were told at the start,i explained that we were told different and that we had only saved enough money to pay for the upgrade he told us no you have to pay, i refuse to pay the full amount they said and told them i'm only paying what we were told,after being there for a while they said ok but sighn this rebate form, i said fill it out first because i don't know what you are writing on it that's how this problem started we signed at the start then they changed the total price.In all i payed what i was told but our bad experience upon arrival and deperture in such a short stay i will never forget and will tell my travel agent not to recomend to anyone.The only good thing was central location but the money we paid i'm sure you can get a hotel with a pool abd gym at least.

<Content>Rooms were small Location of the hotel was good, but rooms were small.Had booked 2 normal twin sharing rooms with intention of including an extra bed for 1 of the rooms. It was impossible to add an additional bed in the rooms. Even opening 2 big suitcases made walking around the room difficult. For a Triple sharing room at this hotel, I would recommend taking the family suite room, it was made up of 2 connecting rooms, where an additional bed could be added easily. Its more comfortable, and you get an extra bathroom. Fortunately, we had also gotten the corner unit, that had a partial view of the harbour..Round the corner was Starbucks, the basement was Seibu, which probably explains why so many Japanese stay at the hotel. Just past Starbucks was the Esprit factory outlet. Gotten some good out of season buys from there.

<Content>Tiny Room, Great Location, Excellent service Yes! The room is very tiny!鈥?The room is ideal for a double bed, miserable for twin beds. Our room is just located at 15th floor, twin deluxe room, somewhere the end of the doorway. In the room, We have a hard time walk around and not even find a space for our luggage to open. Nevertheless, we have a fantastic view of the harbor. The hotel is Just less than 2min walk from the MTR Tsim Sha Tsui, few mins walk to Star Ferry and largest shopping area Harbor City. Every room door is operated by magnetic card reader, so that you don鈥檛 either drop or collect the keys at the counter. The best thing of all, I find it pretty amazing, at every end of the doorway there鈥檚 an Ice-vending machine. The hot beverage is free, consist of green tea, coffee, English breakfast tea and de-cafe coffee sachets. Although the hotel Check-in is indeed slow, nevertheless the hotel service staff is beyond excellent. Would I go back again? Might be the question you have in mind, my answer is鈥?Yes! (Might be due to the service, location and ice-vending machine) haha!

<Content>Great location, terrible rooms! The only thing this hotel has going for it is the location. It is just around the corner from Nathan Street which is ideal for any shopaholics and there is an underground station a minute鈥檚 walk away from the hotel. The Kowloon Hotel is a very busy hotel which caters for business people and tourists alike. As I say the location is excellent but the rooms are just tiny and not particularly pleasurable to be in either I鈥檓 afraid. However, if you don鈥檛 plan to be in the room much and are looking for somewhere central to explore Hong Kong (as we were) and without forking out a small fortune for a more exclusive hotel, then this hotel is worth considering.

<Content>Has gone downhill I've stayed at the Kowloon Hotel 5 times now in 10 years. This stay was the worst. The location obviously hasn't changed - it's excellent - but everything else has. This used to be a great value for a very nice hotel and free internet. Internet was always free. Not anymore - it's now HK$120 a day. When the hotel was owned by the Peninsula Group the amenities were great and the rooms were in good shape. It now looks like nothing has been done in 10 years to spruce things up - what used to be really nice is now dated. Judging by the tour buses in the driveway, it looks like they're going after the tour group bookings and don't seem to care about repeat business. None of the views are particularly great, but some street views are better than others. I would think after 5 stays I would be given a decent room. Nope. This one was facing the worst side. The shower didn't drain. The wallpaper was starting to peel in spots. I've always defended the small rooms based on location, free internet and how nice everything was. I can't do that anymore. I regret not spending a little more and staying somewhere nicer. I won't be back.

<Content>Small, but Clean and great Location Stayed here for 3 nights in mid-August for about $100 a night. Yes the rooms are quite small, just a standard bathroom, small closet, queen bed, and an office desk with a flat screen monitor that serves as the TV. Like typical big cities like NY or SF, the rooms are small as I expected, so it didn't shock me. The room was very clean and came with disposable slippers for the room. It was also well air conditioned, as it was very hot in Hong Kong during the summer. The best part of the hotel is the location. It's right on Nathan Street (short walk to internet cafe), a quick walk to the Ferry, and best of all it's connected to the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station from underground, so we didn't have to step outside, though sometimes they closed the entrance, but the next exit wasn't far. Also the hotel's supper buffet at 10pm was packed with people and food was pretty good. It was cheaper than the dinner buffet that starts at 7pm. The people at the hotel were very accommodating and spoke English well. Overall a good experience in Hong Kong, the only main problem was that we were hit by typhoon Nuri and were stuck inside for 1 day (the hotel room was good to veg for one day) and the airport was a zoo afterward.

<Content>Kowloon Hotel - I will return! Pluses1. In the middle of it All - very centralized location next to Nathan - the shopping strip of Hong Kong proper2. A Grey Lines tour pick-up location3. 20-min from HK airport, via train ($10) and free bus (K7?) from Grand central.4. Good size bathroom w/ all the amenities - considering the room size5. Digital Safe-box w/in each room6. 4pm High Tea has an excellent spread7. Breakfast buffet - excellent8. Everyone speaks ''proper' English9. Fantastic Staff10. Good view of HK harbor and Victoria Peak - on a clear day. Thank mainland China for all the subsequent pollution!Minuses1. Room is small (typical for HK at this price range) however laid-out nicely2. Flat screen TV is a bit small - also plays as a computer monitorRecommend:1. If you have the opportunity to upgrade to business class ($15-$30 per night) do so! Upgrades give you the top floor, free breakfast, free Internet, free high tea, and personalized service on the 17th floor.2. We used Grey Line Tours for 3-days while in HK.

<Content>Great location, friendly staff, clean We stayed at the Kowloon Hotel in Kowloon for 3 nights and had a wonderful time. We were in a club room on the 17th floor. Breakfast was free (2nd floor), happy hour 6-8pm featured free drinks (wine, beer and cocktails) as well as free hot and cold snacks. Happy (2)hour was an excellent way to prepare for the laser show in the harbour, about a 5 minute walk away. The hotels location is very good, only steps to the ferry and metro. The hotel is connected to a shopping complex and the metro (subway) system. The metro is air conditioned and very easy to figure out. The rooms were a little on the small side but they were clean, featured fresh fruit each day, bottled water each day, a fridge, free internet access if you have a laptop or similar. Wifi is also free but there was some confusion as they initially charged us 120hkg dollars per day but then took this off when we checked out.There is also a club lounge on the 17th floor where you could get coffee, juice, croissants, water, fruit in the morning. Newspapers were also attached to the door in the morning.The staff was very nice, extremely helpful. We would not hesitate to go back.

<Content>Club Floor Worthwhile My husband booked a club floor room June 13-16. I stayed with him one night en route to Chongqing. The room was very clean, light and airy but not spacious for two people. It was not a problem since I was always out and my husband liked working from the desk at the corner windows. The location is great and convenient to everything. The service from the Club Floor concierges was excellent. They guided us into the hotel dining room which had a separate area for Club Floor guests; with access to all buffet items. The Club Floor lounge was comfortable and never crowded. The additional price for Club Floor and the upper level rooms were worth the modestly higher price. All in all, my husband always stays here on business and I can see why, as it is comfortable and quiet; daytime construction across the street from our room wasn't too noisy on the high floor rooms. The breakfast buffet is excellent and had wonderful selection of fruits and made to order egg items. I would return in the future with booking for the Club Floor.

<Content>Great view of the fireworks! We came to Hong Kong for Chinese New Year, and this hotel, with its floor-to-ceiling corner windows, gave us a great view of the fireworks right from the comfort of our room.No complaints with the room or the hotel - I didn't feel that the room was particularly small, in contrast to some of the other reviewers here.I don't recommend using the in-room TV internet - it's pay-per-minute, and seems designed to keep you on it as long as possible, with slow connection speeds and impossible-to-navigate menus. Other than that, no issues, would return here if in HK again.

<Content>Good Place, Bad Service Nice hotel, really clean, very near the train station, stores everywhere. Service is terrible, though! Their keycards get quite defective. I visited the concierge only to have this man rudely point me to the reception desk with this impossibly long line of people checking in. When I complained that I am already a guest, he glared at me and spat out What do you want me to do?!. HORRIBLE SERVICE!

<Content>A good hotel. Will go back definitely. The LOCATION is very good. A Tsim Tsa Tsui MRT station entrance is right at the hotel door. The neighborhood is safe, full of restaurants, fashion outlets, shops, 7-11 and Starbucks. The free shuttle bus stop to Airport Express at Kowloon Station is opposite the hotel. The ROOM is very small but I had no problem with the size. The bedding materials are so wonderful i had perfect sleep. There's a small screen to be used as a TV/computer. The free TV programs are about news. You have to pay for a movie. The CONCIERGE is one of the best. They know everything, every detailed question I asked.The SERVICE is good overall. I asked for a travel adapter and i got it immediately (for 30 HKD rental). I needed a wheelchair on one evening, and they helped me with it withing a couple minutes. I paid 1,100++ HKD a night and was happy with what i got. I'll defintely stay here on my next trip.

<Content>Location is the word Still here 4th night of a 5 night stay. I have been at this property several times before and I agree with everyone about the size of the rooms but you just cannot beat the convenient location.This is right in the middle of shopping, dining and transportation.You can step out at night and be reasonably safe.The only change over the years is that the management of the hoel passed from the Penninsula Hotel company from accross the street to the Harbour Plaza Hotels Management Company. Not much noticible in the way of guest services has changed.However I would like to comment that the room that I am currently in is need of some minor refurbishment and or updating. Some wallpaper is peeling and the carpet is showing signs of wear and needs to be changed. Also the small 21 LCD TV should be changed to a wall hanging 32 LCD. Many of the other properties I've stayed at recently already have the larger screens.It would also be nice if they included complimentary internet access or lowered the price a little. Come on $120HK ($15 U.S.) seems to be on the steep side especially when it usually goes for US $9.95 at many porperties in the US. That's all I have to report at this time.

<Content>Excellent location, great service Stayed at the hotel on our honeymoon during mid Feb '08. The hotel is well position, it is just walking distance to all shopping outlets, the ferry, restaurants and the MTR is literally underneath the hotel. The hotel staff were very friendly and very helpful with directions and sightseeing tours. The lobby is a bit small and could be really crowded during check in. The check in for us is a breeze, took us less than 10 minutes. The room we stayed at is small, but then again this is hong kong and we're only there to sleep! It is clean and tidy but the wall is paper thin, we could hear the conversation in the next room and could've join in on the conversation if we wanted to!The view is okay we were looking out directly to the Peninsula hotel and you could just see the harbour if you stretch your neck a little bit. The toilet/bathroom is even smaller. There were road constructions everywhere but you could hardly hear anything, granted we were on the 15th floor. Breakfast buffet was average, you're better off looking elsewhere. . We were really suprise with the level of service we received, (by far the highlight of this hotel) having experience how rude and unhelpful most asian hotel staff were. When we checked out, the marathon was on and all the roads from the hotel were closed, so the concierge asked the bell boy to take us to the otherside of the hotel for taxi. He took our luggage and escorted us to the other side of the road and I thought he was going to leave us in early hours of the morning but he waited with us for a taxi! Great service. Will definately come back here again.

<Content>Great Location for a shopping holiday I stayed on my own, at the Kowloon Hotel in Nathan Rd and found the location excellent. The hotel in literally on top of Seibu department store and the MTR, making this in the ideal location. It is a 5 minute stroll to the Star Ferry terminal and right in the action of the bustling Nathan Rd shopping.The hotel itself was clean and tidy and the staff were more than friendly. The only quelm I had was the rooms were very small - but then most rooms in HK are.Overall, a very good hotel in an excellent locati.

<Content>Good Location, Bed smell! Stay here if you're just looking for a good locaitn to crash. It was by the Peninsula which is walking distiance to some decent attractions and the ferries. When you walk in, the lobby has a noxious smell of perfume from the stores downstairs.The drinks in the bar are overpriced. I had 1 at $10.00 and it wasn't premium alcohol. The service was horrible. I ordered a second drink before my meal came. They never brought it but it was still on my bill. The room was small, but actually comfortable. It was one of the less expensive options, so I guess you get what you pay for.

<Content>Small rooms in a good location You are not really paying for the room here, its all about the location, location, location as you have Nathan Road, Canton Road and the MTR / Star Ferry / Victoria Harbor literally right at the doorstep. You can really shop till you drop around here! Coming back to the hotel all that shopping won鈥檛 fit in the room, as the Standard Rooms are tiny with almost no room to walk around the bed. The bed is very soft and comfortable compared to many Hong Kong hotels. The bathroom is also tiny, but generally speaking the room was clean and ok. This hotel offers no views, as its overshadowed by the buildings around it, so don鈥檛 be conned into upgrading to a corner harbor view room when checking in 鈥?as you can only see a tiny slice of the harbor if you squeeze into the corner! Don鈥檛 be in a hurry when checking in/out 鈥?i.e. don鈥檛 be rush to catch a flight, as you have to queue. The hotel lobby always seemed to have a queue and reminded me of a railway station as there were always big groups coming/going cluttering up the lobby. The cool thing about the hotel is that it has a tunnel linking it to the MTR (Tsim Sha Tsui) and using the same tunnel network one can shop and explore this part of Kowloon without ever walking on the street 鈥?it鈥檚 a great way to avoid the chaos an heat 鈥?and return to the hotel. As usual internet is available, but not free.

<Content>Smallest Rooms Kowloon Hotel, Nathan Road, Tsim Tsa Tsui, Hong Kong has the smallest rooms in Hong Kong (Kowloon Side). I frequent Hong Kong and I've stayed in all 3 hotels of Marco Polo (The Hong Kong Hotel, Gateway, Prince), Sheraton Hotel, Holiday Inn Goldon Mile Hotel and so far, Kowloon Hotel has the smallest rooms. I think the room is only 15 square meters including the toilet and bath room. I've complained about it and the General Manager told me that he could not do anything about it since the hotel's building was built 22 years ago. The food are also not nice. The only thing that is nice with this Hotel is the Location and the staff - but you could also get this from other hotels. I would not recommend it to anyone to stay in this Hotel.

<Content>great location Great location at the bottom end of Nathan Road. We didn't eat in the hotel as there are so many options close by and the restaurant looked like a large buffet set up. The bar was fine with panoramic windows so you can take in the bustle beneath you on the streets. We paid a small premium ( well worth it) to upgrade the room and got complimentary drinks each evening till 7pm. Large rather impersonable Hotel but efficient, clean and in a fantastic location for touring round all the shops and street hawkers. cheap Rolex  anyone?

<Content>Definition of small..... From reading the various views, I am sure you have all come to the conclusion that the hotel is small.In case there is any confusion, think of the smallest hotel you have EVER BEEN...it's going to be smaller than that...Start off with the assumption this is one of the smallest hotel room in the world and you can't go wrong. On the plus side...location is good. The hotel is right next to a MTR (underground Rail) exit. This is Tsim Sha Tsui, majority (not all) of hotels in this area are convenient. As long as it's close to a MRT exit, you really can't go wrong. Many other hotels fit this category so I would choose another if there are choices available.Food...Buffet breakfast is reasonable priced at approx HKD 188 + 13% tax. I have to admit the breakfast is quite good. You get the Western (continental, bacon, eggs, bread, sausages, pastry, fruit...etc) and Eastern Style (congee...etc + japanese stuff). Dinner buffet is good too. I went there during the christmas period so the food selection might be different from other periods. The deserts don't disappointment either. However you are looking at HKD 488 + 13% which is very pricey for dinner. This is HK, with that budget, you can get very well outside.Service - They have good customer service and are very polite. Rooms are clean and well maintained.Conclusion - I went there during the christmas - new year period. The rooms cost HKD 1700 a night + 13% tax which is way too expensive for a room of this standard. Sure, the food is nice and location is good but the room is just way too too small to cost this much. In terms of location, it's good but there are many many many hotels that are close to various MTR exits that provide the convenience.Hope this helps.

<Content>Great location / Small rooms We (wife, two sons - 18  21 - and I) booked the Kowloon Hotel through Ritz Tours as part of a six-day mini-tour (flights, hotel, half-day tour) in December 2007. Other reviews said the rooms were small, and I figured how small could they be? Well, they are really small, though you do get used to it after a day or so. However, the hotel's location more than compensates for the room size. It's right on the Golden Mile, almost directly above a MTR station, and within easy walking distance of the Star Ferry, Kowloon Park and the TST Promenade. They have high speed Internet in all rooms (wireless and wired), but it costs 120 HKD (~$16) for 24 hours. We had the breakfast buffet included, and it was one of the most impressive I've ever seen, though the hostess told me it would be 168 HKD (~$22) if we had had to pay. The dim sum lunch was good and reasonable, but the Pizzeria restaurant was very expensive and ordinary. Hotel staff were efficient and courteous but not particularly warm and fuzzy; restaurant staff were nicer.

<Content>Great Location  Our first time at Kowloon Hotel, we stayed for 5 nights. It's at a great location, for MTR as well as the shuttle bus to take the Airport Express. The room was clean yet small, but we've stayed at even smaller hotel rooms in Mongkok area (which was not very clean) before thus it's no problem. Further more after a looonnng day of walking ard, all you want is just to get a good nite sleep. Would definitely recommend to travellers looking for a convenient and clean hotel.

<Content>Convenient HQ in Hong Kong I stayed one night in October 2007 en route to Beijing. The Hotel is in a great location and the courtesy bus from Kowloon Station where the Airport Express arrives is very handy and free. Check in was straight forward. Initial impression of the room was that it was small, but clean and quite adequate. There was fresh fruit and free bottled water provided. Location to Kowloon shops and eateryies couldn't be better and it was short walk to the harbour walkway (the Stars) to see the 8 pm light show. Cost was a little more than the YMCA across the road. Overall I would recommend it.

<Content>Great location, comfortable beds I stayed at the Kowloon Hotel last year and will stay there again this year. It's in a fantastic location above the MTR and near the Star Ferry at TST on Kowloon side. Right near Nathan Rd, lots of nearby places to eat. Walk to TST East station to go to Shenzhen. Yes the rooms are very small. that's not so unusual for HK. But the beds are soooooo... comfortable. And the breakfast buffet (if you can get it included) is great. Everything opens late in HK so it's good to take your time in the morning and enjoy a relaxing breakfast.

<Content>do not stay here This hotel does not worth $200US per night. Corporate rate is about $110US per night; so don't get rip off; the room is VERY VERY SMALL!!!! A bit dusty and smelly. Dumb receptionist. No gym. It will cost you HK$120 or so a day at the YMCA or HK$100 a day but you need to take the hotel shuttle to its sister hotel. That's insane. The bathroom, tiles are old and molds shown.... If you are a couple wanting a place to stay, do NOT stay there; you will not have room for any suitcases plus your shopping! Right now I am sitting in the room; we have two small suitcases - cabin size and a carry-on bag. We have NO room here!

<Content>Small rooms I stayed here two nights, one before Chengdu and the other returning from Chengdu. The first time was ok, the room was very, very small, but ok. Anyway, after a looooong trip you just want to sleep, and the other time, seeing Hong Kong. It wasn't cheap. It was in a great location, though. It has the Peninsula Hotel right in front, and has a free shuttler that take you from the Kowloon Station when you use the Airport Express. At walking distance (5 minutes) you have the Star Avenue and the Victoria Harbour. The second time we went there they offer us a upgrade, which we took. The room was a little more spacious (not to much) and a view to the harbour. That was like that, because we had the luck to be place in the far right side of the hotel, where the Peninsula Hotel do not disturb the view.

<Content>Great Location. Perfect for a Stopover The Kowloon Hotel is perfect for a stopover in Hong Kong. We were there for 24hours only so needed to fit in as much as we could and the location of the Kowloon Hotel was ideal for this.Yes the rooms are small but at the end of the day, you are only there to sleep.

<Content>Good location but very tiny rooms I was only in Hong Kong for one night which was just as well as this must be one of the smallest rooms I have ever stayed in!However it was clean and bright and everything worked well. I got a good package which included hotel transfer and breakfast so was quite happy.Location is very good, right above the MRT station and a short walk to the Star Ferry terminal.If you are planning a nice break in Hong Kong and there are more than one of you though, don't stay here - you won't be able to move!!

<Content>Convenient choice in Hong Kong I've stayed at the Kowloon Hotel a few times over the years. As many point out, the rooms are very small and getting a bit dated -- although clean and comfortable. These are about the only drawbacks I can think of. It's an extremely convenient location, especially if you're spending most of your time in Kowloon, but the MTR station, harborfront and ferry terminal are all also only a short walk (actually the MTR is under the hotel) so going anywhere is pretty easy. The breakfast buffet is terrific, and service, even in this very busy hotel, is excellent.If you plan to spend a lot of time in your hotel room, want a great view or are looking for a romantic resort setting, choose a different hotel. If you value convenience and cost with capable, efficient service, this is a good choice.

<Content>Pleasant Stay Had a pleasant stay at the Kowloon Hotel sometime back. Little I remember abt the service but the tiny hotel room was the main impression. I was staying for 2 nites on business/pleasure so it was OK but could imagine it being less than pleasant any more than that due to the space constraint. The room (smoking) and toilet were extremely clean with great shower and the bed was superbly comfy as well as the free internet access and fruit basket. Not a bad stay for a single given the value rate and location!!

<Content>Best Deal on Nathan Road Service at the Kowloon Hotel just keeps getting better. The hotel is impeccably clean. Not only does the room look clean, one can actually smell how clean it is. Aside from its convenient location - it's next to the MTR - the Kowloon Hotel serves the best breakfast buffet this side of Hong Kong. On this point alone, I'd chose this hotel over the competition. One thing I miss though is the free internet in the room which vanished after the hotel changed management. Oh, well, I guess we can't have everything.

<Content>Good location at reasonable price I stayed here in January and seem to have had a different experience from some other reviewers, perhaps because I paid extra for Harbour Club membership which gives some extra privileges - maybe room upgrade is included although that wasn't mentioned. My room wasn't big, but certainly not as tiny as some mention here. Admittedly, 2 people sharing would make a difference but I'm sure the space would be sufficient unless a lot of time is spent there. Also, I'm from the UK so I'm used to European hotel rooms which are generally smaller than in the US (hotel rooms in the US are often HUGE - what do people do with all that space? am I missing out on something?!!). The double bed was comfortable, the bathroom was a reasonable size, everything was very clean and there seemed to be plenty of storage space. All I really missed out on was a view as I was on a lower floor. For the most part I found the staff helpful  courteous. The winner for me was the hotel location, being close to the harbour front, the Star Ferry  the metro station. The Harbour Club membership is a good option if you use these benefits. All in all, a reasonable price for a good location.Then again, maybe I just have low standards!

<Content>no room to move if you are claustrophobic don't stay here. the room was extremely small for 2 people, especially for 5 days, were unable to upack suitcases. room more suited to 1 person. no room to move. no room to store shopping, or any extra luggage. this was my main complaint about the hotel. otherwise staff on the whole were friendly and the room was clean, also hotel ideally situated for MTR, Star Ferry and buses and shops. the Happy Hour at the bar was good, included some food.will stay elsewhere next time.

<Content>Too small, but clean Stayed here twice with my family. Once in 2003 when SARS was declining and the second time in 2005. Rates back then were a lot cheaper than now, of course. The low price was the main reason we stayed there the second time. Back in 2003, free internet service was available through the TV. They were using an extremely old version of Windows (3.1 maybe?) But it worked! Checked my email, etc....But in 2005, when Harbour Plaza took over management of the hotel, internet access was no longer available through the TV. Internet access was only available at the business center or if I had a laptop. Like previous reviewers, I also agree that the rooms are tiny. I had booked a standard room with two beds. Judging from their official website, the other rooms below the executive suite level are probably just as small as the standard room. Cramped space, not much room for two people. I felt claustrophobic by the time I left the hotel. I would never stay there again. I'm going back to HK Summer 2007, but I'm not going back to Kowloon Hotel. They're charging around $119 (as of May 2007) for a standard room on some websites when I can find larger rooms or similarly-sized rooms for a cheaper price. But the rooms were clean and the bathroom was a good size. The hotel is in a very good location with Starbucks next door, walking distance to Star Ferry Terminal, the Harbour City mall and Ocean Terminal, and the MTR entrance is located within the hotel lobby.

<Content>Tiny,Tiny,Tiny I was traveling with my brother in law in a bussines t rip.When we arrived to the hotel we were nicely impressed: the lobby is very nice and the staff is very courteuos.THAT麓S ALL FALKS. As soon as we opened our room door we wanted to run as far as we could from this hotel,and believe me that麓s what we麓ve done.The room is so small that if you are traveling with more than a backpack its not enough room in there to even get around to go to the bathroom.The manager is so used to the travelers complaints for this reason that he allowed us to resign our reservation without charging us any penalty.We moved to the Holliday Inn, one block away ,and we only paid U$ 5 more a day and the room was 3 times bigger than the Kowloon.

<Content>Room without a view - or much else Yeah, we were expecting the tiny room, but it still takes your breath away when you realize just how much you're paying for just how little you're getting. Not only that, but step back a decade or two in amenities. Seriously, I was most struck by just how much this room resembled the dorm room I was forced to live in when I was in the Air force. Combined with the pitiful work ethic of the housekeeping staff (as evidenced by the crud built up on the (chrome) bathroom fixtures) and the additional extortionary charge for Internet access, the great location next to the Pen still doesn't work out to any kind of bargain. Considering how easy it is to get around in Hong Kong (get an Octopus card) the location aspect doesn't offset the negatives. Spend a small fortune less and a minimal amount more time getting to-and-from and stay farther North..... your bank account will thank you. On the up side, the staff were quite friendly, and the doorman can't be beat.

<Content>Great location and excellent service We stayed here in early March 2007. Could not be more pleased with the place. The location was great, the staff and service were excellent. While many on here have commented on how small the rooms are, we didn't seem to have a huge problem with them - the bathroom was a nice size and the bed, very comfortable. We liked the complimentary fruit and bottled water served every day. We used the business centre while there for the internet and that was great as well. Buffet breakfast in the cafe on level one was included in our rate - well worth it for the great food on offer - western and asian. We also had the friday night supper buffet there and loved the assortment of food. We will definately be booking again with the Kowloon Hotel.

<Content>Great for the business traveller - tiny rooms Just stayed in the Kowloon Hotel recently. Its location is excellent - right behind the Peninsula Hotel in Tsimshatsui, and right next to a subway station. Reception staff - and all others - were efficient and spoke good English.By HK standards, the price is reasonable for a business hotel. The rooms are clean BUT they are TINY! Barely large enough to squeeze a bed, a desk, and a couple of chairs! One could never accuse the architects of not maximising the space! As befits a business hotel, internet access and an in-room fax are standard features.Conclusion - a great option for the business traveller who will spend most of the day out of the room and primarily requires a clean bed and bathroom.

<Content>Good location,  I stayed at this hotel and booked it because of its location on Kowloon island. I was not surprised as the hotel is right near an MTR station and at the bottom of Kowloon island near the avenue of the stars.The rooms are small but clean and functional.Overall I would say that this hotel is worth the money that you pay for it.The Peak is a must see for Hong Kong but do try and go on a clear day otherwise you will not see very much.The light show is ok but over-rated.Enjoyed the trip alot.

<Content>Upgrade your room. The Basic Room is TOO Small I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The location is convenient with the subway station just around the corner from the entrance to the hotel. The service and staff are all friendly and I can't think of anything that really struck me as terrible or awful in terms of cleanliness etc.BUT...The Room Size is TOO SMALL.To save costs I decided to share a room with my associate so there are two single beds in the room. Now when we went up to our room on the 10th floor, I was extremely surprised to see that there was no gap between the two single beds. The reason for this being there is no space in the room to have a gap between the beds. I must say that the hotel really knows how to use up all of the little space in the room. The table has almost everything in it. safe, fax, mini bar, tv, radio, internet, etc. the room was a smoking room however the fire alarm went off often because of the limited space. This happens if you turn off the a/c fan. Even when taking a shower the fire alarm went off. note: the fire alarm is a silent alarm that alerts security.Total space of the room in my opinion is around 100 square feet which includes the washroom. I'm not sure how the upgraded rooms are but i am sure they would be alot bigger than the basic room.In no way do I not recommend staying at this hotel but if you do intend to stay here make sure you upgrade your room from the basic standard room to a larger room if possible.

<Content>Great Value for Money Just spent 3 nights 4 days in Hong Kong staying at the Kowloon Hotel. We were prepared for small rooms following previous reports; however that did not put us off. I booked the room direct with the hotel website, there was a special package called 鈥楤usiness Package鈥?staying for 3 nights or more you received limo collection from the airport, late check out and daily all american buffet breakfast. We opted for a deluxe room, mainly because we prefer to be higher up. We did not have a view; however, the room was perfectly formed. I would not have liked to have had large suitcases, we had 2 x carry on size and they fitted perfectly into the wardrobe. Dressing gowns, and slippers were provided, accessories in the bathroom included wet shave razor and toothbrushes, which were replenished as they were used. All the other usual toiletries. We had fresh fruit replenished daily along with tea and coffee and drinking water. The controls for the TV and lights were very handy at the side of the bed, a turn down service was provided and all I can say about the beds, is we slept like logs, very unusual for us in hotels. We used the laundry service, and received our clean clothes by 4pm the same day. Hotel bar had a happy hour each day, serving free complimentary food along with your drinks, with perfect people watching views of Nathan Road. The wine buffet was well worth the $198HK per person, it included a choice of 5 red and 5 white wines. Needless to say we sampled them all; Bobbi and Annie were very accommodating and polite and get our vote for the smile award. Excellent location for everything on Kowloon, especially the transport systems, MTR and Star Ferries. Slight hiccup with the bill on check out which was soon resolved to everyone鈥檚 agreement. Next time we visit Hong Kong, we will definitely be staying at the Kowloon Hotel.

<Content>Soviet Chic meets State Prison While location is great for Kowloon and TST yet this hotel is highly overrated and overpriced for what you will get.Though I booked a superior room, the room was so small I could touch three of the walls if I was standing in the middle of the room with my legs and arms. I had to double check with the reception that it was in fact a superior and not a standard room. The furnishing is fitted and attached to the floor like a student dorm room or a state prison. Overall, the hotel is in need of a refurbishing, although that won't help against the panorama view staring straight into a advertising billboard on Chungking Mansions (illuminated 24/7).The common areas are styled in what I could describe as ... western luxury as perceived by former Eastern Bloc. Fake chandeliers, smoke-tinted mirrors etc. It's tasteless but not tasteless enough to be kitsch. A sign of warning here: all images on their site are photoshopped and retouched to the extreme. Even the proportion and the perspective may be skewed to make rooms look bigger.All above, which I don't mind, if not for the fact that you can get a true 5* experience in a boutique hotel if you just add a hundred or two HKD per night.

<Content>disappointed stay I have chosen this hotel based on some of the reviews from this web and one of my colleague said that this hotel was 'quite good' especially the location. I would say the location is good however me and my friend were disgusted by the staff. We are Chinese and I do speak and understand Cantonese but I chose to speak in English when making conversation with the staff. We book a room on club level. On the day we checked-in, I didn't know that we are so privileged that we can check in on the club level which is on the 17th floor. I passed the voucher to the counter staff and she spoke in cantonese to herself that 'what is this nonsense' and gave us an impatient look. After she found out that we should be checking in at the Club level, she called the club level that telling them that 'someone coming', of course, in cantonese. She changed her tone and smile at us and show us to the lobby. By that time we were quite surprise the kind of service this hotel staff provide.However, the most upset moment was when we have our tea time at the cafe. We were entitled to afternoon tea and evening cocktail at the 2nd floor lounge. After a tiring day, we went to have our afternoon tea on the first day and told the manager who show us to the table our room number. It took them 5 mins to notice the 2 of us (there were less than 10 customer at that time) to take our order and took another 5 mins to serve us our coffee. There wasn't any food left (they indicated - afternoon tea with snacks) except a few slices of bread. My friend went ahead to get the bread and was shouted by a waiter - 'Excuse me, what is your room number'. We were so embrassed as others were looking at us. We told him our room number and he pretend to take down the number and walk away.Next is the fruits in the room, we did not finish the fruit and it was left rotten for days. Shouldn't fresh fruit to be served to the customer?If I were to know this is the kind of service we get, we wouldn't spend so much to stay in a tiny room.

<Content>Great location - comfortable beds The location of the Kowloon hotel is brilliant. Its at the harbour end of Nathan road, right next door to a MTR station, and about 5 mins walk from the harbour front and 10 mins from the Star Ferry Terminal. The rooms are compact there is no doubt about that but I believe this is the norm for Hong Kong and they are decent enough size. If there are 2 of you, best bet is to split your suitcases so that you have 50/50 clothes for each person then live out of one of them in the room and put the other in the wardrobe. Staff are very friendly and helpful and the deal we got inc airport transfer and breakfast was a good price for the package. Breakfast in the hotel is a buffet and there is an excellent range of hot and cold, definetly enough to see you through to late lunch. Overall, yes the rooms are small but the beds are very comfortable, the facilities are good with minibar, TV (inc internet) internet connection in the room for laptop and a decent bathroom. Staff are great and the location is excellent particularly if you are on a short stay and you want to be in the heart of everything. I'd definetly recommend it, but if you are picky about the size of your hotel room, then pay the huge prices and stay at the Peninsular instead.

<Content>Worthwhile We booked through a travel agent to take advantage of a 6pm check-out. We were hesitant of this property given this site reviewers comments on the TINY rooms, BUT with that knowledge in mind, thought it was OKAY! Location was great. Staff were knowledgable and friendly.

<Content>harbourclub My wife and I stayed here for 7 nights.The staff were attentive ,polite and very helpful.We think that it is worth the extra 拢30 per day to use the facilities of the Harbour Club.This includes breakfast for two,complimentary pressing of clothes,fruit and bottles of water, the use of private lounges to recover from the excesses of so much shopping.There is also afternoon tea with snacks and also a free cocktail/drink time between 6pm /8pm with light nibbles and cakes....a peaceful haven.There is also a good chance of a harbour view..especially rooms 1728...1732 and 1828...1832

<Content>Location tops, great beds! The upside to this hotel was the fantastic location. From the hotel, if you turn left it's the MTR and if you turn right it's Starbucks! It is also conveniently located near shops although the prices of the goods are on the higher side. However, it's excellent value for money in the TST area - a touristy area. The beds were super comfortable and we had uninterruped sleep for most of the nights. We were also impressed with the message found on the TV (in the hotel room) welcoming us to the hotel.On the downside, the hotel staff put us in a hotel room with a view of the city, which in my point of view, is nothing much to scream about. Also, there was someone washing the windows outside one morning (which the hotel did warn us beforehand but the noise was very unbearable) which woke us up with its thumping sounds. As noted by other travellers, the rooms were super tiny and there wasn't much space to walk around or put your luggage. A hint would be if you travelled with one other person, one person should put his / her luggage on the floor next to his / her bed (near the TV / mini bar area as there is space due to the slating windows) and the other person should just place his / her luggage in the wardrobe / cupboard. During check-in, the staff were quite friendly and informative. The only thing that irked us was the fact that the rooms weren't ready by the time we wanted to check-in (2 times we came back and the rooms were still not ready) and then we took the opportunity to explore the TST area (luggage left at the hotel of course)!

<Content>Good Hotel We have just arrived back from HK. We stayed at Kowloon Hotel and as everyone has said in all the reviews has very, very small rooms. But who stays in the room. It was clean, staff were very helpful. Hubby and I travelled with friend who was in wheelchair and she had a room on her own. The staff helped us with the chair. We were fortunate to be given free buffet breakfasts which were both filling and good variety. We didn't need lunch. The hotel is close to MTR (just outside). We eat buffet supper a couple of nights which was delightful (asian and seafood). All in All we had a great time. Also went to seafood restaurant just around corner called Chok Yuen Seafood Restaurant, in Hankow Rd. Must book. Get the hotel to book for you. We ordered the 1kg of lobster with cheese sauce and french bread., garlic crab, chilli prawns and an abalone dish. This was the recomendation from Chinese friends there. The food was out of this world. When leaving we saw the chef getting prawns out of the aquarium in the foyer. NOW THAT IS FRESH.

<Content>Love the location but hate the size of the room Like what many travellers had commented, the size of the room is ridiculously small. My colleague and I had to squeeze into the room for the 6 days that we were there.My advise is to get 2 rooms if you are travelling with your colleague...or take turns to walk to the bathroom....this is how big the room is.If you are using the in-room internet access, please do note that it is HKD120 per day for max. of 2 laptops. More than that, you will have to pay another HKD120.I loved the location of the hotel as it is very conveniently located. MTR is just right outside the hotel and going to Hong Kong Island is a breeze.There are many nice eateries near the hotel and there are no lack of conveninence stores too.There is also an Espirit factory outlet located nearby for some cheap shopping.

<Content>Ideal location, but basic small rooms The hotel is in a great spot, we were only minutes walk from shops and transport but make no doubt about it, we were always keen to be out of the hotel. It wasn't ditry and the staff were pleasant, but by the time my wife and I wheeled in our two cases there was no floor space left! Our room, which was relativly expensive for an Australian traveller used to paying less for a 4 or 5 star we had hoped for more than the 10 square meters of space and a tiny double bed. We kept the net curtains closed - our view was of the air conditioning towers of another building.This hotel was a bit of a watershed for me - for the first time I booked through an online agent (Zuji) instead of through colleagues at work (a travel related company). I am pretty sure that this room was one of the hotels worst but perhaps that is how some online sites have these bargains available.We only spent about an hour in the hotel bar, it was very pleasant and had a nice street view. The general feel of the bar and restraurant gave me the impression that with the right room I would have been giving this hotel an above average.We had a good time in HK - the hotel was just a place to sleep and none of my gripes were enough to ruin our holiday.On my next trip to HK, I will consider other hotels, but I won't rule out the Kowloon.

<Content>great service, amenities, tiny rooms I booked my room and checked in on the same day, which got me a discounted rate (save ~200 HKD, for a final rate of ~1450 HKD). The agent who checked me in was very helpful. She even showed me another room (on the top floor, for the same price) with a harbor view so I could consider my options.In the end I got a room with two beds. Both that room and the other with 1 bed were the same size. (just barely large enough for the beds and the desk) The view out the windows was nice even though it wasn't a harbor view. (it was a south room across from the peninsula hotel) The rooms were nicely furnished with a desk for working, including a fax machine, and computer/TV display. The TV had a number of chinese and english channels and movies.The internet was 120 HKD for a 24 hour card. (I didn't avail myself of the option.) The room had a fruit plate and a couple of free water bottles, and also a refrigerator. (no microwave) The air conditioning worked well and the lighting was good. The bed was comfortable (not too firm or soft). There were two outlets supplying 120V power (two prong USA-type plugs), one in the room near the desk and the other in the bathroom. The bathroom included a shower/bath which was of reasonable size. The shower was comfortable. (sufficient water flow and temperature)The hotel itself is nice with open hallways and a comfortable lobby with doormen. There is also a bar and restaurant, which are as pricy as you might expect in a hotel.Since the room is pretty small I wouldn't recommend this for someone who is planning to spend a lot of time in the room. Assuming that you are going to be out and about though, you couldn't pick a much better location than this (Tsim Sha Tsui, on Nathan road). Great restaurants, shopping, clubs, and bars are all at your doorstep.

<Content>Good location Place had a good location, very central on the main street (Nathan Rd.) Located near all the shops, with Mong Kok (night life shopping district) just a 15 minute walk up nathan rd. Located close to the subway, which by the way is great over there. As what others have noted before me, the rooms are tiny, compared to other hotels I have stayed at. I think 2 people per room would be the absolute maximum you would allow. The bathrooms are also very small. This hotel isn't really the extravagent one, with big lobby, guest lounge... more business-like. Other than that, everything about the hotel was good. But don't expect fancy hotel, however location wise, it is great.

<Content>Good location We booked the hotel after visiting the reviews on tripadvisor. It is located in a good shopping location with several major shopping centers within walking distance. It is also close to the underground station which makes travelling around the city easy.The hotel seemed to have a good share of mainland chinese  some western guests.The rooms are very small, the entrance is too narrow to take your suitcase inside. Good selection of tv channels on an LCD TV. It also provides fax machine. Bathroom was ok but again very small. Our room seemed to be well maintained.We rarely visited any of their restaurants or facilities. The hotel has six elevators so basically dont have to wait for more than a minute for it to arrive.We did not much contact with the hotel staff but whenever we did they seemed more like rude robots. They would try to rush things  rarely smiled (except the housekeeping lady). I myself being a hotelier did not appreciate their service attitude  request mgt to do something about it.

<Content>Ok Hotel I have now been to the Kowloon 3 times and will be going for a 4th in September. I stay there on business, because it is so convenient and cheap compared to some of the other hotels (Marco Polo group for one).The rooms are small - not really suitable for two persons and their luggage. Bathroom also small and not especially well attended.The bar is good but sometimes service is slow. Italian restaurant I would recommend and breakfast is excellent.You are 10 min walking away from the Star Ferry, 15 min from Ocean Terminal and ferry to Shenzhen and Zhuhai. You are 10 min taxi away from Hung HOm and trains to Shenzhen or to Guandong. But tip - if you are travelling into Guangdong, for instance Champing, buy your ticket the day before. Dont get caught like I did once, where there was the Canton Trade Fair on. MTR is on your doorstep.The hotel is busy but no more than any other centrally located hotel and many hotels have flight attendants turn up. The two Indian guys on the door are very pleasant and obliging.Local night life is OK, Delanys usually where I end up for a quiet night but for more lively action head off to Hong Kong Island and Jaffe Road Henessy Road areas. Good bars - Dusk til Dawn if you can handle it, China Town, Devils Advocate etc etc.Suit sellers can be a pain but after 10 visit I just ignore them. Did see a funny thing last time near the star ferry - two suit sellers having fight and I walked right through the middle of them before I realised what was happening.Temple street and Ladies markets are a must, as is Haipong road. Try the street food and make your way to the Stag Pub if you can find it.Oh yes and the Felix bar at the top of the Peninisula is worth saving up for - just across the road from the Kowloon. I was one with a croud and the bill was over 拢200. Gents it is worth the view from your urinal! and ladies you get special treatment by the service maid who turns on the taps and hands you a towel.

<Content>Great Location Myself  3 other girlfriends stayed here for 6 nights and found it to be pleasant and ideal location. The rooms are indeed small but as a party of 4 we booked 2 executive suites consisting of twin beds in each room. Both these suites actually turned out to be 2 rooms each with an interconnecting door.One room had the twin beds ,computer which doubles up as tv, bathroom, in the next room, was the same but with a sofa instead of a bed.We moved 1 single bed into that room which then gave us all a room to ourselves with all facilites.2 of us were on the 9th floor(smokers)view of harbour was limited as obstructed by buildings,but thats what you get for being smokers. The other 2 were on the 16 floor which had a wonderful view of the harbour.We took the package which came with breakfast which really does full you up for the day,as being females we would rather keep shopping than worry about hunger pains.Overall I would stay here again but only by getting these suites to have the room.Even as a couple you will be tripping over one another.TIP: If you have bought too much and you think you will be overweight on your luggage see the help desk and for $30HKD you can get a box to send back home to yourself. They weigh the box for you then let you know the price for postage which gets delivered to your home door.Arrived back in Australia in 7 days. Far Cheaper than paying excess.

<Content>Great Location Very helpful staff, especially the tour advice desk.The location is great and the decor clean and refreshing. The rooms are small but for a metro area i guess this is to be expected. A hint is that the twim rooms are 1 metre longer than the double rooms which makes a big difference. The food at the resturant is very expensive!, but it is easy to eat out as there are so many resturant near by.The train system is right under the hotel so it is easy to get to shenzen for the day - great shopping!. It is only a short walk to harbour plaza and the star ferry to HK island.Even though the rooms are small I recommend this hotel for its helpfyl staff and clean tidy rooms.

<Content>Excellent location As has already been said, the hotel is in an excellent location but the rooms definitely are too small. I travelled with my mother and we had two single beds in the room, squashed together with only just enough room to get out/in bed. Cupboard space is very minimal with two drawers only and really no space to place more than one suitcase. The beds though are very comfortable and above average for a hotel.We purchased a package which included the buffet breakfast and I can highly recommend this - it was excellent. So many choices and excellent service. The restaurants on the other hand are very expensive.The only complaint I have was from the tourist desk when I enquired about a visa to China and was told a totally incorrect amount about four times the actual cost. This was obviously due to the lady being unable to understand English all that well.Coffee and tea facilities are on the very frugal side, enough for one cup a day if there's two of you in the room.Also the free email service is no longer available and now costs $40 HK for 30 minutes use and the lag is unbelieveable and not really worth using.

<Content>Excellent!! My husband  I recently stayed at this hotel on a 2 night stop-over from Rome to New Zealand. I must say that after reading some of the reviews before we left we were a little apprehensive about the size of the rooms. We didn't have any problem with the size, in fact we were pleasantly surprised. Our room was on the 13th floor with a lovely view to the harbour. Everything was spotless. The bed was the most comfortable we had slept in in our whole time away. The linen was beautiful, when we ran out of milk or tea we asked and they supplied us with more. We had a late check out of 6.00pm and they even serviced our room on this day, which we hadn't expected.We found the service to be of a very high standard, especially when you compare it to some of the European hotels which we had stayed in beforehand. And as for the location...you couldn't beat it.If we were to return to Hong Kong, we would most certainly stay at this hotel again.C  R Baillie, New Zealand

<Content>Great place to stay for cruisers leaving or arriving to HK We stayed in this little gem recently before embarking on a cruise. The location, room and staff were all above expectations. Ideally located to all things, shopping, subway, pier, and major tourist areas.Would definetally stay there again!!

<Content>Great Location Located above the MTR station and central to most Hong Kong transport and attractions.Room very small. We had a fairly small suitcase each and had to empty one so as to be able to stack them one on top of each other in the closet as there was no room anywhere else to put them- including the floor space which was barely large enough to move around in. We were in HK in peak time in April therefore price was also ptretty high ($347 AUD per night ex breakfast). Decor was tired especially the bathroom which had had quite a few shoddy repairs done to the fittings and tiles. TV reception was also poor. Room was very clean and fairly quiet and beds were very comfortable.Luckily there is so much to see and do in HK that we spent little time in the hotel.

<Content>Great Location - good value for price I paid I managed to get a great deal on this hotel via one of the frequent flyer/loyalty schemes which was open to all - at that price this hotel was excellent value for money. Room was small but had everything that uou needed - cable/satellite TV, kettle and hairdryer. Bathroom was adequate but is perhaps due for a renovation. The main attraction to the hotel was the service and the location. Location is directly above the MTR/KCR station interchange which means that you do not need to go out on street level to catch the tube/trains. Also situated near all the kowloon side shopping attractions. Perhaps I would not rate the hotel so highly if I had paid the rack rate but the VFM tariffs are out there - you just need to find them.

<Content>Problem Getting a Non-smoking room I stayed here for one night on a flight stop-over. I booked a non-smokng room (And this hotel does have several non-smoking floors). I checked in late at about 11pm. I was disappointed to find they'd given my non-smoking room to another guest. So I was forced to sleep in a smoker. And believe me, that tiny little room REALLY stank of smoke!!!As I've come to expect in Hong Kong, the check-in staff really couldn't care less. When I complained about having booked a non-smoking room I was told: In this room you can either smoke or not smoke. Like that was a good thing!!! Cheeky sod!So basically this hotel does not honour non-smoking bookings. So if that's important to you - like it is to me - I suggest you try somewhere else.

<Content>Yes, small rooms, but a great value For the money, one of the best in Kowloon, once you get over the fact that HK hotel rooms are small, even by NYC standards. Such a fabulous location it's hard to pass up. Clean, modern, appears well run, great access to MTR and Airport rail. No beefs at all, would definitely stay here again. Got a great rate on Asiarooms---, better than at the YMCA.

<Content>Good location, bad room I stayed here one night after arriving in Hong Kong in the evening, as I would be leaving for China the following morning. I was upgraded to the executive floor (#18) but the elevator only went to the 17th floor so I had to walk up one flight of stairs. My room was extremely small, not much larger than the bed, and the carpet had a very strong mildew smell. I was too tired to ask for another room. The staff for the check-in process was prompt and professional.The location of this hotel is the best, right next to Nathan Road shopping, the Peninsula Hotel, and the subway is actually connected from inside the lobby.

<Content>Great for 1 person This is a great hotel for business traveller travelling alone. Location couldn't be much more convenient, and rooms are well equipped for business. Rooms really are small, even by HK standards. So, for double rooms for 2, go somewhere else.

<Content>Mixed feelings about the hotel My rating would probably be somewhere in between 2 and 3 for this hotel.I found the staff were polite and the hotel and room were clean. The hotel is in a great location - you are in within walking distance of the harbour and access to the MTR is next to you.Yes, as everyone says, the rooms are small, but it's managable. How much time are you going to be in your room when there's a city outside to explore?! We tried the hotel's buffet breakfast one morning, it was lovely with loads of choice, although not cheap if you're on a budget. Can't remember exactly but think it was about 拢16 each.There was supposed to be internet access in your room as well as being able to view your bill, but for some reason ours didn't work. You can book tours from the hotel reception, we booked The Land Between Tour, which I would definitely recommend.On to the problem we had. One morning I was having a shower, got out to find the bathroom had flooded, water had been coming up through the small drain on the floor. The toilet was also flooded. We phoned housekeeping who came up to sort the problem, although they seemed more concerned with drying the carpet just outside the bathroom door at first. A plumber came up to sort out the water problem and then just left us with a bathroom full of water! Because some of the housekeeping staff didn't speak good english, we weren't sure if someone was on their way to clean up. We had to phone down to reception and ask that they change our room. They did this, I just felt they should have offered to move us to another room when they first saw the state of the place, instead of expecting us to watch them fix the bathroom and wait until we asked.I would probably not stay in this hotel again, mainly down to my own personal experience, but for anyone that's looking for a clean, reasonably priced hotel in a good location then this would do the job.

<Content>Really good hotel Great hotel - great location: subway is in the basement - you can go basically anywhere from there. Star Ferry is a couple of blocks away. It's right on Nathan Road - although I find Nathan Road a big tourist trap. Harbour City mall (with free internet) is a couple blocks away.I thought food was fabulous. Really nice buffet breakfast (with everything you can think of) for $100 HKD/day. We ate in the Pizzeria one night too. Staff were super friendly  helpful.Yes, the rooms are small. Especially since we had a baby cot  3 large suitcases. But you make do - we didn't spend that much time in the room, so you just learn to live with it for a few days. Super comfortable bed (foam topper). Next time we go to HK, I definitely would consider staying here again.

<Content>Great deal, great place We reserved a great price- about US120, and then upgraded to about US200 to get a Harbor Club room on the top floor, view across the harbor, great buffet breakfast,tea with sandwiches from 4-6,all you can drink cocktails with snacks from 6-8 and many more extras. Very worth it, especially when we watched the Christmas eve fireworks from our room. The room is small but not as small as our hotel room in Tokyo. You can put your luggage under the bed or in the very large closets. Very clean, very well appointed. The location of this hotel is perfect and the staff are great!

<Content>Absolutely flawless We stayed at this hotel for our Hong Kong trip. Thanks to the reviews from earlier months I have decided to book with this hotel because everyone had claimed that the location was great. I was very satisfied with my decision. The location was PERFECT! (right in the middle of everything!!) The hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly. The rooms were a bit smaller than your usual but that's because it's Hong Kong. I've asked other tourist staying at other hotels and they all seemed to agree that the rooms were quite compact. Other than that I honestly could not find one single flaw with this hotel. Don't worry guys it's a safe bet!!

<Content>Good location and wired Based on the reviews in these pages we tried the Kowloon Hotel. I expected the rooms to be small, but they were really small - cruise ship small. The location was great and after a week in less developed China we enjoyed having the internet (keyboard and connection) When we hit a snag loggin on, the in-house computer guy came to help out. We ate one night at their Italian restaurant - menu in Chinese, English and Italian.

<Content>Small Rooms! This hotel is a very clean  would be rated at least a four star. Its in a great spot on Nathan road in the Kowloon district. The hotel is designed for the business traveller and has internet access in the rooms (you have to pay for this) and also has a business centre for faxes etc. We did not have breakfast because it was over priced nor did we eat in the restaurants. We stayed in a standard room. There is no way I would stay in this room again as it was sooo small. It was hard to even get our two suitcases in the room. Apart from this the bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept on on a holiday!

<Content>Liked the Kowloon We visited Hk when the WTO was on and were lucky to get a room. We ended up at the Kowloon by default but were very happy with it. The location is perfect with the MRT underneath and the waterfront a couple of minutes walk away. It's right in the middle of shopping heaven too. The front of house staff were very friendly and organised. Our bags were off the shuttle bus and in our room before we'd finished check in. The room was more like a cupboard, very small. However it had everything needed for a comfortable stay and the best bed we had in our entire trip to SE Asia. Everything in the bathroom worked too. Would stay there again.

<Content>Location Location Location We booked our room direct with the hotel on line and paid $172AUS per night including buffet breakfast, which we thought was great value as the breakfast alone is $168HK/pp. No problems at check in we requested a non smoking room which it was... very clean and yes it was small but well appointed. Loved the doonas and feather pillows, very comfortable beds.We were there with shopping on our minds, so the size of the room was no issue. The MTR and KCR are directly under the hotel. We took the KCR to Lo Wu and shopped is Shenzhen. $34HK for the trip. We went to Mong Kok alot and that cost $4.60HK per trip so getting around was great. We caught the A21 bus from the airport and it cost $33HK and had to walk 200m to hotel. Starbucks is on the corner, very convenient, McDonalds behind us and our kids werent into the yum cha so that was great for them. Staff were very helpful and pleasant, courteous and prompt with requests. Would recommend this hotel if you were wanting value for money and everything at your door. The subways also helped avoid pakistani tailor harrassment which was constant as was the copy watch copy handbag hard sell.P.S you wont find a better hot chocolate in all of Hong Kong as that served at the Bar on level 2

<Content>Excellent place. Rooms are small. But they are clean. Staff members efficient  Having been there at the time of fair (in October) the rates were expensive. We had been in two minds whether to call the trip off or not. Lucky that we decided to stick to our plans. We had not used any of the hotel restaurants as during the five night stay we had a rather hectic schedule. Rooms were small but very cosy and convenient. Our corner room in 7th floor was overlooking the busy street beyond the HMV showroom. The guest relation was excellent, the hotel staff extremely courteous and helpful. The location was superb. You could walk around anytime for anything. Station, MTR, Ferry - everything so handy. Certainly we would stay in this hotel as and when we visit again.

<Content>Perfect for the Business traveller!! Executive or business owner? Get a corporate account. Harbor Club priviledges for the same price as a deluxe room with all the perks. FREE: broadband wireless (the only hotel I found where I didnt have to pay), buffet breakfast,sandwiches in HarborClub lounge with a view of the water from 4-6p ,alcohol and hor duerves from 6-8 in the middle row bar in its own section,use of the conference room for up to 2 hours a day. All free.All of these perks drives the nightly rate to cheap! Great place to schmooze your manufacturers. The business center sells SIM cards or you can rent a mobile.Get a China visa in the lobby overnight.Get your visa photo across the street in the YMCA lower level at a machine.Subway stop underneath the hotel will take you up to the China mainland..if you can get past the stores!! I was hesitant about the small room reviews,however, it it well designed and the desk has free tea/coffee, free in-room safe and a free refridgerator for things you buy or their mini bar. My room small view of water and side of peninsula hotel. HarborClub folks check out and arrange for transportation in the HarborClub Lounge. At breakfast, the staff will charge your cell phone battery!! Excellent location. Short walk to the ferry to Honk Kong Island and walk to the Macau ferry for some casino runs!

<Content>Read This - The exact details of this hotel :) Before arriving at the Kowloon Hotel I emailed them several times through their website. They were very prompt and always emailed me back right away!:) We arrived into Hong Kong Airport around 11 pm and went to A15/16 to sign up for a busride to the airport. This bus was very nice and was comfortable and dependable. It was 160 HK dollars per person (20 US dollars) but for being new to the area this was the way to go! We could have taken the City Bus (A21 or N21) for only 33 HK Dollars but we did not know about it at the time. However we did take it when leaving the Kowloon Hotel. The bus stop is just about 3 minutes from the Hotel. Nice lobby, clean and welcoming. We had purchased our room thru orbitz.com and we bought a standard queen bed room. All worked out fine and we got an excellent rate. The room was tiny..I'm talking open the door walk 3 steps and the bathroom is on your left. In the bathroom you take 2 steps in and you can sit on the toilet, or step in the shower. The closet is across from the bathroom and we put my husbands suitcase in there because the rest of the room was not big enough. The queen bed was nice and clean and there was a foot between the wall and the end of the bed and the wall and the side of the bed and then a desk on the other side. One chair which I would have loved to get rid of as we sat on the bed and my suitcase needed the space. This is the worlds tinyest room but very clean and very quiet. We would definitely stay again, it was worth the money, we just were not used to a small room. EXCELLENT location! You do not even need to go outside to get to the MTR (subway station), perfect location to Harbour City Mall and only 5 min walk to the star ferry. The hall we were on did smell a bit like sewage but only in the hall so we arent sure what the deal was. I'm quite picky and usually stay at the Mariott or Hyatt but this was fine. We would stay again:)

<Content>Comfortable hotel in a great location The Kowloon Hotel was, until recently, managed by the owners of the adjacent Peninsula Hotel and the same high service standards have been maintained by the new management. The rooms are small but well designed and comfortable - and who goes to Hong Kong to sit an a hotel room anyway?!!I'd recommend paying a little bit extra for a deluxe room - these are the same size and design as the standard rooms but on the higher floors, and so get lots more natural light. A few rooms have a harbour view - but the waterfront is just across the road. The adjacent Peninsula is an awesome location for cocktails in the 30th floor Felix Bar.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at this hotel in August 2005 and found it to be everything we expected for the money and more. The location in Nathan Road was excellent, the service and cleanliness of the hotel were also excellent and we would have no hesitation staying here again or recommending it to anyone.

<Content>Value for Money OK, so the rooms are small, but how long are you going to stay in your room in Hong Kong?? VERY centrally located to harbour, star ferry, MTR, SHOPPING and everything else. The staff were helpful and friendly. Buffet dinner in the Window Cafe was superb and cost $695 HKD for 2. Only minor problem was the non smoking room smelled of smoke..but you soon get used to it.

<Content>Very nice I just stayed 9 nights at the kowloon hotel - i had so much fun and was happy with everything! all the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, everyone was always smiling, the room  bathroom were clean  neat and the size of the room wasnt so bad. i stayed there with my boyfriend and we had 3 huge suitcases and another bag and it was fine, the space didnt bother us at all. the location really cant be beat - close to food and shopping  mtr. on our last night, my brother and his gf ended up having to stay with us too, so we had about 8 pieces of luggage and 4 ppl sleeping in the room and we all fit fine. they stayed at the eaton hotel and the room was the same size, only i thought the kowloon hotel rooms were much nicer. i would definitely stay here again  would recommend it to my friends!

<Content>The Good and the Bad... After reading some of the reviews, I had second thoughts in selecting this hotel for my trip two weeks ago. But since we were staying here for the first and third night only of our three night stay, well we made our decision.The first night we were given a standard room at the 11th floor. Clean room. But really, this is a really small room. I stayed at the Holiday Inn just across the street last June and I thought their rooms were really small. I was wrong. It was difficult to bring in our luggage! But the important thing was, the room was clean. We requested a non smoking room and yes, all our requests were granted. We checked out the following day for our Disney overnight.Back checking in for the third night, I was offered the Harbour club room for an additional HK$400. It was our last night, and well I gave in. The room was on the higher club floor. I didnt notice the difference in room size - it was still small. Our room the first night actually smelled better. I just kept in mind that the HK$400 was for the buffet breakfast, cocktails, the afternoon tea, and the quick checkout at the club floor. Not worth it if you wont enjoy the freebies and privileges. We did, but we dont necessarily encourage it.However, you can't beat the location! You need not go out of the hotel to go to the MTR, which is accesible thru the basement! You can cross the street or go to other points on Nathan road via the MTR crossing below if you want to avoid the human traffic, the heat, and the tailors on the street!Very friendly staff though, from the front desk to the bell service, specially the club floor staff.

<Content>very very small rooms Have just returned from staying at The Kowloon Hotel, Kowloon, Hong Kong. I had read the reports on the internet but was still suprised at how small the room was. If you have 2 suitcases forget it!! The positioning of the Hotel is great, right next to the MTR and the bus to the airport is just 100 metres away, so if you dont want to catch the MTR aiport express to the airport for 90 dollars catch the bus which is a more interesting ride for 33 dollars. I believe for what we paid for the rooms AUS $288 per night we were robbed, there must be better hotels around for that amount of money, but we booked in a hurry and couldn't get in a hotel as there was a trade fair on at the time, so we paid over the odds.

<Content>When you need a bed just for the night - good value Having read other reviews of a negative nature, I move in defence of the Kowloon Hotel. We availed ourselves of an all in one package with transfers to  from airport and breakfast included for HK$1330. This suited our needs appropriately. The rooms are very small but ours was more than adequate for the overnight sleep we required whilst in transit. Our room and bathroom was very clean, bed linen of good quality, bathrobes, slippers, bathroom supplies. We did not have time for breakfast due to a very early departure. For entertainment we spent our time in the Peninsular Hotel, by far superior, just a stones throw accross the road from the Kowloon Hotel. We needed somewhere quiet and comfortable for five hours sleep, it more than delivered. Walk accross the road to the Peninsular for the eating, drinking, entertainment and shopping.

<Content>The Kowloon Hotel I booked a few nights at the Kowloon Hotel in TST and checked out two days later. The rooms are absolutely cramped-- two people cannot stand shoulder-to-shoulder in any part of the interior hallway, and the two twin beds were spaced maybe 5 inches apart. Although the hotel boasts internet access, it's only available for an exorbitant fee of $120 HK (about $15 USD) per day. Also, the beds just have thin mattress pads, as opposed to a full mattress on a box spring. I found the beds dirty and stained. I would not stay there again.

<Content>Interesting experience I stayed at the Kowloon for 4 nights. Checked in with only a small amount of waiting, and was very quickly processed. Upon arriving into my room there was a fruit bowl, which did contain mouldy fruit, this wasn't really a good start to my stay, I did leave a note for housekeeping to please replace the fruit with fresh produces which was done.The Kowloon is well located for what I was there for, a short holiday.The restuarant buffet I think is rather good, being a chef I found that there was a large range of food to be selected both at breakfast and for dinner.When I did check in I was under the impression that breakfast was including in my package however they informed me that it wasn't. After ringing the people resonsible for the booking I was informed that it was and that the hotel will provide me the vochures. This never occured, even asking the hotel about it. Upon checking out I discovered that one of the breakfast had been provided free however was charge for the other, which I then challenged and was removed from my bill.Another time eating dinner on my first night, I opted not to have the buffet but have a la carte instead. The meal was pleasant, nothing special. They did however sit me right next to the busser station which was very annoying, eatting in a restauarant by yourself is usually hard, having to sit next to the busiers station is the worst, I was constantly bumped into, and since the restaurant was very empty I could not understand why they had sat me there.Overall would I say here again, probably not.

<Content>Mixed.... We stayed for 4 nights in the Kowloon, after requesting a non-smoking room we were told there were none left and were given the 'promotion' of upgrading our room during our stay for $400 HKD, presumably for the 4 night stay. The room had everything, but for an upgraded room it was tiny, i mean tiny, ok for one person but for a couple ....? The room stank of smoke but the location of the hotel was great so we stuck with it.During our stay we found the hotel staff unfriendly and as we had upgraded we were aloud 'VIP' breakfast (apparently worth 20 GBP a day???? Each!) which had about a sixth of the choice of the normal one.On checking out we were rudely informed that the upgrade price of 400$ was PER NIGHT!!!! We couldnt believe it, the manager knocked off one night as a gesture of goodwill after us stating that we had not been informed....The Renaissance in Kuala Lumpur gave us upgrade for 5GBP per night, hence why we thought fairly good deal. All in all, ok hotel, good location, extremely expensive, small rooms and unfriendly.

<Content>Great Hotel if size doesnt matter 3 friends and I stayed in this hotel the last weekend of July, I had been to Hong Kong many times before but this was my first stay at the Kowloon hotel. The location of the hotel can't be beat. You can enter the MTR station directly from the lobby or use the underpass to cross Nathan road. There is a Park N Shop convenience store around the corner as well as a Starbucks. Right now there is also an Esprit outlet store around the corner with great bargains on clothes.The rooms are very small, smaller even than the ones at the Holiday Inn Golden Mile across the street, where I have stayed a handful of times. However, we didn't mind - we are 4 girls in our mid-twenties - 2 in each room - all friends for over 10 years, so we didn't mind the lack of personal space/privacy.  The desk contains compartments for everything - safe, refrigerator, tea kettle, fax machine and mini bar. The TV is rather small but with a small room its not too noticeable. Everything however is clean, new and bright. The beds (2 single beds that you can push together to make a double) are comfortable and there are light and tv controls on each side of the bed making it easy to set the alarm or change the status from Do Not Distrub to Make Up Room. I loved that they provided a button to put the tv on a sleep timer, although i couldn't figure out if you could time it longer than 30 minutes.The bathrooms are also really tiny. A tall or large person would definitely find it pretty difficult to move around without bumping into the sink or toilet or tub, but the bathroom was spotless and the cleaning staff kept it that way throughout our stay.One drawback to this hotel is that there are no cheap, clean, good places to eat very near the hotel. However, Ocean Terminal is about a 3- 5 minute walk away, where they have a fantastic food court in the City Super department store. The Star Ferry is also a 2 minute walk away via another underpass and you can easily reach the new Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront promenade and avenue of stars via the same underpass.Overall, I would recommend this hotel for tourists who want a centrally located, clean and well-appointed hotel and who wouldn't mind the small size of the room.

<Content>The great Kowloon Hotel The Kowloon Hotel is indeed 4 star and more in term of service, location and it's great clean and comfortable room.The Kowloon is swarmed with service minded staff who only mission seem to be to delight every guest with their immaculate personalised service with the warmest smile.Everyone was eager to help with great warmth in a fast and efficient way.The room although small is stock with amenities, comparable to the deluxe class hotel which charged higher rates. The bed is ultra comfortable and the room is sparkling clean.The hotel's restaurants served the best food in town and again not only the food was fabulous, the service is extremely delightful too.The Kowloon is located in a most centralise shopper's paradise location in a safe classy neighbourhood.The Kowloon is indeed the place to stay for both business and leisure.

<Content>Accessible to everything Kowloon hotel has a great location. It is directly connected to an MTR station which makes getting around real easy. Just around the corner is a convenience store, several cafes, restaurants and shops. The lobby looks great. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. The rooms are small - like it was a single room converted for 2. But no matter how small the room was, my hubby and I were happy as we had a good view of Nathan Rd, it was quiet and we didn't have any problems with the staff. Room was hi-tech: everything was operated just by pushing a button. Internet is available but a bit pricey - luckily, during our stay, there was a promo and internet was free. Room rates are affordable - around USD80 per night. We visit Hongkong frequently and I would consider Kowloon Hotel as one of the hotels I would stay in again.

<Content>Just Great! We stayed at the Kowloon during mid April, although the room was a bit small it was in a very god condition, location and staff were excellent. The station is not too far away and all good shopping places are near by. If ur lucky you mite just get a room where you can just see the main Hong Kong island - Wan Chai district.

<Content>Brilliant location We were there for a week, in November and it was a great time of year to be there. The hotel was great and the staff very helpful. Buffet breakfast was the best and other meals not too expensive. We ate in the hotel chinese resteraunt and the other one and both were good. Rooms are quite small but had everything you could need and free internet was good. You don't go to Hong Kong to sit in your hotel room we were usually shopping until late. I would recommend it for anyone wanting a good value hotel in a really central location.

<Content>Small rooms but excellent location My wife and I visited HK and stayed at the Kowloon Hotel at the end of Feb '05. The standard room we stayed in was small (but we were well prepared for that after reading the reviews here). The room and bathoom was very clean, however our view was looking out straight across Nathan Rd at Chunking Mansions which is an ugly building. The location of this hotel is excellent with an entrance to the Tsim Sha Shui MTR and KCR right outside as well as an HSBC ATM. All the shops in and around Nathan Road are easy to walk to as is the Star Ferry terminal and Harbour Plaza shopping mall. It was handy having internet access in the room but it was slow and not always reliable with an old version of netscape, good enough for me to check my web e mail though. All the staff were impeccably polite and helpful. We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants as there are so many other places to eat out close-by. We would definitely recommend this hotel based on location, price, staff and cleanliless. However be warned about the size of the rooms, especially if you're travelling with more than one large case or plan on doing a lot of shopping.One last word - the service through Asiarooms was excellent and I would not hesitate using this site again.

<Content>Reasonably priced hotel in the heart of Kowloon The Kowloon Hotel, located at the tip of Tsim Tsa Tsui, Kowloon, is a sister hotel of the famed Peninsula Hotel just across the road. What I like about the Kowloon Hotel is its excellent location for both the tourist and the business traveller. With Tsim Tsa Tsui MTR station at its doorsteps, what more can you ask for. The rooms come with free internet access from a desktop computer from which you can also obtain the latest tourist information. At HK$600 per night, it is reasonably priced for a hotel of this standard and locality. The Airport Express shuttle service stops at this hotel making it convenient for trips to and from the airport. The only drawback is the small size of the room. A standard double room had just sufficient space for 2 medium sized suitcases. I would recommend the Kowloon Hotel more for the business traveller rather than family groups on leisure trips.

<Content>Returned from Hong Kong today 2 March 05 As othe people have stated the rooms are very very small, which the hotel cannot do much about, we got the 3rd floor which meant noise from the traffic was audible but not unbearable.The staff were pleasant and helpful almost all spoke english.The hotel is situated in the Tsim sha Tsui area and is ideal for most of the tourisity type places, shopping, star ferry and harbour front etc.The hotel bedrooms have free wireless broadband internet connection and each room has its own email address which excellent, the only problem is that the browser they use is a dinosaur ie Netscape 4.08 which means that a lot of webpages do not display properly, or not at all.Meals are expensive to eat in at the hotel, a buffet dinner was $280 hk each which is pricey, you don't have to eat there of course.They have nonsmoking floor levels which we asked for, and in our room we had ashtrays and matches supplied which is a bit unusual for a non smoking room !Overall we had no problems apart from the weather it was Cooold.
