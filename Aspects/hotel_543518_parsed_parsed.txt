<Content>downtown alternative We stayed in the Residence Inn near the Toronto airport for a long weekend. We were in Toronto to see the Red Sox play the Blue Jays. Our schedule kept changing so by the time we could commit to our trip there were no decent rates available at any of the downtown hotels.The Residence Inn was clean and comfortable. There are many restaurant choices nearby, but the nearest grocery store is a few miles away. The drive to Toronto took about 30 minutes, from leaving the hotel parking lot to finding a parking lot/spot in downtown. On the second day, we drove about 15 minutes to a subway stop and took the train into the city. It's free on the weekends and was clean and safe.While everything went fine, if we return to Toronto I would prefer to stay in downtown for the convenience. If you want to rest, get rid of bags, change clothes, etc., it's difficult when your hotel is far away from places you want to see.We enjoyed the baseball games and would highly recommend visiting the Hockey Hall of Fame in downtown. Also, absolutely take time to stop in Niagara Falls to see the falls.

<Content>Could Not Have Been Better I believe in giving credit when credit is due and this hotel deserves alot. Went to Toronto to celebrate our 33rd anniversary and for theater downtown. Unlike years ago, hotel prices in the city are outrageous and deals can't be found. Previous reviews for this hotel have been great and this was enough for us. All services by hotel staff were done with a smile everytime. Check-in was a pleasure and the separate 1 bedroom room was superb. Every dish, glass and utensil was clean and waiting for use. The swimming pool was neither hot nor cold. Just cool enough to be refreshing. The whirlpool was plently warm enough. Several restaurants including Montana's Bar and Grill, Tony Roma's, Tucker's MarketPlace and Boston Pizza are across from the hotel and there is no need to drive. We ate at Ton'y Roma's and with the tip spent $80. There are no cheap places to eat. The drive to downtown is about 18 miles if going via the 401 then down Yonge Street. A better choice might be the TTC from the Yorkdale Mall. Cost is $2.25 per person each way if you buy at least 10 tokens at the mall entrance to the train. Parking at the mall is free and safe. Entire area is patrolled by security. We were out until 11:30 pm at there was still plenty of activity in the area. Always felt safe and the parking garage is brightly lit. Be sure and research the drive to and from the hotel as the traffic in Toronto is unbeliveable.This hotel and it's staff exceeded our expectations and we will stay here again.

<Content>what a great place!! My family and I booked a 2 bedroom suite at this airport hotel and I was a little leery due to some of the negative reviews, but when we walked into our suite everyone went ...hmm nice... The fully equiped kitchen had granite countertops and ceramic tile floors as did the 2 bathroms in our suite. The beds were very comfortable and with 3 tvs in the suite we all watched what we wanted in complete comfort. At $230 per night for this luxury suite along with a hot breakfast made this a great value. The service was very sincere and friendly and we really could not have asked for more!

<Content>Great value, no complaints Just had a romantic night with my wife (who else?) and thought this hotel was very good. Was hoping to go downtown but looking at $275 or more for anything good. For $129 + tax we got- huge 1 bedroom unit with separate living/kitchen area, great Kingsize bed w tons of pillows (w pullout sofa bed, you could manage w 2 additional people if you really wanted a value stay but pay the whopping 129 and enjoy).- well equipped kitchen, modern everything- 2 TVs, both modern- corridor bathroom sink/closet and full bathroom- full hot buffet brkft that had lots of choice and hot, unlike many buffets.- free parking, free Internet access- nice pool, hottub, and well-maintained weight room (there is also a mini-basketball court outside)- quality throughout room as in fixtures, kitchen counters, applicances, tables, etc.No restaurant on-site (ergo the name residence inn and kitchens and grocery room-delivery - wow), but lots of restaurants and other hotel restaurants around. We chose, based on Internet reviews, to eat at Renaissance hotel 2 blocks away, which was pricy (surprise, surprise) but very pretty and v gd food.The only negative was one of the two TV remotes was bad but they had it fixed within 1 hour.Only overall disappointment is the lack of live music/dancing at the airport hotels, a lost art perhaps? This area could really do well on value by offering more entertainment and thereby offer a half-price experience that competes with downtown Toronto.Steve

<Content>Best Value in Area My wife and I have stayed at many airport area hotels in the past several years . The Residence Inn provided us with the best value by far when one packages together the room type, staff, free evening snacks and following day breakfast, service, etc. It will be our choice every time we need near airport accomodation.Bob and MaryPeterborough, Ontario

<Content>Not what we were led to believe I chose this hotel for our lay overs on our way to and from Cuba based mainly on Trip Advisor reviews and my general positive experience with this hotel brand.I booked directly through the hotel website, were i was given an opportunity to state special needs and preferences. When we arrived we found the staff less than welcoming. And the room we were assigned did not match any of our stated needs ( i.e. a cot) and preferences( e.g. high floor, extra pillows, etc.). When I called the front desk to inquire about the cot we had requested I was informed that they do not have cots. I was told to use the sofa bed ( the usual thin mattress over loose wire mesh) , and to make the bed myself with the sheets and blankets in the closet.Unlike most Residence Inn hotels I have stayed at, the decor and furniture looked cheap and dated.We had been looking forward to our stay as a place to relax in our way to our destination. But what we found was not what we were led to believe during the reservation process.I cancelled our reservation for the return leg and stayed at a hotel in Terminal 3. Much better.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel and Nicely Priced Me and My Wife stayed in this Hotel Recently as it was the top available choice for the weekend we wanted to stay ( The #1 was the Residence Inn Downtown, but was booked up because of the Toronto Film Festival going on the same weekend )  We arrived late and the staff were very helpful and check in was very smooth and painless, the Room was a 4th floor room and was a nice size and very clean, the layout was very user friendly and the kitchenette was a nice size, we would see planes landing all the time outside our room but you could barely hear them thanks to the excellent soundproofing. Parking was Free which was a nice bonus and the drive to the nearest Subway Station was only about 10 mins away, Toronto has an excellent Public Transport System so leaving the Car behind was a viable option and parking was never a concern for us. The free high speed internet in the room was also a breeze to use and very very fast, and to top it off the Breakfast in the mornings was tasty and plentiful. I would stay in this hotel again in a Heartbeat and recommend it to my friends.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed here for three nights on a trip to Toronto for a family wedding. My in-laws booked a two bedroom suite which we shared with them, price wise it was cheaper than two separate rooms elsewhere. We also had the added bonus of a living area with dining table and sofa, so we actually had friends and family come meet us at the hotel and come up to the room without feeling that they were intruding. Having the kitchen, complete with microwave and dishwasher was also really great.If you fancy eating out there are restaurants close by, either walkable or a short drive away. It is also pretty convenient for the road network with highway 27 and the 401 easily accessible allowing us to get both to the wedding, and also pretty quickly into the centre of the city for a bit of sight seeing.The staff were always really friendly - everybody said good morning to us if we passed them in the corridor. The whole place appeared clean and well looked after. Being 30 degrees outside we didn't experience the heating, but the air-con worked great.Location wise it is pretty close to the airport, but doesn't suffer much from noise. The noise of planes was only noticeable on the third day, when the big jets were coming in on the flightpath closest to the building - but with the soundproofing it wasn't a problem. The other two days the big jets were coming in elsewhere and you'd be hard pressed to hear them at all.On top of all that you get a breakfast thrown in too - very popular but well worth the effort.

<Content>Great deal Stayed at the Residence Inn Toronto Airport 29-31 Aug in a 2 bedroom suite. With four children this was a great deal as included full breakfast each morning and evening reception Monday to Thursdays (5:00 to 7:30). Children loved to make own waffles. We arrived on Wednesday which was a bar-b-que night but unfortunately did not return from shopping in time to partake. Thursday night was chicken stirfry with rice which we all enjoyed. The bedrooms are a bit smaller than we were used to but adequate. Two bathrooms and three tv's were, of course, a great convenience with four teenagers. Only drawback - in checking in I asked if we could have a rollaway bed as with three girls 12, 16 and 18 they did not want to share sofa bed with older brother. However, front desk said rollaway bed was not allowed in room with sofa bed. We solved the situation with going out to Walmart and buying a aerobed with pump for $29. Would defintely stay there again.

<Content>Loved our stay would recommend highly Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Toronto Airport Residence inn and are very happy. We picked this location to be half way to downtown and half way to cananda's wonderland . Very happy with the reservation desk asking if we would like an Early check-in!! this was very helpful we were able to check-in at 11:00 am . They called once we got to our room to see if everything was to our liking. We booked a 2 bedroom suite it was very CLEAN and well furnished the 2 bathrooms are perfect for a family of 4 much easier for showers and getting ready to go. Nice tvs in room 3 total. Excellent hot breakfeast included with room eggs, french toast ,bagels, home fries, fresh fruit , juice, yogert ,muffins , cereal and much more. we brought it up to our room and ate in our kitchen. Fireplace in room was nice addition. Bathrooms are marble with very lovely faucets. Large enough to be very comfortable. Beds were furnished with down conforters very comfortable. The pool and hot tub were very clean and not crowded. Hot tub was perfect temp. Can't say enough for this location. Also we asked for late check out which was no problem..This hotel is not fancy and frilly it is just what you need to be happy and comfortable, and not feel they took you to the cleaners. our 2 night stay was $497.00 canadian and worth every penny

<Content>decent hotel, decent price I stayed in this hotel while attending a function that was in the area. Upon arrival I was a little dissappointed in the staff while checking in. They were almost 'rude' so to speak, as if they didn't want us there. After that was all over with, we went up to our two bedroom suite which was quite spacious. It had a full kitchen and two bathrooms as well. Overall, I thought it was a decent stay for a decent price. There wasn't anything about the hotel that was exceptional, but I wasn't in it very much.

<Content>Great clean hotel Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of July while visiting Toronto city. Traveled in to Toronto by subway, station approx 10 minutes drive from hotel. Although hotel is close to airport there was no aircraft noise. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite and friends stayed in a 2 bed suite both were very clean and a good size. Carol on the front desk was really helpful and a great credit to the hotel. There are four restaurants within 5 minutes walk of the hotel including Pizza, Tony Roma ribs and 2 family restaurants.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Marriot Residence hotels are an excellent idea. Each comes with a fully fitted kitchen, stove, microwave, fridge, all the utensils, etc. This is very useful!! Bedroom and lounge areas are separated, each having their own tv. Good location in Mississauga but you will need a car! Toronto 20 mins away, Niagara an hour. Hotel has complimentary computer access in all rooms and a pc in the lobby for use by guests Breakfast complimentary. Very clean and seems quite new. Would return in a heartbeat!

<Content>Somewhat disappointed... After reading all the reviews on Trip Advisor we booked our stay from 7/16-7/22 at a AAA rate of $209 for a two bedroom suite-we were excited knowing that the reviews were positive. Upon our arrival we told the front desk that we would be leaving 2 days earlier than originally booked and were then told that our room rate would increase an add'l $20/night-much to our surprise -we thought we had a confirmed rate of $209 per night so be aware of this rate fluctuation. Our 2 bedroom suite was spotless and in very good condition and although we requested a high floor we ended up on the 3rd floor-there was too much traffic noise so upon our request we were moved to the 5th floor-there was no availability on the higher floors. There is one community computer for use by hotel patrons but a good majority of the time it is occupied by children...understandable. The pool is okay and the jacuzzi warm but in need of stronger jets to get that therapuetic affect. The breakfast buffet was great-many hot items to choose from and always well stocked no matter what time of the morning it was. The staff that worked the buffet were wonderful-pleasant and helpful. We did not try the evening reception so I cannot comment on that.Beside the disappointment of the rate fluctuation I have two other issues with the hotel. The first being that it is in the middle of a business park and there is NOTHING around for entertainment save for the adults -only place that I'm sure many businessmen frequent while there. The hotel itself did not even have pay TV so my children couldn't even watch a pay movie if they had wanted to. The nearest movie theater was a 25 minute drive through some not so nice sections of Toronto. So we basically felt like we had to stay out really late as there was nothing to do once we got back except for swimming or trying to use the mini basketball court that was always in use. My other issue is that restaurant selection in the area ,was very poor...there is a Montanas, Marketplace, Boston Pizza, Tony Romas and Outback by the business park and everything else was fast food....it was amazing-we ended up at Boston Pizza twice and on the second night my 13 yr old commented that her Ravioli bake tasted just like canned Chef Boyardee and she was completely correct! This is just my opinion-I was very excited to go and then disappointed after we had gotten there-It is so far away from anything dowtown!

<Content>Excellent Hotel and Staff Loved this hotel.... My wife and I stayed here on a great weekend rate while visiting Toronto. The staff was extremely friendly and were great at recommending attractions and providing detailed travel directions into the downtown areas. The room (actually two rooms - living area and a separate bedroom) was huge and the bed was very comfortable. We would not hesitate to stay here again if we return to the area.

The room was spacious and clean with a nice kitchen and separate bedroom and pull out couch for the children. The staff was pleasant and very informative about local attractions. Breakfast had a wide variety of food. It's a great hotel for a family vacation.

<Content>why would they ruin yor stay for just one little thing. July 15th,2007Vancouver BC.We are staying in this property for another couple days. This is an excellent property for our requirements. The room we are in is a one bedroom studio. This is a very clean place. The only thing which bothered us was the pull out sofa bed mattress. It is terrible. You could feel every coil spring of this mattress. When we complained they simply brought another one and doubled it up. This one was worse than the other one and why would they do that in the first place. Anyways we told them to take one of them away and our 12 year son slept with us the whole week in king size bed with us which was very comfortable. Except for the sofa bed we have no complains.

<Content>Pleasant and Relaxing Stay My husband and I attended a convention in the Toronto area in May. We decided to stay here the last night because of our early flight the next morning. I'm glad to have stayed in this #1 rated hotel. The suite was updated, very clean and spacious. We could look out the window to see our rental car parked on the lot. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Value was great which included a hearty breakfast. I would have rated it a 5 except that we couldn't get through the pizza restaurant line linked to the hotel for delivery. We were very tired from a day spent at Niagara Falls and had to walk across to a restaurant mall for a pizza dinner. Just like the previous review, it would have been great if they had a restaurant on-site. Also, my 5:30am wake-up call didn't happen so it's a good thing we also set the alarm clock. Overall, it was a pleasant and relaxing stay!

<Content>Would have wanted to stay longer Stayed for the night since we need to be at the airport at 4:30 AMthe next day. Excellent hotel. Its very clean, front desk staff were extremely helpful and we were pleasantly surprised by the afternoon buffet snacks of pizza, soup, cookies, and fruits.Restaurants are nearby and the most important of all is the complimentary 24/7 airport shuttle. This is usually not the case in most Toronto airport hotels.Couldn't have asked for more!!!

<Content>Great for families!!! I had to travel for business with my husband and baby (9 months old), and was looking for a hotel that would be family-friendly. I booked this hotel based on recommendations from this site, and I was very happy with our stay!We had a one bedroom suite (all of the rooms are suites). The full kitchen had pots and pans, a dishwasher, utensils (even a cutting board, vegetable peeler, and a colander). The refrigerator had an automatic icemaker. We reserved a crib for our baby, which fit into the bedroom. The room was clean and everything looked very new. There were two televisions: one in the living room, and one in the bedroom. The TV channel selection was good (we don't have cable, so it was great for us). High-speed internet was INCLUDED with the room (very nice!).The breakfast buffet was fabulous! Eggs, sausage, potatoes, make your own waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, muffins, croissants, coffee, and tea.Some of the evenings they offer light meals - we had lasagna and soup one evening. You can buy drinks (beer and wine), and the hotel has a small market where you can buy things like ice cream, frozen dinners, and snacks.The hotel staff were very friendly. The shuttle to and from the airport was convenient and easy to use.We had food delivered for dinner. My one wish was that more places delivered! We didn't rent a car, so if you stay here for more than a day or two, I'd recommend having a car so you can get out.All in all, I would definitely stay here again, and would highly recommend this place to business travelers and to families.

<Content>Good Value We stayed at the Residence Inn Feb 16-18. We had rooms 313-314. The room was very clean and comfortable. Staff was wondeful and helpful and breakfast in the mornings was good. Pool was not crowded at all and hot tub was very warm.Airport noise was minimal on Friday and Saturday night but Sunday morning it was quite loud. For the price we paid it was bearable.Would recommend and would stay there again.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed the weekend of February 10, 2007. Booked 2 one bedroom suite. It was a wonderful experienced from reservationI called the Marriot reservation department spoke to a guy namedCharles he was very helpful. As soon as we got to the hotel, Carol at the front desk was very hospitable, she told us about the shutte that runs from the hotel to the airport I have to pick up my niece from the Philippines.  The swimming pool has a fair size open from 6:00 am till11:00 p.m. Breakfast was nice sausages, srambled egg, waffles.

<Content>Good hotel but can be crowded with kids on the weekend My review, like many others, is that this is a very good hotel.- Staff is very friendly- Rooms are comfortable and nicely furnished- Location is a good one, especially if you need to be near the airportKeep in mind, that when my wife and son (18 years old) were there on a recent weekend, that the place was packed with kids (seemingly several hockey tournaments were taking place at the same time). This was only an issue when eating breakfast (the small room was jam-packed) and when we wanted a leisurely and quiet swim in the pool and hot tub (that wasn't going to happen with a bunch of 10 - 12 year old boys!).Other than that we enjoyed our stay

<Content>Great Choice Very pleasant experience at the Residence Inn from start to finish. I called the front desk from baggage pickup at the airport and their shuttle was at the terminal within 10 minutes. Check-in staff were very courteous and they had a small bag of brownies for me. The room was spotless and well-equipped, right down to the bag of microwave popcorn which I ate while watching a hockey game on the living room plasma TV. no noise problems, despite the proximity to the airport and the bed was very comfortable. The complimentary breakfast buffet was nice and the shuttle back to the airport (must be pre-booked) left promptly.All in all, a great stay... ! Thanks to previous Tripadvisors for your reviews, as they were what led me to this hotel as opposed to some of the others I have stayed in before.

<Content>All the creature comforts! I really enjoyed staying at this Residence Inn. I am a Marriotts rewards member so I know what to expect when I go to their properties. Although this Residence Inn was by the airport you really didn't hear the airplanes. Its in a Industrial section so I think its geared towards business professionals. Nonetheless, my family and I enjoyed the indoor pool and spa. It has courtesy computer in which you can access the internet. The workout room is nice. Very nice and updated machines. Our room was perfect. We spent a lot of money on food prior to coming here so it was a nice change to be able to cook a good and inexpensive meal in the luxuary of our own apartment(thats what it felt like) My husband LOVED LOVED the plasma TV in the living room area. The beds were comfortable and we had a good nights sleep. It's only about 20 minutes from downtown Toronto which is fine by me........All the hustle and bustle of the city is for city living folks. I live in a nice city suburb of Cleveland and don' t feel the need to have that excessive traffic. I like to move from point A to point B with ease. I like to get where I am going with out sitting in a parking lot of traffic. This Residence Inn being out of the loop was perfect.Oh yeah it had a club right across the street from it. They played Raggae and top 40 music. Which was nice. It's in walking distance from the hotel. So if you want to get a quick nightcap you have that opportunity.
