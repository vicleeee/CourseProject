<Content>Great Room I stayed here for a couple of nights and the room was great, really big and comfortable and I could see the Hollywood sign in the distance from my window. Staff were all friendly. Hotel was fairly near the subway for the train. The Restaurant I would imagine is great although a little above my budget! The bar was nice although the Bar Staff could be a little more friendly. Booked through skoosh.co and got a good deal. Location is good for business area but not so good for the tourist.

<Content>Loved the Omni With a great staff, clean, comfortable rooms with nice amenities and a large, comfy bed, The Omni is a great choice for those staying in downtown LA.The surrounding neighborhood is transitional but relatively safe and there's some great funky finds just down the hill on Broadway.

<Content>Great Stay At The Omni I spent 2 nights at the Omni in downtown LA during a recent business trip. This was my first time to stay at an Omni andI was very pleased.The staff at the front desk and the bellhops were very courteous and efficient. The bellhop filled my ice bucket up for me withoutbeing asked. I was very pleased with my room. It had nice decor and waswell maintained. The bathroom was very large and had a seperate shower and tub. The bed was extremely comfortable.I stay at Sheraton's quite often and this bed was more comfortable than the Sheraton heavenly sleeper. The pillows were the best I have ever slept on. The had a mixture of bothfirm and soft, and large and small pillows. I was very pleased with my stay here and would highly recomend this hotel to anyone who needs to be in the downtown LA area.

<Content>Good Choice We had a great stay at the Omni although I agree with the previous reviewer that the beds are way too high!! I've never had a bed that's so high up! The room was a really nice size as was the bathroom and the service was excellent the whole time - I especially liked the touch of the complimentary hot apple juice and biscuits in reception. One thing I was a bit annoyed about was that when we enquired about internet access we were told we could pay $9 a day for wi-fi in the room but then I remembered reading something on tripadvisor before we booked and we called back and were told if we registered online (for free) we would get free internet access...it was a bit annoying they didn't bother mentioning that and if I hadn't read it on here and remembered we would have paid for something they offer for free. Apart from that it was a nice hotel and there's a nice little shop down in the plaza next to the hotel where you can wander to buy snacks and drinks and also a starbucks and a few restaurants. I would probably stay here again if I was in LA, I would have like to have been in Santa Monica with more restaurants, shops etc but the prices there are much higher and from what I've read the standard of hotel not as good.

<Content>Good hotel The Omni is a good hotel. The rooms tend to be clean and comfortable. Staff tends to be responsive to customer issues. The gym is modern. The only real concern was there is a charge to use the computer at the business center. That is a little disappointing, considering the high tariff at the hotel. On the whole, I would say that this is probably one of your better options in Los Angeles. Hopefully, my main concern is resolved in the future so guests can have real business center access.

<Content>Omni L.A. If you have to stay overnight in the business section of downtown L.A., the Omni is a great choice, especially on the Club level. Nice touches, like a toilet kit in the bathroom containing razor, shaving cream, toothbrush and toothpaste (in case you forgot any of them). Very nice rooms. Good restaurant. Free drinks and cacapes in the Club Lounge. Internet access in your room and two computers available in the Club Lounge. Plus you're close to everything, both business and cultural.

<Content>Omni Beautiful My daughter and I were in LA to visit USC. The Omni has a discount for campus-related stays, so we decided to try it. It is a beautiful property - California Plaza is an office complex plus Omni that surround a gorgeous plaza. The hotel itself is high-end without being stuffy. The staff, from the parking attendants to the bellhops to the folks at check-in were universally friendly and helpful. Our room was fresh, well-furnished, quiet and comfortable. Based on the quality to price ($175) ratio, I rate this hotel a 10.

<Content>Exceptional Service We recently stayed at the Omni for business and felt the service really set them apart. The concierge, Amy Leland, was particulary helpful, friendly and competent helping us with some unexpected problems with a delivery we needed for a trade show. Everyone at the hotel is upbeat, professional and goes out of their way to make sure you have everything you need promptly. The rooms are nice but not exceptional for a hotel in this class, I felt the dining choices were somewhat limited but they do offer a free car service and we used that a couple of times to explore other restaurants in the downtown area. Would certainly stay here again when on business in the downtown LA area

<Content>An excellent Downtown hotel This hotel is well located if you want the Downtown area of LA. The Pershing Square Metro station is only a few minutes walk away and the Downtown entertainment area in also close.The room and the bathroom was large and well furnished. The standard of house keeping was excellent. Unfortunately there were no Internet facilities in the room.The Concierge was helpful, but unfortunately the advice given was not correct.The hotel is quiet and there is a complimentary morning newspaper.I recommend you go to Starbucks in the Watercourt, next door, for breakfast.I would use the Omni again

<Content>One of our favorite hotels My husband and I stayed at this hotel 3 nights, and we are very impressed with the location, the room, the staff and their services.The front desk staff was extremely well trained, courteous, and helpful. Our Room was clean, nicely appointed, and with excellent beddings. With Omni's Select Guest membership, in-room wireless internet access is complimentary (for both of our laptops,) as well as your choice of 2 morning drinks, served at the time you select, to your room. There is a valet/parking charge.Omni is one of our favorite hotels for our domestic travel.

<Content>Some good...some work needed Stayed 4 nights at this hotel. Overall, acceptable but some issue to make you all aware of prior to booking:1) I needed to move to five different rooms before I had a WI FI signal strong enough to hold the connection. Very poor WI FI in most rooms. Bridge unit from the desk didn't boost or improve. Even in room I finally settled in still got kicked off repeatedly.2) Coffee maker missing in room. All other items present, but needed to have new coffee maker delivered.3) Carpet was VERY worn. It was clean, but very worn and really needed to be replaced.4) Having only the NOE Restaraunt for PM dining limited choices for a lighter fare. Room service was only option other than going elsewhere. NOE dinner was excellent, but not a wide selection and a bit pricy if someone wanted a lighter touch.

<Content>An excellent start to our holiday, care of The Omni! This hotel is great 鈥?we got a great deal through Expedia by booking alongside our flights and were kind of spoiled as this set an early bar for the rest of our holiday!From dropping the car off with the valet, to check in (which was smooth and efficient) we had a first class experience here and would recommend it to anyone, with easy access to the subway links, which was a very inexpensive way for us to travel, without having to once use the car (it鈥檚 a little dark around the entrance to the subway at night, next to the park but was ok to walk briskly past at night, back towards the hotel!) We used the subway to get to Universal and Hollywood Boulevard, from which we were able to walk to the Hollywood Bowl.The room was spacious, comfortable and felt new and was a delight to return to after a long day in and around various parts of LA; the bathroom was roomy and had a great shower 鈥?we had breakfast in the restaurant the first morning but found it a little expensive to indulge in every morning, so we made do with the Starbucks which was onsite which was a great way for us to start the day. Sign up to Select Guest on their website before you go; this enables you to free wi-fi Internet access in your room.In conclusion, don鈥檛 let the location of this hotel put you off, the subway was easy and cheap and we found it a lovely base, in almost five star surroundings!

<Content>An Exceptional Stay We arrived at the Omni after a 10.5 hour flight from the UK and I'm pleased to say the positive comments made by others on the hotel were accurate and we relaxed in comfort.Check in was hassle free, staff in general extremely courteous (especially the doormen). The two concierge we dealt with were very useful regarding transport and finding places to dine in the evening. The room aspect of the stay was very pleasant - a wide variety of channels (around thirty), a comfortable bed (although I found the pillows massive and prefer shallower ones rather than deeper ones) but got round this by sleeping on the very edge of them. View was of Disney Concert Hall and very interesting. Despite a large variety of business traffic on weekdays the room remained very quiet within. Bathroom nice, very clean with nice products. The rooms are furnished with desk, small coffee table and small sofa but are certainly not the most elaborate I have stayed in - but, very clean and functional. Lifts, hallways and lobby were all exceptionally clean and adequately decorated. Gym is good with a wide variety of equipment and pool is nice - a shame the towering skyscrapers around the property don't allow much sun to it - so is quite cool even on hotter days. We rented a car from concierge one day and it arrived on time and was a good rate. About $70 a day + fuel for a 22/23 year old with extra insurance coverage for younger drivers.If I was being very critical of this hotel I would say it's weakest point is the location. Although it is a five minute walk to the 720 bus to Santa Monica and the 16 To Beverly Centre, after dark there is the very little to do and what restaurants there are, are pretty expensive. The Daily Grill to name one was pricey with terrible service (I think it's on 6th St). Try the KooKooRoo opposite the hotel (out back door of Level Two, its very affordable and does a nice variety of chicken and sides for about $6 a person - we found it excellent. It was NBA off season but, during the season you could get the hotel car (Lexus) to take you to the Staples Centre (5 mins by car away) which would give you something exciting to do.Travel wise to Santa Monica it's about a 60 min journey + 20 in rush hour, to Beverly Centre/The Grove about 30-40 mins (bus journey).I would definately stay in this hotel again but, maybe tempted to locate to a hotel nearer B.Hills/The beaches if you don't want longer bus journeys to the stereotypical attractions. As a downtown business venue it is second to none. OVERALL I WOULD RATE THIS HOTEL EXCELLENT!

<Content>Roses have thorns Firstly i agree with all the other reviews about how nice this hotel is, the door men all welcome you in with a thousand smiles and everything in the room is always left in pristine condition. However on arrival me and my boyfriend were allocated a room with two single beds, an easy mistake to make we thought so we went down to try and fix this problem only to be told we couldn't! Not happy! Especially given the cost of the hotel! Which brings me onto my main point...if you're coming to staying at the Omni be sure to bring an elasticated wallet because you're gona need a whole lota money. $7 for 15mins on the internet. $30 for parking. and that doesnt even include all the tips you gota throw at them constantly all day long. the staff are nice...but most of them only when they know that they're bank balance will benefit from being nice to you. but if none of that bothers you you should have a really nice stay lol! the hotel is just as beautiful as the photos show!

<Content>Great staff, great room, great trip. My girlfriend and I stayed at Omni for 2 nights and had a great time. After spending 4 nights in Hollywood, we wanted to experience the downtown area of L.A. and we were glad we booked our stay at the Omni. This place was a steal for the price we paid! Our room was ready upon our arrival and the room was spacious and clean. My girlfriend raved about the Spa (she had a massage and facial) and while she was being pampered, I enjoyed a few cocktails at the Noe Restaurant. The location was great as it was close to all the major throughfares. We parked our rental with the valet and it was quite expensive, but we never needed to jump back in the rental because the hotel provided a courtesy car which was free for any destination within a 3 mile radius of the hotel. We utilized the courtesy car (sleek Lincoln Navigator) to visit Chinatown, to take us to dinner at Arnie Morton's Steakhouse (excellent), in addition to a couple of other downtown destinations. I will definitely stay at the Omni during my next trip to L.A.

<Content>Definitely Staying Here Again! My husband and I stayed for 2 nights (8/31-9/02) at the Omni hotel. The hotel staff were very friendly - from the valet folks to the room service people. We booked the hotel directly through the website and used our AAA discount. We got a good price ($161.night) considering it was labor day weekend. We had a quick check in since we were select guest (it's Omni's hotel rewards program). I informed the front desk that we had a car so instead of including it in our bill, he waived it for us because we were select guests. The front desk gave us our keys and we were on way to the room. I noticed once we got to our room, all the preferences we had listed when enrolling into their program, were fulfilled (high floor room, in the corner, away from the elevator, non-smoking, with a king size bed). What other hotel will accomadate to all your preferences.The room was very roomy. The bed was very comfy along with the down pillows - it complemented each well and I slept like a baby both nights. It was quite and we even had turndown service. Also we enrolled into their rewards program (Select Guest) our WiFi connection was free and we received complimentary juice, coffee, or tea- which ever you prefer - every morning.This hotel will definitely be on my list to come back to when we are in LA.

<Content>Couldn't be more satisfied I stayed for 4 nights in late August. I got this hotel through a package deal. I have to agree with those that gave the hotel great reviews. I utilized the Online check in and our keys were waiting for us upon our arrival allowing us to bypass checking in with the front desk.Like others, I highly recommend signing up for the Select Guest program; the complimentary beverages in the morning are a nice way to start off each day. And the turndown service is a nice way to end the day.Amy, their concierge was top notch. She was very helpful with suggestions and providing directions to places we wanted to go and she did this without us having to ask. And while it was $30/day, I wasn't too upset because frankly we were on vacation and that's come to be a normal expectation and they were quick and prompt; we never had to wait long for the car.On the last night, we weren't getting any hot water and I contacted the front desk. Upon our return from the evening out, the front desk manager Gary informed us that the problem was still not fixed. Taken proactive measures, he gave us access to another room to take a shower the next morning and comped up 2 days' parking for the inconvenience.Last but not least, it was in a great location, with easy access to the I-101We stayed at the Omni San Diego as part of our trip as well and there is no comparison; Omni LA at California Plaza's service lived up to it's four-star rating.

<Content>Loved the Hotel - not great location for tourists Stayed at the Omni for 3 nights. Could not fault the hotel. Service was excellent. Staff so helpful. I would comment that it is not a great location if you are a tourist however we had a car so were able to get about. $30 a day to park but this was so much cheaper than San Francisco. Did not find traffic a problem. It was unfortunate that we arrived on a Sunday - could not find a decent restaurant open nearby so ended up ordering room service. This was not too pricey as we were careful what we ordered. Cannot blame the hotel for the location we should have researched better before we went. We thought for a city hotel the rooms were very spacious and the bathroom was big with a separate bath and shower. Do not be put off by the outside of the hotel - it looks nothing but inside it is really nice.

<Content>Found the service wonderful I found the staff at this hotel really lovely--polite and helpful at every turn. It's an expensive hotel and in downtown, which might not be where tourists want to stay (no walk to the beach, after all!), but for business purposes it really can't be beat. I slept SO soundly on the bed--I woke up in the same position I fell asleep in, and don't think I moved in the eight hours in between!

<Content>Loved the Omni This hotel was central to all of the attractions we wanted to see in LA. There were free nightly shows downtown for my teenage sons. They both loved the shows. I think Sesame Street World was showing. The hotel staff was very helpful. The beds were so soft I did not want to leave. My only complaint is the extra cost for refridge(pay extra) and no microwave. Other than the 30.00 per day in/out parking, I was very satisfied. By the way, you may be able to walk 1/2 block up Olive and get in/out parking much cheaper if you don't mind the 1/2 block stroll.

<Content>Horrible Service The front desk service and the hostess for the Grand Cafe were rude. Simply posed questions easily confused the staff who responded with arrogance. Really, 80% of the staff could use a lot customer service training. The valet staff were the only decent people. The pictures are good but inaccurate. The room was simple and small. AND the water smells like sulfur. I would never stay at an Omni hotel again.

<Content>Loved The Omni I loved being here. This is a 4 star hotel, and it was a great experience. Everyone was very accomodating.Our first room had a view of the fountain - unfortunately in the afternoon I smelled cigarette smoke coming up through the air vents - it was not in the hallway, so it was not neighbors. I phoned the desk and we were immediately moved to another room. That room did not have a great view, and still had a sort of stale cig smell, so we moved again, back to the original floor, but, a corner suite, with fantastic views, and no cigarette smells whatsoever.From the moment we arrived, Charlie helped us out (make sure you tip everyone btw, bring dollars and fives, or more if you wish), we were treated like royalty. The maids were super sweet, the receptionists were great, the staff was amazing. Chocoalates and ice came in the afternoon as well as turn down. WiFi (make sure you sign up as a Select Guest on their website so you can get that free).There's in and out service with the parking system, so you are only charged for parking once a day.The bathroom is big - separate shower and bath. I asked for extra towels daily from the maid, she did this daily, without us asking which was great. BTW, the maids that we had were wonderful.One night we were at a restaurant and called for the courtesy car to take us back.Couldn't be happier! Great place to stay!Oh and the manager sent us up fruit and an apology about the other two rooms, so we were very very happy.Almost forgot this, we asked for a refrigerator for some of our personal things, and we had that in the room - no charge.There was also daily shuttle service to the convention center.Can you beat that? Nope!

<Content>Average - Wouldn't stay again We stayed at the Omni for 2 nights in August.Overall the stay was OK. The rooms were really big, felt like an apartment, but the location is terrible.If your in town to work in teh CBD, then fantastic, but if your a tourist, then there is NO point in staying downtown as everything is at least a 5-10 minute drive away and you have to pay for parking.I found the Omni dated, and felt like something more suitable for the elderly. It was old fashioned and the decor really out-dated.I wouldn't stay here again. We ended up forgoing out last night's prepaid accommodation and stayed in Beverly Hills, simply for the location.

<Content>Nice Downtown Hotel My daughter and I stayed at the Omni at California Plaza. It was close to activities downtown and travel from there to Hollywood and other tourist destinations in the morning was easy since traffic was coming toward downtown. The room was nice and the beds comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful with one exception; our in-room safe was locked when we arrived and no one ever came to reset it for our use during our three night stay despite two requests.  Parking was by valet only and, at $30.00 a day, was too much. The subway was only a couple of blocks away (Persing Square) and that was convinient when we went to Universal Studios. We had a10:00 a.m. flight out and was aftraid traffic would be bad going to the airport. We encountered a slight backup as soon as we got on the freeway but it was clear sailing after that. A welcome surprise. I would stay here again if the price was right.

<Content>Great hotel - not so great location for turism! We spent 3 nights in the Omni LA, it was a great experience, staff were friendly and helpful, breakfast was amazing and the room was comfortable - loved the bed!!! The only negative aspect was the location, if you are looking for a holiday it is really far away from all the LA attractions (apart from museums and concert hall). Won't come back due the location, but would recommend it for business trips to everyone!!

<Content>Another Great Stay at the Omni My family and I stayed at the Omni for one night, as part of our trip to San Diego. LA was a good stop over point for us and allowed us to see The American Girl Store in The Grove--about 20 minutes away. We had stayed at this hotel a few years ago, and liked it then so we rebooked here without a second thought. Once again, we enjoyed our one night stay here. The staff are very friendly and helpful and make you feel very welcomed. The kids received a welcome goodie bag upon arrival. Our room was a standard size hotel room. We had plenty of room for our luggage. The room was clean. We had a great view from our floor to ceiling windows of California Plaza. One of the best things about this hotel was how quiet it is. We noticed this during our first stay a few years ago, and again during this stay. We could not hear any neighbors beside or above us.We ate the buffet breakfast at the hotel. It offered plenty of selection, and while it was not inexpensive, it was quick and helped us to get off to an early start.All in all, the Omni at California Plaza in Los Angeles is a great hotel, that I highly recommend and look forward to staying in again.

<Content>Fab hotel I could not fault this hotel. It was fabulous. Excellent location - I did not have a car and was alittle worried that this would be a problem, it wasn't. This hotel was expensive in comparison to other hotels I stayed in on my one month vacation in America, but by LA standards wasn't that bad and you definitely got value for money. The room was luxourious  spotlessly clean, food was great ( I didn't try breakfast though, it was a bit full on and pricey - I'm not a big eater in the morning), they have a well equiped gym ( headphones, towels, water  fruit all provided free of charge), outdoor pool with loungers and the staff could not have been more pleasant. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a vacation in LA.

<Content>Great Experience After a disappointing stay elsewhere, we checked into the Omni. We got a corner room which was particularly spacious. It was so comfortable that we decided to add to our stay and cancel plans to stay elsewhere for our last few days. The room was very comfortable with many nice amenities. Each day the hotel lobby had bowls of apples for guests and, in the afternoons, a freshly-made iced tea/lemonade brew which varied slightly each day. Omni Select Guest members get additonal amenities, including free WiFi access. Unfortunately, it is not a secure network, so it's not good for business but it's still useful for checking restaurants and places to visit. The location is walking distance to a number of good restaurants as well as only a block to the start of L.A.'s music center complex. It is about a 20 minute walk to L.A.'s Old Mexico section and the hotel is a short drive to Dodgers Stadium and to the Staples Center. It is also very convenient to freeway entrances so within 30 minutes, you can be at the ocean in Santa Monica or enjoying the thrills of Universal Studios. All of this and very competitive prices as well! For our next L.A. trip, we will absolutely stay again at the Omni.

<Content>Special weekend getaway To celebrate my husbands Birthday we went round trip on Amtrak from Oceanside, CA. The Omni will pick you up at the Union Station complementary. The hotel is located in Down town Los Angeles with-in walking distance to all musical events in the Plaza area. During the summer there are free out door concerts in the Plaza. The Omni website offers special weekend rates and packages. We stayed on the Concierge Level and enjoyed complimentary drinks and appetizers in the evening. We ate dinner in the hotel at Noe Restaurant . This is a five star dinning experience. After dinner we enjoyed the concert. Then went back to the Concierge for additional desert and coffee.Sunday morning we had a huge breakfast in the Concierge room, everything you could imagine. After breakfast we went for our downtown walk. To walk downtown Los Angeles on a Sunday morning is a wonderful exploring experience. The streets are empty, no noise, cool breeze and a great photo opportunity. We took photo's of the Museum of Modern Art, Disney Hall, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Courthouse, etc.Upon departure we were fortunate enough to have Robert as our driver. The Omni has a real jewel with Robert as one of their drivers. Thanks Omni Los Angeles for a great weekend get-a-way! Dona Tittle

<Content>Omni - OK! Stayed six nights at the Omni as we got a great deal on Skoosh.com. It worked out at less than 拢75 a night.The room was typical of a large hotel, clean and functional. Service was good and efficiant.Definitely worth signing up to the Select Guest program - it is free. We got free wireless which otherwise is $10 for 24hrs, free beverages and newspapers in the mornings. We didn't eat in either of the restaurants nor really explore the area. We had a car and were travelling out of downtown to see other areas of LA.If you get a great deal then the hotel is worth it, otherwise as a tourist I would stay else where.

<Content>good choice in downtown LA was my home but this time we were only here for one night, just needed a place to sleep for a few hours before attending a funeral the next day, after getting off a 14 hour flight, was nice to get upgraded to the club floor (after I made a small fuss about not sharing a king size bed with my brother, especially since I requested two beds 2 weeks before hand  re requested/confirmed during the online check in process 2 days before arriving in LA)the hotel is older but comfortable, located on a quiet street in LA downtown, we left in a rush in the morning so didn't have a chance to eat there but I'd would go back the next time when I don't have a place to crash in in LA(although if this was a for pleasure trip I'd probably try some of the other boutique hotels in LA)

<Content>Wouldn't go back I was at the Omni on business for 5 days. The hotel itself was beautiful, with a nice restaurant, however management and the guest rooms left much to be desired. The first night I found a wierd eye drop applicator type device in my bed- which left me to seriously question whether or not the bedding was actually changed from the last guest. I requested a new room, but was given a hard time by the manager on duty who simply wanted to change the linens. I was given another room that had still not been cleaned from the last guest!!!My third room had a bed that looked like someone had received a hair cu on- literally had hair all over the comforter- how does housekeeping not see this???Fourth room was fine but nothing special. The area around the hotel had nothing to do after 5 or 6 pm when the area businesses closed. I didn't feel safe in the area after dark and opted for room service most nights, which was very good.I probably wouldn't return to this hotel based on cleanliness issues with the room, and issues dealing with the management that was unaccommodating.

<Content>Very impressed! Very impressed! We stayed just one night at the Onmi, LA in May 2008 and it was excellent. Very few hotels give you more than you expect, but the Onmi did in every way. On check in the 4 of us (2adults/2kids) were warmly welcomed and kids given a sizable welcome pack of activities and even some lollies. From here on we were more impressed (and that鈥檚 not easy). The room was very large, we visited the Walt Disney theatre and MOCA just behind the hotel and when we returned we ordered room service. Every thing was excellent; the pizza was massive and tasty. The following morning we had the buffet breakfast which was one of the best in our three week holiday around California. I honestly can鈥檛 say enough about how good the Omni was. I should also say that it was our wedding anniversary the night we stayed at the Omni, and they went the 鈥榚xtra mile鈥?by supplying complimentary Champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.I would always return to the Onmi and thoroughly recommend it to any else visiting downtown LA.

<Content>Handsome Hotel--Great food and location The Omni hotel is definitely a standout hotel among the ones I've been too in LA. It's located right in downtown LA and the views from the room let you see all of it. Rooms are quite large and I feel like they are decorated like your own bedroom--not a standard, basic hotel room. There are two good restaurants, one is a little more luxurious, but both have really good food. There a huge pool outside with nice lounge chairs. Also, the fitness center is very nice and has a lot of machines. I'd say it's a great place for everyone, business travelers in particular. I took a video of my stay and it shows more of what I was talking about: http://www.tripfilms.com/Travel_Video-v64421-Los_Angeles-The_Omni_Hotel-Video.html

<Content>Fantastic Stay at the Omni! We stayed at the Omni LA during our tromp through Southern Califronia. Los Angeles was our first stop and we were more than happy with our stay at the hotel. The staff was amazing. Our kids loved the little back backs they received. The backpacks were more of a hit then the actual gadgets inside. The beds were heaven. I could have slept all day. We didn't get to enjoy the pool as it rained our entire stay in LA, but I saw that they had one. The only thing that could have gone better was our room service. We came in late one evening and ordered some hamburgers. That's pretty much what we got, hamburgers on a bun, no lettuce, cheese or anything. All in all it was a great stay in LA.

<Content>Very nice hotel We stayed at this hotel while attending a convention at the L.A. Conention Center. Service is wonderful - we asked for a few things and got them almost immediately. There will always be an attendant to open the door for you. It is not the best location for the LACC as it is a mile and a half away. Fortunately we had shuttle service. There is also not much shopping or restaurants nearby as it is in the business district. But you can walk several blocks and get to what you need. The rooms are nice and comfortable however I agree about the entry way being awkward. The main door and bathroom door just inside almost bump together. The closet is roomy, but has no light. If you put your suitcase in there on the rack, you'll have a hard time seeing your belongings. TV does need to be upgraded. There were only about 10 channels available. But, those are minor things to me. I would stay here again.

<Content>A Winner in every category This hotel is truly outstanding in every aspect. We were in a party of 16 people attending a convention downtown, and everyone of us were happy with the hotel.Service- Omni has a reputation in providing attentive service that is commonly found in Asia. This hotel provides a benchmark for good service that rivals that of Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental but without the attitude. Staff is plentiful and they are everywhere.. They are also courteous and eager to help us whenever we encounter them. We had a small problem with room service and management was quick to correct the mistake.Rooms- clean and good size. Beds are very comfortable and provides good support. Bathroom is also spacious. Plenty of towels.They even provide a fresh pair of slippers.Location is good. However there are not much shopping close by. Complementary car is available within a 3 mile radius.Great hotel period. Would definitely return.

<Content>Very Nice, Would Stay Here Again A very nice hotel with a reasonable downtown LA price. In the safe part of downtown and within easy walking distance of many places to eat. Not a lot of shopping nearby, but the Jewelry District is about 2 blocks away if you are into that. The room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. Staff was curteous and helpful. The breakfast was quite expensive but wonderful. I didn't like the entry to the room. The closet and bath doors bumped against each other and it felt like you were squeezing your way in. Also the TV was dated and small - it's time for a flat screen upgrade Omni. Both minor issues. I liked the property and would stay here again.

<Content>Nice place to stay for downtown LA. I've stayed at practically every downtown hotel in L.A. and this one is up on top of my list.The service is absolutely spot-on for business travelers. They are quick, courteous and friendly. You just can't ask for much more than that.The rooms are standard business fare and you will find no surprises. It's clean and roomy enough to work. The restaurant does a good breakfast buffet with pretty much anything you need. The prices are typical business rates.I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you are a tourist due to it's location away from the rest of downtown. It's a good hike to the Staple Center and the Convention Hall, so if you need to go there, you may want to find another place. If you are there on business, it's the place to be.

<Content>Not as great as all the reviews say This is a nice hotel, but not incredible. The restaurant is nice, but again not incredible. I would say that this is strickly a business travelers hotel. There is a nice pool, but no jacuzzi!!! For this kind of hotel, I am sorry but I expect a Jacuzzi!!! Room were very nice, and very big, with nice decor. This hotel is nice, but it is not amazing. I would recommend it for business travelers who need to be downtown, but not for pleasure.

<Content>Good business hotel in downtown I enjoyed my stay here. It had all the amenities you'd expect from a good quality business hotel...Big clean spacious rooms, wifi internet access, big TV, good bar and restaurant (if a little expensive), friendly staff, good maid service, great hot and cold breakfast selection (with made-to-order omlette available).It's located on a quiet street, felt safe enough walking around, about 5 minutes from a metro stop (pershing square). Short walk from some decent downtown bars and restaurants (particularly recommend the rooftop bar at the Standard Hotel, best city skyline view in LA). There was a small shopping area at the bottom of the hotel.Only downside was parking was a bit expensive at $30/day, as was the hotel bar.I'd recommend signing up to the Omni Select Guest programme prior to staying. Its free to sign up and gets you free wifi access plus 2 free drinks and newspapers delivered to your room every morning.

<Content>great service at the Omni We stayed in the Omni for the first few nights of our honeymoon and the staff were so helpful. My new husband had called in advance and we had champagne and few special extras ready when we arrived which was lovely.I would recommend for the service alone but the room was clean and spacious too.

<Content>Great Hotel! My 8 year old and I are on a alone getaway to see Wicked in LA. The Omni got good reviews here, so I booked it. The club level room we got is $219 per night, cheaper than some of the regular rooms. I found the rate online, but called to confirm the ammenities. Join the frequent guest program for extra perks. Perks of the club level room are a room on the top (17th) floor (with key access to the floor), complementary breakfast (french toast, bacon, lox and bagels, fruit, etc etc), and complementary cocktail hour from 5-8 (alcohol, sodas, snacks). There was so much at the cocktail hour that it was dinner for us! Hotel ammenities: Small outdoor pool (too cold outside for us to go in but the pool was warm), nice workout room, COMFY beds, windows that open. When we checked in we were given a backpack of toys for my daughter. All good. Oh, and our rate included complementary valet parking (normally $30 per night). The only problem was that when we called the front desk last night at 9PM to ask about the circling helicopter a couple blocks away, we were informed that it was due to a movie being filmed (500 Days of Summer was being filmed in the park right outside the hotel during the day). Luckily, we decided not to go check it out, because it was actually the POLICE looking for a SNIPER shooting from another hotel into the street. I had a little chat with the front desk manager about this. She didn't seem to grasp the severity of the mistake. I suspect that as long as things go smoothly, this is a great hotel. And, except for the idiot at the front desk, things went very smoothly. The staff are not the brightest bulbs on the string, but they are very friendly.I would stay here again for sure, especially with the kids! I just wouldn't ask anyone here for advice.

<Content>exceptional service, comfy bed (rqst a high floor for a view)鈥?#x201d; I received an excellent deal for this hotel from work, and I'm VERY glad I took advantage of booking my stay here. We got a 12th floor room and swear we were one of only another couple that was on the same floor out of over 20 rooms. It was a refreshing oasis of silence. Valet parking only, and it's a bit pricey at $30/day, but its nice that you can go in and out as often as you'd like. Sign up at the omnihotels.com for their preferred guest reward program (free) and then you are able to get free wi-fi in the room (otherwise it's $10/day), free morning bevs, etc. I highly enjoyed my stay here, and would totally return in the future.

<Content>GREAT Hotel with GREAT Location and GREAT service Right in the middle of Bunker Hill, the cener of downtown Los Angeles. We chose it because of proximity to AMTRAK and the Disney concert hall. There were just soooo many other museums and attractions nearby we stayed two extra nights! The staff were friendly, fantastically helpful, and seemed more genuine than most four star staff. The price was also right because of hotwire.com. We have already booked more nights for the Fall. The rooms are large, bedding comfortable, bathrooms almost as large as the bedroom with separate shower and tub. The desk leaves a little to be desired and they charged $9.95/day for internet but otherwise it was a wonderful hotel.

<Content>Lovely hotel... Gorgeous luxurious hotel. Nice rooms / helpful staff. They even have a car to take you where you like for free (when i was there anyway). Its situated downtown though so i would not recommend for tourists as its no where near sunset boulevard etc. You can still book trips for pick up from the Omni, but in my opinion its too far out. Most of the people around were business people staying in the hotel.

<Content>By far the best service The service at the Omni is some of the best of any hotel property I've ever stayed at. I had a suite on the club level over looking the downtown sky line. The employees at the property gave me great service. From the parking attendent to the concierge on the club level, whatever I asked they gave. The room was clean with turndown service. Afternoon drinks in the lounge were great. I live 15 miles from this hotel and it felt like I was vacation even if it was just for a day. I plan to stay here again in June.

<Content>Terrific Hotel; Great Value I stayed on a business trip for 2 nights. The room was spacious and clean and was a corner unit with windows facing in 2 directions. The beds had comforters and were very comfortable. Wireless internet access is available free to Omni Selected Guests. Bathroom was large with separate shower. A large safe was in the closet, big enough to store a laptop. The only issue was the presence of 3 very large moths flying around in the room. They must have entered through an open window when they aired it out prior to my arrival. They were difficult to eliminate, but I was successful with the use of a spare towel. The hotel staff is very responsive and friendly. Almost everyone I encountered asked if I needed anything, if my stay was enjoyable and if they could do anything for me. So, top notch service, beautiful and spacious rooms, all for $209 per night. That is a great value for a downtown hotel in a major city.

<Content>Omni all the way The Omni Los Angeles is a safe place to stay in Los Angeles (and that's from a New Jerseyian) . It provides a classy atmosphere and is home to some of the most professional staff I've ever encountered. Their services and hospitality are unmatched. The conceirge was always willing to help decide where to eat, what to do, and even make reservations for us.  The location is also within walking distance to the Disney Concert Hall, and surrounding coffee shops, casual eateries, convenience stores, and of course, Starbucks. The outdoor pool could use some work, but it's heated and even in April, LA was a bit chilly for the beach. Overall, the hotel was a steal for the price and location!

<Content>#1 in LA?? Overall we had an enjoyable, problem-free stay at the Omni LA. I just find it hard to believe that this is the top-rated hotel in all of Los Angeles. LA hotels must really be in sad shape.The hotel staff was very friendly so I will give them props for that. The room was clean but just average overall (beds were nice but unfortunately my back didn't agree). The bathroom was large but had no counterspace and the shower water pressure was pitiful. For a hotel that welcomes kids (toy packs, cookies), their TV service did not have either Disney or Nickelodeon. Room service was tasty but quite expensive. No vending machines so you're forced to order drinks from room service. Valet service was slow, even slower when we called ahead. Biggest frustration was that we were in town for the Lakers game and hoped to have the car service take us to Staples Center. When we asked the valet to arrange it he told us that they didn't go to Staples Center. Huh? It's a mile away! He didn't even provide an explanation or offer to at least take us somewhere closer to the arena.Overall the Omni was a nice place to stay, just not what I would expect from the #1 hotel in the 2nd largest city in the country.

<Content>Great Hotel My wife and I booked 2 nights at the Omni for a weekend stay. This was a nice property with excellent service. From the moment we checked in until the time we checked out the service was great. We arrived early and the hotel was able to make arrangements for us to check in an hour early. The gal at guest service was very friendly and helpful, she told us about different restaurants to eat at in the area. Everyone we dealt with at the hotel was very friendly and helpful.We went to a Lakers game on Friday which was a $10 cab ride from the hotel. The hotel is only about 7 miles from the Hollywood area so it was easy to get to from the hotel. We had some drinks at the Noe Restaurant which was nice and relaxing. The room was very spacious with a large bathroom, the bed was very comfortable.We were very impressed with Omni and would definately return if we are in the Los Angeles area.

<Content>Good Hotel in Downtown The Omni is a good hotel, nothing spectacular, but it meets all your needs nicely for downtown LA. Well positioned close to Disney Hall, the Cathedral, etc. The place was pricey, even with a group discount. The room was clean, and well furnished, but to be honest, I was a bit surprised that this was rated the top hotel in LA.

<Content>Omni downtown LA is very hard to beat I stayed at the Omni for 2 nights, and I have to say that this is one of the nicest hotel stays I've had in some time. I picked up a tip from this website, and signed up for Omni's SelectGuest program online. It's free and easy to do. If you sign up for that, you get free Wifi in your hotel room when you stay at an Omni, as well as a free newspaper of your choice every AM, and a free AM beverage of your choice, both delivered to your door. It's worth doing. The Omni emailed me a day before my trip, offering me the option of checking in online, which I did. As it happens, I got out on a flight that was earlier than I thought, and I arrived at the Omni at 2pm. I thought I would be too early to check in, but not so: my room was ready and all I had to do was pick up my room key in an envelope with my name on it at the front desk, and I was good to go. Very quick and easy.The room was very large, with bed, armchair + ottoman, desk, and a couch, as well as the obligatory TV/minibar armoir unit. The bathroom was also quite large, with a tub and a separate, glass-enclosed shower. The room was reminiscent of some stays I've at the Four Seasons, but not nearly as expensive. I stayed Thursday and Friday nights: the Thursday rate was $179, and the Friday rate was $249, so that averages to $215 per night, I think. There is a spa/gym on the 4th floor, with a pool long enough to swim laps in, which most hotels do not have. I'm guessing it was 45 feet x 15 feet. Everything was clean; everyone was polite, and everything went smoothly. I had dinner one night at a Japanese restaurant called Sai Sai, which is a couple of blocks away, and that restaurant has fantastic sushi. It was some of the best sushi I've had, rivaling even the superlatively great sushi restaurant of northern California: Sushi Ran, located in Sausalito.I can't think of anything negative to say about the Omni LA. If you need to be downtown, I don't think you can find a nicer hotel, even if you pay a lot more.

<Content>Off-line at the Omni, but Still In-Line Service I stayed at the Omni hotel for a conference and while I generally liked the hotel and the people there, there were a few annoyances. But first the good stuff, because I would definitely return to this hotel, despite the problems. Things do happen. This is a four star hotel and it is nicely, if not extravagantly appointed with pleasant, but sparsely decorated rooms that are big with large, airy windows. The hotel staff was very good and the facility is within walking distance of the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall and, well, not much else. The high end hotel restaurant, Noe, is spectacular as was the service there. But there were a few rough edges you don't expect at a hotel like this. My wife and I got out of the shuttle with two large bags each and two carry-ons each, but no one came to take our bags. We dragged our luggage into the lobby ourselves. I thought a bellman would pick us up there and certainly once we checked in, but they never came. A surprise at a hotel of this rating. The Omn also needs to upgrade their TVs and cable reception, as both were substandard.But the real, but unusual disappointment was the complete loss of internet service. Ironically, I was attending an internet convention and on the first day, the hotel internet went down and remained down for two of our three days there. The Omni was very accommodating, and ultimately comped me on a night's room, but again, in a major hotel in a major city, you don't expect this lapse of service. Upon leaving the hotel, Bell service was very prompt, stored my luggage for the hour or so I had to kill and checked me out quickly. I would definitely stay at the Omni again. Ditto any other good things you read here.

<Content>Luxury hotel at a great price We stayed one night at this hotel and found it very comfortable. The beds were huge, the bathroom had both a shower and a bath tup, and the mini bar included all kinds of things that you could possibly need. The staff was friendly and the dinner we had at the hotel restaurant No茅 was quite good. The truffle butter is fantastic!The hotel has a pool area, but is seemed that it was shady most of the time.We paid USD 179 +tax for one night which is not expensive at all for a hotel like this.

<Content>A superlative experience yet again ! This is my fourth time staying at this superlative hotel. I got a really great deal through a travel agent, and this only makes this stay more worthwhile. The staff are really friendly, the rooms are large and very comfortable. If you are looking for a hotel in downtown L.A., look no further...

<Content>Highly recommended downtown hotel We had a very pleasant five-night stay at the Omni. We found the staff to be exceptional. The front desk staff was helpful and professional, the concierge provided great advice, and the bell staff was so attentive I don't think we touched a door entering or leaving the hotel in five days.The room was great and extremely quiet. The bed was very comfortable.We were also very impressed with the breakfasts at the Omni, which were typically expensive for hotels but very good and generous. Some people have noted that there isn't much to do in downtown LA, but we found plenty of restaurants and nightspots within six blocks. It takes a little walking or cabbing, but there are nice restaurants, bars and lounges nearby including Seven Grand, the Daily Grill, the Elevate Lounge, and the lounges at The Orchid, The Standard and the Biltmore.The Omni is highly recommended if you're looking to stay downtown.

<Content>Omni is the best in downtown LA I love the Omni. From my experience, it's the best hotel in downtown LA, better than the Hilton Checkers or the Biltmore. The rooms are very nice, the staff are awesome. There's even a Starbucks on-site. And plenty of great restaurants within walking distance (e.g. Nick and Steph's).

<Content>For Downtown Omni is Tops This was second stay at Omni. First stay was in September 2007. On both occasions I enjoyed it. Good clean room, discrete but warm service. It's a bland hotel but there is a good feel to the place architecturally - even though it is not special there is good natural light, layout seems sensible - more like an apartment block than a hotel. Also the staff are not sycophantic. Fitness Room is great, didn't use the pool. Car parking is a rip-off but you can park overnight in any of the local places including Pershing Square for much less $ and walk two blocks. Great location for the Gehry, MOCA, LA Phil and so on. I have also stayed at the Westin Bonaventure and the Orchid Hotel in downtown and this has the best all round mix of atmosphere, comfort and amenities.

<Content>Strongly recommend the Omni! We stayed at the Omni the weekend of February 8th for the 50th Annual Grammy Awards. Here are a few of our comments:Transportation: You can take a Super Shuttle from the airport, just go outside by the taxi area and look for the guys in the red and blue jackets. The ride is only $15 per person. On the way back we took a cab ($42 flat rate plus tip) because we were in a rush, but the shuttle is also available from the hotel. We also took the metro (located a few blocks from the Omni) to Hollywood which was a little scary, I would definitely not take it after dark but is a cheap way to get around.Service: My husband and I both agree that we have never experienced such remarkable service as at the Omni! They are unbelievably helpful, friendly and professional. We never stood in the lobby for more than 1 minute without someone politiely asking to help! They were super helpful with any question or request we had. EXCELLENT!Rooms/Hotel Quality: The lobby is beautiful and the hotel is overall extremely clean and well kept. Our only complaint was the lack of counter space in the bathrooms (pretty tight for 2 people and all of our toiletries/hair dryer/etc..) But the bed is wonderful and comfortable and the rooms are very attractive. There is no refrigerator (only the mini bar) so we had to put our wine over ice which was fine.Dining/Location: We only ate at the Grand Cafe at the hoel for breakfast which was very good. We ate dinner at the restaurants in the Plaza which is adjacent to the hotel, both of which were very nice (steak restaurant was more expensive but good). There are also several stores in the plaza to buy snacks, coffee (Starbuck's) etc... which is convenient. We heard that room service was also excellent, but was a little on the pricey side.Overall we would strongly recommend the Omni, a lovely place to stay!

<Content>Nice room but... My two adult sons and myself stayed for just one night at the Omni. The check in, after doing the on line checkin, was great! Everything including my breakfast slips and room key were in an envelope with my name on it ready to go. The room was perfect and very comfortable. The staff was very helpful as we wanted to walk to Staples Center for a concert and they told us the safest and quickest way to go. The breakfast the next morning was my only complaint. We had a total of nine people, six of whom had stayed at other hotels in the area, that all arrived to eat together. The buffet was awesome! The food ordered off the menu was above average but the SERVICE was HORRIBLE! I had to leave the table, after requesting a coffee refill four times, to find someone who would bring us more coffee. (it was our FIRST refill, not fourth or fifth) Another one from our party also had to leave the table to obtain MINIMAL service. I own a restaurant, and tend to be sympathetic to overworked food servers, HOWEVER, this was not the case here. No more than six other tables in use in the entire restaurant, and our server stood talking to other staff for over twenty minutes while we waited. The room and the hotel is fabulous. Don't expect much from their breakfast service

<Content>I Read the Reviews And It Was As Good As They Said I flew to Los Angeles from Vancouver in November 2007 to attend a concert by legendary pianist Martha Argerich (and she showed up!!). I used Trip Advisor to look for a hotel since I don't know anyone in LA. I considered several less expensive hotels all within walking distance of the Walt Disney Concert Hall but was finally convinced to book at the Omni because the reviews are very favourable compared to the others. The hotel service and location was excellent and really made my stay a great experience. We ate at the hotel's award winning Noe Restaurant before walking across the street to the concert hall. After the concert, we had a drink at the hotel lounge. The following day we went to the Museum of Contemporary Art also next door. A taxi ride to the Beverly mall was $60 return, but it was premium shopping if you want to spend the money on taxi. Transportation to and from the airport and the door of the hotel was by Super Shuttle around $22-$30 each way so I saved on taxi money there. The room was clean and quiet and had all the usual amenities. The lady and man at the Concierge helping visitors were pleasent , knowledgeable and patient. It was a truly pleasurable experience. I would book at the Omni again and recommend it to anyone going to LA and want to stay in the nice and safe financial district.

<Content>Four-star amenities at a great price I booked the Omni via Skoosh.com at an all-inclusive price of $122/night. The standard room was spacious and spotless. It had a king-size bed that was very comfortable, with soft comforters and an abundance of fluffy pillows. The bath had separate tub and shower. The only thing lacking that I would have wanted was a safety box. The room came with complimentary wi-fi, which was great because it helped me plan and book the rest of my trip online. I've heard a lot of good things about Omni's Noe restaurant so we had dinner there one night. The food was very good (I tried the chicken while my friend had the lobster) but quite pricey. I've read comments from everywhere that downtown LA is not a very good location because there's not much action going on there at night and during weekends. It is in a way true but it makes up for the lack of action through its proximity to public transportation. The Pershing Square train station is just two blocks away from the hotel, an easy walk. Or if you need a ride anywhere within the downtown area, the hotel offers a complimentary shuttle service. There's not a convenience store within walking distance so if you need to fill up the bar with your own stock, plan ahead. Service can be cold and impersonal but I expected that from a chain hotel. What mattered more to me was that I was attended to promptly and I got help when I needed it.

<Content>Love the personal touches! Booked my stay via an Expedia package. I'm so impressed with this hotel that I have to write my first review on Tripadvisor about it (and I just got back from my trip today!) It's a big hotel but is still very service-oriented and full of personal touches. The staff is extremely polite and accommodating. The room is comfy, clean and well-appointed. Make sure that you join the Omni Select Guest program before you check in and provide the hotel with your membership number. You will get complimentary drinks and newspaper every morning, free internet access and evening turndown services as well. The valet parking is $28 a night but is a good deal compared to other downtown hotels which charge over $30. I am definitely going back to Omni the next time I visit LA.

<Content>Excellent! I stayed here for 3 nights and 4 days in November. This hotel is very lovely. Location is downtown LA. The parking was complimentary which was AWESOME!! There really isn't a whole lot around the area, but we were driving so it didn't matter. The L.A. traffic wasn't even bad. I'm from NY so I know what hectic traffic can be like.  The rooms: Nice size beds were A+, well stocked mini bar (of course some items were ridiculously pricey), beautiful bathroom. Everything was clean and lovely. Room service though it took a bit was absolutely scrumptous. Staff was wonderful. Bar is located on 3rd fl. This is a up class joint that was well worth the money. I would stay here in again in a heartbeat!!!!!!!

<Content>Disappointing As it was our first time in LA, we booked a hotel downtown and the Omni seemed to fit the bill. However, we regret that we did not book somewhere hipper and livilier like in West Hollywood. We quickly learned that downtown is not somewhere that we wanted to walk around in the evening. It was all very depressing and souless and felt a bit dangerous. The hotel itself was fairly standard. The kind of place I like to stay in on business, but for pleasure I want something with more character which I have only myself to blame for as I had stayed in the Omni before on business and found it efficient. However there were other problems:We were very unhappy with valet parking. There was an event on in the hotel one evening and we had to wait about 15 minutes on the street to drop our car OFF (!). Message to hotel: if you have an event on, you need to get more staff and put your hotel guests first.Another irritation was that there was no safe in the room. We had to desposit our valuables downstairs with the front desk which was inconvenient.Overall, the Omni LA is a good hotel but definitely not for us.

<Content>Art in the Heart of L.A. On a recent trip to L.A., we decided to spend a night at the Omni based on reviews and proximity to the downtown LA art scene.We were SO happy with this hotel. From check-in to check-out this hotel surpassed our expectations. The rooms were gorgeous, and we had a view of the new Disney Music Hall. We were just behind MOCA and just down the street from the theater complex.We spontaneously booked tickets for a show at the Ahmanson Theater, and then stopped into the hotel restaurant NOE for a bite before the show.Of all the wonderful things I could say about the Omni, our experience at NOE was the best. The food is amazing. We ate our pre-show snack in front of a fireplace (it was a chilly night), and had terrific service.I would highly recommend this hotel to others, and even if you don't stay at the omni, check out NOE if you're in the neighborhood.

<Content>Very good hotel, location ok We arrived at the hotel at around 10pm after a long day of flying from London. The hotel does not have an airport shuttle so we paid for a taxi (around $45).Being tired, we were pleased with the swift check-in. The first impressions of the hotel were good, a nice modern lobby with sealed off garden area, a very nice and spacious room with great view of the rest of LA from the 15th floor. The swimming pool was small but never had more than 5 people so a brilliant place to relax. The gym was very modern. The lady at the concierge, Amy, was extremely helpful and friendly, even at the busy times ensuring that she was acknowledging everyone waiting. The bellman was also great...we were walking out of the hotel to go buy a plug adapter, but he insisted on getting one for us, he didn't even take any money. So as well as the hotel being great, we were mightily impressed with staff.Even though the hotel is in downtown, we were slightly disappointed with the location being there as a tourist. The plaza next to the hotel was not lively, with only a Starbucks. However, the metro station is only a 5 minute walk and very cheap, around $1 if I remember correctly. It will take you direct to the Walk of Fame, Universal Studios, etc. The Universal Studios area was great, as the restaurant and bar area is extremely lively at all times, reminding me of Piccadily Circus in London.Overall, the Omni is a great hotel. Comfortable and good facilties although as a tourist, I would have preferred to stay in a hotel in the Universal Studios area, as it is still cheaper than W.Hollywood/Hollywood, closer to the main sites and has is lively all the time. Whether the hotels there are good or not I'm not sure!!

<Content>Excellent Service and Comfortable Stay at the Omni Stayed at the Omni for two nights on business travel. From the moment I arrived when the valet picked up my car, to the moment I departed when the valet returned my car, I experienced nothing but great customer service from Omni's staff. A first I was skeptical, thinking that the staff was being nice to perhaps make up for less adequate rooms, but when I opened the door to my room, I found it to be clean, comfortable and modern. No dust or crumbs around the baseboards. The mattress was high and firm. The sheets were white and the beds were decorated with accent pillows. The bathroom featured a separate shower and tub, complimentary toilettries and clean, white shower rugs. I also used the fitness center and was impressed with the number and condition of the cardio machines. Most hotels have one or two machines that are terribly outdated. The fitness center at the Omni was spacious and featured elliptical machines, treadmills with mini tvs, and some machine and free weights. The free weights were a little on the old side, but the overall fitness room was more than what I expected. Further, the Omni has a courtesy car that can take you to any business location in the city! I definitely recommend the Omni if service, cleanliness and amenities are of importance to you.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at the Omni for 2nights. The Location was great. Its in the downtown area close to chinatown, staples, shopping area and restaurants. The service was excellent, valet parking, checking in, room service, housekeeping etc. The flower arrangements in the lobby are so beautiful and refreshing. They also gave my son a bag of toys and goodies. The room is somewhat disappointing. It is small, the decor dated, room configuration is not done properly ( e.g. when you open the closet you cannot go to the bathroom or front door. Maybe its only our room but still this is an inconvenience) and the tub is really small. However the bed is comfortable. Over all it was a NICE stay and we will definitely come back to OMNI when we go again for a vacation in Los Angeles.

<Content>Not bad but, not great .... Middle of Road Hotel for me. I recently attended a business conference at the Omni thus, stayed at the hotel for two nights. I booked on Expedia with a good rate about 3 months before my stay.A few days before arriving, I was checking the Omni website for WiFi access and learned there is a charge of $9.95/day. But, if you sign up for Select Guest which is free and create a profile with your likes/dislikes, you get WiFi access for free as well as 2 morning drinks (oj, v8, etc....) and a daily paper of your choice. Also, if you book with the hotel, you can check in Online as long as give at least a two hour notice you are coming. Since I booked on Expedia, I could not do this.On arrival, check in was quick. You can only valet park which is $26/night. I got my requested high floor corner room on the 15th floor with a decent view. The room itself is a bit dated. The carpet showed signs of wear with stains. Build Up was around the shower door. The bathtub had a layer of sediment (or dirt) in it but, since it was late at night and I knew I would not use it (I used the separate shower), I just put a note the next morning to inform the staff the bathtub was dirty. The TV is standard tube TV with a good representation of channels including HBO. The honor bar was well stocked and is a traditonal dorm fridge which I like since you can put your own things in it if you want (I just hate the new wave of honor bars that use motion sensors so you can't move anything or put in your own stuff). The big plus was the bed. It was very comfortable and pillows large and soft.On my first night, turndown service was not done. Turn down service was done for the second night. Each morning, I received two drinks and the LA Times left at my door which I specificed on the Select Guest door hanger.WiFi service in this hotel is very spotty both in my room and during my conference. In my room, it seemed like I had to sit a certain way in a specific part of the room to get a solid connection. Anywhere else, it would drop. For my conference, some areas had excellent connection rates while others had none which frustrated several attendees. But, for me the main focus was on my room and it was terrible.Although many rave about the location, I found it to be the complete opposite. There is really not much around the hotel within walking distance. I walked a four block radius and saw nothing in terms of good food, bars, etc... Looking out my window I could see the 110 freeway and of course, it's a parking lot at 5-6pm so, although I knew I could get somewhere in my car it was not worth the headaches to get it out of valet and fight traffic knowing I could only be out a few hours at most. But, the hotel bar; Noe, is really nice and they did have a small menu which I had dinner which was decent but, pricy.Check out was quick and easy but, I was not honored with a late check out. My conference was all day until 5pm and lunch was after the check out time of 12:00. Having an extra hour would have been nice. But, I was able to give my suitcase to valet and they put it in my car. At the end of day, getting my car leave took a bit of time but, that was expected since everyone who attended the same conference as me was leaving as well as there were other meeting events ending which made a small bottleneck in getting out of the hotel.Overall, the Omni is not a bad hotel. Only few negatives but, the poor WiFi and bad location (for me) makes me rate it as Middle of the Road.

<Content>Nice property for the weekend warrior Aside from some minor inconvenience upon check in (were initially given the wrong room type as requested) - the front counter staff made accomodations to fix it right on the spot. The room was wonderful and hotel location was central. Nice to be downtown on the weekend when it's quiet. We used the hotel as a jumping point to the west side, which worked out nicely. The bathroom was exceptionally appointed and the beds were marvelous. The pool was small but enjoyable. Truly, the service made the difference here. I would recommend this place as a quick weekend get away.

<Content>Probably the nicest hotel in Downtown LA. The Omni is considered the most upscale hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. Having stayed at a couple of other downtown hotels, I would say it is probably the best overall choice, if cost is not an issue. Aside from one rude front desk employee (who later called back to apologize, to his credit), the service is classy, the rooms are standard sized, with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms, and the spa/fitness center are very nice. The location is great, if you have a reason to stay in Downtown LA.TIP: When booking your room, request one with views of the much-talked-abou Walt Disney Concert Hall, designed by architect Frank Gehry.

<Content>Loved the Omni! I stayed at the Omni for 2 nights while on a business trip. Prices were obviously high, as expected for this hotel, but service was definitely up to par. Very friendly and helpful hotel staff. No complaints about anything at all. Food was great at both restaurants -- Noe (creme brulee is awesome!) and the Grand Cafe (french toast is wonderful!). Didn't use the gym facility, but it looked good. My room overlooked the pool and it was situated on a rooftop and looked nice (just too cold out to swim). The room was excellent. Very clean and beautiful bed. Nice bathrobes available to use as well. I did request a single king bed (my preference), but they only had 2 queens when I checked in. Not a major issue, but I did check in at 8am (regular check-in is 3pm I believe), so they were pretty accomodating.I highly recommend signing up for the Select Guest program that the Omni has (free to sign up on website). You get free internet access in your room (otherwise there is a charge) as well as your choice of newspaper in the mornings as well as 2 complimentary beverages each morning. A really great program for no charge, in my opinion. In addition, make sure to provide your mileage program number upon check-in so you earn mileage points for your stay.The location is okay for downtown access. It's connected to the California Plaza, so if you need to get to the Deloitte  Touche or KPMG bldgs, etc....this is the place to stay. Definitely easy access.

<Content>Stayed Here for a Dodger game We booked this hotel to go to a Dodger game and were VERY happy. Cab was less than 20 and the Dodgers won the game! We were there on the weekend and the little mall nearby was closed and there was not a lot to do within walking distance. We felt very safe walking at night. there was a mini concert at the nearby mall. the pool was awesome. Room service was a little pricey but overall we were very pleased. We would stay there again.

<Content>Los Angeles Downtown location As always, I chose the Omni based on Tripadvisor reviews. That's why I feel it's important to write reviews - as a way of giving back to other reviewers and the Tripadvisor website for their contributions to making my family trips the best that I can plan. The Omni is a great location for downtown Los Angeles touring. It is two blocks from the Music Center, where we attended a play, close to Koreatown, where we shopped for great produce at one of the huge markets, close to Chinatown where we dined on dim sum, close to our friends and family in the increasingly upscale Silverlake district, and close to many authentic Mexican taquerias. It is a beautiful hotel that was very busy on the weekend that we stayed - a testament to its popularity, I believe. The rooms were spacious and immaculate, the bedding delightful, and the bathroom well appointed with very good water pressure.Downsides: telephone buttons didn't work well, difficult to get the concierge and valet parking staff, movie rental system didn't work consistently, in-house restaurant, Grand Cafe, had terrible service and so-so food (but they deducted the cost of the entree that was not properly served, thank you!).Not insurmountable downsides, but perhaps a bit disappointing, given the pricetag, which is on the higher end.

<Content>We were impressed with the Omni Arrived exhausted after long, delayed flight. Impressive lobby area, creating a good first impression, efficient check-in. Room a fair size- bathroom also spacious-separate shower and bath. Went to bar to eat- a relaxing atmosphere with pianist, comfy leather sofas and low lighting. Service wasn't speedy, but felt O.K. not to rush in these surroundings. The outdoor tables overlooked the Plaza, where a free concert was taking place- we were just too tired to fully appreciate. Beds extremely comfortable-slept very well all 3 nights. Turndown service with chocolates and weather forecast first two days only. Teenaged son is a fussy eater, so didn't want anything on hotel menu for breakfast. Went to see Amy, the efficient bubbly concierge, who gave us a street map, phoned Hollywood Bowl about a concert for us, gave us Metro information, then went out to ask Robert [lovely man] one of the hotel car drivers to take us to IHOP for breakfast - excellent choice, very clean and great staff.We caught Metro to Hollywood, where we spent all day and evening.Back to IHOP in hotel car next day- had to wait a short while to go. However, coming back took one hour, from first phoning from IHOP to arriving back at Omni- not too impressed. Went to collect hire car from Union Street Station- wow, it's like going back in time-we loved it! Headed off to the beach. No problems with valet parking- except expensive, but we only had car for one night.Can't comment on either restaurant, except to say that Noe looked like a very spacial place for couples to share a romantic meal. Overall, we were impressed with the Omni. We were comfortable and treated well by all staff. The hotel car issue was really the only complaint, but we felt that was outweighed by far by all the positives. Location may have become a problem if we had been staying longer with no hire car. However, Metro station was not too far away.

<Content>Nice hotel but a bad experience with valet parking. I got a great rate through the hotel website. The people checking me in were nice and the room was just fine. Was glad to have a pool. If you're sound sensitive like me, though, you might notice that you can hear the vibration from mechanical things around the pool under (and, for that matter) above the water as it seems surrounded by big whirly-noise making things. Overall, I had a fine stay. Room service was yummy but they didn't follow through on my request to leave it outside my door and I wasn't happy about that. Biggest bummer was that I was only there 1 night and my car bumper got dinged from the valet parking. No response from management despite an attempt to contact them. This was my first time at an Omni and the car ding and non-response leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I might not return to this hotel or just park my car myself if I do. As for other Omnis, I'd consider it. Just hope they have their parking better worked out or a manager who is responsive.

<Content>Nice room romm service was bad Room was nice and clean but did not get the turn down service and requests for breakfast juices was never picked up so we did not get that either. Front desk was sorry and did not charge for valet which by the way was $24 per day. Might look else where next time for better service.

<Content>Comfortable stay We stayed for three nights,my daughter, husband and myself.We found the room comfortable and as members of The Omni Select guest program,we received complimentary morning beverages which was a great touch.The hotel was convenient for the Metro which we used to get to Universal.We were aware of the parking charge before check in and allied to the great rate we paid for the hotel it was still good value .We did all the touristy things as this was our first visit to L.A. and really enjoyed The Warner Brothers Tour.

<Content>Great hotel! We arrived earlier than check-in time and our room was not ready. So, we waited till check-in time and it still was not ready. Front Desk then gave us an upgrade to the Executive Suite - 1 King bed and 1 sleeper sofa, huge bathroom, desk and chairs. We valeted our car but the wait was quite long. It's a nice downtown hotel. We stayed there 'cos we wanted to go to the Greek Theatre. It was about 20 mins drive via the city rather than via the freeway.There was a restaurant at the hotel and the food was good. There was a buffet for breakfast on Sunday and we enjoyed that.

<Content>Superior Hotel I stayed at the Omni Hotel this past weekend (Aug. 24-27) and what a great place to stay! The location is right in the heart of downtown (about 5 min. for the Staples Center), it has great views from all around and from each room! You are greeted when you drive up with the valet and a plenty of friendly doorsman(s) to help you with your luggage. When you walk in, ahead is a beautiful atrium and mixture of flowers, grand stairs, and personable staff. The check-in was easy and now for the room.....I requested a room with double beds only because the room is usually bigger and I like the space. Anyways, warm decor and neutral colors used through-out, down-feather, crisp white fluffy beds, a nice closet (with a iron, but no ironing board??, kinda weird). The bathroom had a seperate shower and tub with marble floors and sink. It also has a speaker in the bathroom for you to hear the T.V. (which I thought was neat!) and a phone. It has 2 restraunts, one for breakfast and lunch (which I thought was a little pricey, for example, I had a cappachino and a belgum waffle for $15!!) and they have another restraunt (Japense fusion), smaller selection of food and again pretty pricey considering you could order the Chef's special and spend $100 a person (yikes). The only (disturbing) little issue that i have, is housekeeping would knock on the door and then open it to see how you are doing....I was trying to take a nap!! I thought it was rude.! a phone call would be suffcient. I didn't order room service, but it was available ( for you out there that would like a late night snack). All in all, what a very nice place to stay. I would definately stay again, minus the afternoon interuptions.....

<Content>Excellent Hotel I write reviews because I use reviews to select the hotels I stay in. This is the first hotel where I give it an almost perfect rating; especially for the money. It's 5 star all the way on both service and comfort. There aren't many restaurants around the hotel (it's in a business district), so the food's a little pricey, but it's delicious and the service was great. In fact, the only suggestion I can give this hotel is to upgrade the toilet paper!

<Content>"Excellent Stay in an Excellent Hotel" Just returned from a weekend stay at the Omni Los Angeles @ California Plaza....and I must say that I was hoping for the best, but was so pleasantly surprised that this hotel met all my expectations and surpassed them. I was traveling with 13 other ladies for a weekend get-away/shopping/relaxation trip and I was responsible for making the accommodations, so I was a little nervous and my hopes were that everyone would be comfortable. I am very particular about where I lay my head and I wanted to have the best for our getaway without breaking the bank. The Omni was magnificent, the service was grand, the rooms were beautiful with a neutral decor, marble baths with separate shower and bathtub, large closet space and larger than average room. The beds, well, let's just say that some of us wanted to stay just to sleep in the heavenly bed just one more time. The beds are big, fluffy with lots of pillows and ultra comfortable. The room service was excellent and very timely. A few of us ate at the Noe Restaurant in the Hotel on the first night, granted it is very pricey, but you get what you pay for. The service was par excellent and the food was wonderful. The swimming pool is a little small and there is no jacuzzi...I did not get an opportunity to visit the Spa, but the prices were quite high. The next day some of us ate in the Cafe, which was very nice and the food had a really nice flare to it. The location was perfect for us as we planned to go shopping at the Garment District which was a few blocks away. There aren't many places open around the Hotel during the weekend, but right outside the door of the hotel, there is a Day Spa where some of us went and had manicures and pedicures and there is also a Starbuck's that stays open on the weekends. In the same area right outside the Hotel in a Plaza there is nightly entertainment, i.e. bands, etc. And of course, you have the Museums and Disney Concert Music Hall right near the Hotel that is also open on the weekend. The Hotel is close to the freeways and Saturday evening some of us went to the Universal City Walk for dinner and fun, which was about 20 minutes away. The Hotel has a courtesy Town Car to take you and pick you up from anywhere within a 3 mile radius. The Valet was steep at $28/night, but there is no other place to park, oh well.....All in all, this is a great place to stay and the only place that I will stay when in downtown Los Angeles....I have stayied in downtown L.A. several times in the past and the other Hotels cannot hold a candle to the Omni....I have already booked another stay with them next month. My hat goes off to the Omni Hotel and Staff and a very much deserved Thank You for making our weekend so wonderful!

<Content>Loved It!!! A group of 8, stayed at the Omni for 4 days,after having a short cruise and before moving on to Vegas. It was superb. The service we recieved was excellent. The hotel was lovely and the rooms clean and very comfortable. We didn't eat in the hotel, but had breakfast in the adjoining Plaza , which we loved. Although others have moaned about the location, we all really liked it- away from the hustle and bustle but with transport readily available to every area we wanted to visit.

<Content>Brilliant stay! Stayed here for one night with my fiance on his birthday weekend. GORGEOUS lobby with amazing flowers. Check-in was a breeze and the iced tea and cookies at the front desk were great.The bellman, doorman and front desk staff here were really on top of things. The concierge left a lot to be desired; she didn't know a thing. The doorman came over and whipped out a map and told us what to see, where to go, where to catch the metro. Our room was on the 7th floor and pristine, great view of a courtyard and adjacent art museum. There are free concerts in the amphitheatre in back of the hotel, and we went and listened to a great cabaret performance. Top notch!We did not eat at the hotel (L.A. has great restaurants!) but did have a drink in the bar and it was very nice. One thing to note: pool area is very small but we were in L.A. to check out the sights, so didn't spend any time at the pool really.Brilliantly located and easy to find as well. We'll stay here again!

<Content>excellent room but in downtown LA As long as you know that this hotel is in downtown LA, which is not close to many major tourist spots, it's a very good choice. We had a good weekend rate and, without requesting, were upgraded to concierge level, including buffet breakfast and happy hour. The service and staff were very good. The bed was extremely comfortable, California king size, and the room quite large. We had a corner room with two windows - the design of the building is such that there are many more corner rooms than usual. It overlooked the plaza where a concert was being held - if you kept the windows closed, you wouldn't hear much. The windows did open if you liked.If you did plan to use the California metro, it was just a block away - although I wouldn't recommend it at night if you're not familiar with it.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel - Relax and Enjoy Very nice hotel, rooms were clean and spacious and the price wasn't all that bad - granted I got it at a copr price. It is right next to the Disney Hall of Music and some other attractions and is smak dap in downtown. Internet access sucked though and they put me in a business room. One would think that the internet access would have worked in that room. that pissed me off a bit

<Content>Wasn't as Impressed as I Wanted to Be... I really wanted to LOVE the Omni from everything I heard about it, read about it, and saw on their website -- and from the price I was paying to stay there!! But honestly, I really wasn't that impressed... I stayed for one night because I was there to see Jersey Boys which was playing at the Ahmanson Theater, within easy walking distance from the Omni. The only thing I can truly say was the best thing about The Omni is it's close proximity to the theaters.Getting there was a bit of a hassle because the driveway is so small, not very many cars can fit in the driveway at one time, so there's a line of cars waiting for the Valet... which is WAY overpriced. But parking on the street, while cheaper, is too dangerous, because they aren't in the best of neighborhoods! No real way around it. The hotel itself is nice enough, but could be better. I was expecting to be more wowed than I was. We had a King bed and a sleeper sofa - our room overlooked the pool. The pool, by the way, is a small lap pool that was overcrowded with children the whole time, so there was no way to swim laps even had I wanted to. They provided us with one robe in our closet, we called to ask for another one to be sent up, and were told it would be up shortly. We never received it.After seeing Jersey Boys, we walked back to the hotel and had to go all the way around to the main entrance because the back entrance was locked after 10:30pm - seems like they should let guests in with their hotel keys since it's a much more convenient entrance/exit to the Plaza and theaters...We stopped into the bar/lounge on our way back up to our hotel room, and waited literally 8 minutes before someone came to take our order. Yes, we could have walked up to the bar ourselves and ordered and gotten our drinks faster, that isn't the point here. The point is that it wasn't very crowded or busy, and I KNOW that staff noticed we were there, yet it took them 8 minutes to come take our order. After the manager came over to take our order (yes, the manager took our order, despite there being 3 other wait staff there) he apologized that it took so long to be waited on - then we waited another 10 minutes (yes...10 minutes - we kept track) to actually GET OUR DRINKS. We ordered a Rum and Coke, and a Cosmopolitan... it's not rocket science! The manager came back with our drinks, and apologized again for how long it took, and said that our drinks were on the house - a nice gesture, but it still is completely ridiculous that it took that long to get waited on and get our drinks! I probably wouldn't stay here again unless I was able to get a super great rate there.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at the Omni but not sure about its location I booked this hotel because of the recommendations on this website but I did not feel as strongly in its favour as other people had done. On arrival by car It was quite difficult to access because of the one way system. Our room was lovely. It was large with excellent amenities although the bathroom was showing its age. After checking in we went for a walk to have a look at the surrounding area. We walked downhill to the jewellery district and I did not feel safe in this area. There were several people sleeping rough on the streets and one was shouting abuse at passing pedestrians. I was glad to get back to the hotel and considered moving to another hotel the next night. On a plus side the hotel is very handy for the theatres (they are in the opposite direction) and we went to see Jersey Boys which was excellent. We found the staff very pleasant and the buffet breakfast was excellent. We also had a meal in Noe restaurant and this was excellent. The hotel is at California Plaza and there is an area where open air concerts take place. This is very enjoyable and many locals come along to enjoy the music. If this hotel had been situated in a different area I would have enjoyed it more but I did not feel comfortable venturing far from the hotel particularly at night.

<Content>A nice hotel I stayed at the Omni for one night for business in July 2007, and I definitely had a pleasant stay. I booked my hotel online and in the Special Requests section I asked for a room on a higher floor, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the hotel actually read my request and honored it (so many do not!). The room was clean and nice but not incredible. The fitness center is small but nice, with new state-of-the-art equipment (not a lot of it but enough for an OK workout) and right next to a spa that looked quite nice (although I didn't get a chance to use it). The restaurant offered healthy and organic options for its breakfast buffet, which was nice to see. The location is good if you need to be downtown, close to many downtown attractions. Overall, I would have no problem recommending this hotel to others. My one complaint, which I have with so many hotels, is that it charged extra for Internet access in the room, which is particularly nonsensical given the fact that there's free wi-fi access in the lobby.

<Content>A Disappointment There is a lot of potential here. The building is well located, within walking distance of the arts institutions on Bunker Hill and most of the office buildings in downtown LA. The public spaces inside the hotel and in neighboring California Plaza are attractive. But there is a real sense of fatigue. The facilities need renovation, and the staff seem disengaged. My room was spacious, but had all sorts of problems. For example, hot water in the shower was very slow (like 2 minutes!) to appear and the pressure was never strong; the air conditioning was weak; there was no light next to the reading chair; and the carpet was old, stained, and ugly. Food in the daytime restaurant was really bad: tough and tasteless. (I didn't sample the up-scale evening restaurant, Noe.) And everywhere -- the doormen, the check-in people at the desk, the attendant in the concierge-level lounge -- the staff were indifferent: lots of smiles, but no results. I am sorry to say this. I have stayed here before, and things seemed better then. That's why I returned. It is still an OK hotel, but no more than OK. If what I experienced on my recent trip is typical, one can do better elsewhere.

<Content>Best possible hotel! We stayed at the Omni for 2 weeks and we loved every minute of it! I have nothing bad to say about this hotel, it has everything that you would ever want. The staff are so friendly, the room is immaculate, the location is excellent and safe and its near the metro and buses etc so its really good if you dont have a car. Stay here if you want a good holiday! If i ever get the chance to go back to Los Angeles then this is the only hotel that i will be staying in!

<Content>Everything you could want. My husband and I were so impressed with the Omni. We have stayed in many upscale hotels, and the Omni was right up there on service and comfort. The staff was welcoming and pleasant from the minute we drove up to the day we left. The beds were so comfortable and the rooms were very clean. The fitness center was outfitted with state of the art equipment and also very clean. Even though the hotel is downtown (which is really quiet on weekends), we didnt' feel like we were far from all the action. We can't say enough good things about the Omni. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Convenient Getaway For Those of Us In the O.C. Stayed at the Omni Los Angeles for a quick, weekend getaway from June 29 to July 1, 2007. Took advantage of a $119 per night weekend rate to celebrate our 23rd wedding anniversary.* Check-in/Check-out: The quickest, most efficient I've ever experienced anywhere in the world. Check-in was online a few days before our arrival. Our key, etc. was in an envelope ready for us to pick up from a predetermined area the moment we stepped into the hotel. We practically didn't stop from the front door to the elevator! Check-out was just as efficient--drop-off box for the keys, bill already paid. Our package included parking, which saved us $28 per night. The hotel inadvertently charged us for the two nights we stayed, but they promptly reimbursed us with no hassles when we pointed out the mistake. We appreciated this VERY much!* Service: Friendly, always well-meaning staff, who ocassionally lacked attention to detail but attended to us quickly and efficiently.* Perks: The hotel surprised us by upgrading us to Club Level, which included an expanded continental breakfast, cocktail hour and a relaxing lounge with nice views from the 17th floor. Additionally, the hotel surprised us with a hand-typed note acknowledging our anniversary, and left us a $45 bottle of champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries on our first night. Nice touches!* Transportation: We had our own car, but didn't use it since we hung around the vicinity of the hotel the entire time. The Omni offers their town car for transport to any site within a three mile radius of the hotel--very convenient. We used a combination of walking (difficult at times because places are widespread or not easily accessible because of overpasses, underpasses and steep inclines), the towncar and a taxi (once).* Exercise Room and Pool: Average--gets the job done. Some of the equipment needed repair. Hallway to this area is somewhat dreary.* Spa: Had an ultimate facial, which included a hand, foot and shoulder area massage. Average for the $150 (with tip) fee. My usual facial back home is $60 (with tip) and is much superior in quality.* Gift shop was under rennovation. Needed lip balm, which the front desk sold to me for $2.* Room: Clean, somewhat dated (early 1990s?) and well kempt. Smallish window with a decent view on the 16th floor.* Neighborhood: Except for the California Plaza (where the Omni is located), the downtown area is not an easy walk. The Disney Music Hall and gift shop, MOCA (Museum of Modern Art) and its gift shop, and the L.A. Music Center, however, are easily accessible on foot. We've been to many big cities around the world, and the only people wandering the streets in L.A. seem to be a few homeless. The throngs of tourists and locals were mostly absent--something were not used to--since the presence of many people is the usual when visiting other big cities. This downtown area is relatively clean.* Entertainment: Expect a quiet downtown (on the weekends at least) and a low-key night life. Fortunately, the L.A. Film Festival featured a documentary film at the California Plaza Saturday night, so we spontaneously attended this event and participated in the discussion with the director of the film and one of the key historical figures from the film afterward. Very cool.TIPS* Check out any specials and packages directly on Omni's website.* At the Club Level: Eat breakfast as early as possible; it gets crowded 45-minutes after they begin serving.* Reserve for dinner, excursions and activities before arriving at the Omni. It makes your weekend getaway run more smoothly and efficiently. * Suggested activities: Watch a play (which is what we did), listen to a concert or take in one of several cultural experiences offered. Check out local listings for nearby events.OVERALL: An excellent value for the money!Happy Travels!

<Content>Great Stay - I''ll be back The short stay I had at the Omni was wonderful from helpful check in - to the nice quiet room - to the good room service food. It was a nice plus to have use of the town car to get to my meeting. Room was very nice - beds were a bit high for a short person but nice and comfy once you got in. The bathroom had both a shower and a separate tub - lots of amenities such as 2 wall hooks - great for steaming out my wrinkled suit. Only thing I could have used a bit more of -- was counterspace in the bathroom. But it was manageable. I will be back.

<Content>A Bargain on the Weekend with Much to Offer I just had a great weekend stay at the Omni at California Plaza for only $75/night through priceline. Unlike other reviewers I found much to do nearby with the free concerts in the Water Court on Friday and Saturday and also took in Jersey Boys at the Ahmanson Theatre just down the street. The Disney Concert Hall is within walking distance and the Museum of Contemporary Art is next door. There are so many first rate restaurants in the area that it is difficult to decide where to go to eat. I think it would take several weekends to take in all this area has to offer.

<Content>Adored the Omini! Wow! The Omni Los Angeles at California Plaza is heaven on earth! I'm not exaggerating!! Great staff, great rooms, terrific gym  spa, and a driver! Yes, the hotel has a town car for guests who are traveling anywhere in Downtown L.A.! You walk into this place; check in; and are greeted with cooling ice tea and a staff that treats you like royalty! In particular, Kelvin, the Concierge was at our service and went beyond the call of duty!My only complaint? It was just a short weekend trip. Had I known it was going to be this good at the Omni, I definitely would have changed my schedule and stayed a few extra days!

<Content>Lovely hotel but location is very quiet on weekends... I stayed here over Martin Luther King weekend having secured an excellent rate on hotelpronto.com. The downtown area is almost dead on a weekend however, with just a couple of cafes open (along with the hotel eateries). However the Disney concert hall is close by, as is the Museum of Modern Art and both have places to eat lunch. Parking is expensive but nearby are large car parks with a reasonably low daily fee; however if you'll be coming and going more than 2 or 3 times then the hvalet . Don't park in the California Plaza car park unless you want to pay over $30 per day!The rooms and hotel are excellent - very big rooms and huge bathroom with walk in shower and bathtub.I don't think I would stay here again largely because of the dead weekend location. However if you're after a dirty weekend away - it's perfect!

<Content>Simply the best Me and my wife arrived at the Omni at may 7th. I need to say that i expected a simpler hotel. The Omni is really a great place to stay.At the front desk, the guests have a private room to check the safe box. The room is very comfortable,, with plenty of space, very nice beds, with white and super-clean blankets and linens, and a dozen pillows on the bed.The carpet was very clean, and the bathroom has a very nice size, with shower separated from the bathtub, witch was very convenient.The minibar was full of treats, and had a lock (ask for the key at the frontdesk).The hotel has one restaurant, for dinner (very nice salads and entr茅es) and a cafe for breakfest (i shall notice that the breakfest is far more expensive than the dinner).The location isn麓t the best, but whe you are in L.A., anywhere is close enought.

<Content>Amazing Hotel!!! The Omni Los Angeles is an exceptional hotel with a wonderful staff! This hotel is gorgeous with wonderful accommodations and amenities and is close to everything. We traveled with our small children and the location actually worked out nice because we could get to everything quickly, yet we weren't in the middle of the LA craziness. I've stayed at the Four Seasons in San Francisco and I would say that this hotel is comparable in quality and attention to detail. They even had milk and cookies in the room for us upon our arrival. I could not say more good things about this hotel...You should definitely stay here if you are going to LA!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Of the Six Hotels we stayed in on our Two week Holiday, this was by far the best ( and the cheapest) The Concierge was superb, chose our Room and checked us in himself. Superb room, fabulous Bathroom and extremly comfortable Bed. Only stayed one night, could have spent a week there. Recomend the Bar, very pleasant Barman ( name slips our memory) Food and Drink very reasonable. We came in on the Amtrak to Union Station, a$10 Taxi ride to the Hotel, with the most friendly Taxi driver we have ever met. The oposite to the miserable sod who took us back to the station.Unfortunatly for us that was the best bit of Los Angeles, went on a 5 hour Bus Tour, got bored after a couple of hours. We have the same shops in Manchester, they have on Rodeo Drive.

<Content>Great, consistent Downtown hotel I really like this hotel. It is a reliable business hotel with spacious, comfortable and clean rooms. I have stayed there several times over the last couple of years and the service is always good. Different pillow types on the bed and wonderfully crisp linens provide a great night sleep. If you go out to the food court plaza from the second level there is a wonderful organic coffee bar open on weekdays. The sandwich shop next to it, is also great for a quick bite.

<Content>Fantastic Service, Clean Rooms I stayed here for 3 nights Mar 2007 for a wedding. The service was fantastic from doormen, valet, front desk, to housekeeping. The rooms were super clean, nice marble floors, super comfy beds, very white clean towels/linen. Pool was small, but your in the middle of the city. I was in Room 617 which didn't get as much sun as room 627 due to the buildings. But if you want a bigger room for the same price get rooms ending in 45... like 645. It overlooks the pool  has much more space due to the location. The only disappointment was the banquet service during the wedding, it was terrible. The banquet servers ignored your requests, just wanted to get in/out  do thier job regardless of customer service. The bar is nice with fantastic bartenders, pianoman,  servers. There is a 'public' international marketplace close by for fast food (chinese, mexican, japanese, thai, etc.) The Wells Fargo Plaza also offers CPK  other eateries. The Italian restaurant in the courtyard of the Omni was just ok. Overall, the inside of the hotel was much nicer than the outside, the hotel service was fantastic (excluding banquet service). I would stay here again. We booked through Fly n Stay for cheaper rates, but some rooms booked through this site had major problems. When they checked in, the Omni asked for Vouchers. The Omni wanted to charge them AGAIN for the room even though it was prepaid through Fly n Stay. This was a bit of a bummer. So if you don't book directly with the hotel, call to confirm your reservations. The hotel is close to the fashion district, chinatown,  the jewelery district. The area is not the greatest, but then again its downtown.. thats to be expected.

<Content>Great deal We stayed at the Omni for four nights during a recent vacation to Los Angeles. It was hard to get a good look at the outside of the hotel because we were never standing that far back. Inside, I enjoyed the modern Asian inspired flower arrangements. We found the hotel to be located centrally to the things we wanted to do. Driving to the J. Paul Getty museum, a trip to the Griffith Observatory, walking to the fashion district and dining in Beverly Hills. The staff was courteous upon our arrival and we were efficiently checked into our room. I was a bit nervous because we had a voucher purchased through a discount travel company listed on TripAdvisor. There were no problems and it turned out it was just a really good deal. The hotel is located across from the MOCA and within the California Plaza. We wandered the plaza and found the nearby water features to be very nice, a great spot to sit in the morning with coffee. In general the area was nice although if walking there is an underpass I would suggest you skip walking under. I was surprised to see so many people walking in LA. I didn鈥檛 encounter any maintenance issues and the room was always made up before we returned for the day. The options for the minibar were numerous and predictably expensive. The bed while made up with layers of padding and soft sheets was so warn I didn鈥檛 sleep well many nights. All the padding over the mattress seemed to trap the heat and even with the air conditioning on cold the bed was too hot. This seems to be a common effect of the padding hotels are adding to their bedding. The complimentary toiletries were nice and the towels thick and absorbent. The tile on the floor of the shower was a sad small pale pink tile but overall the bathroom was nice. The counter had enough space, the lighting was bright enough and they even had a make-up mirror. The one thing I missed was a light in the closet. It was difficult to see my clothes after hanging them away. We didn鈥檛 use the restaurant or the room service. We usually had coffee in the room before heading out for the day. We did use the complementary wireless Internet and the valet parking. I have no complaints with either. We didn鈥檛 turn on the TV so I have no comment on that. The view was okay. We overlooked some modern art in the Plaza below. The fitness room was very nice. It was equipped with elliptical trainers, treadmills and stationary bikes for aerobic training. The also had Cybex machines and free weights for weight lifting. They had towels, water and headsets freely available in the room. A couple of the elliptical machines had TV monitors and there was a large plasma screen TV in the room. I noticed the lap pool outside the fitness room but didn鈥檛 give it a try. All in all we had an enjoyable stay and wouldn鈥檛 hesitate to visit the Omni again.

<Content>Great hotel for business stay The Omni was great. The location was convenenient to shops, restaurants and walking/jogging areas. My hotel room was very nice, the bed was super comfortable. I used the fitness center which was very nice and definitely a pleasure to work out in. Overall, the hotel is great, peaceful, and worth the cost of the room. The concierge and front desk were both very helpful when I needed them.

<Content>You have to try the Breakfast Buffett The Omni downtown LA is probably not the most eye pleasing Hotel I have stayed in but the staff certainly make up for the SLIGHTLY dated decor. The rooms and bathrooms are comfortable and clean but are a little small.The best thing about this Hotel is deffinatly the staff. Wheather its the doormen or the chef they cant do enough to help. If you do decide to stay in this hotel you just have to order the Breakfast Buffett. At around $18 per person its not cheap but it will fill you up for the day. Watch the chef prepare and cook your omlette then come back for the best pancackes in the States. Absolutly delicious!!!!!

<Content>Wonderful Experience and Highly Recommended! We stayed at the Omni two years ago and had a great time. We returned last month for a Saturday night stay and found it just as wonderful. This hotel is exceptionally well managed, clean and inviting; guests are made to feel welcomed and valued. For example, at check in last month they were out of keys for the in-room mini-bars. They immediately arranged to send a free mini-refrigerator to our room so we would have a place to chill the champagne we'd brought with us. Our room was spacious and the bed was exceptionally comfortable and quiet. As Select Guest members we get free coffee, orange juice and a paper delivered to our room in the morning (we used our champagne and the hotel's free orange juice to make mimosas). This was followed by the delicious buffet breakfast, included in our room rate. The hotel is next door to MOCA and virtually across the street from the Dorothy Chandler, Ahmanson Theater, the Opera etc. We are opera and theater buffs so this is a great base when we attend performances.Our experience last month was so terrific that we decided to return this weekend to enjoy the Show Must Go On package. The $229 room rate includes a $100 dining certificate to Noe, the restaurant located in the hotel, plus the breakfast buffet for two, a wine amenity, free town car service to and from the Dorothy Chandler and valet parking. All in all an amazing deal- break it down and the effective room rate is almost ridiculously low . I'm already impressed by the Omni for this trip because a couple of days ago I received a call from the concierge asking me if I wanted them to make dinner reservations at Noe so we could use our $100 dining certificate, and inquiring about whether we wanted red or white wine for the wine amenity. Talk about a hotel having its act together! Can't wait to spend the weekend there!

<Content>Love the Omni for business in LA The last trip I made to Los Angeles for business I did not stay at the Omni and I was not happy. Thank goodness a room was available at the Omni last week, so I could stay in comfort and ease. The front desk staff is always quick, efficient, and friendly. Every time I stay there my room is clean and the amenities are available. The fitness center is good and is open 24 hours which is fantastic for business travelers. Room service was good and the servers were always friendly. I travel alone on business quite frequently, so it is nice to stay in a hotel where I feel safe. I only have one complaint and that is the valet service. Sometimes it is quick, but other times I can wait 15-20 minutes but there are many attendents standing around. Omni might want to look at the valet service and step it up a notch. Otherwise the hotel is great. Good location in downtown LA and I will continue to stay there for business.

<Content>Loved it Love it Loved it Fabulous, all the LA glamour can be found at the OMNI hotel.I stayed there for business 2 days last August and the service was brilliant. The staff was really helpful and the room classy but comfy.I enjoy a fabulous lobster at the restaurant and the lighted terrace on a warm evening had really the X factor. Coming from England I found the meal really good value for money as well. The best moment was on a Tuesday morning on the roof terrace sipping an exquisite orange juice by the pool. It felt good.I would definitely recommend it for business travelers and romantic trips.

<Content>Favorite Place in Downtown LA We stay in LA a lot while visiting our daughter at USC and always come back to the Omni. The people working here are so friendly and helpful and the rooms are always clean and very nicely decorated. The bar and restaurant on the property are great. Great location to walk to other business and restaurants as well as being across the street from the Disney Theater. We don't even consider staying anywhere else anymore.

<Content>Awesom In the past, I have ALWAYS seen a problem (even if it is minor) with every hotel/motel we have stayed in over the last 30 years. The Omni in L.A. was the only exception. From the time we checked in (I was in my real grubby clothes) we were treated like royalty by the registration staff, up to the time we left. I didn't have any complaints. The room was meticulous, it was large, the bed was huge and so comfortable, we had a great view, and the staff did everything that we requested. This hotel was a bargain. We paid $75.00/night on Priceline. I would have gladly paid $200/night knowing what I know now about it. The people in the front (the doormen) were excellent. We had our car in minutes from when we requested it, and they were so nice. They were so very helpful with anything we needed. I cannot say enough about this hotel. The location was also excellent.

<Content>Great value! Loved the room This is a great hotel. I really loved the room, it had a huge comfortable bed and was newly renovated. The bathroom was beautiful and big! We had a wonderful view of the MOCA too. Got a great rate for the hotel through another website (i.e. not the hotel website) and paid only $89 per night! As we stayed during a quiet time and most tourists during Christmas tend to go to Anaheim resorts, there were very few guests and I think this is why we got such a great rate. You have to drive in LA so the location suited us even though it was downtown. The location didn't matter too much because we had a car. There weren't a lot of eating places nearby, you have to either eat at the hotel or walk a little to find somewhere to eat. As a tip, don't park outside of the hotel because it may not be safe for you or your car if you do. Yes valet parking was pretty expensive at about $25 a day, but an unavoidable expense if you have a car.

<Content>The Omni gives respite from hustle and bustle We stayed on the ninth floor of this clean and quiet hotel. Rooms were a bit impersonal (as others have said) but that was easily remedied by fresh flowers purchased at the nearby farmers market and a vase from room service. We were going to the House Insititute on this visit and we were pleased that the hotel has a free car service to take you to nearby locations and pick you up when you are finished at no charge! There are several coffee shops right outside the hotel so we were able to just dart out for coffee in the morning and save the roomservice fee (although I found out later that if you are a member of the Omni Guest Club as I am, coffee is free). We ate at the resturant at the hotel and had an amazing meal. This was a great homebase from which to explore Los Angeles, especially if you prefer a quiet zone at the end of a busy day. If you want to be an LA scenester, go elsewhere!

<Content>OK--but not for internet access or work In general this is an above average business hotel. Not very stylish, but more than serviceable on 3 visits. Decent gym, excellent lap pool.Housekeeping only ok and service seems a victim of constant turnover. The front desk, concierge etc. are pleasant, but clueless-and never seem to be the same from trip to trip.However, the work area doesn't include a task chair, laptop friendly desk or decent desk lamp, like many Westins or Hiltons.Most importantly, on all three stays (twice on 14 and most recently on 15) the WiFi service is intermittent at best all hours of the day in the rooms and the public areas (even though they just upgraded the service). Regularly couldn't stay connected for hours on end. Resorted to going to Starbucks for WiFi, not optimal in mostly empty downtown LA.It's a decent value under $200, as long as you aren't counting on using the internet.

<Content>Quality Hotel I'm often surprised at how overgenerous Trip Advisor reviews can be of some fairly ordinary hotels (Hilgard House is rated way too high, for example. Nice people and location, but the rooms are 70's relics) But I would strongly disagree with the last, very negative review of the Omni Los Angeles. This is a very high quality, comfortable hotel. I have stayed several times, mostly for business, both in ordinary rooms and at the Club Level and would rate all of those stays very highly. Service is not perfect but very professional and welcoming. Like all Omni's, the bathrooms are a bit larger with a separate bath and shower and countertops. The bed with down comforter and mulitple down pillows was very nice, comfortable, and clean -- not the typical ugly, mulit-colored, polyesterish and probably-not-washed-in-quite-a-while comforter. I stayed 4 nights on the 16th Floor Club Level -- I had a good sized, corner room with a direct view of the Music Center, the Disney Hall, City Hall, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and alas, the large, not-so-interesting condominium building across the street. There isn't a large amount of public space in the Omni, but what it is has is attractive. Downtown LA, while getting better, can be hit and miss in terms of nightlife. But the Omni is quite central for downtown business activities and culture, as has been often mentioned. Music, theater, art, Little Tokyo, etc. are either next door or down the street.The morning breakfast and afternoon snacks are good in the Club Room, which also has 2 computer terminals and a color printer. The people staffing the club room are very nice and very hardworking since they pour drinks, help out with the computers, clean up, etc. Wireless internet access is also free for Select Guest members (which you can just join when you arrive if you want), in addition to coffee/tea/etc. delivered each morning for Select Guests.Some small service issues -- they delivered the wrong paper in the mornings, but when I went to breakfast, the WSJ, NYT and LAT were all available, so no big deal. Coffee was delivered to my door half of the days, but again, I went to breakfast each morning anyway, so I didn't even bother to call and it was free. Most of the front desk personnel were good. Parking valets were very good.I've stayed at several of the downtown hotels -- Bonaventure, Biltmore, New Otani, The Grand, etc., but the Omni is my preferred hotel. Quieter, nicer rooms, more valets for parking, and overall a higher quality hotel.

<Content>Fantastic stay at Omni Hotel We have just returned from a stay in the Omni Hotel at California Plaza, Los Angeles. We booked this Hotel because of the very good reviews on Trip Advisor. It was fantastic - better than expected. We choose a room at Club Level which included Continental breakfast and drinks from 5.00 - 8.00 pm each evening. The bed (as advised by a Trip Advisor user) was pure luxury. You just would not want to get out of it. Room  bathroom just perfect. Our room no 1615 was positioned on a corner so we had 2 views. Through one window we could see the famous 'Hollywood ' sign on the hills and through the other window we had great view of the waterfall  plaza below. Breakfast included hot porridge, fresh fruit - all kinds, cold meat, smoked salmon, egg s Florentine, bacon, sausages etc, etc. not to mention the beautiful muffins  pastries. The menue was slightly different each day. Evening drinks included cheeses, pancakes and tasty hor'devours. All the staff we encountered were extremely helpful  friendly. Don't forget to become a 'select guest' with the Omni. Do this through their website. Taxis always available outside hotel. This hotel is just great.

<Content>This place is awful This hotel is depressing. Its a bare bones hotel. The only saving grace is that the bedding is OK. But the room is very plane and the bathroom stark. I would not rate this a 4 star hotel.

<Content>Wonderful Experience! The hotel is by far the best hotel I've ever stayed at. My boyfriend and I booked a standard room via priceline.com for a great price...around $80/night after taxes. I've paid full price at many other 3-4 star hotels, but none of them can beat the Omni. The room was not big at all...to be honest it was pretty small, but still for me to love the room and the experience, you'll have to believe it was really that great. The down comforter was soooooo fluffy and there were pillows all over the bed. The shower had a speaker/radio so you can listen to the tv while in there. If you're only looking to pay for a standard room, the size is perfect if you're looking to stay in bed all day, watch tv, hang out, etc. It's not big enough if you're planning to bring children along. I forgot how much parking was. I think it was around $15/night, but there are in and outs. There's not much to do in downtown L.A., but you can walk next door and visit the Museum of Contemporary Arts (MOCA) or drive a couple miles to Little Tokyo...On Saturdays, Little Tokyo has a small farmer's market. Other times, you can visit the Little Tokyo's branch of the MOCA, have lunch, shop around. Enjoy!

<Content>Close to Cultural Venues My husband and I stayed at the Omni for a one stay for a birthday trip. The staff and rooms were great. The location, one block from the Music Center and Disney Auditorium was the real reason for our choice. The museum next door was also nice. Our room was spacious, the bed was so comfortable and it was very quiet.

<Content>Great location, beautiful hotel, LOVED IT! We stayed at the Omni for 3 nights during a tour of California. There were 2 adults and a 16-yr old girl. We found it with no problems and the valet service were wonderful with the car. They were excellent all the time we were staying there. The hotel itself if beautifully decorated and photos do not do it justice. Everything was easy to find and staff could not have been more helpful if they tried. The room was wonderful, if not a tad on the small side, but great nonetheless. Mini bar and snacks well stocked. We ate out in the restaurant downstairs one night, which was pricy but well worth it. The chef is actually from around where we live in England so it was a happy coincedence. The food was amazing and service top notch, a real first class LA dining experience. We left the 16yr old in the room while we ate in the restaurant, and she would like to give her complements to the room service staff for the wonderful pizza and desert. The restaurant is right by a whole little block of coffee shops and food places which is great for the mornings. We found out way to Malibu, Santa Monica and Hollywood no problem. We drove to the first two but used public transport for the latter and it was very easy when explained to us by the hotel staff who were more than happy to help. The pool was great, there were a few teens and kids in it when we used it which was good, and we had a great time swimming and laying by it on the comfortable loungers, chatting to other guests. We would stay here again!! Loved it!

<Content>Loved The Bed! My colleague booked this hotel for a convention at the LA Convention Center. And I think she paid about $130 per night from Fri - Mon, 3 night stay.The entrance and lobby are relatively small, but I think it's typical of hotels located in busy business district like downtown LA. Since we stayed there on the weekend, there were several parties/events/gathering at their meeting facility, and the lobby/entrance staffs seemed more busy accommodating them over their hotel guests.Our room was on 17th floor, which had a lounge area where they served daily continental breakfast. They also served complimentary wine and some snacks in the evenings and the room had 2 internet ready computers for the guests for free.Room was very clean, simple, and modern. I really liked their bed, mattress, choice of pillows, and a down comforter especially since I am somewhat particular about my sleeping environment.The hotel is located in a strange spot. There is nothing else around the hotel that I was willing to walk to at night. We always took a cab to get to places like a sushi restaurant in Little Tokyo, California Pizza Kitchen, and Roy's. Cabs were hard to get to find our way back to the hotel on weekend nights.Overall, it was a nice stay. I might find a hotel that's closer to stores/restaurants on my next visit. Things might have been very different if it weren't for the weekend stay.

<Content>Best Luxury Hotel Downtown I stayed here this past weekend for the USC/Cal game, and it was absolutely perfect! Great location... you just have to know that downtown is NOT a party spot on the weekends. The room was large and comfortable, and the service here is excellent! Definitely worth its 4-star rating.Beware the $26 for valet per day... we parked on the lot on Olive between 1st and 2nd for $6 instead. Just know that it's an open parking lot, so your car isn't guarded 24/7 and there's no In-n-out priveleges. We saved a lot of money though!

<Content>pricey but very nice We booked ten rooms for my staff for a Thursday/Friday stay in early November. Due to a city wide convention and Laker game, downtown was virtually sold out. We found concierge floor rooms for $259.The hotel is a few miles from the Convention Center but is directly across from the Disney Concert Hall - some of the rooms have a great view of the hall. The bellmen were very helpful and quick at this hotel. We used car or cab servcie every day and one nice bellman made sure we knew the flat fee or expected rate so the cab couldn't overcharge us. The lobby is small and centers around a strange glass atrium filled with a yellow iron sculpture resembling an animal. The orchids filling the vases at every turn are nice. The front desk is small but there was no line. There was a mixup with my reservation at first but it was quickly fixed. The clerk did not remember to inform me about the concierge lounge, however.My room was a good size with a great King Bed, lots of pillows, a chair with ottoman and a desk. The furnishing looked update and almost new, and the bedding was very nice. The TV was large but not a newer model. There was an open plug available (not under the bed) for electronics and a nice CD player/Alarm clock. The robes were nice, albeit huge. There is a mini-bar with pricey but attractive items like chocolates, nuts, spa products, even a cute little quote book and spray starch for your clothes ($3.95). There is an iron and ironing board in the room, which is nice. Although free pressing was included at the concierge level, they needed about 24 hours to complete it.I liked the bathroom, which had a separate bath and shower, and lovely toiletries. The towels were plentiful and plush, and there were two bath mats provided, which was nice.The marble vanity was a bit small for a woman's things, but there were a few tiny glass shelves and a nice magnifying mirror (you must stand to reach it). Lighting is good and there is a scale (!) in the bathroom. Water pressure was good and the bath/shower temp was nice (I liked the bath salts that were provided), but the sink wouldn't run hot water at all. There was also an interesting switch so you could listen to the TV in the bath without blasting it from the bedroom, but it didn't work consistently enough to be of much use.While it wasn't too hot or cold, I would have like my AC to work just a bit better - even if you set it for 60 degrees, it wouldn't go below 70.Room service was prompt but extremely expensive (+20% room service fee plus $2.50 delivery fee), as is the on-site restaurant , Noe. Food was nicely done and hot on arrival with everything that I requested. There is a bar/lounge where you can order the room service menu, but it really isn't much of a hotel restaurant and is hard to find on the third floor. There are small couches and tables in the hallway near the lounge if you have a group. There is a tiny, tiny gift shop at the back of the third floor. Don't rely on this for much more than a soda, snack or magazine, but the prices were fair.The concierge lounge is on the 17th floor and you must use your room card to access that floor. The breakfast spread was much more than I expected (eggs, sausage, oatmeal, pastries, fruit) and there is an internet alcove available for use. The huge plasma screen TV was a nice touch. One warning about the view from the hotel - there is an apartment building across the street and I noticed lots of tenants (men) who stood on their balconies at night, taking in the view of the hotel. Also, the window jutts out from the building (nice) almost like a balcony, but if you look right or left, you can see anyone standing in their window, and they can see you.I found the hotel comfortable and somewhat quiet. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I had business in the area, but I think you can find more reasonably priced hotels if you just want to stay in downtown.

<Content>Excellent hotel in great location Huge, comfy beds, a heated outdoor pool [in which we swan at10pm] and in a wonderful location.The only down side to a hotel such as the Omni is that, being quite pricey all the services are, too. Being a select guest ww were very glad of the free early morning coffee or hot chocolate.There are lots of rooms with good views -our 18 yr old son was mesmerised by ours of the Citybank tower. The subway and Grand market are literally one and two minutes away from the rear entrance, Disney Concert Hall less than 5 mins walk, the MOCAnearer. There are not too many places to eat in the evening but we walked purposefully down to The Pantry or Denny's diner for instance, in about 20mins and never felt intimidated.Chinatown and Union station restaurants about the same in the other direction.Public transport is great ad it is easy to get aound by subwayand bus. Even the 50 mins to Santa Monica lets you see real people and the local sights.We had such a wonderful time last October we brought our son in April.No need for Universal Studios -it seemed the whole place was a movie set at times and we saw some films being shot in the streetIf you're travelling on to San Diego get the Amtrak-it's very reasonable, comfortable and the vfiews are spectacular.

<Content>A Positive Experience Going to LA for a conference, my wife joined me and we stayed at the Omni Oct. 26 and 27. We are recent select members and have stayed at the Omni San Francisco twice. We booked a club room about a month in advance and were not disappointed. The online booking and check-in was quick and we were given a room on the 17th floor (both the 16th and 17th we were told were club level rooms). While the outside of the hotel shows some wear (I was told it used to be the Inter-Continental) the inside and the room we had was spacious, clean and modern. My wife had a chance to enjoy the pool and exercise room. Being on the club floor we enjoyed the expanded continental breakfast and evening cocktails and snacks, plus delivery of the LA Times in the monring. All this made for a relaxing get-away and work trip. I read the earlier review and feel lucky we had such a great stay. I've stayed at the Biltmore in the past, but would choose the Omni again if we are staying in downtown LA. Some of the larger corporate hotels downtown may offer more service, but we loved the location and staff at the Omni.

<Content>Less than expected! After reading the great reviews of this hotel, I decided to stay at here this weekend with my daughter for a shopping trip. I booked the hotel via their website and used the 50% off coupon that was included with my select guest card package last year. When I arrived at the hotel, I was informed by the young desk clerk that I would not receive the parking ($26 a night) that was included in my $149 rate because I was using the discount. Then he stated I could not use the upgrade certificate with the discount either. I then asked to speak with the manager. Instead, he must have tried to confirm this himself as when he returned, he told me that I could use the upgrade certificate....but from my experience, this hotel doesn't really have upgraded rooms, other than the Club floor, which he refused to put us in unless I paid an extra $35 a night! I had already read on here of that upgrade being given for free and I declined.Upon opening the door of our room on the 14th floor, I noticed we were given a good size room with a king size bed , when I had reserved 2 double beds, non smoking. Then we were moved to another room on the same floor, this time a standard double room. I called downstairs and asked the manager why this room was considered an upgrade and she said it wasn't! So she moved us one more time! Wait it get's better....On Saturday after a trip to the Fashion district, we called the hotel for the town car to pick us up, and only after 5 phone calls, several promises that the driver was on his way...1 hour later, he finally made it. I don't know if I would ever depend on that service again.Anyway, when we returned to our room, it had a very strong odor of cigarette smoke. Apparently, one of our neighbors decided to light up and the smoke entered our room through the vents. My daughter called the front desk and they suggested that we move...AGAIN! Same thing occured here, they moved us to a standard double instead of larger room and we have to move for the last time to the 6th floor. That is 5 rooms total! I have never had such an experience and hope to never have it again!I stayed here because it looked like they excelled in service but I found the opposite to be true. None of our preferences for the select guest program were fulfilled so I really am not sure why the program exists.

<Content>Friendly and comfortable Stayed at the Omni one night for business travel. I found the hotel comfortable, quiet and more than satisfactory for my needs.Following the advice of other Trip Advisor users, I joined the Omni's Select Guest program (free) so I earned frequent flyer miles and got express check in, several newspapers and a complimentary morning beverage. The staff were friendly and efficient.The room was large and comfortable. Every convenience one might expect, as well as free wireless internet. The king sized bed was piled with mountains of covers and was so inviting I fell asleep the minute my head hit the pillow (having arrived from the east coast!). As a result, I didn't even turn on the television, but a card on the bedside table listed an array of local and cable stations available. I didn't hear a noise all night.I could see an outdoor lap pool from my window, so that is available, although, obviously, you could have an audience.Although there is not much of a street scape in downtown LA, I did take a walk the next morning and there are a few coffee shops around. The Disney Concert Hall is nearby and that is worth at least walking around if you have the time.In sum, it is a very friendly and comfortable hotel -- a wonderful place to spend a night away from home.

<Content>Best downtown LA hotel The Omni is the best downtown LA hotel--not to be confused with the best hotels in LA which are near Beverly Hills. However, if you have a business meeting downtown I recommend staying here. The rooms are very nice and good value. If you are from the East Coast and wake up at 5AM LA time you can walk to the adjacent plaza and get a latte at that time. I also found the room service to be very efficient. The hotel is very quiet and within a short walk to the Disney, which should not be missed. Also, there are some good restaurants within walking distance. So if you do not want to be sitting in LA traffic more than necessary, I recommend a night at the Omni and then a trip back to the airport.

<Content>Great nights sleep! Both me and my parents stayed for one night at the Omni at the start of our around the world trip, and it was a perfect start. Beautifully spacious and well equipped rooms and wonderfully comfortable beds - perfect after a long flight. Our room even had a view, although distant, of the Hollywood sign.The staff were helpful and the breakfast was delicious. We booked online and shopped around to get a real bargain.The hotel did seem mainly used by business people but that was to be expected with its location. The hotel is set in a pretty coutyard where there are several places to call in for a snack.We found getting a cab between three of us cheaper than most other forms of airport to hotel transportation.Would highly recommend it!

<Content>Great rooms, not so great location We stayed at the omni for one night. It took us about 1.5 hours to get from a relatively close location to there. not that that was unexpected, because the hotel is downtown. however, it was kind of a drag. the hotel is also not in the nicest area of town. It is not a terrible section of the city, but not a great one either. The hotel's lobby is not very welcoming. Having said all of that, the room was very nice. it was quite large and had a tub and shower in the bathroom. The beds were extremely comfortable. The 2 restaurants were very nice, as was the outdoor pool. The hotel also offers a towncar service, which can become useful, although it will only go to locations within a short distance. The front desk was fairly helpfull. Overall, mainly because of the very nice rooms, a nice night's stay. if you are looking for a charming hotel; this isnt it. however, if you are looking for a nice, quiet, comfortable place to sleep downtown, this may be your hotel.

<Content>Loved it! Beautiful hotel. I traveled with my family but for work. Rooms were clean, large and very well decorated. Comfortable beds too. The location stinks on weekend because there is no place to eat but the hotel and it can get pricey. I followed a tip I saw on Trip Advisor and joined the Omni's Select club (free) and got upgraded to the club floor which has a lounge with drinks and food.

<Content>Great hotel for the price I stayed here for a conference recently and was very impressed with both the rooms and the facilities. The rooms were spacious and comfortable and the bathrooms were especially large, with nice amenities. The conference facilities were great and so was the food served and the service. My favorite part was the free Starbucks coffee in the 3rd floor restaurant--I hate roaming a strange city at 6 a.m. trying to find the coffee I so desperately need! The gym was above average and the pool was smallish but nice. There were a few things that seemed to be needing some attention, like missing faucet handles here and there, etc., but generally it was great. The beds were the best part--really a great night of sleep.

<Content>Okay but not what I expected I read many reviews about the Omni Hotel Los Angeles and most had nothing but great things to say about this property. Perhaps my expectations were set too high because my experience did not mirror that which others encountered. Here are the issues I found: Hotel staff not at all knowledeable about the area around the hotel (e.g. - restaurants, parking issues, etc) and they appeared minimally interested in helping me out. The rooms were adequate but nothing spectacular as I had expected from other reviews. The pool area had NO spa and the towels were not kept stocked adequately during my stay. One MAJOR issue I must make all aware of: parking is a joke! VERY expensive: $26.00 a day (valet) and if your into tipping everytime you have to get your car, then well hats off to you.. I'm not into that and it was quite costly during my stay. Parking around the hotel is not recommended due to the reported car thefts and burglaries in the area by hotel staff. I also didn't see any security on site at the hotel during my stay (at least they were not visible). Overall, the hotel is adequate but nothing remarkable and in my opinion this is not a 4 star property.

<Content>Feels a bit dated, but nice enough The Omni looks and feels a lot like a hotel which was flash in its day - unfortunately that day has passed. Not that it isn't perfectly ok, just some of it is a bit overblown for the standard of the hotel - eg the 10 bellmen mingling around all desperately trying to help you to earn a tip becomes a bit tiring. But thats coming from a New Zealander not used to that sort of thing so it might be perfectly normal.Other than that the staff were friendly, room service prompt, the room was comfortable and the bed was huuuuge, and the location is ideal for exploring around the MOCA and Disney concert hall, and downtown. A warning to NZers (and others) trying avoid staying in Anaheim, and have this place recommended to you by a travel agent (like we were). This is ok for a night, but beyond that it is quite restrictive as the nightlife is dead, even restaurants are hard to get to. Pay the extra money and stay in Hollywood or Santa Monica.

<Content>OK, but nothing spectacular. I just got back from a trip to LA and stayed in both Santa Monica and the Omni in Downtown LA.I booked the Omni based on the reviews here and on a great deal ($150 a night).Whilst I was very happy with the hotel, I didn't experience any of the wow factors that other reviewers have. Reception staff were perfectly pleasant, but not exceptionally so, and in the two days I was there there was never once an occasion where the doorman opened the door for me - even when I came back laden with shopping bags! It seemed that they were focusing on the rich American families and business guests, rather than the lone female traveller - I wondered if they thought I was less likely to tip!?The room was comfortable - and an enormous king size bed - but no hairdryer!! The area is very quiet and didn't feel particularly safe. The Metro is only a block away, but you have to walk through an area populated by homeless people to get there. OK (if a little smelly) during the day, but certainly made me nervous of doing so at night.In summary, if you need a comfortable room to rest your head, a good deal. If you want to be in the action, or want a hairdryer, try elsewhere!!

<Content>Nice hotel Very nice place. Good size room. The bed is fantastic, better than my own at home. I loved that there was a nice white down comforter on the bed...you know it must be fairly clean if it is bright white. Nice comfortable chair.The restaurant, Noe, is extremely expensive. There is an italian restaraunt on the second level in the plaza that is lovely and much more reasonably priced. Room service prices were as expected and the quality was good. I recommend that everyone coming here first sign up with their preferred customer program on the hotel web site. Then when you check in let the desk clerk know and they will give you tickets to have coffee/tea and juice/milk along with a newspaper delivered to your room in the morning whenever you choose. Very nice touch. You also have the ability to add a muffin or crossant at a very reasonable price like 1.50, with no delivery charge.The doormen were excellent and always there to open the door for you or get you a cab or whatever.

<Content>Great Hotel!! Stayed here for 4 nights in early July. Found it a bit tricky to find as its located in downtown L.A. but used Mapquest which helped. We liked the location as it was handy for all the tourist attractions and at night it is very quiet . The standards at this hotel are very good - the staff are great, they could not be more helpful and the valet parking staff greeted you with Welcome Back, etc, etc The beds were very comfortable with lovely linens and we had a nice view out of our window. The reception area is very impressive. We would return if we went back to L.A.

<Content>Relaxing and luxorious The Omni Hotel in downtown LA was one of the best hotels we stayed in during our 3 -week trip in the US. The reviews on tripadvisor were perfectly right. We stayed here from the 11th till 14th of July 2006.When you arrive, your car and luggage are taken care of and you can immidiatly proceed to the check-in, without any hassle. Funny was that there was always someone who happens the front door for you. As opposed to the exterior, the interior of the building looks faboulous. Wall decorations, pieces of art and flowers in the (big) lobby welcome the tired visitors who we are (we flew from Europe). The hallways look just as neat, instead of those typical dark ones in motels. All the staff (including everybody out there, even the cleaners) are friendly and smile all the time. They really want to make your stay comfortable it seems. The rooms are spacious. We had 3 large suitcases and 3 weekend-bags and we could all 'get rid' of them in the room without tripping over them. The beds are really comfortable (triple sheeting) and the bathroom is nice. You even get plush robes to use which are replaced everyday if you used them, just like the towels, bed sheets and laundry bags. The restaurants are quite expensive. For diners closeby we would advise to look for restaurants near Pershing Square. Breakfast on the otherhand you could choose the Omni. OK its $17 but we see it as a breakfast+lunch as you can eat and drink as much as you want. 4 different kinds of ommelets, bread pudding (a must), potatoes, veggies, cereal, bread, bagels etc. are all in. Major attractions in downtown are the skyscrapers, theatres and the shopping streets (figuroa) and perhaps the dodger stadium if you have time to visit a game. Something you should note about downtown is that there are a lot of homeless people walking around, especially if you go east towards the metro station. For Europeans, its quite a shock at the beginning (contrast thing) but once you get used to it, its OK. Santa Monica and Hollywood Blvd are 30-40 minute drive but there's enough to see along the way.All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Omni and the overall feeling of the hotel was relaxing and luxorious.

<Content>Very good hotel Great big room, king size bed, big clean bathroom. It's what I expected from this 4 star hotel. So it was worth the price.Metro station 5 mins walk from hotel for those without car. Very few restaurants open for dinner at California Plaza, which has many things to offer during the day, including a Starbucks.

<Content>The Omni rocks! We enjoyed a perfect stay at the Omni this past spring. After a not-so-great experience at the Westin Bonaventure, I can safely say that the Omni is my favorite hotel in downtown LA!Firstly, its location is great -- close to museums, restaurants and the freeway. Little Tokyo is just a few blocks away, so we were able to do takeout sushi from Sushi Go 55. (It was absolutely delicious, especially the seared albacore sashimi. The black cod special was sweet, velvety and very yummy as well!) Note that LA is one of those cities that you must drive, not walk鈥o don鈥檛 expect any of the local attractions, such as Hollywood, Rodeo Drive, the beach, etc. to be within walking distance!Check-in and service in general was excellent 鈥?probably the best that I鈥檝e experienced so far. The staff was courteous, speedy and made me feel like they were willing to handle my special requests. The wait for valet wasn鈥檛 too long, and there was always someone to greet us at the door. The preferred guest program is a great bonus, so sign up for that when you have a minute. The perks are great, it鈥檚 free, and allows you to stay on top of the Omni specials that are going on.The room was great! Of course, everything was clean and well-appointed and the room actually felt quite spacious. We had a great view from one of the top floors, and could see various sculptures and plazas of nearby buildings as well as a gorgeous city line, including the intruiging Walt Disney Concert Hall. We also happened to be staying there the weekend of the immigration protests, and it was surreal to see what was happening both on television and outside our window. My only wish is that our stay could鈥檝e been longer so that we could experience all that the Omni has to offer. I can鈥檛 wait until our next downtown LA stay, and would try any of the other Omni locations in a heartbeat!

<Content>The reviews were right, great hotel!!! We stayed at the Omni Hotel at end of June as we had one night in LA before we flew out the next day and didn't want to be stuck around the airport. We read the reviews and got a great rate at the hotel.This hotel is just a really nice, quite classy hotel. Its downtown so perfect if you have business in that district but as one of the other reviews mentioned, there is a nice mall next door. The day we were there a small music festival was going on at the mall which made it all the better. Fabulous rooms, extremely comfortable beds and friendly service. If you haven't got the impression from all the other reviews, the bed in our room may be the best I have slept in at a hotel. Can't really say enough things about the hotel - I know that one of the reviews mentioned the mini bar could be better (??) but I don't pick hotels by mini-bar - there was a lovely bar within the hotel that should most people busy....Keep up the good work Omni!

<Content>GREAT VALUE, GREAT SERVICE, GREAT LOCATION! I had a previous stay at the San Francisco Omni and loved it, so I thought it would be fun to try the Omni in LA. We stayed at downtown LA's Omni to attend one of the free summer concerts in California Plaza (nextdoor to the hotel) and to visit MOCA (directly behind the hotel.) We booked a package through the hotel's website that included a huge picnic dinner prepared for the concert, valet parking, and buffet breakfast for 2. My expectations were exceeded for several reasons: As a SELECT GUEST, I was already checked into the hotel and only needed to pick up an envelope with my room keys and breakfast vouchers when I arrived (I signed up as a select guest on the Omni's website before I booked the room, after reading about it from another Tripadvisor review. Thanks!)Our picnic dinner baskets were ready for us when we arrived in the roomWe had a large room on a high floor with a view of the Walt Disney Concert hall and extra down pillows as I requested on their websitePicnic dinner basket was well stocked, nicely presented,and food was very tastyThe gym facilities are well equipped and brand new. Nearly all of the cardio machines had their own TVsStaff were extremely helpful and attentiveThere were many things to do in the vicinity of the hotel on a Saturday night. On this particular night, was a concert presented by KCRW's Sounds Eclectico program featuring two world/latin music groups. The venue was incredibly packed since the show was free. Next door, MOCA was presenting Night Vision (basically, the museum is open until 11:45pm and has a DJ, cocktail bar, and art station--mostly appealing to young adults). The breakfast spread was really good and had a station with a short order cook preparing fresh omelets, pancakes, and french toast.The only thing that might be bothersome to some people would be the noise generated by the concert and by MOCA. This did not bother us at all, but for those that need to get to bed early, it would be a good idea to request a room on the opposite sides of the hotel that don't overlook either of these venues. Overall, we had a wonderful time and are now even bigger fans of the Omni chain! We will definitely be back.

<Content>Great Downtown Hotel If you need to stay downtown (I don't know why anyone would stay downtown except to attend a convention like I did), this is the place. It is easy to get to in a nice area. It's near the Disney Concert Hall and Museum of Art. The rooms are spacious with nice views and the bedding is wonderful. Lots of equipment in the fitness room and a small heated rooftop pool. I would definitely stay again.

<Content>Good well priced hotel My husband and I stayed one night over memorial day weekend. This looks and feels like a business hotel but we enjoyed staying as tourists. The service was ok friendly but was made up for by the huge clean room and truly comfy bed. The bathroom was also a good size. We were a bit annoyed with the valet car service as twice we called 10 minutes before going down to the lobby yet the car was still not there and we had to wait another 5 minutes for them to bring it around. We booked our room on expedia for ~$150 and thought the price was great for this level type of hotel. It's close by the MOCA and freeway entrance.

<Content>GREAT PET FRIENDLY HOTEL! Wow this hotel was amazing! Pet friendly and the rooms are BEAUTIFUL and REASONABLE! I highly recommend this hotel, if you have a fancy little pup who doesn't want to stay at the motel 6 downtown! I also did not have to pay a pet surcharge which I thought was very nice. This hotel I would highly recommend for the location, it's near food and safe walking areas! Great for the business traveler who gets lonely being cooped up in their room as I was! Wonderful comfy bed and accomodations!

<Content>Not a bargain, but no other significant complaints Pros:-Location: if you must spend time in downtown LA, this is a relatively pleasant block with good views. Proximity to the Grand Central Market (fun, cheap, indoor farmer's market) is key.-Cleanliness / service and comfort: immaculate. No problem with getting our tub re-cleaned after getting it all sandy after a trip to the beach. Excellent concierge service, which contacted me by email prior to my stay and was able to assist me with car rentals, restaurant reservations etc.-Club lounge(complimentary with club level rooms): Nice view, great cocktail snacks and breakfast. I have stayed at renaissance hotels which had a similar club rooms, and this one served much better food.Cons:-price. We paid $279 a night (for a club level room) , and it wasn't THAT nice-lack of character- very business-y. Kind of sterile with no fun extras like spa products. Bathroom had a small tub and generally not as luxurious as other hotels I've stayed at in this price range, though it was certainly clean and fine.-Most good restaurants are a significant cab ride awayRecommendations:-get a room overlooking the disney hall (an architectural wonder)- If you're not already an Omni select guest, go on line, join the select guest club (free) prior to your stay, book a standard room, then use your free omni select guest coupon to upgrade to club level-- this will get you a free, good breakfast buffet every morning

<Content>Fastastic Bed! The room was comfortable. The bed was great! It had huge pillows and comforters to die for.It was voted the best bed we have slept on by my husband and me. The only mishap that occured was on the final bill. We booked an online special through the hotels website that included parking. When we received the bill, parking was charged again. This was quickly remedied when we spoke to the front desk.

<Content>Just Wonderful! The Omni in LA was a wonderful surprise! We managed to get a beautiful room for three nights after having arrived at a nightmare hotel in LA. They took us in very last minute and were very warm and friendly about the whole thing. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are spacious and clean. Morning brakfast buffet is delicious (try the pancakes), room service is fast, fresh and friendly and the whole experience was very relaxing and enjoyable. We would definetely stay here again and would recommend it to all our friends!

<Content>Excellent Hotel Omni Los Angeles Hotel, 12th April '06. 2 adults and 1 teenage son.What a lovely hotel. The hotel rooms are spacious and tastefully furnished, the beds are the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in and the bedding also. The hotel ammenities are very good although we weren't there long enough to make good use of them. We were very late (22.30hrs) arriving at the hotel due to road work hold ups from Las Vegas so found we were very limited to where we ate, basically room service, this was very quick and the food was of a high standard. Our only gripe was having to pay $26 to park the car for the night. We would however definately stay here again.

<Content>Perfect Our family of 3 stayed at the Omni on a Friday and Saturday night. What a great week end deal! We paid 159.00 a night with free valet parking and breakfast for two each morning (we didn't need 3 vouchers because I'm not into breakfast). The guys selected breakfast items from a wonderful buffet. The rooms were quiet and comfortable. I loved the floral scent every time I entered the lobby. The hotel is in walking distance to the Disney Concert Hall, Our Lady of the Angels Cathedral and The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. The Omni deserves the high Trip Advisor ranking it receives. We highly recommend it for a week end visit.

<Content>Nice hotel; I hope the area catches up with it This hotel's best service is undoubtedly its valet parking. The service is amazing. I never waited more than a minute or two for my car. In fact, there are some rates that include unlimited valet parking in it; however, be careful. I paid the higher rate to include this amenity and was charged for the parking anyway. The readily amended it when I brought it to their attention. (Maybe they're accustomed to having to do so.) The area surrounding the hotel is very dicey. So, the hotel offers a free service in which they will take you or pick you up from any location within a three-mile radius until 11:00 p.m. This can be especially helpful since the streets are quite confusing with lots of one-way streets. They offer free Starbucks coffee all day, which is especially nice if you have travelled and are now in a different time zone. The staff at the Grand Cafe was very friendly and accommodating.The room was cleaned early in the day, which is somehting that I just haven't seen happen in most other hotels.We requested early check-in for two rooms and, although they weren't ready when we arrived, they were available to us within the hour.Prior to this trip, I stayed at the Hollywood Renaissance Hotel - and I cannot begin to list all of the problems that I encountered with them. It was so bad that they offered me a free room on my next trip. Oddly, I haven't been able to get the Manager who offered this compensation to return my call. Try the Omni Los Angeles. It's a part of the city that many people visiting L.A. don't see - but should.

<Content>Would stay at the Omni Again My husband and I stayed at the Omni from March 24-26. The lobby is beautiful as well as the rooms. The pool is heated for swimming laps. We got the breakfast package which included valet parking and the breakfast buffet daily - $159/night. Totally worth it. The only downside to the hotel is that it is in the business district and so we had to drive everywhere, but no one walks in LA anyway, right! It was 30 minutes to Malibu/Santa Monica area and 30 minutes to the airport. For the price and the luxury, I would not hesitate to stay at the Omni again.

<Content>Nice, Warm, Clean Place to Stay Upon check-in, we were greeted by a very friendly, front desk agent. The room was nice with a great view of the courtyard. It was clean and had a very warm feel to it. The room was decorated quite nicely and we felt very comfortable for our week-long stay. The only drawback here is the parking. You can valet your car for about $24 per hotel stay and come and go as you please. If you plan on parking in the lots nearby, expect to pay about $6 everytime you leave and come back to that lot. Not very cost efficient if you plan on coming and going from the hotel regularly.Despite the parking limitation, I would stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful hotel All the reviews were spot on with this place! An amazing bargain for a magnificent hotel. The rooms were lovely and the beds supremely comfortable and with a large bathroom and separated shower and bath. The gym had good, sufficient equipment. The staff were very helpful and welcoming and very patient!We used the car valet service, a little pricey at $26 per day but the car was got promptly on request. And the hotel entrance smelt wonderful with all the lovely fresh orchids!The hotel is in downtown LA and is a 10 min walk from the nearest metro station, Pershing Square though it's a sharp uphill to get back to the hotel from the metro. The general area is fine, a lot of homeless people near the metro and park and not a lot to do or eat in the area on a weekend as it's a business area and the hotel resturant is a little pricey.But more than exceeded expectations!

<Content>A good find and two new fans of downtown LA. We enjoyed our stay at the Omni. Service was excellent, views were nice. We particularly enjoyed the proximity to the Grand Central Market (where we had a fabulous lunch for $5 of authentic Mexican and fresh seafood) and being within blocks of the Disney Concert Hall. Easy to get all around LA. We parked at the hotel the first night because we got in so late, but easily found street parking the next evening.

<Content>The Omni is Good I don't have that much to add to all the deserved praise the Omni has received. We got a $125 weekend rate, which we considered a fine bargain, though $26 for parking was steep (the family couldn't agree to park on the street as some other people posting had done).My wife and daughter enjoyed the pool very much and could actually swim in it, unlike so many hotel pools. I was able to walk from the hotel to both the Downtown Standard (for early morning coffee since it's open 24/7) and Little Tokyo (for dinner). The latter walk took us through a few blocks mostly comprised of parking lots, which my wife and daughter complained about mightily, but (on friday night) there were always at least some people around and no suggestion of danger. (We took a very short bus ride back). We also walked to a very pleasant cafe/wine bar--open 7 days--at 4th  Main in the Old Bank renovation project. The Omni is also literally adjacent to the main part of the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) as well as the other atractions folks mentioned.The Omni is clean and quiet and smoothly functioning, almost unreal. We asked for a high floor, they got us onto the 13th, though it didn't quite get over the neighboring highrises (but kudos for having a 13th floor). Not a lot of character to the hotel perhaps, but very very nice.

<Content>Superb service! Booked a 4 star hotel on hotwire and got the OMNI Hotel in the California Plaza (one of two 4* downtown LAX hotels - the other is Hilton Checkers which is excellent too) at a fantastically low rate of under $80/night for the weekend!!! But it turned out my reservation was accidentally booked for March (same days and dates as Feb). At check-in I had basically no reservation but the manager and front desk agent went out of their way to call hotwire and change the dates. Amazingly my reservation was switched with no problem and surcharge at all. The service rendered and received was without question above and beyond what I'd expected esp. with the discounted rate I'd booked the room. In fact the day manager and Lara the front desk agent made me feel very at home and at ease by suggesting that if I was hungry that I could go for lunch in the California Plaza while she was on hold. I was treated with the utmost respect and courtesy while my problem was being resolved.Room 920 was designed for the physically challenged and therefore quite spacious - large door openings and plenty of room to move about. Room very well appointed; large tv; fully stocked mini bar and snacks if you woke up hungry; bathroom very clean with bathsheet towels and the king size bed VERY VERY comfortable!Used the 49 cents/minute computer in the business center to print boarding passes but the very slow connection kept timing out and ended up wasting 11 minutes. But this inconvenience would not deter me from staying at the OMNI again.I love the location as it is close to the Music Center (Dorothy Chandler, Ahmanson and Mark Taper Forum theatres) - the reason for my visit and requirement for a downtown hotel, the Walt Disney Concert Hall, many museums; and very close to Little Tokyo for great authentic and busy Japanese restaurants.However during the nights this business district becomes quite deserted and the homeless aspect is quite prevalent. A complimentary car service is provided within a 3 mile radius which I would have used if I had not already bought a day bus pass.Overall I was more than impressed with the OMNI - superior customer service and a thoroughly pleasant 2 night stay!

<Content>Best service, great location. I stay in LA often on weekend trips. At the last minute I was able to obtain a room through Priceline at the Omni in downtown Los Angeles. What a terrific hotel. Very friendly staff, great location, extremely comfortable bed with a great view of the Disney Concert Hall. I stay at Hilton, Hyatt, and Sheraton often for work and must say the service and ambience at Omni hotels is far superior. The complimentary coffee and newspaper service each morning is a treat. They also have free wireless internet which other high-end chains still charge for. I parked on the street (which on the weekend isn't too difficult if you park on Grand Ave) and avoided the valet wait. What a relaxing and pleasant experience!

<Content>Awesome hotel Wonderful stay at the Omni....the beds were wonderfully comfortable and the room in general was lovely. nice hot water in shower  good water pressure. the location was wonderful and it was easy to get anywhere from the Omni.The bar is very expensive, even for L.A. We ordered a cheese plate and have never seen such small slivers of cheese and so few of them for the cost. All in all though, we'd stay here again and would recommend it.

<Content>Great service, excellent hotel I was looking forward to staying here after hearing such great reviews, but it was even better than expected. The hotel was beautiful and smelled of fresh flowers that were placed throughout the lobby. Staying on the Club level is definitely worth it with beautiful views, oversized rooms and an evening cocktail hour as well as morning breakfast. The service was excellent as the hotel promptly responded to any request I had. When I was craving a chicken sandwich at 1AM, but it wasn't on their Night Owl menu, the chef said it would be no problem to make it. I definitely recommend the Omni!

<Content>Great Place - Location (Enjoyable Stay) The Omni in Los Angeles is nice. The valet service, check-in process, and taking bags to the room worked very well. We had a special deal where we had the room and buffet breakfast in the morning (excellent value.....lots of great things to eat as well as an omelet/egg/pancake bar.). We signed up for the OMNI membership and it was delightful. Juice and coffee (or tea/hot chocolate) delivered to your room in the morning. Turn down service at night.The bathroom was large -included both a tub and a shower and very nice marble; including sound system for the TV (no TV but you could listen to it.)The bar area, Noe Restaurant, and Grand Cafe were all very nice (and nice service).We had a room with a terrific view of the Walt Disney Concert Center - very nice. The place is also right next to MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art) so we were able to enjoy breakfast and then litterally walk a couple of minutes and be at the art museum. Wonderful location! You can walk to the Music Center, Walt Disney Concert Hall, etc.We stayed at the Biltmore, Westin in Downtown LA before = and we were pleasantly surprised how wonderful the OMNI was. Its definitely the best of the 3 if you like pleasant hotels with excellent service.

<Content>Lovely Hotel Wasn't sure what to expect from the sprawling metropolis of LA after reading various reviews so I picked a fairly central hotel in Downtown. The Omni is primarily a business hotel but it was perfect for us road weary road trippers too. Beautifully set out with very helpful staff - the concierge was particularly helpful in answering our queries regarding transport  attractions. This hotel is in a great location for exploring LA, particularly if you don't have a car. As it's in the business district there's not many shops nearby but the underground to all the prime sights is a 5 minute walk away and the area felt a lot safer than much of the city.Bedrooms were expansive and comfy with big roomy bathrooms. Lots of drinks and sweets available from the mini bar - though at a price too rich for us! Morning buffet breakfast (not included in price) was also a treat, fresh made-to-order omlettes and and fuevos rancheros. All in all this felt like a real luxury hotel experience and a great way to finish our California trip.

<Content>Very Pleasantly Surprised I was very pleased with my stay at the LA Omni -- much more so than stays at other Omni properties. I was a guest at the hotel from December 6 - 8, in Room # 923.From my arrival, staff could not have been more efficient and polite. Even walking through the facility on my way to meetings, I was warmly greeted by porters, maids and others.The rooms and public spaces were very clean. The design is nothing fantastic, but neither is it over-the-top or offputting.Room service offered some low calorie options, and the mini-bar is well-stocked. When the batteries on my internet keyboard died, the engineer was dispatched within minutes to replace them.The view from my room was wonderful -- a full-on Disney Hall perspective. Double-glazed windows and solid walls ensured plenty of quiet so I could sleep.Shower water pressure was good, but they should have a shelf in the shower so one can lay their razor and/or toothbrush on it versus having to cram it into the little soap alcove or -- gasp -- leave it on the floor of the shower.Each morning I had a USA Today and an LA Times waiting outside my door...nice. I don't read USA Today so it was great to have something more substantive to read.Wake-up calls are from a real human, not some recorded automaton, and were placed exactly on time.A small bottle of spray starch is in each closet -- a nice extra touch (even if they do charge about $5 for it).I truly enjoyed my stay here and when downtown on business will ensure that I stay at the Omni again.

<Content>Great location for down town Just returned from a 3 night stay at Omni.Great business class/style hotel and great location for down town being next door to Museum of Contemporary Art and across street from Disney Concert Hall. Valet parking at $24 per day seems to be only viable option as couple of lots we tried suggested not leaving our vehichle overnight as not manned 24 hours. (Pershing Sq appears to be a congregating point for homeless people close by at night).

<Content>I'm definitely going back We arrived at the Omni at California Plaza and were impressed. It's a really nice looking hotel and the concierge quickly offered to bring our luggage up to our rooms. For four women, you know we didn't pack light. Excellent guest service. Check in was quick for Halloween weekend. Our room was nice and clean, the size was enough for two girls and all of our stuff. The shower pressure was great, comparable to a waterfall. There is a built in speaker in the bathroom so that you can hear the television. I slept well in the comfortable bed. The cleaning ladies came while I was still asleep and did not stop knocking until I opened the door, that was probably the only negative thing. Yes, the room food is expensive. So it's up to you. There weren't any rowdy guests and that's always a plus. Our first day there, we parked in a lot on the corner behind the hotel since it was cheaper, but ended up walking for about 10 minutes dragging our luggage around downtown. So I suggest using Valet, it's more convenient. I would stay here again because it's a quiet area not far from shopping and nightlife, and the guest service is excellent.

<Content>Mixed feelings Stayed there over a long weekend (Nov 10-13) Was attending a convention at the Convention Center, which is in an absolutely dismal part of downtown, there are only terrible hotels within walking distance ( hotel figueroa, holiday inn) The omni is roughly a mile and a quarter away, but not a bad walk. It really tries to be a first class hotel in terms of services but it fallsa bit short. Example: we asked the concierge about local restaurants, they reccommmended in alvarado by the train station in a touristy area. Ok , the food was terrible and it was a rip off, but thats not why i was pissed. They provided us with a free town car ride to the place, but when we called back, they told us it would be at least 45 minutes to pick us up. I would still of not been mad , except it is very difficult to find cabs in LA, we had to walk over to the train station and only out of providence was there one there. They did apologize and reimbursed us for the cab. I guess my beef is that they should of warned us they might not be able to pick us up instead of putting us in a dangerous situation, and i would of gone to a more touristy area ( chinatown) where they have more cabs. Otherwise the hotel was fine. I guess my real beef is with LA, its just not tourist friendly at all, its too spread out and you definitely need a car

<Content>Eat before you go! I was expecting better, given that this is a top chain, but was disappointed. The room was small, as was the bathroom. The hotel restaurant served typical LA cuisine, which means if you're a red-blooded meat and potatoes type, you'll go hungry. On the plus side, the pressure in the shower was awesome and the room service breakfast was good. The hotel valet staff was very helpful as I needed to navigate downtown to get a few things I had left at home. However, they let Mark Garagos, the attorney who respresented the evil Scott Peterson, park his car there as his office is next door. Seeing him unexpectedly was a little like running into Hitler. Or Satan. Okay, maybe that's a bit dramatic - but it was unsettling. All in all, this Omni wasn't the great hotel I thought it was going to be.

<Content>A little expensive but great ! That's really a great hotel for business men but also for tourits. You're in downtown : so you ' ll see homeless people (but it would be the same in Hollywood !). But you're in the best part of Downtown, and you've nothing to fear. The location is great for visiting LA : you have many highways near...This hotel is luxury : the price for the parking was 24 dollars per day. And the restaurant inside was really not cheap (20 dollars the hamburger !). Even Internet was not free. You have too a pool and laundry service...But the room was great and the service friendly. And as we paid the room only 52 dollars per person, it was a good way to finish our trip ! We just had to eat somewhere else ...

<Author>HotelCriticDude
<Content>Luxury hotel, practical rather than hip Stayed here while attending a conference at L.A. Convention Center. I knew I made the right choice as I stepped into a spacious corner room late at night after a long day of work and flying. Everything looked and smelled new, clean and fresh. The decor and furniture were modern but still traditional at the same time. The bed was very comfortable, I did not have any trouble getting to sleep, nor did I wake up with a sore back. Air conditioning was great. Unlike a previous reviewer, my bathroom did not have separate tub and shower stall, but it was still very spacious and well-appointed. I did not hear any noise from outside or from other rooms, which is exceptional nowadays.The front desk staff I dealt with were professional, yet down-to-earth (not to mention very efficient). The housekeeper left me a thank-you note for the tip I left her one morning. The town-car driver and bell staff were courteous and helpful. I did not have any meals or drinks at the hotel (which I regret), so I can't speak for the food or restaurant/bar service.I did have some minor issues--I experienced low signal strength and could not connect to the free WiFi internet access. I did not have a chance to ask for assistance on this matter, but I trust they would have tried to help out if I did. Also, there was a problem with authorizing my corporate credit card, but that was quickly solved (somehow their mag-strip reader picked up the expiration date incorrectly).The hotel's image is not hip or edgy, but that's OK because I was a tired business traveler that didn't want or need to contend with a staff of trendy, stuck-up actor/actress wannabees. If you want to stay where the stars and other assorted L.A. scenesters party, look in the West Hollywood area or possibly Beverly Hills.All in all, I thought it was a good value for the price paid, and a better choice than the big convention hotels in downtown L.A. (which were actually more expensive) despite being a bit further from the Convention Center.

<Content>Ultra Clean Omni A Friend and I stayed at the Omni in October, for 4 nights. The hotel is very clean and very well kept. I was surprised on how big the room was but even more surprised on how huge the bathroom was. Bathroom had a tub and a seperate shower with good water pressure. Hotel is in the financial district so there was not much to do or eat, concierge did recommend a great chinese restaurant in nearby chinatown and pizza place in the Well fargo building accross the street. Hotel is near a metro, eventhough we rented a car we did take the subway a couple of stops to Hollywood just to avoid the hassle of parking. Parking at the hotel is a bit expensive $25 a night, which would be my only complaint, along with the pool being very small and in shaded side of the building, so just forget about getting sun. Hotel staff was very pleasant, room service was very promt and curteous. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Can't fault it at all! Me  my boyfriend stayed at this hotel for 3 nights at the end of September and can't fault it. The staff were exceptionally helpful  friendly - especially the ones on the door.It was our first time in LA and the concierge was great at recommending tours  how to use the nearby metro - brilliant quick way into Hollywood. All the tour buses pickup from the hotel for free also so you don't really need a car if you're just there for the touristy things.We dined at the hotel cafe for breakfasts, ~$12 for a full cooked breakfast. And had an absolutely exquisite meal one night at 'Noe' - the hotel restaurant, $100, but worth every cent.One tip - join the 'Select Guest' programme on their website. A couple of weeks after joining you get some vouchers in the mail, and one is for a complimentary upgrade. Even though we booked our room cheap through a 3rd party company, there were no questions asked when we requested the upgrade - definitely worth it as the room was huge!

<Content>whirl of a weekend Stayed here to be close to the shopping district. We were right across the street from the Disney Opera House. There weren't many restaurants nearby other than those in the Hotel. Parking is plentiful on the weekend so we bypassed the valet parking. Pool was nice, but small.

<Content>Don't drink the water.... Room was clean and comfortable however, the lack of amenities was disappointing. The pool area was a mess and the gym was being renovated. For the price they could have thrown in a complimentary breakfast as many other hotels/inns do. Watch out for the overpriced snacks and water in the room. Water was 4.75 per bottle plus 15% restocking fee plus tax. The doormen were the only staff who were helpful. Once we signed in the desk staff couldn't have cared less. Parking Alert: If you are staying a weekend you will save lots of money by parking in the public garage next door (where museum attendees park). 8.80 per day compared to 24 at the Omni.

<Content>Don't even think about going anywhere else I'm an Omni select guest, but still everyone once in a while get talked into trying another downtown L/A hotel. Believe me, it's always a mistake when I do. There isn't a single thing about the Omni at Cal Plaza that I would change. Takes the sting out of business trips, even short ones. Never had a bad experience there.. and I've stayed there easily 100 times. Enjoy!

<Content>Great Hotel! I stayed here for one night and was very impressed with the room and the service. My room, which I understand was a standard (i.e., the least expensive class), was tastefully decorated, very roomy, clean and comfortable. The soundproofing was good and I heard no noise from the hallway or other rooms. The in-room climate control system is one of the better ones that I've encountered in a hotel. Usually, you're either roasting or freezing, but the controls in my room allowed me to fine tune the temperature. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was exceptionally large and well-appointed, with a separate shower and bathtub.The buffet breakfast in the hotel's restaurant was delicious and offered a tremendous variety of dishes (fresh fruit, croissants and other pastries, omelets and pancakes cooked to order, bacon, sausage, yogurt, cereal, etc.).Overall, an excellent experience.

<Content>Power Shower If for no other reason, you should stay here for the insane water pressure. Most hotel showers have limited water pressure but this place is insane -- if you're on the skinny side you might want to hold on to something. Shower aside, the Omni is a wonderful place to stay if you have to stay downtown. The staff is quite accomodating and the amenities, while not particularly unique or mind-blowing, are more than sufficient and exactly what one would expect from this sort of establishment. I think there are far better places to stay throughout Los Angeles but if you have to stay in the downtown area this would be a good place. Also, if you're not familiar with LA or this is your first visit, the Omni would be ideally located. It's not within walking distance of anywhere (nothing in LA is within walking distance) and you probably don't want to walk around the area at night but you're a short drive away from just about anything you'd want to see.

<Content>Loved it- Very convienent downtown location. Staff was very helpful and very friendly. Beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and the rooms and bathroom were very spacious. Valet parking was a bit spendy, but all of downtown LA parking is that way. The only thing that would of made it excellent for us would of been a whirlpool/jacuzzi. Otherwise, we were very happy with our stay.

<Content>Happy We stayed at the Omni in downtown LA the last week in May 05. Room was fine, clean, roomy, with a view - if we turned our heads - of Frank Gehry's Disney Center. What was probably the most impressive was the lower-level personnel, maids, bellmen, and the guys working the driveway, all cheerful, friendly, helpful. It was quite striking. The hotel has a car service that's available from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. to take you or pick you up within a 3-mile radius. (That means you can go to Dodger Stadium, for instance.) No reservations, first come first served, but it worked really well. We had a car, but used the service 3 times in 5 days, and was happy with it. The hotel is walking distance of the Disney, Mark Taper Forum and Chandler Pavillion, as well as being almost on top of the contemporary art museum. There aren't a lot of restaurants, particularly for breakfast, nearby, especially on weekends. But we walked down the hill to the Central Market and had a wide range of choices, including great Mexican food. (Used the car service for a return.) If you go to the market, go across the street on the downhill side and see the Bradbury Building, unremarkable outside, but amazing inside. By the way, there are refrigerators in the rooms for the minibar, and they can be used if someone needs to store medications - no need to ask for another. I don't recall the daily parking charge, but it wasn't as much as some previous reviewers said.

<Content>Very nice weekend downtown hotel This is probably the 4th or 5th time we have stayed at the downtown Omni Hotel on South Olive in Los Angeles. We stay there after driving over from Phoenix to attend the LA Opera, and can easily walk to Dorothy Chandler Music Center. Also, the weekend rates are reasonable, about $109.00 before taxes, via a website registration. However there a a $24.00 per night parking charge for guests!The rooms we have had were all large and very pleasant, often with good views. The bathrooms have separate tubs and showers, and excellent toiletries. The closets are spacious and have plenty of hangers. In short, this is a true 4 star hotel, and our only problem was that we requested a king size bed and received two queens on this stay.The lobby entrance is off Olive street on the first floor. The two restaurants, one the high end dinner spot Noe, and the other a full service cafe, are on the third floor, which leads out to Grand Avenue directly adjacent to the Museum of Contemporary Art. This occurs because the hotel is on top of Bunker Hill, so Olive Street is below Grand Avenue at this point.There are a number of downtown restaurants, but usually they are not busy on weekend nights. We often have breakfast at a deligtfully funky (and very inexpensive) spot about a mile and a half away on Figueroa and 9th Street.The hotel is fairly quiet on weekends, except for the occasional wedding or high school prom; but I imagine would be a lot more active during the week since it is in the heart of the Los Angeles high rise business district.We recommend this hotel.

<Author>Where to go nextt
<Content>Comfortable Safe Bet Stayed at the Omni in January 2005 . Excellent spacious and clean rooms.Service standards throughout were excellent ( possibly too much attentionat breakfast ). Parking expensive , though efficient. Location is fine if youhave a car. The area is deserted after 6.30pm  would not be safe to walkaround. Easy access to major freeways a good downtown base .Probably better base for business than leisure. I would use it again .

<Content>A Nice but Quirky Hotel While there are a lot of positives about this hotel, a few things stood out as quirky. First, the window blinds are such that they can't be fully closed at night, so a tremendous amount of light comes in. If your top priority in staying at a hotel is to get a good night's sleep, this is certainly a strange disincentive. Second, the Angel's Flight lounge is rather hard to find and, if I remember right, it closes relatively early (although not as early as the restaurants and lounge at the Biltmore down the hill). Third, there's not much life in the hotel, the lobby seems to be relatively deserted at all hours except for the occasional tourist trying to rent a car. I stayed there three nights, and there was never a point where the hotel seemed to be either crowded or busy. On the positive side, the rooms are a nice size with large bathrooms, extremely clean and well maintained, and there's not much traffic noise from the street below (this hotel is built on top of a downtown hill). I would rather stay here then at the Bonaventure, Hyatt Regency, Biltmore or the New Otani downtown, and I hope to stay there again on a future business trip. However, if you want a quotient of fun in your stay, this may not be the best choice. All in all, this is an above average utilitarian hotel - a trait it seems to share with the Bonaventure and the Otani - which may not be everyone's perfect cup of tea.

<Content>Poor Service I went to the Omni after I read all of the great reviews posted on this site. Personally, the hotel was nice but I thought the service was very poor and rude.The restaurant / bar was nice but again the service was terrible. We waited for 20 mins to get service - and that is only because we went to the Bar 3 times to remind them we were waiting. Each time they kept saying someone was coming...We finally left and ordered room service.Service is everything to me...I will not be going back to the Omni next time I'm in Los Angeles.

<Content>Lovely Hotel (shame about the city!) This was a fantastic hotel - and we must have got a great deal, visiting in mid-April, it wasn't too expensive! All the staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel rooms were nice and roomy, and on the higher floors (14th for us) you can get a really good view across the city. The gym facilities were good with enough machines if you want to work out. The location of the hotel is right in the middle of the financial district, but only about 5 min walk to Pershing Square metro station - so you can easily get to most destinations within the city - apart from Beverley Hills - if you want to go there - you really need a car. The restaurant was lovely, but a bit pricey. Parking at the hotel is $24 per day, but worth it to avoid the hassle of public transport. The only thing that spoilt this trip really was the surrounding districts - Universal City and Hollywood Boulevard are fun to visit, but you need to be wary of pickpockets wherever you go!

<Content>Nice hotel, but downtown is dead at night We stayed at the Omni for two nights this past weekend, and found the rooms to be very nice and the view of California Plaza from our window to be amazing. The staff was nice and helpful, although I wasn't too impressed with the concierge. My only complaint about this hotel is the location; downtown basically shuts down at night, especially on the weekend. We had a hard time finding somewhere to eat within walking distance. Wish I had known about the free towncar service. Next time I'll stay in West Hollywood where all of the restaurants, bars, and people are at night.

<Content>Great hotel; Great service This is oerhaps the beat hotel I have visitied in the United States. 1st class serice from the moment of my arrival until the moment I left.I arrived on Oscar weekend. I thought the hotel would be packed, but there seemed to be plenty of romms available. I booked my room on priceline for $55.00 per night (plus I had a free upgrade coupon to the club floor). There was no mention of my third party reservation.A Metro stop is a block away, which will take you to various area of Los Angeles. Downtown nightlife wasn't important, as I was taking the metro into Hollywood for the Oscar events; plus, it was nice to get away from the insanity of Hollywood.The rooms are well appointed and spacious. The bathrooms were larger than expected and the walk-in shower was wonderful.Not many places to eat, but there is a great market a block away. I think the name was Central Market. I had the BEST Mexican food I have ever eaten - very inexpensive!I highly recommend the hotel, especially at the priceline rate of $55.00 per night (+ tax and fees). If you want an upgrade room, join the Guest Select program, and you will be sent a coupon for a free room upgrade coupon. after making the reservation, call the hotel and advise you have an upgrade coupon. The upgrade will allow access to free Continental Breakfast and afternoon cocktails.

<Content>Great experience :) I was at the Omni for four nights and had a great time. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My major problem was the $24/day parking, which is typical for the area anyway so it couldn't be avoided. It is a good location, a block and a half from the metro and easy access to the freeways. The room was clean and well maintained throughout our stay and I was generally pleased with the hotel as a whole.

<Content>Great one week stay at Omni L.A. I was in L.A. in March 2005 for a one-week convention and stayed at the Omni.Reservation and check-in: Booked the room through AAA, $85 per night. Because of flight delays I arrived at 3 a.m. in the morning. Prompt check-in. Don't forget to pick up an apple at the front desk every day!Room description: End of the hall on the 10th floor. Large floor-to-ceiling window, could be opened for fresh air; overlooked the front of the hotel and Olive Street. The room had king-size bed, small desk with lamp, TV, minibar fridge, coffee maker. Bathroom had tub only (my colleague's room had a bathroom with both tub and shower stall), well stocked with towels and a bathrobe, a swivelling make-up/shaving mirror was mounted on the wall, which was nice to have. Hair blow dryer provided. Telephones on nightstand and in bathroom. Iron and ironing board in closet. Signal for the complementary wireless connection was very good, but the DNS server was spotty and could have rendered the wireless service useless for a layperson. I had to bypass the hotel's DNS server and use the one at my university so that I could use the Internet normally. Housekeeping provided turndown service (pillow fluffing, next day's forecast, ice, and chocolates) around 6:30 p.m. Couldn't find a telephone book in the room. Bottled water provided, but costs $6.75 plus restocking fee per pop. L.A. Times and USA Today delivered to room in the morning.Dining: Had breakfast only once at the hotel's cafe on the third floor. Price is a bit expensive ($17 for full breakfast buffet, I had a big omlette for about $12, I think). Did not eat at the hotel's Noe Restaurant. There are other places to eat nearby the hotel, but most are closed by the evening except the California Pizza Kitchen in the Wells Fargo Center on Grand Ave between 3rd St and 4th St behind the hotel, which stays open until 9 or 10 at night. Another option for dining is the Westin Bonaventure, which is three to four blocks away and has a greater selection of restaurants and fastfood outlets--just don't get lost in the Westin.Transportation: I did not have a car, so can't say anything about the parking. Took the DASH bus on Grand Ave, south bound with one transfer at 5th St to go to the Convention Center; bus fare is only 25 cents! The DASH buses run only during the day, and service north to Little Tokyo, Chinatown, and south to Exposition Park (USC, Olympic Colesium, Science Center, Rose Garden). Walking from the Omni to the Convention Center West Hall/Staples Center took me 30 minutes; taxi ride for the same costs $8. I did not make use of the hotel's Town Car service. On the evening that I left, I asked the front desk to make a reservation for me with SuperShuttle (independent of Omni) to go to LAX. The shuttle was 30 minutes late, and the front desk staff called their dispatcher on my behalf to find out where the driver was.Around the hotel: Felt safe walking in the vicinity of the hotel at night. The Watercourt plaza next to the hotel offers a variety of restaurants and businesses, including the postal service. There is a graphics shop just around the corner of the hotel (printing, binding, etc.), saving a trip to Kinko's seven blocks away. The hotel's business center offers only basic laser printing and fax services, and a fee is charged for these. Museum of Contemporary Art is right next door to the hotel (regrettably I could not understand or appreciate the artwork that was on display).Celebrity sighting: Eric Morlon Bishop, aka Jamie Foxx.Overall I had a great stay at the Omni Los Angeles, and would return again.

<Content>Beautiful View of California Plaza Ask for a corner room to enjoy the view of California Plaza and the Hollywood sign in the distance. Rooms are oversized as is the bathroom. Walking distance to food shops, post office and convenience stores make this a better location than most downtown LA hotels. To the critics of this Omni I say - try staying one night at the Bonaventure before being critical! The Omni LA is very very good......

<Content>Great place to stay! Staff cannot do enough to help you. Serivice is top notch from top management to housekeeping. This is our hotel of choice if we are to do LA again. Walking distance to the Cathedral. Parking is steep but you can find a lot across the hotel for much less.

<Content>Great Hotel - Not a lot around it to do on weekend.... I loved this hotel. The staff was very friendly and overly helpful.The parking was steep @24$a day. The hotel is in downtown and hard to find if not familiar w/the area. Downtown is shut down on weekend. We had a hard time finding much to do around it. But it was a steal @$50 a night on priceline. Ask for a corner room - they are spectacular. Highly recommend.

<Content>All at the Omni The Omni LA Hotel has it all. The hotel is a short walk to the Museum of Contemporary Art which is located in the same complex - California Plaza. A block farther away is the new Disney Concert Hall. Both federal and state courthouses are nearby and a handy hotel area map highlights the local buildings making it easier to get around.. One of the nicest features at the hotel is the use of a Lincoln Town Car and driver o transport guests anywhere within a three mile radius of the hotel - no worries about being lost and a return to the hotel is only a phone call away. I used it repeatedly and was very pleased at this first come/first served service. Within the hotel is a fabulous restaurant - Noe - which describes itself as Progressive American with a Japanese sensibility toward food preparation. The hotel's rooms are very nice with a good size working desk for business and a comfy bed and chair. My oversized bathroom had both a tub and a separate shower in case you are traveling with someone and both need to get ready at the same time. I have stayed at the Omni many times - even back when it as an InterContinental. Omni is better toiday than it has ever been. The only cheap aspect of it is the use of 19 inch televisions in the guest rooms.

<Content>Nice hotel! Very nice hotel. Friendly staff. Free courtesy car for hotel guests (free rides within 3 miles from/to the hotel). Breakfast was little expensive, but had a good selection of food. Spacious room with nice view on Olive Street. Large bathroom with shower and bathtub. Just one recommandation. Never - never have the hotel concierge book a sightseeing tour for you!!! All tours are doublepriced!

<Content>Loved the Omni Stayed her for 3 nights on the 15th October 04 after travelling round all of California, Nevada and Arizona. Could not fault the Hotel at all. the Valet parking was a little on the high price, but if you ask nicley and flutter your eye lashes, they may reduce this for you?? Maybwe we were just lucky. The room was amazing and the bathroom was lovely. espically to have a separate bath and shower. Room service was quick and the Bar Staff were lovely. Loved it here and looking again to return.

<Content>Nice place! Location depends on what you plan to do while you're there. My husband  I were in LA for 4 nights and stayed here our 1st night in LA. The valet parking is $24 with in/out priviledges, self park is $19 -- we did the valet, which was nice after hours of travel to get there. Very nice hotel. We stayed on the top floor and had clubroom priviledges which was very nice -- complimentary drinks 5-8pm, and free breakfast -- the view up top is really nice. We took the Metro to Hollywood Blvd -- to save time and headache with the car -- glad we did. The Metro station is a short walk (2 blocks) -- be sure to have singles for it. The area of the Pershing Metro is not in the safest area when it's dark, so I'd recommend only using it if you're back before dark. The entire staff was very nice, and helpful. I would stay again, but only if we were doing more activites that were located in the downtown area.

<Content>Quiet at Weekends I stayed here for 5 nights and some of the over a weekend in september.. THe hotel was lovely but the 'mini bar' was v expensive!! and we arrived late and there was no where open to eat at all..Around the hotel at weekends there is nothing open but there is a metro station nearby and for $3 you have a day pass and can visit most touristy places.. I would recommend this hotel but definately do your homework before you stay!!!

<Content>Sure recommend it (but be aware  I stayed for one Sat. night with my BF, and I, occasional traveller, say you'll have a present stay at OMNI. My BF, who is a RE developer, also, a frequest traveller, says, High quality  good service. Along with other comments, I'd like to add five things about OMNI. 1, if you go there at night, it's hard to find (do not go thru the tunnel). 2, around the hotel there aren't many homeless so that you can take a little morning walk to check out a Latino market near the hotel; they have eateries, cafes, vegetables  meat shops. On the way back, you can come back in the hotel from 2nd floor where you see other shops (sorry, I can't explain exactly how or where). 3, drinks  snacks in the room are costly (like other hotels), e.g., MM for $4 ($.50 or less at SFWY). 4, there're some fruit you can enjoy, near the front desk,  in the exercise room. Five, if you register for special membership,  want your complimentary drink, let them know, or won't get it. Have a nice trip! Oh, did I mention we paid under $100 with parking ($24)?

<Content>Great service, super clean and well appointed I frequently have to stay in LA for one or two nights at a time - and the OMNI is excellent. Great service, very calm hotel envirement. Super clean rooms, safe and an excellent value. Location very central and the use of the hotel town car for close drops is nice.

<Content>Disappointing hotel, great location Travelling on business, I was booked at the Omni. The hotel itself is rather disappointing; the carpeting is elderly and stained, the bathroom not user-friendly. Separate shower, which is fine, but NO PLACES in the shower to put anything but soap. The public spaces are nice, and the restaurant was quite good, if noisy, but the rooms and the small, concrete-surrounded pool were a disappointment. Location near Disney Hall and Dorothy Chandler great, but if you are walking back to the hotel from a performance at night you can't get back in the Grand Ave. door after 10PM, which means you're walking around, looking for an entrance in the dark with no-one else around. A little disturbing. LA isn't NY, with an active street life, and the area is really dead at 11 PM.

<Content>Great for the rate! My husband, 5 year old son and I stayed here on the evening of 8/14/04. We booked through priceline for the rate of $55 per night so I have to say the price was right. We checked in and they vey nicely accomodated our request for a double room which had a nice view on the 8th floor. The room was a standard business layout. It was nice but not over the top deluxe. It did not have an in room safe.The hotel is well located in downtown and is about a two minute walk to the Disney Concert Hall/Dorothy Chandler/Ahmanson, etc.. It would be ideal for dinner and an evening at the theater concert.We went to Olivera Street for Mexican food on saturday night and ate at Los Golondrinas, a classic but touristy destination. Dinner for the three of us (with a couple Margaritas and tip) was about $60. The little shopping area on Olivera Street is alot of fun, especially for children, with lots of toys for under $5.The pool at the hotel was well heated but did not get direct sun because of all of the tall buildings near by. It is also a small lap pool but was not at all crowded on the weekend. The three of us had the pool to ourselves for pretty much all of Saturday afternoon between 3:30pm to 5:00pm.All in all, Downtown LA is pretty dead on the weekend and if this is your Big Vacation you could well be disappointed. However, if you get it for the right price and have the right expectations it is quite a find.

<Content>Very nice hotel Stayed July 30 thru August 1. Beautiful room for the weekend rate I received. Large bathroom with separate shower. If you join the Omni Hotel Select Guest Club, you receive complimentary morning beverages which we enjoyed. I agree with the previous poster who noted a car in LA is a must, so staying downtown was not much of a problem for us. Would definitely stay here again if I got the same excellent rate.

<Content>Great price- conceirge was a rude I'd stay here again. But the concierge lady and some of the staff were pretty rude (funny- I thought they were there to serve you?)Downtown LA is a ghost town on the weekend (there is more to do in downtown Fresno or Lodi), especially at night. There is only a Burger King, a California pizza place (I don't think they deliver) and a koo koo chicken (?) that was opened after 8:00 PM!!!You can drive or take a cab to Little Tokyo or Olviera Street, which are both really nice and really close. Or I would suggest just bringing in food before you arrive.The rooms were nice and the beds were comfortable. It is close to a museum and the new Disney music hall. And it has a nice courtyard to walk around.There is a shopping center on the property, but it is closed on the weekend.I would definitely go there or any of the 4 star hotels in downtown LA again for the price we paid (60 bucks). In fact, if I stay the weekend again anywhere in LA (including Disneyland) -- I will book a hotel in downtown LA. You think about it: You have to drive in LA anyway. Might as well live the high-life at one of these ritzy (if not empty) hotels.

<Content>nice hotel. thats where the story ends We got a good deal on the internet, and agree that you do get what you pay for. Our first impression on arriving on a Saturday was  this place is deserted and it was.Los Angeles downtown is just that, its downtown, and unless you are there on busienss do not bother going as there is nothing to do.We were without transport and reading various websites etc it advises that there is a good metro link from the hotel etc. Which is true yes there is, if you dont mind the gypseys tramps and thieves.It does not feel safe to walk around at night, and the courtesy car is there if you can catch it but they wont actually offer it to you.We thought for a nice change we would visit china town for some dinner, the sad thing is no body else had the same thought and the place was shut before 9pm.Over the road form the hotel is the california pizza kitchen, this is nice and inexpensive, and after 9.00 its your only choice.Hotel rooms are very nice, pool is small, reception staff are courteous and efficient, if sometimes they give misleading info, and the door staff are pushy hunting their tips.If you could pick the hotel up and puty it in a less dodgy area it would be great.We would not stay downtown again. Its just not worth it unless you are there for business, even the guide books are now saying theres a lot to do downtown....BULL !!!

<Content>convenient but that's all The only reason to stay at this hotel is to be able to walk to the music center for opera and symphony performances. The staff is misinformed about hotel policies, the food is truly awful, and the pool furniture is dirty and broken. The former Intercontinental Hotel had no delusions of grandeur.
