<Content>Motel 6 disguised as a Embassy Suite My friends and I went to NOLA for the Sugar Bowl. We arrived on the 31st and departed on the 3rd. Upon arriving at the hotel it looked very nice and the people were very friendly. When we walked into our room, we were shocked at the condition. Everything was ragged. It was clean, but that is where the good review ended. The TV went in and out and when we called (twice) they said they would fix it, but they never did. On the moring of the Sugar Bowl there was no hot water in fact there was no hot water until that night, after the Sugar Bowl was over. There were three of us in the room (which we paid extra for,) but we were only given 2 towels. We requested towels; they never came. We finally found a cart in the hallway and got towels off of it. They also did not removed the dirty towels after we requested that they do so. The dirty towels were not removed until the 2nd of January ( I guess they figured that since they were not planning on providing hot water there was no need to provide towels.) Breakfast each day was wonderful and the service people were very friendly and helpful.One of the resons the Embassy Suites was choosen was due to the on site parking however, when we started to leave we discovered that the car had been moved to an off site location and it did take about 30 minutes to get it to the hotel. Other people waiting said that they had been waiting for over an hour. As we left the dining area there was a lady complaining that her room had no water at all (she was in the shower when the water cut off with shampoo in her hair; she had taken a cold shower the day before.) As we were talking with her and her husband, a manager came over and apologized for the problems saying that it was due to Katrina, a recurring theme throughout our stay. Every time we called the front desk with a complaint it was blamed on Katrina. While I feel bad for the people of New Orleans that Katrina hit them, it has been 3 years and other places are back up and running and New Orleans has commercials saying they are back. I feel that the city should not advertise that they are back unless they really are back.Embassy Suites is certainly not ready to be back!

<Content>Problems but Great Hotel Staff We booked this room based upon prior reviews and availability/pricing and cancellation policies for the night of the Sugar Bowl (1/2/09). Most hotels in New Orleans were sold out this night with many fans in town for the game. We arrived approximately 12:30 in the afternoon and were told we would not be able to check in until 3PM at the earliest and when standing in line found out that there was no hot water and water pressure was very low in the hotel (under repairs) and had none the night before. We came back and were able to check in approximately 3:10 but were told we had no towels in the room (They arrived within 30 min or so.) There were guests sitting all in the common areas downstairs waiting to check in. We were told this was due to a large number of people who checked out late. Our room (619) was clean but had worn carpeting and a chair with a large tear. It is definately in need of updating. We had a view of the street below from the balcony. We arrived back around midnight and there was hot water so we all took showers before going to bed. This was a good thing because the next morning just as we were checking out there was no water - a sudden outage leaving some guests in the shower with soap and shampoo on them. (Very unhappy guests.) We had the breakfast (included) which offered a good variety and made to order items. There was a buffet area set up with hot foods like eggs, grits, bacon, etc. (I assume due to the large amount of guests.) They were refilling food/drink areas constantly so that seemed to work well. We called for our car and went down to wait with a large number of guests who were also waiting for their cars. This valet service was total chaos. There was no organization at all. We waited approximately 20 minutes and asked (car on the way is what we were told) - another 10 minutes and again told car is on the way. I went into the hotel and requested a refund of my parking which was immediately given. After another 30 minutes or so I confronted the valet manager asking where my vehicle and keys were and was again told rudely that there was someone getting it even though I told her I had heard that for over 50-55 minutes. I had to go in and get a hotel manager involved and requested a refund. My husband went looking through the garage himself (others did the same) and retreived our car which was in the main hotel garage just a couple of levels up. There was no reason our car should not have been retreived within a reasonable amount of time. I requested a refund of our entire stay which was promptly taken care of by the hotel management calling Priceline and requested that my entire amount be refunded. (This was done as I verified it on their website.) There were major problems with this stay, some of which were mechanical failure (not fault of the staff) and some with management issues of another sub contracted company. The staff that I encountered were friendly and helpful even though they were being forced to handle a lot of unhappy guests and problems beyond their control (boiler issues). I would commend the entire front desk staff (especially Rachael) for their attempts to make everyone happy in a bad situation. They were doing the best that they could and handled everyon in a very professional manner. The parking however is lacking in management and I suspect that is is run by Central Parking rather than the hotel as the valets had their uniforms on. The girl who was in charge was terrible and should not be in that position. While I stood there she continued to tell everyone on the phone that it would be 20 minutes to retreive their vehicles when that was obviously not possible. There were other guests standing there saying they had lost their cars and/or their keys and had been there over 1 hours as well and guests who also gave up and retreived their own cars even though the rude girl there kept telling them that they couldn't do so. Their current set up is unable to handle the volume of guests that a large event produces and in New Orleans with so many events and Mardi Gras just a couple of weeks away, if no improvement is made this will continue to be a problem. The hotel is in need of updating and general maintenance seems to be an issue. It is in a good location and very convenient to the RiverWalk, Aquarium and for cruise ship passengers. Hopefully they will take care of the problems as this could be a very nice place to stay considering the quality of the employees.

<Content>nice view of cruise ship We enjoyed our stay in Dec. Breakfast was crowded, ran out of mud bugs for omelets. Still had plenty to eat. We walked to the French quarter in 15 min. Enjoyed beignets at Cafe Du Monde. We could see the NCL Spirit under the bridge from our balcony. Weather changed from 70's to cold wind blowing over night. We walked with our bags 2 short blocks to cruise terminal. Loved it.

<Content>Great stay in NOLA My nearly week long stay for a conference was wonderful. The staff were friendly and helpful. We staying in the non-loft area, the rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable, the balcony was a great touch. The included breakfast was amazing. The food at the Sugar House, connected restaurant was pretty good too. The elevators were a bit slow, as the middle one was broken, but sometimes its okay to have to wait.

<Content>Concierge (Ricky) made it worth the stay! Stay here if only for the wonderful concierge, Ricky. He has expert knowledge of the city and he will go out of his way to make sure you have top notch directions. He is passionate about the city and his enthusiasm is contagious. I was with 3 other women as a part of the hurricane relief efforts; he could tell we were tired and nervous about driving at night, so he made sure we had good directions. Also, they have a great full breakfast. Besides having the best concierge around, this hotel is in a good location. It's walkable to the French Quarter and Canal Street shops, and just a few blocks from the Riverwalk. I'm rating this hotel so highly because of the concierge service, which is better than any I've experienced. Thanks Ricky!

<Content>Service is second class As a Hilton Honors Diamond VIP, I selected 2 bottles of water and snacks for Embassy. The front desk notified me that this was only provided on day of check in, but If I selected free internet service, that was available everyday, so I changed my selection in HH My Way account. That doesn't make sense that one option is for check in only and the other (a $10 per day fee) is free everyday...... Valet parking was confusing and expensive, had to park in a yellow curb zone in front of the hotel to check in, then they had to call the Valet person. A couple of days into my stay, the Valet person told me that we could pull into the Garage to find the Valet desk, even though the outside entrance is marked Exit Only The room was clean, furniture OK. Some of the TV channels faded in and out which was annoying and the remote keys were sticky, like someone had spilled a coke in it. The elevators were slow as molasses, especially on the weekend when everyone was trying to get to the free breakfast before the Saints game. Overall, Below Average for the price.

<Content>Okay, but not the usual Embassy Suites experience I stayed at the Embassy Suites at the New Orleans convention center recently and found the experience rather mediocre. Although the hotel was not one of the official convention hotels for my group, I stayed there anyway, because I've always enjoyed the chain. The upside is that the hotel is only a block and a half from the convention center. The property itself, however, is old, a bit rundown and just not what you expect from an Embassy Suites. The building is obviously an old motel that has been reworked to be an ES. The rooms are small, much smaller than other ES's. Most rooms do have small balconies, which is nice, but most rooms also enter from an outside walkway. In the room I was in the televisions (19) barely worked, the bathroom was so small it was difficult to close the door while inside, and the furnishings were rather beaten up. The standard (good) breakfast is offered, as well as the nightly (all 7 nights) manager's reception with open bar. Perhaps it was just because of multiple conventions in town at the time, but both breakfast and the manager's reception were so crowded it was difficult to get a drink or anything to eat. Overall, the property is worn, tired, and no up to Embassy Suites standards. It is, however, very convenient to the convention center and makes an effort.

<Content>Good location, great staff, but a little tired I recently stayed at the Embassy Suites for a week while working nearby. The hotel is in a great location, just a couple of blocks from the Convention Center and River Walk. The French Quarter is within walking distance but the riverfront streetcar is also a convenient way to get there. The staff at the hotel was excellent. They were always friendly and efficient. The breakfast buffet was plentiful but occasionally crowded (during a convention). The typical manager's reception was held nightly and usually started with a crowd at the bar.I had a king room in the main hotel. It was the standard layout for Embassy Suites. The bed was comfortable and the bath linens were thick and a nice size. The room, however, could use some work. There was an open light box (i.e. hole) in the ceiling above the bed, the bathroom light fixture was not level, and the showerhead was corroded. These are items that could be corrected without a major renovation. The rooms in the main section are convenient. Mine was steps from the elevator. The main entrance and valet parking was near the ground floor elevators.I would stay at this hotel in the future due to the location and staff. Hopefully, some maintenance will be forthcoming.

<Content>Good Ole' New Orleans... We went to New Orleans for my husband's birthday, and got a great deal on pricing at this hotel. The hotel was the norm for a 3 star hotel. It was a basic suite, with a view of the street. Nothing special. The staff was very friendly, they worked with Southwest to get our bags to us in a timely manner, since Southwest had lost our bags. The front desk clerk was very professional in making sure it was delivered to us as soon as possible. The convenience to the French Quarters was not bad at all. I would have to say it was about a 15-20 min walk. I really don't have anything negative to say about the hotel, it was just a nice stay, without all the frills. Our main reason as I stated for staying here was the price was GREAT!!! Would I stay here again, probably not because I would want to be closer to the Quarters. I would say this a great location for wanting to have a good time in the Quarters, however defnitely far enough to sleep peacefully at night without all the noise from partying.

<Content>Good stay for convention. I stayed here for several days during a conference at the New Orleans convention center. The location was great. Two blocks from the front door of the convention center, although you will be at Hall A and its a long way to the other end. It's also a short walk to the French Quarter. The hotel staff was courteous, though I felt they were often short handed. The room was spacious (a suite, of course) and relatively clean. My only complaints are that the carpet was a little dirty and the door the balcony had some very large gaps. Other problems with the hotel were a very slow elevator (my room was on one of the top floors) and horrible breakfast buffet. I have stayed at Embassy Suites in other cities, but for some reason this buffet was a little worse than other stays. Overall, an average stay and probably one of the better options near the convention center.

<Content>This could not be a Hilton! This is a very old property with some rooms having doors to the outside. I can't believe this is a Hilton property. Don't stay here, especially if you are a female traveling alone.

<Content>Downtown Embassy The Embassy Suites were very convenient to the Convention Center. The staff members were not as professional as I am used to but they were not rude.The room was okay. The best thing about the hotel was the breakfast. They offer a FREE breakfast. The omelets were FANTASTIC.

<Content>Not bad but not great I stayed at this hotel about 4-5 years ago and had a great experience, so this time around I didn't think twice about booking this hotel. Although not a bad stay, it wasn't great! The hotel itself is in decent shape. Our patio door handle kept falling off, but oh well. It was the poor service that I was surprised at. From the front desk, to the breakfast attendants, to the bartender - everyone seemed miserable. There were a few exceptions, but it was not the Southern hospitality that I experienced on the last stay. All of the other service people I met in town were fantastic!

<Content>Substandard Version of the ES Experience Having stayed at quite a few Embassy Suites I would rate this hotel near the bottom. While friendly the staff often appeared clueless and in short supply. The hotel showed many instances of deferred maintenance and grime. Management did not honor my Gold membership with an optimal room. The non-smoking room I had in the main buidling had evidence of cigarette usage and the poor insulation allowed lots of street noise in.I did not have a terrible stay, but this Embassy Suites does not come close to the general standards set for the chain.

<Content>A little shaky, but great service Staff was very accomidating considering all the problems we had. We arrived and were not told about some additional per person charges for the guests, the staff was nice enough to waive the fees. We checked into our suite and went our for dinner to a little place one block away. We should have gone to Emeril's, but we decided to go a local nearby spot, what a dissapointment. We returned after taking in some of the sights to MAJOR plumbing problems. The staff said they would move our room immediately (which didnt actually happen until 5 hours later) and when we were packing up our things we found a mouse in our room. The hotel, obviously aware of our displeasure accomomidated us by moving us to a larger suite, free parking, nd they gave us a fruit basket and a bottle of wine, plus a discounted room rate. Over all I was ultimately pleased with the service even if there were a slew of bad luck. The buffet and free happy hour are great for budget travelers, but when you are in New Orleans you should enjoy all the food opportunities presented.

<Content>Comfortable stay Stayed here during Mardi Gras and was quite impressed that even during such a crazy time the hotel staff were attentive to both guest needs and hotel safety. The suites in the Loft property are superb with the sleeping area separated from the living room. Our room had a small refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker. We ordered room service once during one of the Mardi Gras parades and it was prompt and courteous. This is a nice location for Mardi Gras as two parades go right by the hotel. However, this also makes it a bit noisy during that time of year. Once Mardi Gras was over the streets were quiet and so was the hotel.The free breakfast is excellent serving on-the-spot omelettes and other breakfast items.The hotel is within easy walking distance to the convention center and the streets feel safe in to the early evening. The French Quarter is several blocks away.

<Content>What a wonderful surprise!! We randomly chose this hotel after a poor stay at a different hotel and were extremely surprised  impressed. The check in clerk was extremely helpful and courteous and accommodated our request for a quiet room. I'm not sure what the rooms in the main hotel are like but we got a room in the Loft section and it was excellent. Very spacious, everything was clean and new, including the refrigerator and microwave. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were nice and fluffy. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was fantastic and the staff was friendly and helpful. Great location, right down the street from Harrahs - we will definitely be back! Excellent stay!

<Content>good hotel and great convention center location don't believe the 2004 posting as how this hotel is... the staff was very friendly and the rooms were neat, clean and very comfortable.I spent almost a week living in this hotel because of a trade show and i couldn't have been happier. the hotel's valet service was also very accommodating. the breakfast made to order every morning was very fresh and the kitchen staff patient.one other thing worth mentioning, is the concierge. A gentleman named Ricky will go out of your way to find you a restaurant, or something special in the city. Supposedly, he's been voted one of the best in the country - and i can see why. Classy guy,

<Content>Second time is a charm... This was actually our second stay at the Embassy Suites in New Orleans. Our first stay was fine, nothing to rave about. We had been in another hotel the previous night and decided to stay one more night, called the Embassy Suites b/c I wanted a bit of space from the kids! This time we ended up in room 213 which was much larger than the suite we had the first time we stayed there. This room had a lockoff hallway from the other hotel rooms. Upon entering 213, there is a hallway, with the bedroom and bath to the right (vanity separate from tub/toilet area). There is a large separate sitting area in the living area, table with 4 chairs, the sofa bed, a large work desk, and a very large window and door leading out to the balcony. The living area itself seemed as large as the suite we had during our first stay there. We loved it! Each room had a television, of course. I am certain we will want to stay here again when we bring the kids along. I recommend anyone checking in to ask if any of the x13 rooms are available. You will be surprised at the enormous difference it those and the other rooms. The staff was wonderful as well. We were only there for one night, but felt very welcomed by them. The bellhop (I'm sorry I didn't get his name) was great with my kids and apparently sensed that I was about at my wits' end with them...he had them tag along with him to get ice for us and otherwise interacted with them, treating them as guests as well. They loved it. Another New Orleans success. We've had so many over the past few years, we are finding it hard to decide where to stay when we visit!

<Content>The Lofts are Great! I have stayed here several times and would normally give this hotel somewhere between a 3 but the room in the lofts is a 5 and the service is a 3 so i give this a 4!Service at this hotel is always average at best. I wanted something to eat at 10:45 PM and was told it would be well over an hour for ice cream, or any other food for that matter. There seriously must be something not working right. Front desk staff are not the most professional, but passable. As for the room in the Lofts, I am glad I took the room over there. They are very up to date and clean, and much nicer than the rooms in the main hotel. I mean MUCH nicer!Make sure to ask for a room facing the French Quarter. It was absolutely beautiful to look through the shutters in the bathroom and look out to the FQ. It was beautiful whether it was day or nite. The bathroom is quite big and clean. The bedroom is small but nicely deocrated and very clean as well. The couch in the living room is stylish compared to the typical Embassy pull out couch, and the fridge and microwave are new looking and work well with the rest of the room decor. Even though it is not in the main building, don't fret, go over to the lofts!

<Content>Home Suite/Sweet Home I spent 6 nights at the Embassy Suites in New Orleans while attending a meeting and conference at the Convention Center. I was very happy with the hotel. The location is excellent, only two blocks from the north end of the Convention Center. It's on the edge of the Warehouse District but well-lighted and seemed safe enough. I was in the Lofts section which is a separate building from the main hotel. I overhead a gal telling someone else that she refused to stay there since you had to walk throught the parking garage and down a creepy street to get there. Not really. Yes, the route does go out the garage and down the street, but again, well lit and travelled and certainly not creepy. Only a short walk, but rewarding. Room was very nice, something different. Appeared to be an older building that was refurbished -- not your typical long corridors with identical rooms routine. A living room with couch, tv, kitchen are with microwave, small fridge and sink. Separate bedroom. Bath roomy and clean. Many windows to let in natural light. Unique decor, not your typical blah beige. Everything worked well, not much neighbor noise, some street noise although there wasn't a lot of traffic.Breakfast is included and you can either choose the buffet with hot items (scrambled eggs, grits, bacon, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, etc.) or have an omelet made to order. Did not try the latter - grits, scrambled eggs and fresh fruit was fine for me. They also have a happy hour (several hours) in the evening with free drinks - very crowded but a nice touch. The atrium area where these meals are offered is large and spacious. The staff will bend over backwards to help you. They were friendly and wonderful. I hope you will enjoy your stay here as much as I did.

<Content>Good place to be I was recently in New Orleans for a conference and stayed at this hotel. It was very conveniently located to the convention center, only a 2 block walk. The Riverwalk shopping area is the same distance. It is about a mile from the French Quarter and Bourbon Street, but that proved to not be a problem. You probably don't want to make that walk alone at night though. The neighborhood seems perfectly safe by day, but you never know after the sun goes down. I had no problems during the week I was there.The hotel itself was quite nice. I would recommend getting a room in the Lofts if you can. They are in the building next door. The hotel bought it a few years ago and completely renovated everything, so things are newer and nicer over there. You have to walk outside to get there, but you can only get in it with a valid room key, so it's safe. There's even a separate front desk over there. There is no wireless internet access over there, but you can check out an Ethernet cable from the front desk for a deposit, which is refunded when you check out.Being an Embassy Suites it has the free breakfast buffet and the manager's reception. Both were up to par with other Embassy Suites that I've stayed in. The hotel staff was polite and helpful. I didn't check out the pool so I can't comment on that. All in all, I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Excellent Service We stayed at the hotel during the sUGAr Bowl and enjoyed our stay very much. The staff was especially helpful and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. Ricky, the concierge even loaned us his chairs when the reception area got crowded!We would consider staying here again if we were in New Orleans.

<Content>Nice Hotel. I Would Stay Here Again Overall, this was a nice hotel. Good location, as I was able to easily walk to both the casino and the French Quarter. The staff was helpful and friendly, and the complimentary breakfast was very good. The room was spacious and comfortable, although it could have benefited from having a desk, rather than a round table. And, it would have been nice if the bed would have had a washable duvet cover, which seems to be the norm now at nicer places, rather than the typical germ infested blanket. These are somewhat minor points though, as I would stay and the Embassy Suites again if I ever make it back to the Big Easy.

<Content>I loved the Embassy Suites at the Big Easy If you are familiar with the Embassy Suites chain you can expect all things at this location. The staff was great. Our rooms were clean and comfortable. Breakfast and the Manager's Reception were excellent, at this location the give out passes for the number of people in your room. I stayed in the main tower.This location is a long walking distance from Burbon St. It can be walked but if you tire easily I suggest a cab.

<Content>The Never-Ending List of Problems I was visiting New Orleans for a conference and short vacation with my wife and stayed at the Embassy Suites on Julia Street as it seemed to offer excellent value. However, there were good reasons why it looked like a good deal. First the positive...the location is great for access to the convention center...Now the problems...On the first night we were on the 5th floor of the loft, which is a separate building behind the hotel. The first thing we noticed walking into the room was a cockroach sitting on the table. The room decorations in the loft have an industrial feel with unpainted exterior walls, as it is a converted factory/warehouse, which is fine if you like that sort of thing. We also had two double beds instead of the requested King, the elevator shaft was right by the bed, making noise all night and the hotel staff was unwilling and/or unable to move us. The next morning the toilet blocked and the alarm clock radio volume switch didn't work.We were moved to a new room the next day. While this one had a king bed and was in the main hotel, there was a noisy electrical transformer in the corridor closet behind the bed. The toilet blocked again, but flooded the bathroom this time, meaning we needed replacement towels that took a while to arrive. Then the towel bar broke. We were also unable to change the time setting on the alarm clock so had to remember it was always an hour behind.Finally, when we returned on our final day after touring the French Quarter, we found ourselves locked out of the room. We had been told we had checked out already!!! After showing our ID and having spoken with the senior receptionist, we were eventually let back into our room. Luckily our belongings were still there...We don't know if these types of problems are common in New Orleans, but they certainly should not be common at Embassy Suites. Our advice if you choose to stay here is not to expect the usual high standards and come prepared to deal with problems.

<Content>Enjoyed The Stay My friends and I stayed at this propery from July 5-8, 2007. It was a busy ESSENCE FESTIVAL weekend so I expected some delays. The hotel was packed so checking into the accomodations were the worst. It took over an hour. When we reserved our room we requested a 2BR Suite that supposedly had two double beds in each room and a pull out queen sized sofa in the luxurious TV room. Well once we got to the room we were very disappointed when we saw a King size in each room instead of our diligent request. It was five of us on vacation and upon reserving directly with the hotel we explained that none of us wanted to share a bed. They guaranteed (5 beds) something that did not even exist in the entire hotel. Truly not worth the $450 a night charge. They gave us a roll a way bed to compliment us but we used that to cover the large stains and the huge dip in the middle of the luxurious TV room. The drapes in my bedroom were hanging from it's supposed position; none of the lamps worked; the radio didn't work. Staff tried their best to accomodate us, but this is such a busy weekend that all of the rooms were taken. Atleast this is what was told to us.Some of the good points about thisproperty is the staff they are so friendly and are willing to help at a moments notice. The breakfast was delicious and the social hour with free drinks were a definite plus. Location was excellent for the superdome but if you are interested in Bourbon street then it is a little out of the way. If asked would I stay here again I would probably say yes!!! I just wouldn't spend the extra for the 2 room suite because it is a gimmick!!!!

<Content>Nice staff, but a few concerns with the facilities This hotel boasts a staff that was consistently pleasant throughout my stay. Check-in personnel, housekeeping and wait staff were prompt and courteous, as was the maintenance man who could not fix the AC.Ah yes, the maintenance man. Not a term you want to hear when at a hotel. My first room was in a secluded corridor that held three rooms behind a door off the main hallway. It was not a safe layout for someone traveling alone. In this case, there was also no functioning AC...in New Orleans...in July! Somewhat odd to be assigned to a room that had a pretty obvious problem, but after a long intervention and conversation with the friendly maintenance chap, I was promptly moved upon his call to the front desk to a different room with AC.The new room was outside the regular hotel, but was of moderate size and had a lovely balcony. All fixtures worked and toiletries were of reasonable quality. It is important to note that this particular Embassy Suites has many regular rooms and few suites. I was here on business, so location was not a great concern; however, the location is not ideal if you desire to be amidst the decadent sights of the French Quarter. The hotel is roughly a half mile from mall shopping and a mile to the Quarter or Market. Cabs are quite reasonable though, so it is a very minor inconvenience. They have a very handy little check-out kiosk in the lobby where you can leave your key, get a print-out of your receipt for the hotel and even print your boarding pass.

<Content>Good but tired Close to the convention center, walking distance from French Quarter. Rooms need rejuvenation. A faux suite with a couch and an empty minifridge. Very dark if you're on the courtyard side. Thermostats which seem to work only on ON or OFF position. Wireless is slow but works. Small round table to work on, not ideal.

<Content>Good Deal...but, Good Deal, but not the greatest. The hotel is very nice from the outside and lobby. The rooms however, need a little work. I stayed in the main building at the Emabssy Suites. My room was clean and very unique. I was on the 16th floor and could only access the room from a balcone walkway. I felt like a motel. The room was hard to describe. It reminded me of an apartment I had while in college. Stucco walls little artwork. It wasn't bad, just not what I expected. However, I loved the fact there was a ceiling fan in the bedroom. One problem... I could never connect to the internet. I called the front desk and they sent someone up. He couldn't have cared less. Needless to say, I was without internet the entire trip. On the otherhand, room service was great! Location is a little walk to the quarter and the casino. During a Louisiana summer, I would opt for a cab to the quarter.

<Content>Great place to stay with the family We stayed for four nights and were very pleased with the room, service, and amenities. Our room was spacious and clean; the breakfast delicious and ample; the pool and hottub clean and refreshing. Service was excellent and beat most places I've ever stayed in New Orleans.

<Content>not up to embassy suites standards The rooms in this Embassy Suites hotel are not up to normal standards. We were originally assigned a room in the main hotel. The room was an old run down room without a wetbar. The bellhop was very nice and told us that the rooms in the Loft were nicer. We were able to change. These were much better. The rooms were interesting with some of the brick walls exposed. Decor was nice and furniture was fairly new but upholstery had been spilled on and wallpaper in bathroom was peeling. Rooms and bath looked clean. No mold in shower. Bed was very comfortable. Low shower head and normal shower rod. Breakfast and the manager's reception were better than most of the other Embassy Suites we have stayed at. The Loft is in a separate building and you have to go outside to get to the main lobby and dining areas. Valet parking only and it was slow at times. No carts available for luggage unless with bellhop. It took a while for them to come for our luggage on checkout. Staff were all very pleasant. We normally stay at Hampton Inn, Fairfield Inn, Embassy Suites, Marriot, Holiday Inn Express.

<Content>Great Stay!!! We stayed 2 nights pre cruise and 1 night post cruise. The 1st stay we were in the main Hotel. We had a very nice suite with 2 double beds. The room was very clean and had a balcony overlooking Julia St.,the Convention Center and part of Riverwalk. We could see the top of our ship also on Sunday Morning. The front desk personel and all the other hotel personel were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was really great, the best Omelett I've had in a long time. You pick your own fillings. They had French Toast made from French Bread...Yum The second stay we were in the Lofts. They are very nice and also very clean The down side of staying in the Lofts is if the weather is bad, all the amenties are in the main hotel. Valet Parking is $26.00 a day and Internet is $9.95 a day.We walked to the Cruise Terminal and it took about 15 minutes we had luggagge on wheels( 6 cases) and it was a easy walk. There were 3 of us. I highly recommand The Embassy Suites.

<Content>Good deal Stayed here for work in March 2007. We paid a govt rate of $130/night, which as usual includes breakfast  happy hour. I was impressed w/the hotel; it's sparkling clean, new, and the rooms are really comfortable. The staff couldn't be friendlier and the breakfast is plentiful -- a little too plentiful w/all that food around!The area's a little remote from Bourbon St, but cabs are plentiful and the walk isn't bad if you need to stroll off dinner. The area's a little desolate w/local businesses closed after Katrina. Did not need the parking so cannot speak to rates. It's a great hotel if you need room to spread out.

<Content>Extremely Happy - good experience. Have just returned after staying in New Orleans for Mardi Gras. Have stayed at Embassy Suites before (i.e. New York, Philadelphia) so had a good idea of what to expect with the room etc so no big surprises there - small suite very clean - very happy. The main problem you can have when staying with a 'chain' in different places is that they can all look the same and you wouldn't know which city you were actually in - but this one is different. The atrium was just amazing - we loved the mural and the atmosphere it created - you knew you were in New Orleans alright!.My only reservation about booking this hotel again - if I were lucky enough to visit again - is that it is a good 25 minute walk into the French Quarter. A long way if you want to do it twice a day! Otherwise go ahead and book the hotel - I think they did an amazing job.

<Content>Be Careful Worst stay ever. I do a lot of travel and this is by far the worse hotel I have stayed at. Nothing worked including phone, internet etc. I ordered room service and when I called 1.5 hours later they said for me to come down and get it. Then were nice enough to tell me that they would waive the room service charge sicne I had to come get it. The only good thing about this place is the location. The manager was very short and seemed not to care.

<Content>I switched Hotels after one night I do a fair amount of business travel each year so I have developed a standard. This hotel has a very nice central interrior and the staff is extremely helpful. Maybe I got unlucky, but after switching rooms twice due to the smell of the room and other unatractive characteristics, I decided to leave the property all together.The hotel is located far from the french quarter which also contributed to my decision to switch.Although the bar is nice and the breakfast, the one day I did stay, was excellent, I've become accustomed to a higher standard and comfort from my room.

<Content>Great experience! We just returned from a stay at the New Orleans Embassy Suites, August 3, 2006. We were pleasantly surprised to hear they had no damage during last years storms. Our room had a king bed with a sofa bed for our teen son, which was more than adequate. A gift bag with two bottles of water and a candy bar was on the table when we checked in. The concierge was most helpful with advice on how to walk to the restaurants we chose. The happy hour was enjoyable with typical bar snacks. The dining area is beautiful with painted murals and 3-D type figures on the walls. Great included breakfast - cooked to order or an express lane. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>If you want a great stay, stay here!! Three weeks earlier I stayed at Le Pavillon and was not pleased. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Embassy. The staff is friendly, the common areas and rooms were clean, the made to order continental breakfast offers much more than the cold cereal at other hotels, and the complimentary happy hour was a nice way to wind down at the end of the day (try the daiquiris). It is a short walk to the french quarter, casino, Riverwalk, and streetcar; just far enough from everything to be nice and quiet. I will be returning to New Orleans again in 2 weeks as I try to reestablish my life there and I will be staying here again.P.S. In The Sugar House restaurant the pizza is good, the buffet only so-so.

<Content>Perfect for this trip Despite struggling to properly staff up in these post Katrina days, this property did a great job when we were there over President's Weekend. The location is ideal for visitors going to the convention center, and not a bad walk from the French Quarter, but a bit sheltered from that action. Since we were also in town to visit family that live in Uptown it was a nice central location.The facility was clean, staff was friendly and very helpful, and breakfast delicious. They were only offering maid service every third day-but that's all I get at home anyways.

<Content>We were impressed! A feel of home! An excellent property. Very close to the Riverwalk but a distance (but walkable) to Bourbon St. I would have ranked it higher but the food quality and in how it was served could have been better. My family an I stayed on the loft side. The rooms are clean, large, and exteremely impressive. We enjoyed our balcony as well (not a view) but the fact of having one w/o an upgraded rate.The staff was nice and very professional.

<Content>Affordable and nice Stayed at the Embassy while at a convention. Two blocks from the convention center. Long walk from other site, french quarter, etc. Good breakfast, free drinks at happy hour!! Moved us when accidentally place in smelly smoking room without a problem. Nice rooms. Would stay there again if at convention. Bit of a walk from the action EXCEPT one block from Emerils, best dinner I have had in years.

<Content>Loved it The Embassy Suites was awesome. I stayed in the Lofts in June. The rate was excellent and the room was perfect (clean  quiet). The breakfast was really good, too. Everyone was friendly.The only thing I didn't like was the walk to the French Quarter. But that is what taxis are for.

<Content>Stay The Lofts We just got back from staying at the Embassy Suites and it was great. After a check-in SNAFU, they moved us to their adjacent building called The Lofts. It was much better and more newly renovated than the main building. It was in an old Sugar refinery/factory and the original brick walls line the exterior of the rooms there. The room was huge and even had a conference table which worked out great for some meals we brought back to the room. We stayed with our 2 yr old, 1 yr old, and in-laws and there was plenty of room! Recommendations: Eat at Emeril's Delmonico -- it was fantastic, even though it was pricey. If you have kids, take them on the boat cruise to the zoo leaving from the Aquarium every 2 hours. If you have time and want to do something very New Orleans and also FREEE -- take a trolley car (cheap and good people watching) to City Park (the lsat stop) and take a stroll through the Sculpture garden. It was beautiful weather and a great experience! If you do stay at the Lofts, stil go to the breakfast and manager's reception next door for more selection. However, there is a completely duplicate one at the Lofts if you want a smaller crowd or faster service, depending on the time of day. Definitely recommend this hotel - enjoy NOLA!

<Content>The Lofts are fantastic One reviewer complained that his room at the LOFTS was small, but I got a suite which was very nice. It was much cooler than the typical Embassy Suites. The room was decorated with lots of color and modern style. The brick wall in the bedroom was beautiful. The room was a bit dirty but not bad. The breakfast and complimentary cocktails are below average but since they are free, there is nothing to complain about. Most of the staff were helpful and friendly. The workout room was tiny and very stuffy so I ran outside instead. Good location -- several trendy restaurants nearby.

<Content>Christmas at the Embassy Suites We were looking for a pre-cruise hotel in New Orleans. With a family of five, I was looking for a place that could sleep all of us, was close to both the pier and within walking distance to the French Quarter. We had a large group of twenty and I needed 5 rooms. A quick phone call to the group reservations department and I was quoted a rate of $89 per room for four with an additional $10 for the fifth person. This included a made to order breakfast and happy hour cocktails in the evening. We arrived Christmas Eve to the coldest weather New Orleans had seen in almost 20 years. We met up with my Brother in Law and his family and the nine of us walked to the French Quarter. We could have taken a taxi or walked two blocks down and taken the streetcar but since we were idiots we walked. Temps were in the mid thirties and it was windy. Had dinner at Embers Steakhouse on Bourbon and St. Peters. Dinner was good but pricey for the quality. The Embassy Suites is a very nice looking hotel and unbeatable for the price. It has a bar and resturant on the bottom level and a very large open space where the breakfast is served. This is no ordinary continental breakfast- this was a big buffet with a special made to order egg cooking area. Hot beverages, cold juices, fruit salad, whole fruit, bagels, pastries, cereal were also offered. We were looking for a place for Christmas Dinner and since the last of our party was to come in at 6:00, we decided to eat at the special Christmas buffet right at Embassy Suites. Unfortunately, the rest of our group could not fly in on Christmas Day due to the weather. It snowed in New Orleans (!) We changed our reservation from 20 to 9 and somehow it was lost. After apologizing again and again, the resturant manager offered to comp us our meal - all nine of us! Seven of us ate from the buffet and 2 ate from the regular menu. All of us enjoyed the food. The next day we asked for and were granted a late check out time of 1:30 so we were able to enjoy the day a little before boarding our ship. We walked down two blocks and caught the streetcar and rode down to Jackson Square. When we came back we walked up to the hotel, grabbed our bags and rolled them 3 blocks down to the pier and boarded our ship. I would stay there again!

<Content>Okay hotel Stayed at the Embassy Suites New Years Eve. It's an older hotel but it has its perks. The complimentary breakfast was WONDERFUL! Stayed there with two friends. The pull out sofa was a bit lumpy and the room wasn't as jazzy as other Embassy Suites I've seen. The parking garage was full our entire stay, so were others in the area. Parking was awful. Keep in mind it was New Years Eve so maybe it was only like that because of the holiday. Go figure... We didn't know that there were two buildings to the hotel, one being a modernized refurbished loft building. We visited others who stayed there and there room was gorgeous!!!! Hint: Ask about it (The Lofts) when making reservations or at check in. Location of hotel is unbeatable. Walking distance to great spots (Riverwalk Mall, Harrah's Casino, Emerils' Restaurant.)

<Content>Great with Kids Overall, we enjoyed our stay. Although we were initially given a room which was occupied, the staff was very apologetic and quickly got us situated. Although some of the hotel is worn around the edges, our room was updated, very clean are well designed especially if you're travelling with childeren. The location is also good for kids--the Louisiana Children's Museum is across the street and the Riverwalk is a couple of blocks away. The gym is quite limited. The breakfast and managers special were pretty good. At $80/night it was a great bargain.

<Content>Great Mardi Gras Hotel This hotel is on the parade route for two of the super krewe parades for Mardi Gras! A great location to walk to the other parades on St. Charles street. The hotel has a free full/cooked to order breakfast every morning. The staff is very kind and helpful. We will always stay here during Mardi Gras. The rooms are huge and clean.Come for Mardi Gras and catch lots of beads from your balconey!

<Content>was this the same place?? Wholeheartedly agree with the last reviewer. My wife and I and two friends stayed here for four nights at the end of October. the rooms were fine and --as suites-- not claustrophobic. The staff were uniformly attentive and courteous. A few odds and ends were a bit off (a towel rack in our bathroom was loose) but nothing that would ruin our experience. As I learned on a previous visit, this is a great (and quiet) location if you don't want to be in the quarter or the business district but close to lots of activities. (E.g., we could walk back and forth to Frenchman Street with little effort, we were two blocks from Emerils; and the Riverfront Trolley ends about three blocks south.)Agree with the earlier comment about the parking costs--the one thing out of line with what was otherwise a bargain.

<Content>love the embassy i dont want to sound childish, but some of these people complaining are a bunch of nit picky whiners. we have stayed at this embassy 4 years in a row and we will continue going there. we've always been treated courtesly by the staff and our room has always been clean. you're on vacation, relax! you dont have to search the carpet for every piece of lint. we had beautiful rooms, never any problems. breakfast was wonderful! very convenient location. within walking distance to shopping and attractions. the only thing i would have a complaint about is something that the hotel really doesnt have any control over and that is the outrageous valet parking prices. we love this hotel and we highly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to be in the center of the action. all embassy's offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. in other words, if you are not satisfied, you are not expected to pay. there is a good chance some of these people got their money back or the staff made it right and they still wanted to complain. there is plenty of time for anal retentiveness at home. you're on vacation dont be so uptight. this embassy rocks.

<Content>Very disappointed Dirty and Elevators didn't work.We arrived at the Embasy Suites in NO on 6/23/04 and stayed until 6/27/04. Very disappointed. Our room was given to someone else only knew this when we tried to access our room and the key wouldn't work. Back downstairs and was given a new room and supposedly to receive a courtesey basket which we never received. Luggage arrived at our room 1 hour and 15 minutes later after a call to the front desk.Room was only vaccumed one time and the bathtub was very dirty on the side, and never received clean glasses. They were just wiped out and cardboard lids put on. How sanitary is this?? A very strong odor of sewer gas on Sunday in our room and in the lobby. I'm not sure if we will stay at a Embassy Suite again.

<Content>Dirty This was the worst Embassy Suites Hotel that I ever stayed at. The rooms were dirty, the carpet was filthy and when I went to take a shower I could not believe that the shower liner had dried blood stains on it. I called housekeeping and they put up another one that was clean, but after that I was very upset and did not want my kids to touch anything. The other Hotels were all booked because it was the NWB finals. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Not the Greatest As far as hotel rooms are concerned this was ok, although a little small by Embassy Suites standards but comfortable. The housekeeping staff was very intrusive and careless. Entered the room while wife was in bathroom, rang telephone to see when they could clean the room, knocked on the door to try to clean--all of this with the PRIVACY PLEASE tag hanging from the doorknob. One day they left one washcloth for two people. Next day left one bath towel for two people. Before we left for New Orleans I called to ask if they had laundry facilities in the hotel as we were staying 7 days, the reservations clerk just said no. When we arrived we asked the desk clerk where there was a laundromat located, just said didn't know. Asked a shop clerk the same question, same answer. Finally asked a very friendly bell captain the same question and he informed us that ES has an agreement with the Marriott Courtyard right across the street to use their facilities, which we did. Some people just try harder.
