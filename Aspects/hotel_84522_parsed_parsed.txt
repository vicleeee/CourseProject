<Content>Nice Getaway Hotel Angeleno was a very nice place to stay for a few days. The room was a little small but comfortable. Beds were above average. Great pool area to relax around- there is a fireplace on at night as well. Hotel did not seem very crowded or noisy. Traffic noise was not an issue as some reviews said. Only drawback- $18 for valet parking- I like having a choice of valet or self-park. But otherwise, very enjoyable. Good location- about 10 minutes from Beverly Hills and Westside, and 10 minutes to the Valley. We went out to Malibu one day- only about 25 minutes. Got a great price with Priceline.

<Content>I loved the Hotel Angeleno! I just came home from LA where I stayed at the Hotel Angeleno in Brentwood. My husband and I enjoyed the pool area, which is very tranquil and were able to get in our workouts as well in their workout room. The restaurant was fantastic with great service to boot. Overall, we were very comfortable there and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I will go back the next time I am in LA.

<Content>nice hotel but horrible road noise The hotel is located right next to I-405. It looks better inside then outside. The rooms are very small but nicely furnished and clean. Service is good and friendly, but as typical for LA you are better of if you speak some Spanish. Room service menu is standard but food quality was very good. I didn't visit the Restaurant.If you do business at UCLA, you can take the bus (302 or 2) from the hotel leaves about every 15 min and takes about 15 minutes. Only problem is that you have to cross two busy roads to get to the bus station. On the way back, the bus will drop you off right at the hotel. (only one road to cross).My main issue is the road noise. My room was facing 405 and the road noise was very bad at times of day/night. The balcony they advertise is not usable. The in-wall air conditioner doesn't help. Luckily I didn't have to use it. But it is louder then the road noise (someone suggested to use it to drown out the road noise).There is essentially nothing within walking distance. Some stores about a 15 minute walk along a busy road with partial sidewalk. Bus #2/302 is your friend again.Cab ride to/from airport is approx. $40, Shuttle bus $20. Local bus rides are $1.25 (exact change needed).

<Content>Good for what we wanted This was our 3rd and last stay in our tour of California. The service was fine and the bar at the top floor was brilliant. Me and my mates quiet happily went for some nice drinks and A*** food most nights. The location was a bit annoyly so only go there if your hiring a car. Vallet parking was efficient and worked well. Pool area was classy and modern, sometimes you seemed a bit too enclosed though. But it's not supposed to be a 2 weeks beach holiday resort. It was great. Not perfect.

<Content>Great hotel Loved this hotel. Very modern and funky. We got offered an upgrade on check in鈥?for an additional $20 per night we got a King bed and walk in shower (rather than 2 queens and a shower in a bath)- would deff recommend these upgraded rooms. Valet parking only and at $18 per night, not too bad. Hotel is appx 10 miles from airport- no idea on how much a cab would have been as we had a hire car. Rooms are quite small but fine for a few nights.Staff were all great, hotel was a good location for driving around if you have a car. We didn鈥檛 eat in the restaurant- the view must be amazing but we had room service late one night and it was about $48 for 2 burgers inc tax etc. I didn鈥檛 think that was too pricey esp as its LA and delivered to the room. Portions were big too. Cool area round the pool, tho small it had plenty of soft seating and loungers. At night, they light a fire out there and it was cool to just chill by the fire with a glass of wine!Air con units in room (like many hotels) too noisy to have on at night but room stayed reasonably cool overnight and we were there when it was about 33 degrees in the day. There is freeway noise and our king room was right on the 405 but we were so tired on an 8 hour time difference that it didn鈥檛 bother us.Went to Santa Monica pier one night- stay away from Bubba Gumps- food order wrong, mains came out literally 3 mins after starters and rude staff when I asked them, nicely to take the mains back and keep them warm. Very busy and I think they were just trying to get people in and out as quickly as they could鈥︹€?.but no excuse for rudeness of waiter.

<Content>Good for One Night Stays, Shame About the Location We stayed here for two nights in August, at the end of a much larger tour.The staff were very helpful, rooms small but adequate, beds comfortable. The hotel is located in a really good area, however, it is a real shame that the hotel is right next to the freeway, and although the windows do stop most of the noise, there is no escaping from the slight hum of the traffic. It is well located for visiting the Getty Centre, which is great, but there are no coffee shops or restaurants within walking distance, so a car is essential, or you would be trapped into eating in the hotel which is a bit expensive.On the whole, we wouldn't stay here again, really due to the location, probably great if you are on a business trip, but not great for a holiday.

<Content>Relaxing and comfortable I joined friends who were staying in LA at this hotel and we were there for five nights. After very busy days touring and shopping, it was always a pleasure to come back to this hotel and relax and unwind before going out in the evening. My room was cleaned every day and fresh towels and sheets provided. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The restaurant on the 17th floor was especially nice and a real treat. The location was excellent as well and we seemed to be central to all the sites we wanted to visit. I would definitely return to stay here and would recommend it to others.

<Content>Clean, Modern, Simple.. Hotel Angeleno is a decent hotel. I had the opportunity to stay here for one evening and although the rooms aren't that big, they are big enough for two people to rest comfortably. The hotel is pretty clean and has decent, contemporary interior design. They also have a small pool (but no jacuzzi) and a hotel sized gym. I would definitely recommend requesting a room that's not facing the freeway! The housekeeping staff, valet and bellboys were incredibly warm and went out of their way to be hospitable. They seemed to hold the place together and their service was A+Strangely enough, it was the front desk staff that was very lukewarm in their service and attitude. When I arrived the girl overseeing the front desk was in the back hanging out and seemed annoyed when I sent someone to get her so we could check in. This was the general attitude of the front desk, and throughout my stay I noticed from my interactions that they only cared to do the bare minimum to help their guests. Maybe they were just having a bad day but they could certainly take some pointers from the service staff. Overall, Hotel Angeleno is a decent hotel and they would get 4 stars if I had a better experience with the front desk.

<Content>friendly helpful staff The first thing we noticed was how easy it was to find the hotel - it was so easy to spot from the freeway, which after long day in Universal Studios and driving back in the dark was a major bonus! The staff could not have been more helpful every where we went they, without being asked, printed off maps and gave advice about places to eat, drink and hang out - even where to get the best views. The rooms were not a disappointment and the beds extremely comfortable, I would also recommend the top floor restaurant - the food was great and the view amazing. For anyone wanting an easy to use base with helpful staff we would thoroughly recommend this hotel.

<Content>A hip Holiday Inn? This is an odd hotel, seemingly trying to be more then it is. If I was 25 to 30 I probably would think this is a fab hotel, but I'm not. In fact it should really should say, if you're under 30 and have a few dollars you'll love us, but if your 30 plus you might want to look further.It isn't that the hotel isn't hip, it is. But it is noisy (I stayed on the freeway side), the rooms are small yet stylish, and the restaurant on the 17th floor with Jazz music and decent food does have a great view (but the service is immature). It isn't that they don't care, but are too inexperienced to know better. Maybe, I'm a little too old for this one, and a little too familiar with LA to buy into the vibe. I just expect a little more from a boutique hotel, and maybe that is it. The Angeleno is a Hip Holiday Inn.

<Content>Adequate Angeleno I stayed at the Angeleno for one night because I had a meeting nearby. My first impression, even though I knew roughly where it was, is that the hotel is so close to the 405 freeway.The hotel is kind of hip and kind of well decorated. The room is small and doesn't actually have a closet. There's a small cupboard/armiore that contains a small space for your clothes and the ironing board and iron. The TV is on the dresser/desk as someone earlier wrote about. Breakfast in West, the hotel's restaurant was just fine, no complaints. My stay was very short and was for business. I would never go back for any kind of leisure travel because of the hotels location and small rooms. Also, there's no place to walk nearby (for coffee, etc). If you have a reason to stay overnight near UCLA or nearby its just fine. There's no way to escape the dull roar of the freeway below even with what appear to be new soundproof windows.

<Content>Not So Hot on this Hot List Hotel The Hotel Angeleno promotes that it was on the 2007 Conde Nast Traveler Hot List of new hotels - I don't know why editors selected this spot. Granted, the hotel is nicely decorated - it has a very hip, chic appeal that is very appropriate for it's location. But when it comes to service - this hotel is not so hot.When we checked in, we were told we would get upgraded - we found out this was from a standard room that was noisy to a standard room that wasn't noisy. The hotel's convenient location next to the 405 is great for commuting to business meetings but apparently bad if you get stuck on the noisy side of the hotel.My room key didn't work and it took three trips to the front desk to resolve the issue. The front desk team was very nice but they did not do anything to address my inconvenience. The next morning they forgot my wake up call and I had to call my breakfast appointment to move it back by an hour. Then, on my last morning, it took an hour to get oatmeal and berries when I was told it woul take a half hour. When I called to check on my order, the person on the phone said they forgot. The only redeeming qualities that will make me reconsieder another visit to this hotel are 1) it's convenient access to the 405 2) the comfortable beds 3) and service at West, the hotel restaurant. The food was exceptional but the wait staff was engaging and fun to be around. They picked us up after a busy morning of meetings.I heard a lot of I'm sorry comments at the Hotel Angeleno. I would have preferred to have been asked what they could do to make my stay more enjoyable. In the long run, the service was just not so hot.

<Content>would not recommend We stayed here for a wedding and were disappointed with several things given the high price of the hotel and the way they advertise their 'luxury amenities.'--The room was very small (e.g. the closet could fit about 4 things, and the TV was placed on top of the desk, partially obstructing the mirror). --The bed sheets were ripped and extremely thin. --Housekeeping failed to come one day during our stay.--Housekeeping knocked on our door at 9 am one day when we had the 'privacy please' sign on our door, wanting to know when we were checking out. --They charged us for items from the mini bar which we never used (although they did remove the charges when we questioned them, it was a hassle).--We made a reservation for the shuttle bus once, and the driver threatened to leave without us when one person in our party was 3 minutes late.--There were cigarette butt holes in the couches by the pool.We will choose to stay elsewhere next time.

<Content>Fabulous experience! We had the Hotel Angeleno chosen for us by Hotwire.com so I was a little worried about what we'd end up getting for our anonymous bargain rate. My concerns were heightened after reading some of the reviews here on Trip Advisor.I must say, though, that the people who were complaining either didn't know what they were talking about or their concerns were noted by the hotel and addressed/resolved before we got there.The great:* hotel is very conveniently located right off the 405. This was our first trip to LA so we wanted to hit lots of the tourist spots - nothing was more than half an hour away, factoring in the horrible LA traffic (which wasn't really so bad).* check-in and checkout were a breeze and the hotel staff were all very friendly* Contrary to a previous poster's opinion, we were not harassed about taking any tours that the hotel was hawking. They did mention it upon check-in and then once more when we were lounging in the hotel lobby, but it wasn't high-pressure.* Uur room was beautiful and roomy* Our room faced the interstate but the traffic noise wasn't very loud at all. We opened the balondy door and were overwhelmed with the road noise but when we shut the door, it was just as quiet as any other hotel room we've ever stayed in.* Valet was very prompt in bringing around our car - when we called down for it to be brought around, it was always there waiting for us when we got there.The not as good but not worth complaining about:* 3 very shallow dresser drawers and very limited closet hanging space in our room - no place to stash our suitcase out of the way* very thin/poor quality bed sheet which literally ripped in my hands when I rolled over during the night* hotel bar was pretty loud and rowdy - but it was a weekend night so I guess that's to be expected* there are no restaurants near the hotel so we ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant our first morning there - but never again - it was too expensive (appx $25/head) and they weren't even apologetic when their weirdo contemporary-design teapot didn't pour properly spilled hot tea all over.* 18/night mandatory valet - I knew to expect the mandatory valet and I even knew the price, but it still seems a little steep.

<Content>Good location despite initial misgivings. We arrived in Los Angeles by train from San Francisco and took a taxi to the hotel. Our initial concerns were that the hotel appeared to be miles from anywhere and also at the intersection of several large highways. However, it is situated near local bus stops and we found we could travel around Los Angeles and down to Santa Monica and Venice with no difficulty. Both the hotel valet staff and local bus drivers are extremely helpful-more so than the taxi drivers! The hotel has everything needed and the rooms were very comfortable. There was little noise inside the room despite being surrounded by many lanes of busy roads. I would highly recommend this hotel for a short break in Los Angeles.

<Content>Family was a disaster - Hotel was a lifesaver We stayed at the Hotel Angeleno for two of 10 days in the LA area. The location is not within walking distance of much, but if you need to see a lot of the westside, it is relatively close to more - Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, not too bad to get to downtown or the airport - a great spot for seeing art galleries in major areas like the Getty, Bergamot Station, Culver City, etc. The service started out pleasant and typical for a Joie de Vivre hotel, but when our four-year-old got food poisoning at a Dodger game, we got a lot of extra-special help and support, from housekeeping particularly. I noticed a lot of people have said in reviews that this isn't a great hotel for families with small children...well that may not be the audience that the hotel is after, but we found it very kid-friendly and welcoming, especially considering how demanding we were as patrons (3 sets of fresh white sheets in 1 day, a puking child in the lobby)!Also would add we ended up staying in all day and getting room service which was excellent, and the beds are great and our room was very quiet.

<Content>Not as noisey and loud as most say it is The hotel was much more Hollywood in person than it appeared in pictures online. It was very elegant, clean and the staff were all very accommodating. We stayed in the basic King size bed room on the 6th floor over looking the pool and fireplace. I didn't hear a peep from the near by 405 freeway which was a plus considering the other reviews which complain so much about it. Our room was clean. Our bed was fluffy and sturdy. The LCD screen tv was do'able. My only gripe was the expensive valet and the cleaning lady barged into our room while we were watching tv. It was one of those knock-knock HOUSE KEEPING all in one instance situation. Overall, my experience at Hotel Angeleno was excellent and I would definitely stay here again. Thank you

<Content>Need a car!!!! Hotel was lovely and staff at first were very courtious and helpful, that was until we didnt book any trips through them! Restaurant on the topfloor was nice with high quality food and the bar served for the majority of the day. we did however attempt to open a tab for drinks to which they added another two dollars to the bill!location and views left a lot to be desired, we were very much out of the centre of things, more than we realised we would be. to compensate this the hotel very generously puts on a courtesy car to take you anywhere within a three mile radius, and although this doesnt get you very far (not really out of Brentwood) it is a nice gesture nonetheless. for those of you who do have a car, this would probably be a good venue for you as it is literally straight off the freeway (not really that noisy either) however dispite the the cleanliness and comfort of the hotel, it wasn't our favourite stop on our journey.

<Content>Nice Rooms but Hotel needs help with customer service So during booking of our room I must confess I did have some issues although I have stayed at the location before and love their rooms and location. My husband and I truly love to come to the Angeleno Hotel but one thing I seem to run into every time when booking is customer service. On their website they say that they will beat any other rate by matching the lower rate and giving 10% off. Although I called the reservationist after finding a deal on expedia and the reservationist and the location manager would not honor this guarentee. I really would not make a stink about the issue but I also am one of their Joy of Life members and I was told by the club membership represitive that I was to recieve not only a complimentary beverage of my preference upon arrival but also a room upgrade. When I asked the room upgrade they told me that I must be mistaken. Although I love the Hotel my next trip to LA I will probably consider somewhere else.

<Content>Dark  If you want to stay at a hotel that it constantly dark even at 12pm during the day this is the place for you. I think they like keeping it dark so that they don't have to keep it clean. My room had a layer of dust on everything not to mention the cobwebs on the ceiling. I was afraid to go barefoot as I knew there were things crawling around on the floor that I couldn't see. My sheets were ripped and even through I'd empty out any glasses and put them on the desk they were never removed until I put them in the hallway. Only somewhat decent service was from room service who were friendly. I will never stay here again.

<Content>Miserable, management needs to get its act together ! I have stayed here several times in the recent years. While it has never been good, it was never been too bad...but this time I can see the place is a disaster...the staff need heavy training.Where to begin..- arrival - Mr XXX you are sharing a room with Ms XXXX....'excuse me?....booking was all screwed up. Wasted 15-20 min at reception to sort this out- rate - the rate agreed (in writing) was not on the reservation record at the hotel. Receptionist promised to fix it after another 15 minutes of wasted argument time. Surprise, surprise when it came time to check out the rate was not changed and then another 20 minutes had to be wasted arguing about it and finally getting it corrected- hot water...dont wake up early and expect a hot shower, you will only get a tepid one (at best and after waiting 20 minutes) . When complaining to reception I was told  it is an old building....you need to wait a long time.... So I asked 'does that mean hot water is not guaranteed in this hotel.....No answer....(at the time I was checking out another guest had same issue with the hot water...he got no response from the staff)- wake up call....my 530AM wake call never came....what is more fundamental than getting a wake up call when asked for...- the bill - had charges from other rooms on my bill ! Had to ask them to remove it ( which they did)All in all be prepared for miserable service, an I dont care attitude from incompetent staff and a hotel that is all veneer without substance.Unless the price is cheap, dont stay here...and dont forget the highway noise....bring ear plugs...-------------------

<Content>Fantastic This hotel was really nice. The rooms are a reasonable size. The beds are very comfy. The location is good to B'hills and the beach. There are bus services just outside the hotel on the right and over the road. (The Big Blus Bus is the better one to get on rather than the Metro).The Hotel also provides a free shuttle service to take you anywhere within a 3 mile radius, a brilliant perk! The upstairs bar and its views are amazing. The food in the restaurant is not all that considering the prices.Overall, a good stay and I would recommend the hotel.

<Content>Angeleno Magic Spent four nights in the Angeleno and throughly enjoyed our stay. Our room was partcially facing the Getty Museum and overlooking the Freeway. The rooms are a reasonable size and furnished to a very high standard including flat screen TVs. Huge windows that do an adequate job suppressing the noise of the freeway. That said, if you are a very light sleeper, ask to be placed at the back of the hotel, further away from the noise of the early morning traffic. This is a very busy stretch of road. The rooftop restaurant has spectacular views but one word of warning, its expensive and not very good food. All the hotel staff were more the accomodating but appreciate that this hotel operates valet parking only. There is no option to self park. You'll be charged for the valet parking at the end of your stay. The location is excellent for getting about in LA just on the edge of Bel Air and Sunset. That said you really do need a car to get around in LA....otherwise it's gonna cost you a fortune in cabs. Would stay again and good value for money.

<Content>The reception staff were great! I stayed here two nights and just loved it! I was attending a seminar, and the organizers suggested three hotels. I chose this one, as it was the least expensive. The hotel staff were all great, especially the front desk. I enjoyed the trendy design, the bar on the top floor, and the bed was very comfy. This hotel has a great location by the 405, but that does mean that you hear the traffic. It was more like white noise to me, but if you need a super-quiet environment, then the noise might bother you.

<Content>Nice hotel, staff unhelpful When I arrived at the Angeleno at 2:45 p.m., they didn't have a room for me. Check-in was at 3, but I've never arrived at 2:45 somewhere with nothing available. No problem, I figured. I'll just change, take a dip in the pool for a few minutes, and I'll be all set. I came back in at 3:15, and they told me it would be at least another 30 minutes!I changed again (in the lobby bathroom) and went for a run, asking that they comp my first night of parking ($18) for the inconvenience. When I returned, they led me to a double room, even though I had requested a king. They immediately accommodated my request to move to another room, but when I got there I found that the TV wasn't working. By this time, I just wanted to take a shower and relax, but I needed to get this taken care of first. I called the front desk five times before they sent someone up. The rest of my stay was really nice, but when they slid the bill under the door at the end of my stay, they neglected to comp one night of parking as they had promised. I brought this to their attention and came back later, and then they mistakenly comp'ed all three nights of parking. Which was nice for me, but interesting that they got even this wrong (although it was in my favor). Overall, the staff was very pleasant, but they just seemed inept. I found out the reason I wasn't able to check in on time (I wasn't the only one -- the lobby was full of travelers waiting) is because they held a staff meeting right before check-in time. Not smart. It's a nice place and would easily get four stars if they had their act together.

<Content>In between everywhere you want to be LA can be a tough place to visit. If you are close to one thing, you are impossibly far from somewhere else. The Hotel Angeleno splits the difference about as well as you could. Nestled between Brentwood and Westwood, it is convenient to much of the city. Everything else seems closer b/c you are right on the 405.The hotel has a W look and feel. Very nice. The roof bar/restaurant is a huge plus that should not be overlooked. Half price happy hour drinks allow you to take in the 405 traffic jam that stretches as far as the eye can see -- if you can forget the environmental impact, it's quite beautiful.One drawback: there is no concierge. So, you are on your own for dinner.

<Content>An L.A. landmark reborn The Angeleno is a totally cool renovation of a former Holiday Inn. The round 17-story building is a landmark right at the junction of I-405 and Santa Monica Blvd. It鈥檚 really well located for bopping all over the city, in your car, of course. You even need a car to get to the Getty Museum, practically across the street.The rooms (all exactly the same, a la Holiday Inn) are utterly generic boutique-hotel style鈥ll browns, creams, modern, spare. Frankly, they鈥檙e pretty boring and unoriginal, BUT they鈥檙e much snappier than a traditional Holiday Inn, and they do have all the au courrent bells and whistles.We were only there for one night and didn鈥檛 have a chance to use the pool which is very glam. The restaurant is on the top floor and must have a sweet view. Missed that too, but our room service lunch arrived speedily and was very good. We also appreciated the little coffee/news bar off the lobby.The only down side was the noise from the major freeways. There may be quieter rooms facing the Getty. Otherwise, bring ear plugs (always a good idea anywhere you stay

<Content>Bring Sewing Kit for Sheets, Earplugs for Noise, Wallet for Cafe, and no ID I'll start with the good - the bed is really comfortable and the staff is kind. The rooms are pretty nice. I definitely had some issues, though. Noise: I originally was in a room on the 9th floor overlooking the freeway. I went right back downstairs and asked for another room because it sounded like I was in the middle of the freeway. I got moved to a different room on a lower floor that faced the front of the hotel and away from the freeway, but I could still hear the traffic loud and clear throughout the day and the night. I also could hear my neighbors flushing their toilets and drying their hair, as well as the ice machine down the hall. I barely slept the first night, called downstairs to speak with a manager about changing rooms again, but the manager hadn't arrived yet. I asked to have the manager call upon arrival...five days later, I'm about to check out and still haven't heard anything. I would've checked out, but I got the hotel through Hotwire and ahd already paid for it. The Security: On my last night at the hotel, my keycard demagnetized. I went downstairs, and the person behind the desk just asked me what room I was in and gave me a new key. She did not ask for ID. I don't care if my mother were behind the desk, I would've wanted her to ask for ID. It made me a little nervous to think that anyone could go down there and say they were staying in any room and get a key to any room...Rips in the Sheets: I couldn't believe it when I read about ripped sheets in another review before coming, especially at hotel that is almost $300/night, but sure enough, there were rips in the duvet and in the fitted sheet. The rip in the fitted sheet extended from the foot of the bed to the middle of the bed.The Cafe: A bagel and a small bottle of orange juice costs $7.00. And the bagel wasn't even that good.

<Content>Loveley Experience and Helpful Staff Spent my 60th birthday on the 24/01/08 at the Angeleno, the room was lovely, the staff really helpful, I would like to personally thank Lesly and Christina on the front desk, Matthew conciege and Mary Manager of the restaurant for their extreme kindness when I lost my camera and very helpful in providing lovely birthday gifts and getting us sorted out with trips etc. It was a shame about the weather but being British we are used to that.Many thanks again to Mary for being especially helpful in locating Camera shops for me to purchase another one in Las Vegas.If I ever return to Los Angeles I will certainly stop at the Angeleno and will also recommend this hotel to my friends.Wonderful people.Many thanks.Melanie Parkin and Pat Gadd

<Content>Great decor, but unpolished service The hotel has sleek decor and very friendly staff as well as a restaurant with a wonderful view and very tasty food. Really good pastries in the morning at the little store in the lobby. There's a beautiful pool with a fireplace, although it was too windy and cold for us to enjoy it. Rooms were clean. Staff were very friendly. However, service was very spotty: missing towels, missing chair, missing shampoo, empty tissue box, toilet paper holder left in the middle of the bathroom. Staff were powerwashing the gym floor while the gym was supposed to be open for guests' use. Valet only parking, but inattentive staff. Staff were quick to respond to requests, though. Missing items were brought immediately and upon request, parking attendants provided good service. Incorrect charges that we found on our bill were corrected immediately when we checked out, without any fuss. Overall, though, good value. I would stay here again if I needed a hotel in the Brentwood/Westwood area.

<Content>Great Value for Location This hotel is a former Holiday Inn and completely renovated in European Style. Decor is the latest Brown/Blue suede with outstanding comfortable beds and pillows. Extremely well appointed with nice touches such as a plush terry cloth shower curtain and monogrammed towels. The latest style of faucets have been put in. Because the hotel is so conveniently located off the freeway at Sunset Blvd. you will get freeway noise on that side - turn on the air conditioning unit in the summer and you would never know. The hotel is circular and at the top is a fine dining restaurant with a nicely appointed bar. Great views of the Getty Museum and of UCLA and Westwood. Just up the street slip into the Hotel Bel Air for a drink without having to pay the price of their rooms. Extremely convenient for any business traveler into the West LA region and certainly acceptable for the vacation traveler also.

<Content>Do Not Stay Here!!!!!!!! I don't understand the other reviews--they must be written by employees or something---this place is a MESS! The first room they gave me had sheets with RIPS in them--I complained and they switched my room. But if you look closely everything is coming undone here---the chairs by the pool have cigarette burns in them, the walls have splotches and stains. The design is a kind of corporate boutique, lacking any real individuality or quality. Also, the hotel is right on the freeway--at all times the sound of cars zooming through traffic abounds. Yuck! The housekeeper started knocking on my door at 8:15 in the morning. Huh? The art in the room is so tacky--like worse than pre fab pottery barn art. The restuarant has a cool view--but the food was mediocre--and my heirloom tomatoes were terrible. The people who work here are very nice, but I would never stay here again.

<Content>really pleasant stay at this hip, clean hotel My husband and I live in the Los Angeles area; but, we often travel to local hotels to take a break from our busy household and our three small children. Our stay at the Angelino was one of these quick overnight get-aways, and we loved it. The hotel has been remodeled since it was a Holiday Inn and there are virtually no traces of its former self. The room was a little small, but very cozy. The room was pie-shaped, which I thought was unique and interesting. We had a view of the 405 freeway, which doesn't sound cool as I write this, but was actually extremely cool. You feel like you're on top of the freeway, but you don't hear the noise (expensive double-paned glass, probably). At night, the lights on the freeway are especially pretty. The room service was quick and the food was great. The restaurant on the top floor has gorgeous views of Los Angeles. The pool area was small, but very hip, with nice comfortable outdoor furniture. This hotel could get away with charging WAY more for their rooms, but they don't, so that makes me give The Angelino even higher marks. Give it a try!

<Content>Good Bye Holiday Inn---Hello Angeleno What do you do with a circular Holiday Inn on the 405 inLos Angeles? The best possible answer is to sell it and turnit into the Angeleno. This hotel takes everything that HolidayInn does wrong and makes it right. Great comfortable bedswith wonderful linens. New furniture and flat screen televisions.To top it off, all of the personnel from the valets to the desk clerks were friendly and welcoming each and every time wehad any contact. The restaurant on the 17th floor has wonderfulpanoramic views and excellent food for breakfast (the only mealwe ate at the hotel). We were really impressed with this hotel and hope to return in the near future. One final note---there is some noise from the 405 freeway. It almost can't be avoided, After a few minutes it seemed to be unobtrusive and sleeping proved to be no problem. Our room was on the 5th floor and was slightly facing the freeway. Other rooms might be even better.

<Content>We will always love the Angeleno We stayed at the Angeleno because it was close to UCLA Medial Center where our baby son was having surgery. We were pretty stressed out when we arrived but were immediately impressed by the professionalism and kindness we encountered by everyone at the Angeleno.People went out of their way to put us at ease and make us comfortable. We had seen the unique circular design of the building as we drove by on the 405 freeway, but we had no idea that the rooms were so well appointed, particularly the linens. Our son has now recovered and we are glad this episode is behind us, but we will always have a warm spot in our hearts for the Hotel Angeleno, and we look forward to staying there again just for fun!

<Author>RkyMtnHi
<Content>Great little boutique hotel! I only stayed here one night, but it was a fabulous stay! Everyone who worked there was so friendly and nice and all my co-workers said they had the same experience. The hotel has dimmed lighting and cool music that makes you relax right away and the room rates are extremely reasonable (they even worked with our nonprofit to give us a lower rate). The room I was in was on the second floor--the bed was so comfortable; a very comfy mattress and soft sheets. The plasma TV was nice and there was free wifi in the room. The bathroom was kind of small, but it was well-appointed with luxury shampoo/conditioner/lotion and little extras like containers of Q-tips and cotton balls. I checked in at about 11:30 pm after traveling all day and I was starving. The receptionist said that room service was available until midnight. The menu was incredible--I ordered light things like spinach cooked in garlic and herbs and Parmesan polenta. I thought room service might be cranky since it was so late, but they were very nice. I ordered breakfast in the room too and it was also delicious--the menu offers things like chicken-apple sausage, fluffy eggs and amazing potatoes. I heard the hotel used to be a Holiday Inn back in the day--it's a tall, round hotel, so everyone has a view. I was sad to only stay one night, but I'm glad to know I now have a go-to hotel in LA!

<Content>Very Cool and Fun At first I thought the Angeleno would be all marketing gimmick and poor service. True, their advertizing is over the top: no, staying at Joie de Vivre hotels is not like going to a farmer's market (a silly jingle says when you are on hold on their phone). I would have liked it much less if it were like going to a farmer's maket! ;-) The design is very cool and the rooms incredibly confortable (even if one hears the ocassional roar from 405 nearby). The pool is so very pleasant, especially in the evening to enjoy a drink by the fireplace after a dive. The gym is small but was enough.But the biggest surprise of the stay was the wonderful West Restaurant  Lounge on the 17th floor. The food is great and the band playing Monday (Jazz) and Thursday (Jazz/Funk) was excellent---and the groupies even better!I would definitely go back!

<Content>Great little hotel in a convenient spot My wife and I just stayed here for a night so that we could be close to our Halloween party this year. The location is superb, right off the 405 freeway and a quick drive to Westwood (not 5 minutes), Brentwood (not 5 minutes), Beverly Hills (maybe 15 minutes?), Santa Monica (maybe 20 minutes?). It's nice to be so close to the freeway if you need to travel a bit during your stay. The price was fairly reasonable; the rooms very nicely appointed and comfortable with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms. Our room had a balcony and was perched almost above the freeway. Pretty nifty even if I am a light sleeper. Just know that the hotel is right off the freeway. I am a very light sleeper and was surprised that the noise of cars on the freeway didn't bother me. Again, I was not bothered by the sound of cars rushing bar. With the balcony door open, it's loud. With the door closed, it's surprisingly much more quiet, almost like a muted rushing river. It was not bothersome.Similarly, our room was adjacent to the ice machine. I usually ask to be put far from the ice machine and the elevators. This ice machine was loud and faced the hall but somehow, the door to our room did a remarkable job of silencing it.If you have a room facing south, I'd imagine you'd get a view of the city but I liked having the view facing north up the Sepulveda Canyon just as much.The place has a cool 'W' kind of feel to it although we didn't have time to check out the bar or restaurant. Valet parking is $18 for overnight parking...somewhat of a standard practice these days. The valets are attentive and prompt. I'd stay here again, absolutely.

<Content>Good Deal Located right next to the 405 freeway, between Westwood (UCLA) and Santa Monica, The Angeleno is convenient and comfortable. I was put here by work and had low expectations. I'd driven by the remarkable round building many times. On the bad side, you need a car for everything from this road side location. On the great side, the service was lovely, the room large and comfortable, the room service open, the cable and wireless functioning. The bathroom was small but clean. I'd stay here again, no problem.

<Content>nice boutique hotel in westwood This is a nice hotel near Brentwood/Bel Aire/Westwood and the price is a bit reasonable compared to some of the places in this area.We had a really nice room, king bed (very comfortable bed), flat screen T.V.. We were on the 11th floor and had a great view all the way to catalina. Only draw back....there is a little bit of humming noise from the freeway if the window is open. Otherwise all was great!!There is a nice restaurant on the top level that has a great view. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. There is a small bar as well.

<Content>Comfy at the Hotel Angeleno Stayed at the freeway and UCLA-close Hotel Angeleno for one night. We found the rooms well furnished, the beds quite comfy, and bedding luxurious. The room service menu is versatile, with the food delicious and service excellent. The front desk and housekeeping was responsive to our requests. When we return for future overnight visits, we will utilize this hotel.

<Content>Nice if your deaf  The Angeleno is right next to the 405, and that alone being bad enough, the A/C is simply mounted in a hole in the wall. So, 405 noise isn麓t only relayed through cheap-ass windows, but also vented in as soon as the A/C starts working - the noise from the freeway actually gets closer as soon as the fan starts to spin. So if you plan on getting any amount of sleep, you better be deaf. My stay there was only for a week or so, lacking alternatives in the proximity. One of the nicer amenities to compensate for the lack of sleep overnight is the free shuttle service - which I relied upon for two consecutive mornings, only to get involved in an accident in the hotel shuttle on a 2-mile-journey from the hotel to UCLA. I have driven all my life and never had an accident, and three times a 2 mile drive should hardly be accident prone - unfortunately for me, it was. Luckily no one was hurt, but both cars were severly damaged. I relied upon my own car from then. What was odd was also that even after the accident, the hotel declined to offer any kind of compensation, and they actually wanted to raise my room rate because they were getting booked. I moved out that same day - its a pity the rooms are decorated so nicely, they should move the furniture to some other hotel that really matches decoration with service.

<Content>Noisey The Hotel Angeleno is next to the 405 Freeway. The heating / air system is a window box. This is not a hotel if you want to get a good night sleep.I woke up early (because of the noise)... to find out that room service and the dinning room open at 6:30 (it is not 24/7).

<Content>Fantastic Service at the Angeleno I'm a frequent business traveler and can honestly say the Hotel Angeleno is the best value in the area. The service is *exemplary*, the location is easy to get to, and the beds are so-o-o-o comfortable. Everything the business traveler could want. It leaves everything else in the price range in the dust.

<Content>OK, but felt slightly uncomfortable Nice room recently renovated.Staff available and polite.ONLY valet parking, 18$ per night + tip.Overall a good experience, but there is a kind of trendy, showing off  attitude which makes a casual tourist feel somehow out of place... maybe it's just the way things are in Los Angeles...Also they had a private party one of the evenings which meant no pool available for clients and loud music during the night ! They were basically sacrificing the customers for making more money with the private party...

<Content>Great Hotel! We stayed at the Angeleno Hotel for a weekend while visiting our daughter who is a student at UCLA. I had read a rather negative review, so wasn't expecting too much, but it was the only hotel with availability. How wrong the other review was! The staff were very kind , helpful  welcoming. Our room was beautiful and the bed was so comfortable with luxurious bed linens. We didn't go to the restaurant, but enjoyed the workout room 2 mornings and the nice pool area. I would say the only, slightly negative is that the hotel is right next to highway 405, but we weren't bothered by that ,even in our room. At the pool, they have nice soothing music playing, so you aren't really aware of any noise (very clever). We would stay there again in a minute and also recommend it to our friends.

<Content>Trust the reviews; the Angeleno is great!!!! Before booking my business trip to LA I did some research on Trip Advisor. Angeleno seemed to fit my needs so I booked my stay there. My rate was 206 through my company agent. I believe you can find a lesser rate online. This was an excellent rate for the quality of my overall stay. The location is very convenient, I have never driven in LA before this trip and found the hotel easily from LAX. I pulled in and was greated by a very attentive valet and bell staff. Valet is $18 a day. In my opinion, this is an incredibly fair price. I would call down for my car a few minutes before I left my room each time I needed it and it was waiting for me by the time I walked out the door. The room was nice, not huge but very adequate in size. The decor was clean and modern; hues of turquoise and brown. Bedding was plush and abundant. My room had 2 double beds. Bathroom was decent, nice fixtures, good water pressure, soft towels. As others have said in previous reviews, the shampoo is awesome! I have very fine hair and I had a great hair day everyday. In fact, I bought some to take home in the gift shop/cafe. The cafe is a good alternative if you want a quick breakfast; scones, bagles, yogurt and gourmet coffee drinks. The plasma TV was nice. If I had more time I would have borrowed a (preloaded) Ipod nano for 5 dollars a day. What a great idea! The pool was beautiful. Cozy cabanas, great ambience. Supposedly heated, but I didn't have a chance to jump in. Workout room seemed more than adequate (only popped my head in). The restaurant upstairs was great! Since I was travelling solo I dined at the bar (full menu available upon request). The bartenders were friendly and attentive. Food came out at a decent pace. Good wines by the glass. Try the filet (with red wine sauce). Al la carte; $34. Also got asparagus w/ pecorino; $8. The following night I was exhausted so I ordered room service in; Angeleno burger ($12 or $15) was perfect! Came w/ avocado  bacon, side of fries. The greens salad ($9) was also very good. Check out was very simple. A valet greeted me at the desk and helped my bags into my car. Overall, Angeleno has the level of elegance and subtle trendiness without being over-the-top. There were no attitudes from any of the staff and service was top-notch. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone. I might try something new on my next visit for the sake of variety but I'd gladly return.

<Content>A Great Place to Stay - Angeleno Hotel We recently stayed at the Angeleno Hotel in order to help our son move into his college housing. All the staff members at the Angeleno were helpful, courteous, and very willing to share any information they couold to make our stay as pleasant as possible.The food from the restaurant was excellent, as was the room service. The facilities were clean and well kept, and our stay was a real treat!We will be returning to visit our son frequently during the school year, and we will always make the Angeleno our first choice to stay.

<Content>Okay but wouldn't choose it again The hotel is in a great location - easy drive to Santa Monica and Beverly Hills, where we had meetings all week. Nicely decorated rooms - although rather small. We only had a shower - no bath tub - not sure if this is the same in all rooms. Front staff was friendly upon check in. Pool area is very nice - although does not get vey much sun in the afternoon. Problems were the freeway noise - unreal - doesn't matter which side of the hotel your room is on, had to use the A/C to drown it out. The cleaning staff was not very attentive, bathrom not cleaned well daily, had to call down for replacement supplies. Bathrobes were missing. Housekeeping walked into the room unannounced one afternoon which was a bit startling. Number of towels each day was inconsistent - had to dry with a facecloth at one point! Just little details that should really be attended to. Also - disliked the valet parking, (which is mandatory) while the valet staff was generally pleasant, it was very inconvenient to call down every time we needed to leave - phone rang busy, often times had to wait for some time for our vehicle. Overall - it was an okay experience and I would recommend this as a good place to stay for a night or 2, but we were there a week - and feel that perhaps another hotel would provide a much more comfortable stay, and will be looking to book elsewhere for our week in October.

<Content>Angeleno was great My stay at the Angeleno was fantastic. The hotel and the amenities were great. The staff was incredible- personal, friendly, professional and courteous. The hotel is located centrally to Westwood, Beverly Hills and Brentwood; making it a great location to be based at for my trip. The rooms were spacious and always clean. The hotel is an amzaing value for the money, and I recommend it without any reservation.

<Content>Love the place! This is a very nice hotel. The rooms are modern. The beds are very comfortable. It's very clean. The staff is friendly and offers exceptional service. Room service is a plus; the food is very good! They have a shuttle service that will take you right into Westwood and pick you up when you are ready to relax at the hotel. Love the location. You will come back; just like I have done.

<Content>Classy, Clean, Modern Hotel w/ Attentive  From the moment we booked the reservation, this hotel proved to be more than just a regular hotel. The reservation agent was extremely warm  friendly as if it were an independant bed  breakfast run by a family not in any rush to get on to the next call. Upon arrival, we were given no hassles about valet parking, the check-in was smooth, the room was clean. The deocr is modern, simple w/ clean lines, warm tones and not cluttered. The amenities were high-end too. The shampoo didn't actually make your hair feel like sticks after using it:) Room service was friendly, the food was cooked to perfection  the quality of the food was superb. I have a hotel background and have also worked as a conference planner for years so, I can be critical  this one was nothing but top-notch. Hope you share my experience.

<Content>We're Not Easy To Please Hotel Angeleno far and away exceeded my every expectation. I absolutely love the warm and inviting atmosphere. As a former hotel administrator I tend to pay close attention to detail, especially in how the staff treat their guests. I can honestly say that in all the years of hotel employment or personal hotel visits, I have never encountered a more outgoing group of employees. I literally felt like I was in their home. What was even better was the genuine sincerity each staff member displayed. The pool area was occupied with an Emmy function; however as the Banquet staff were breaking down the tables, they invited me in. I didn't want to be in the way but they were so accommodating that they were nice enough to set up a lounge area for me, right in the midst of their busy schedule. I was impressed not only by the atmosphere downstairs, but also with the restaurant/club West on the upper level. What a posh place this is! The staff really seem to enjoy themselves.My husband and I will definitely be returning soon. Thank you for a great weekend. -Shannon

<Content>This hotel totally exceeded our expectations! From the very beginning, we were given above standard service. The staff were kind and courteous. In our case we were guests because I was having a medical appointment at UCLA Medical Center. We booked for one night, but after our appointment I felt I needed another night. They had no problem meeting our needs. We immediately were escorted to a new room. The rooms were beautifully decorated and the beds were clean and comfortable. The wide screen HD tv was very cool. The toiletries were of good quality which is always a nice surprise. The room service was great and the food was delicious. I was too ill to go to the on -site restaurant, but by our next appointment I definitely plan to enjoy a yummy dinner on the 17th floor. Again,, the staff are what makes a hotel stay what it is and these staff were just the greatest!

<Content>Great location, cool ambiance I've stayed at the Angelino several times, and really like the feel of the place. It has a modern Asian feel to the decor and the rooms are clean and fairly spacious. Staff is very helpful, and I'm told the restaurant is excellent. Very convenient to UCLA or anywhere on the West side of LA.Try to stay on the quiet side, as the freeway noise (it's over the 405 freeway) can be loud.

<Content>2nd Stay, Better Than the First This was my second stay at the Angeleno and while there was nothing wrong with my first stay, the hotel was still being remodeled at that time. During this stay, it appears everything was in order as the pool was open, there were lots of employees and the coffee shop was new. Check-in was a breeze and my room was outstanding; comfy bed, flat screen TV and a great view. I loved the bathroom, including the European-style shower. My room faced the 405 and I was a bit concerned about the freeway noise, but as soon as the I shut the sliding glass door, I couldn't hear a thing. Their local shuttle is handy and the hotel is also on the #2 bus line, so the Westwood theatres and the Sunset Strip are just a short ride away. The maid service was outstanding and I loved the bed turn-down service at night.I do have to chuckle, while checking in, there was an elderly man who had a bit of a problem with his room. It seems he just wasn't comfortable with the openness of the shower stall (glassed in, no shower curtain) and the opaque glass door of the bathroom. The manager was trying to explain that the hotel has a modern/chic look and feel, but I guess that might be too much for someone who is a bit more consertavie. Overall, the hotel, staff and location are great! The next time I'm in LA, I'll book there again.

<Content>Wonderful service at Hotel Angeleno We stayed at the Hotel Angeleno while going to the UCLA clinic.We have used this hotel many times before the change in ownership.Was very pleasantly surprised to find they could do such a wonderful upgrade. The Hotel was impressive starting with the front desk, very friendly and helpful, ending with the immaculate,tastefully decorated rooms. Every aspect of the hotel is first class. Will stay there again.

<Content>Great Location, Room, Service  We've stayed in LA several times over the years, and so far, the new Angeleno Hotel on Sunset and the 405 has been the best place. Reasonable rates, well appointed lobby, attentive staff, and (most importantly) great clean rooms. Not too big, not too small. Nicely decorated, flat screens, free wireless, good mini bar, and a small but well executed room service menu. The bed was excellent too. Soft, plush, and very sleeeeeppppyyyyyy.We stayed for a week, and put the front desk through its paces. We changed rooms twice, extended our stay, and then left one day early (medical reasons). The front desk was courteous and helpful all the time.The location is good too. Nestled between Brentwood and Bel Air, it's right off of Sunset, and only a few blocks from Wilshire. Easy to go west to Santa Monica and the beach, or east to Beverly Hills or Hollywood. On the last day we went to LAX, and were at the airport within 15 minutes.The pool looked nice too, and the restaurant on the top floor looked great too. We unfortunately were not able to use either last time, but we certainly will on our next visit.

<Content>Great Value in LA I normally stay at high end properties but after seeing a review in one of the travel magazines, I decided to give The Angelenos a try. Although the room is small, a complete renovation had been completed. The room was spotless and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was laid out well. We ate at the restaurant West and once at the bar and was completely satisfied both times. The location is central to everywhere with access to the 405 close by. The staff was pleasant and attentive and any request was dealt with immediately. Would highyl reccommend this property.

<Content>Cool Design Hotel for a good price! I love the interior design at this hotel + all the little details....the rooms are very cozy, the beds super-comfy. You even sort of love that you're sleeping almost right on top of the 405. It's so, well, Quintessential L.A., right? This hotel is very cool and chic for a more affordable price than other boutique hotels nearby. My ONLY issue was the very bad, very cheesy techno-pop playing too often and too loud in the lobby, by the pool, pretty much almost anywhere except your room, thank god!

<Content>Wonderful experience We just returned from a 6-day stay at The Angeleno in West LA and can't say enough about our experience. The staff was attentive and gracious. Our room, although on the small side, was immaculate and well-appointed with several little interesting touches. The Asian theme was interesting and the pool and patio were soothing. Our only complaint was noise from the 405 expressway, but once the door was closed, we were pleasantly quiet! We'll definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone in this mostly adult atmosphere.

<Content>Stylish hotel Overall, this was a nice hotel--beautiful room, very comfortable, friendly staff. My only complaint is that the details were overlooked. My room was missing the hairdryer, and it took over an hour for them to bring it up; the lid on the coffee maker and the pot were both broken; the bottom sheet was already coming off of the bed when I checked in; and many of the lamps did not work. Collectively, these details were annoying, but overall, it was a nice place to stay and a value for the area ($18 valet sounds reasonable for LA). And the view of the city from my room was spectacular.

<Content>Boutique Hotel Wanna Be I was antsy about my 5 day stay at this hotel after reading the reviews so kept my receipt of on-line payment but didn't have any problem at check in. I did however encounter 3 drunk middle aged adults on the elevator trying to get to my room one of which tried to pick me up. I quickly made it to my room and wanted to bolt the door being a female traveling alone. However their was no interior deadbolt. The room was very small since it is a circular structure located right on the freeway. It is convenient but somewhat noisy. I was dying to open the balcony door to let the gorgeous breezes blow in but it was way too noisy. The shower only gave a steady stream of warm water for about 7 minutes then I would get long stretches of cold water then warm again then cold. It almost seemed like there was a timer and you only got 7 minutes before they said times up' and started sending cold water. The bed was a pillow top and very compfy, there was a nice plasma TV but the lighting in the entire room was very poor. The worst part of the entire stay was the $18/day valet parking + tips. There is no self-parking at all. So when you add a minimum of $20/day to the cost of the room, I don't think it substantiates the over all value of the room. The maid service, newspaper delivery etc. was very unpredictable. I spent 5 days there, my bill was $900 and only received 2 newspapers and 1 turn-down service at night. It is however very convenient to the UCLA campus and freeway.

<Content>Great place to stay for business @ UCLA If you are doing business or visiting UCLA this is the place to stay because it is only five minutes away from campus. It is very luxurious with excellent service, yet practical and reasonable considering the premiere location in Brentwood/ Bel Air. Plus, you are located right by the 405 and 101 freeways, which will take you almost any where in Los Angeles, of course traffic permitting.

<Content>My favorite place to stay in L.A I live in Orange County and every three months I have to visit a specialist at UCLA, which is always a bit stressful. Morning appointments mean either getting up very early to drive from Irvine, or staying somewhere close; staying close definitely reduces the stress and aggravation.Luckily for me, I discovered the Hotel Angeleno on my third visit after moving back to Irvine from Silicon Valley, and I'm so glad I did. The atmosphere is so nice and relaxed and luxurious, and the staff is always friendly and helpful. I'm usually able to get a great night's sleep, despite the impending appointments in the morning.I stayed at the Angeleno again just last week, and I think I'm starting to become a semi-regular. I had a personal note from the general manager welcoming me back, and received a phone call from the front desk shortly after my arrival, asking if everything in the room was to my liking. It certainly was, and it was nice to feel appreciated.I've stayed maybe five times now, and the rooms are consistently well maintained, the linens fresh, and the bathroom sparkling. The beds are so comfortable, we ended up going out and buying a new bed for ourselves at home this past winter because we realized how much nicer we could have it.I would definitely recommend the Hotel Angeleno to anyone who is looking to stay in the Brentwood/Westwood/UCLA area.

<Content>Great value in LA Located right at the intersection of 405 and Sunset Blvd., the Angeleno Hotel is a perfect location for visiting UCLA, Westwood and the Getty Museum. The service is warm and welcoming. The rooms are small but comfortable. In spite of the location just off the freeway there is no problem with noise in the room. Compared to other hotels in LA and Santa Monica that charge double the price for fewer amenities, this is a great choice.

<Content>Really nice hotel I stayed in this hotel while attending a conference, and was really impressed. It was a bit pricey, but no more than other hotels in the area. When we arrived, there was a movie shoot going on, so the parking area was a little crazy, but the valets did a great job in quickly serving us. I didn't realize that valet service was included in the price of the hotel, which was a pleasant surprise.The hotel was clean and neat and the personnel were very nice. I didn't hear any noise from neighbors or the outside, something that's really important to me. The rooms have an interesting V-shape that was a little strange, but didn't detract from the overall design.Meals from room service were very small for the price, so be prepared to go out for food if you're starving.The location is great as well if you need to go to UCLA or other areas in West LA. The entrance to the 405 is very close to the hotel.Be ready for some pretentiousness in the staff, but hey, it's LA!Overall, I was very impressed and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>This is my kind of place! I really enjoyed my stay, The hotel is mod, rooms are comfortable and fairly soundproof. The view is surreal hovering over the 405-pretty cool and all the rooms have a balcony. The West (restaurant on the top floor )have great steaks,drinks and the DJ was spinning out of control with the 70's soul and disco. A great time was had up there.I highly recommend it for a weekend getaway!

<Content>Good night's sleep despite the 405, and well-priced for the West LA area When I checked in and reminded them that I'd requested a room furthest from the freeway but was given a room facing south at the exit/on ramp and w/ a view of the freeway, I wasn't too pleased. The hum of constant traffic was pretty continuous until after 9pm. I suppose it's better than being on a large boulevard and having direct loud traffic screeching down the street here and there thru the night. Surprisingly, I slept soundly until morning traffic on the 405 served as my alarm clock at about 6:30AM. I would think/hope that if you're there during the weekends, it would start later. Maybe they'll put in new double-paned sliding doors to the balcony once they break even.The room was 99% clean (stains under the glass protective top near the TV area). It's been redone in sleek modern decor and furnishings for the most part - instead of the Herman Miller chair I was supposed to have at the work station as their website advertised, there was an old Holiday Inn banquet style chair probably left over when they bought the old hotel. Did the Herman Miller chair go kapputt? The shower pressure was one of the best I've experienced in a hotel. But due to the very dim lighting, I would not recommend this for business people. I may only stay there again over a weekend. but I would not stay on weekdays for any reason as it's not really close to anything affordable/reasonable to dine at but chain restaurants around UCLA.

<Content>Small But Huge When we checked into the Hotel Angeleno I was impressed with the front desk attendant who was overly pleasant. Just knew this was going to be a great stay. We were kept waiting for over 20 minutes because she couldn鈥檛 locate the 鈥減aperwork鈥?(on their end) after my handing her the paperwork that Priceline had sent me for them, but she kept thanking me for my patience. Our room was clean; the linens were a nice thread count. The rooms are extremely small and laid out poorly. Barely bigger than a Motel 6 room. No closet, no hooks to hang your towels. The soap/lotion/shampoo and conditioners were nice and smelled great. After freshening up we went to the bar, ordered 2 generic drinks. My bourbon and soda was 鈥淛im Beam鈥?so it wasn鈥檛 like they poured exquisite brands, yet our tab was $21.00 for two drinks. The view was nice. On our morning with our 鈥淧rivacy Please鈥?sign on our door with the deadbolt locked, a maid walked in at 10:30 announcing she was told she had to come in and clean. I asked her what she would have done if we鈥檇 been sleeping but she asked me to repeat the question numerous times since she couldn鈥檛 understand English that well. We stayed there 3 nights and with the exception of the initial check-in, the staff acted like we were strangers. I鈥檓 surmising they save the pleasant fa莽ade for the new guests checking in. After that, they assume a 鈥淲e鈥檝e gotcha鈥?attitude and couldn鈥檛 care less if you like it or lump it. The location is awful, the 鈥渟huttle鈥?is on their whim, and overall the hotel emits a feeling of a shabby hotel with a recent facelift trying to be a 4 or 5 star hotel. Not even close. I鈥檇 rate it a 2 star at most. I must tell you that the bellman we had was extremely helpful and the driver who took us on our one and only complimentary shuttle ride was a hoot. Very entertaining guy. The restaurant menu and lounge beverage prices are laughable. The overall appearance is not pleasant. If you like lovely comforters and nice sheets, this is the place for you. The sheets, comforters, toiletries, bellmen valet attendants and drivers are the only things they鈥檝e got in their favor.

<Content>Whoa This place is Expensive! Oh My!We booked this hotel thru the main number. We noticed that the price was considerably higher than when we were there before when it was the Holiday Inn. We were looking forward to seeing the renovations and they were very nice, however, it should not be financed on the backs of the customers. I was also appalled at the term - mandatory valet parking. At $18 per day, It should have been discussed when the reservation was made. Ok, our mistake. Now, on to the restaurant. Make sure to refinance your house before setting foot in there. A glass of wine is $17 and a very small appetizer (2 tiny eggrolls) is $16. My advice: Take a cab to Santa Monica. Believe me, it will save you tons of money. Overall, we won't be back- there are much nicer hotels for the same price or less in West LA.

<Content>Horrible Customer Service We stayed at the Hotel Angeleno for three nights while we attended a conference.I can say that the bed was quite comfortable. However, there is little I can say that is positive about the rest of the experience.The front desk service (which also acts as the concierge) was horrible. The hotel advertises that they have a shuttle service to anywhere in a three mile radius. However, the front desk didn鈥檛 tell us until the last day that the shuttle service would take us to local restaurants. When I asked the front desk for evening entertainment recommendations, they only knew that there was no entertainment in the upstairs bar. The front desk stated that they would call us about entertainment options but never did. The few times that we used the shuttle, it did not arrive at the time indicated. The air conditioning indicated that it went down to 60 degrees, but the room never seemed to get cooler than 67 degrees. I ordered room service and attempted to order a beer. As I went down the list on the menu, I was informed that they did not carry three of the eight beers anymore. Oddly, one of the beers they 鈥渘o longer carried鈥? Sierra Nevada, was available in hotel gift shop, but room service refused to offer me this beer. I had to go down to the gift shop and purchase the beer myself even though the restaurant and gift shop were both owned by the hotel!!!Is this the type of service that you should receive at $175 per night?

<Content>Loved this hotel! Stayed for one night for a business trip and LOVED this hotel. The rooms were beautiful and each one has its own balcony. The only thing I would change would be for them to provide earplugs, since it's basically on the freeway and the glass doors to the balcony only do so much to block out the noise.

<Content>Anywhere but here There were a number of problems:1) Traffic noise was unacceptable. This was due to poorly-sealed air conditioning unit, which had pulled away from the wall, leaving basically an open window on the highway a few feet away. I pointed this out to hotel staffperson who came to deal with another problem (see below) and promised to send an engineer. Nobody came. 2) There was no desk or chair in the room and the lighting was so poor that it was impossible to work. After I complained, a chair arrived, but without a desk it was useless.3) The coffee-maker was missing. One arrived promptly after I complained, it had a broken lid and a chipped carafe, not what I expect for over $200 a night. It did make coffee, though.4) The free wireless internet did not work. After getting through to the tech support number (15 minutes on hold) I was promised the problem was solved, but it was so hopelessly slow (5 mins to load a web page) that I gave up. I had no problem at any of the other 3 hotels on this trip.5) I went to the restaurant, which appeared to be empty, and was asked by the maitre d' if I would mind waiting 5 minutes for a table. I did mind, and went elsewhere.I travel a great deal on business, and this is the first time I have written such a negative review of a hotel. It was one of the worst hotel experiences I have had, and definitely the worst value for money I ever experienced.

<Content>Disappointing You can take the hotel out of Holiday Inn but you can't take the Holiday Inn out of the hotel...The building that is the Hotel Angelino was built as a Holiday Inn and was a Holiday Inn until it was closed a while ago. It has recently been renovated as the Hotel Angelino. The rounded shape of the building limits the space available. As a result the rooms and bathroom are very small, as is the lobby. While the furnishings are for the most part well designed to maximize the small space the room is still tight.One big peeve of mine is when a room is dark and our room at the Angelino was extremely dark. There were no ceiling lights and only 3 lamps with low watt bulbs. The lack of light drove me crazy, especially at $150 per night.The shower pressure was low and still there was a big shortage of hot water. Most of the showers we took were lukewarm at best.Valet parking is mandatory (not unusual in LA but still a large added expense) and while the staff did hustle there were time when there was a long wait for your car.We had a great view of the 405 from our low floor but highway noise was not an issue. The balcony however was useless. What was noisy however was the heat pump/AC unit.There were only 2 usable pillows on the king bed (and 2 decorative ones)The Luxe, which is practically next door, is a better (but not perfect) hotel. We chose the Angelino this trip to try something different and becasue it was about $20 night cheaper, but are unlikely to stay there again. From the Luxe you can see the best feature of the Angelino - the neat lights on the top.

<Content>Stay Away from this Place if you want to Sleep! If you need a place in the LA/UCLA area, save your money and a lot of heartache and choose another hotel. I value online reviews and was lulled into thinking this place is a deal... how it has an above-average rating is beyond me. The CONSFirst, it bills itself as a luxury property... it's not... in fact, until recently, it was a Holiday Inn. Now, I am not a picky traveller, but one thing I do value is sleep... this hotel is circular and at least one-half of the building fronts the 405 and is so loud that you cannot sleep even with the AC fan blasting to try to counteract the noise. It's actually worse than LAX hotels, because those hotels have double paned glass to block the noise... this property desperately needs that glass. Second, it is in the middle of nowhere -- fronting the 405 -- so there are no neighborhoods to walk to or quaint places to explore. Third, parking is $18.00 a night -- again, many places charge to park, and if there was a benefit, like being in a desirable location, then $18.00 is reasonable, but here you don't get what you pay for. Fourth, all rooms are not created equally. Because of noise and maintenance issues we saw two of them during our stay and one had a chipped and disgusting bathtub that should have been replaced 2 years ago. Fifth, recognizing they're in the middle of nowhere -- with no sidewalks -- they provide a free shuttle service. Problem is the shuttle is reservation only and they only book on the half-hour... 4, 4:30, 5, 5:30... seems like a perk, right? what could the complaint be? well, they ONLY book on the half-hour, so if one guest wants to go somewhere at 5pm and another needs to be picked up somewhere at 5pm (a reasonable front desk clerk would not take one of the reservations, right?) this hotel's policy is to take both bookings (double booking) and to make someone wait -- without telling them they'll wait -- because they only allow reservations on the half-hour.Sixth, it's pricey. Sure, it's not the most expensive hotel in the general area, but it's certainly not cheapest. Seventh, the restaurant prices are steep as well. You're a captive audience here... expect a meager breakfast for 2 to run $50.00 or more. One cup of regular coffee = $4.00 + tax + tip. Another example... the honor bar with a can of Pringles for $4.50 and a FIRST AID KIT for $3.50! Eighth, the room lighting is poor. No overhead lights and very dim freestanding ones. Finally, it's frequently a Priceline win... where consumers pay before they know what they're getting... I'd say there's a reason for that. Maybe if I'd paid 60% off the going rate, I'd wear earplugs, hail taxis and be happy. I didn't and I'm not.The PROSFirst, free wireless internet. Not too common these days, so a definite plus.Second, a gym, though it only has 2 treadmills, 1 bike, 1 free weight set and 1 nautilus set... there's a reason the fitness room is not included in the photo gallery on the hotel's website.Finally, the beds are comfortable. With the freeway noise, you can't sleep in comfort, but you can lay awake in comfort. Good luck if you choose this hotel... you've been warned.

<Content>Most relaxing business trip ever because of the Angeleno Absolutely wonderful! The rooms are great and well appointed; not much closet space though. Room service was fablous (although be careful the service staff waits for a tip but there's a 20% tip and service fee already calculated in the bill and when confronted he told me that it was a slow night and 20% wasn't enough). The valet guys were wonderful, patient and understanding. The coffee shop was having some staffing issues but when staffed was a great place for coffee and conversation. Edgar is the friendliest and most accomodating staff member!

<Content>Fantastic hotel We had never heard about this hotel until we booked it on Priceline without knowing it. The staff was attentive, friendly and very polite. The rooms were REALLY nice with flat TVs, very comfortably beds, spacious bathrooms and great complimentary beauty/shower products. The hotel also had complimentary wireless internet, which I think should be a standard perk in every hotel these days. We only stayed for 2 nights, so did not have the time to check out the pool or the restaurant/lounge on the top floor. I would definitely stay there again. The management/head office should do a better job of advertising this property.The only con is the $18/day valet parking. I hate it when hotels won't let you park your own car.

<Content>Nice Hotel We stayed at this hotel for 1 night Aug.10, 2006. Our stay couldn't have been better. I had read previous reviews and asked for a room on the opposite side of the 405. Loved the decor, pool, outdoor fireplace,etc... We arrived late and had a great nights sleep, noise was not a problem. Liked being close enough to Beverly Hills, Bel -Air, Sunset Strip, Hollywood, etc.. Front desk was very helpful printing our boarding passes  additional directions. Looked at reviews of other hotels on Sunset Strip, etc.. but all seemed to be dumps or overpriced for 1 night. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>A 50-50 experience We stayed here recently while moving our daughter to college. It is a chic little hotel but with some pros and cons to consider.PRO: The decor of the hotel is well done, the pool area is very nice and the room size is adequate (given the shape of the building). For our purposes, the location was perfect: midway between UCLA and the ocean, right below the Getty Center, and close to Beverly Hills and other points of interest. And, it only took 20 minutes to get from the hotel to LAX during the noon hour.CON: The air conditioning in our room did not work. We told the front desk once, we told them twice, and nothing. And no offer to take anything off the bill. Incredibly poor customer response on their part. And, while the air is nice and cool at night, opening the balcony door was a terrible option because I-405 is a 24-hour noise machine. While the hotel looks great during the day, it may have been the worst three-night sleeping (or lack thereof) experience in my life.We will be travelling to LA regularly over the next few years. While the Angeleno is in an ideal location for us, I would say that the odds of us staying there again are at best 50-50 given the poor customer service to a mechanical problem that they did nothing about.
