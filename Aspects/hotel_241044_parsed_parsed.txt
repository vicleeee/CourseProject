<Content>Very nice and different! Loft 523 was a wonderful experience! Very modern, large, luxurious rooms. We actually liked the fact that the hotel (outside of the actual rooms themselves) was sparse with few of the normal hotel amenities (there's no pool / exercise room, large lobby with many staff, coke  ice machines, breakfast, etc). After all, why would one stay in their hotel for very long in NEW ORLEANS?! The bathroom was especially large  nice; ours had a wonderful tub and open, walk-in shower with 2 shower heads. WIFI worked great as well. It's also in a nice location, in our opinion - quiet, sleepy street only 2 blocks or so from the French quarter. The front desk people were very friendly and helpful. Their car valet parking was also excellent - the car was always delivered within just a couple minutes from when we requested it. We highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Very good place Booked through bookit.com. the room was smelling like bleach. The very nice guy at the reception gave us another room and upgrade us to a bigger one, as we were asking for a bathtub. Great place to stay if you like modern architecture and if you don;t need a room service. Very quiet (away from the French quarter) and relaxing place. Didn't hear any noise from the trendy bar downstair (it was a Saturday night). Will definetely stay there again. The woman at the front desk in the morning was vry nice and helpful.

<Content>Spacious and trendy All I can say is WOW!! Loft 523 was amazing!! The rooms are extremely spacious with the most incredible bathrooms. I love taking baths so the extra large spoon tub was perfect. I can see why so many celebrities stay there being that it is a small hotel and even a little hidden with no sign out front. I truly felt like I was in my condo and not a hotel room.As for the lack of service I was worried about because of some of the reviews...I do not agree. The hotel only has 18 rooms so they have one concierge at the desk at all times... don't see why it needs anymore than that. Everything I needed and requested was delivered by asking the helpful concierge. During my stay I needed ice, dinner reservations, extra towels and assistance with my luggage. All of these requests were handled promptly with an extremely friendly and knowledgable staff. The hotel does not have a restaurant but you are in New Orleans with fabulous restaurants everywhere...trust me you will not go hungry. We even ordered in one day for lunch from their delivery menu book they had in the room.I would definitely recommend this hotel to hip trendy people looking for an unforgettable experience.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel And Staff First and foremost the room and hotel was excellent! The room was very large and spacious and the bathroom was to die for! I never wanted to leave my room. The hotel staff was very helpful and everyone was so very nice. Like someone posted earlier Loft 523 has a sister property literally 2 blocks away called International House Hotel. They have fruits granola coffee and different types of tea there for guests. Although the rooms at loft 523 have coffee pots in them. I have no idea where all these bad reviews are coming from. We never experienced anything like was stated before me. The bar was rocking every night we were there and we heard nothing coming from the room and we were in 2E...one floor above the bar. So definetly recommend this hotel to everyone out there. It is a very hip and modern hotel that not many people around know about.

<Content>Loved it ....fun place I stayed at Loft 523 for the first time on March 2nd. It was a great stay. The room was spacious and the bath tub was great. Actually, the tub was my favorite spot because it was spoon shaped and you can just lay back. The room had a flat screen TV and surround sound. The hotel is a small hotel so I only saw a few people which is good for me because I did not have to wait for the elevator. The bar is fun and happening. The hotel is wireless and there is a computer in the lobby. The front desk is helpful and very friendly. They are very informative about the weather, restaurants, clubs, and tours. I will definitely be back to stay here in the future.

<Content>Trendy Hotel I just wanted to comment on some of the hotel updates...although my friends and I were not able to stay over night at this hotel our time their was not that bad. We were able to check-in our hotel and get a room (the wrong room! our penthouse suite was being renovated due to plumbing problems so we were moved into a smaller room which would not accomodate 5 females and then moved to IH, the sister hotel) we did use the shower and toilet and had no problems (room 300) and the beds were great the front desk lady great, we really wanted to stay because it was very cozy, with a great bar and spacious hotel room just not enough bedding) Previous reviews stated construction with the lobby which is finished. Although the loft hotel and IH hotel use the same staff they are literally 2 minutes away in walking distance so its not a hassle to get assistance at anytime. A concierge came and got our luggage and moved our things between the hotels while we showered in the loft room and changed. As far as food, its new orleans who wants to eat hotel food in a great city like New Orleans...the hotel is located really close to bourbon so finding a great restaurant is not hard at all. The hotel is in the middle of everything Harrahs is to your right on Canal and Bourbon to the left on canal with great mini-shops and stores along the way. The hotel has wireless internet and the desk inside the rooms definitely come in handy for a laptop. Its very quiet and it only has like 15 rooms its great, check it out!

<Content>Can't prove the reviews wrong I must say, before I went to this hotel I thought some of the reviews were a bit harsh and fully expected I'd have a wonderful experience. I have to say now, most of the reviews are right on.The good: The rooms were generally good. Super comfy beds and well appointed furniture. We started off in a larger Superior room, but moved to a smaller room for a larger window and balcony. DON'T spend the extra money on the larger room, the standard size room is more than enough, and the bathroom was actually a little better. More Good: We were in NOLA for new year's, the same time as the Sugar Bowl. This hotel was extremely quiet and a nice break from all the craziness outside. The front desk staff were all helpful and really nice. There's also free internet access.The Bad: Just like others have said, service isn't so great. The staff is shared with the I Hotel, so there is no staff in the hotel except the front desk person. The housekeeping was subpar. An empty bottle of water was never removed from the nightstand for our whole stay (I know it's obnoxious but I left it just to see). All housekeeping did was make the bed and change the towels. Coffee and creamer weren't replaced, things weren't straightened up. More Bad: Like another reviewer, we had problems with our toilet which wasn't fixed. I actually had to go into the lobby to use the bathroom in the morning! There were also issues with our billing, and my husband ended up getting charged about 4 times.Overall: I would stay here again if my options were limited, but I'd be sure to ask for a room facing the front of the hotel with a balcony or large window. I do think it's overpriced - it's more expensive than I hotel and they actually have the staff.

<Content>Should Have Read The Reviews BTS (before the storm), we lived in NOLA for 6 years and have now replanted in Baton Rouge. We LOVE NOLA and every time we have an excuse to go down for a few days, we splurge: stay at a different hotel and eat at a new restaurant each time (with some old stand-bys too!)...WE USUALLY LOOK FOR THE BEST DEAL...But this time, decided to SPLURGE...and I FORGOT TO CHECK TRIP ADVISOR FOR REVIEW...Going off one friends mention of the hotel, we looked at it online and were suckered in...space, loft, spoon bath tub, luxury...AND THEY DELIVERED ON THAT...but what they don't have for a 5 star? is service, amenities, positive attitude. If you want to do anything other than sit in your room (I know you don't go to NOLA to work out, but going to spa, gym would have been nice for at least one hour), you have to walk outside to ihotel (thought it was connected, my bad); The mini-bar had a decent little menu, just no items.the shower pressure was less than desired...had to ask multiple times for blanket...mattress H.A.R.D.LOTS OF ROOM THOUGH...B.I.G. ROOM.NOW: IF YOU WANT PRIVACY, THIS IS YOUR PLACE...there's only 5 rooms on the floor (we were on 4th so no noise from bar) and we never saw any other guests...were they there??? I've heard that celebrities stay at the PH, and i'm sure they get service...was it a horrible stay? no, have had worse, but not at 200/night. But won't stay there again.

<Content>do not stay here While the hotel has nice rooms, the service was poor. My toliet did not work for 2 of my 3 night stay; the room was never clean; the balcony was dirty when I checked in and remained that way for the entire stay; and the soaps, etc were never replaced. Although I never complained, the hotel wanted to charge me for an extra night when I missed the 12pm check out by 5 min, even though the hotel was empty the next day.

<Content>Disappointed Big Time Without going into exceptional details, the good is the room was exceptional and the staff friendly, but not very useful.The bad goes from continuing details of no light bulbs, burnt out light bulbs, lukewarm water, no access to conveniences (they just are not ready to be open) to the major item of the Music from the bar until 3:00 AM the base seemed to shake the building. We paid extra to stay here over the Monteleone or Chateau Sonesta our New Orleans favorites and won't bother again.

<Content>Loft 523 is a different but great option First of all, Loft 523 is on a non-descript block, with no signage or address. So be sure you know where you are going. The room was large, modern and comfortable. Concrete floors, 12 foot ceiling, floor to ceiling windows, huge bathroom with walk-in open shower, surround sound stereo/CD/DVD. Bed and linens were comfortable. Downsides: our room was lousy for hot water, and the bar downstairs is a hip nightclub, with loud dance music, and throngs of people spilling out of the club into the street. We were on the third floor, so no problem with noise. I would hate to get stuck on the second floor, though. This is definitely not a cookie-cutter chain hotel. Summer prices made this a fantastic bargain. Highly recommended for those looking for something different.

<Content>An Unlofty Experience I have stayed at many hotels in New Orleans, and this is the worst hotel experience I have suffered there in the post-Katrina age.To give the pluses, the room itself was incredible and the staff, although somewhat limited, was fairly friendly. Unfortunately, the charm ends there.The website gives the impression that it is connected to the Ihotel, but except for the staff, we saw no evidence of it. For ex\ample, we called the front desk on our first morning to order some coffee and breakfast. We were informed that they did not have room service. Needless to say, we were disappointed. The Loft bills itself as a cool and luxurious property. But they did not even offer a continental breakast that are offered at limited service hotels.Parking: The hotel charges $30.00 per night for valet parking, which is almost three times the amount charged by other hotels in the area. To make matters worse, they contract their valet service. When we called for our car on Saturday afternoon, we had to wait over 20 minutes for it to be brought to the hotel.Room Deficiencies: Our room came with a DVD player; however, there were no cables to connect the player to the television. When we talked to the front desk about it on Friday night, they assured us that we would have cables by the following day. Instead, they removed the player and did not provide a replacement. Also, the water temperature in the shower was tepid, and we could not adjust the position of the nozzles.Housekeeping: We left our room on Saturday morning at 10:00 in the morning, and retuned at 3:00. The room was not made. We wanted to rest before dinner, and asked the front desk to have housekeeping clean at 6:00. A few minutes later, the housekeeper called us on the phone and said that they had no housekeeping service after 6:00. Thus, we had o leave the room for 30 minutes while they serviced the room.NOISE: The hotel has a bar on the first floor. Despite the fact that the hotel was not near capacity, we were placed in a room just above the bar on the second floor. On both nights, we were kept awake by noise coming from revelers who were standing outside of the hotel after the bar closed. On both nights, we called the front desk to ask them to quiet the crowd. On both nights, we were told that there was nothing they could do about the situation.We considered writing a letter to the owners/managers of the hotel. But, we would not stay at The Loft again even if we were offered several free nights. I caution anyone coming to the New Orleans area to stay away from this sad joke for a hotel.

<Content>Ready for service? I was a bit suspicious to not see any recent reviews or or press clipings regarding this exiting property in New Orleans, so I decided to give them a call before booking a reservation.Hotel is up and running, but still isn't 100% following the dreadful events of 2005. Front desk personel couldn't give specifics over the phone in regards to the overall condition of the hotel, but did say that things are still being worked out and are under repair.Overall, the information regarding the hotel's condition didn't sound too promising, so it would be unlikely that I would book a stay there.

<Content>credit card fraud The first room we were assigned was on the 2nd floor right above the pump room. It's hard to believe a boutique hotel like this wouldn't spend more on soundprove. I stayed there in July but in August, one of the emplyee manually keyed in my credit card number. The credit card company reported this as a fraud. I would never return to this hotel nor recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Loft 523 We would return We just got back from Loft 523. We stayed there for Part Duex of our honeymoon. Both my husband and I really enjoyed our stay at this boutique hotel (only 18 rooms). Here are the Pros and then the very few Cons:Pros:The front desk people are all very accomodating and nice. We love the fact that this was an old warehouse turned into loft style rooms. We loved the high ceilings. We loved the furniture and decorations in the room. We loved that the maid left music playing after she was finished. We loved the bar. Very sleek and nice and on Friday nights it was jumpin'. We loved most of all, the spoon tub. If you stay here do yourself a favor and just upgrade for the experience of the tub. Cons:The walls were a bit thin and you could hear people down the halls. At night there was a very strange swishing sound. I have no idea what it was, but I had a hard time falling asleep sometimes because of it. Lastly, Magazine street in between Gravier and Canal has too many street people that would stop and try to swindle you for money. It is best to take Camp Street up to Canal to get to the French Quarter.Restaurants: Pat O's always a favorite same as Cafe Maspero and Pierre Maspero's. Sweet Ginger (thai) was excellent. The coconut shrimp is supreme. The Bourbon House was excellent as well. We also enjoyed Johnny's Poboys (all though we saw roaches on three different occasions, yuck!) It is hard to get a poor meal in this town. Overall, we will be back, we always come back to Nawlins

<Content>Relies too much on the cool room decor I give Loft 523 four stars only because the rooms are undeniably cool. The high, high ceilings and spaciousness of the rooms make up for a lot if you are a self-reliant sort of traveler. The king-sized bed was extremely comfortable, with a great chenille blanket on top for extra warmth. I have not slept so well in a while. The tub was extraordinary; don't miss taking a bath if you stay here. It takes a long time to fill up, and in our room at least the hot water took quite a while to get hot, but it's a great hedconistic experience. The bathroom, overall, is quite nice and very large. The towels are rough, though. Throughout the room, the lights are all on dimmers, so you can set the level that fits your mood. Keeping the temperature in the room steady was a challenge, but that's New Orleans. There's a lot of variable humidity. The climate controls were very responsive, and there was a big ceiling fan in our room with adjustable speeds which helped cool the room off in a hurry.The chaise and chair provided were uncomfortable. The television swings around so you can watch from bed or the other side of the room, but the other furniture was so stiff and unyielding that we watched from bed most often. The floors are concrete, which is surprisingly cool and comfortable on the feet.As far as noise, we were right over the bar and facing the street and were not disturbed at all. However, the bar was closed the first two of the three nights we were there, and we live in Manhattan, so we're used to street noise. I must say, I was tensed up about the third night having read all the reviews that mentioned the noise from the bar, but there simply wasn't any. I didn't have to use the earplugs I brought in anticipation.As stated before, there are no facilities in the hotel at all. If you want to order breakfast you have to put your order in at least two hours in advance. Dinner room service is brought in from the restaurant in International House around the corner, the sister property to Loft 523. We did not order any room service at all, nor did we drink the coffee in the room (take the walk to Cafe du Monde instead; it's worth it).There is also very little information in the room itself. There is the ubiquitous folio in the room, but when you open it, expecting to see information about the area, the hotel, etc., there is very little. What is there is an unfortunately long paean to the design of the hotel, etc. We also found it difficult to get information and assistance from hotel staff. Although no one was rude or unprofessional, it seemed like there was a bare minimum aspect to the service. If you are the kind of person who doesn't need pampering and can ask for exactly what you need, you will be fine. Do your research before you go.I think this hotel needs to step it up a notch. The level of personal attention and service needs to match the excellence of the room design. It's a smashing concept for a hotel, but everything else falls slightly short of expectations. I'd be curious whether the International House has the same minimalistic approach to customer service.I still recommend Loft 523. It is in a good location, within a short walk from the French Quarter and the Aquarium. There is a mission around the corner, so some impoverished-looking people are often hanging around on that street. They are quiet and don't bother anyone, but if you're a bigot or a snob, you might be uncomfortable.

<Content>Interesting but noisy We stayed at Loft 523 February 25-27 2005. Like others have mentioned it can be noisy particularly if you stay in one of the front rooms. Our room faced the street and the noise was quite incredible.We did not experience the bar noise although we were out later than the bar was opened. On the subject of the bar - its nice but you never know if or when it is going to be open.The staff here were quite friendly and helpful.Paying for coffee in a room - that is a first for us! Get real.The room was very big and quite different. Very nice experience.If you book - ask for a room at the back.

<Content>My first choice in Noleans I've stayed at the Loft 523 six times now. I go down to Noleans every month, and there is no other hotel for me; not if I can help it. It is the first hotel I can really kick back and relax after a long day. I need the space, the lack of clutter, the comfortable modern bed and a sound system other than the alarm radio clock. The staff's always taken care of my needs when asked. During busier periods, I've asked for rooms out back and received the complimentary upgrades without so much as a question.I don't dispute the fact that street noise does migrate into the front rooms easily, especially if one stays there during the various festive seasons that attract party crowds (Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, etc) ... but if one goes down for that, one has to remember that the crowds rule; so plan accordingly.Anyways, I'll keep coming back like clockwork.

<Content>Good but not Great Loft 523 is one of the more imaginatively designed hotels I have enjoyed, despite a few problems. While the bar noise never penetrated our penthouse sanctuary, I can readily understand why other commentators would be upset. Water pressure and temperature weren't great but neither were they awful. The hotel has no food facilities; if you want breakfast in the hotel, the only option is room service.We liked the location and found the desk personnel to be friendly and helpful. I would consider staying there in the future.

<Content>Must stay in New Orleans Loft 523 is a must stay in New Orleans. After staying on Bourbon Street across from Rick's Cabaret, Loft 523 was a welcome change. Located just far enough from the Quarter to give you some piece of mind. Stayed in a fabulous loft style room. Every detail had been tended to. The bed was glorious, audio and visual equipment to keep one entertained and a fabulous seating area and porch. The bathroom was huge with both an enormous tub and shower with dual shower heads (not available in all rooms). This is definitely a hotel to run away from it all. I loved it!

<Content>A peacefull retreat off the beaten path This place is as wonderful as the description on their website says - very peaceful and zen like, with hints of the old architecture still evident in most of the rooms. The bed and the linens were some of the best I've ever slept on and the bathroom is gorgeous - all in a cream colored limestone. That being said, the hotel website is misleading because it leads you to believe that in each bathroom there is a wonderful spoon tub and a big two person shower, and when we checked in we were told that most of the rooms were either one, or the other. My fiance and I opted for the more practical shower. The water pressure isn't that great either. We were not given a personal concierge when we checked in, but the hotel staff were very knowledgeable and friendly, so it wasn't a big deal. We stayed during the week in a room on the second floor that I believe was right above the bar, but we didn't have any problems with the noise as past reviewers have mentioned. Also, nothing is for free, even the coffee in the rooms and the minibar item prices were (not surprisingly) expensive.The location is ideal, you aren't right in the French Quarter, which can get quite loud at night and the rooms are spacious, we saw a hotel room at The Historic French Market Inn and it was a third of the size.

<Content>The Big Easy I had already made reservations for three separate business trips when I came upon this site and all its reviews. Despite the common complaint of constant noise, I figured I should still take the chance since I liked the idea of spacious, open rooms with modern furniture instead of the usual horribly uncomfortable antiques.It paid off. The off-season is spectacularly quiet. They put me in one of the back rooms (they even upgraded me to the superior room) ... one just has to ask beforehand. The place is walking distance to a whole slew of good restaurants like Rene's Bistro, Herbsaint, Cuvee, etc. Plus, I brought along a couple of dvd's so that I could really kick back and enjoy the room  its surround system. To address other review's ... water pressure was fine, alarm clock's battery promptly replaced, friendly downstairs staff (I don't need my personal concierge).I'm already looking forward to the next stay. Will report how the noise levels develop. Recommended!

<Content>Modern Boutique Hotel with Huge Clean Rooms I stayed at the Loft 523 last weekend and was highly satisified. The rooms are very large and clean, with a meticulous modern design. The stereo surround sound cd/dvd system and wi-fi internet hookup were much appreciated. The Hotel is located conveniently within a few blocks of the French quarter, the St. Charles Trolley Line, The Canal Street Trolley line and the Magazine Street Bus line. Regarding noise, I found it to be quiet always, except on Friday's Hip Hop night which caused a slight vibration in the walls (I was two floors directly above the bar). But it was not anywhere near as loud as I expected and I slept like a log anyway. Regarding concierge services: the front desk staff were quick and accomodating. I found that their information was sometimes not 100% correct. ie, I was told on a particular Sunday that all but a few shops on Magazine Street were open, and after getting there, I found that all but a few were closed. But overall, I was treated very well by the staff and would rate this place high and I would return.

<Content>Very Good Weekend The rooms at Loft 523 are great. Plenty of space, comfertable and all the amenities you would need. Our room was on the fourth floor. At night, you can hear the thump, thump thump of the lounge on the first floor. When the door opens to the lounge to the outside and you are staying in a room that looks out on the street as we were, you will hear the noise for sure. The location of the hotel is great. Not right in yhe French Quarter, but a block away on a quiet pretty street. The hotel staff is friendly and knowledgable, although that whole personal concierge is not really true. Never offered, never mentioned.

<Content>Ripped us off - Bad Service Although the rooms are lovely at Loft 523, beware of what they try to charge you. There were problems with our booking - they had no record of our booking and they admitted that this was their fault. We were told that we could have a room for two nights for an extra $35 per night. When we arrived home we had a credit card bill for $241.50 as opposed to $70. They are now saying that we have to pay $75 per night plus $35 per night on top of what we had already paid!! They have not been very helpful about trying to sort this out so check your credit card statements carefully when you get back home!!

<Content>Never on a weekend Stayed here for a few nights in February and found the noise to be unbearable. Even on the top floor the music from the lobby bar was shaking the walls until the wee hours. The combination of concrete flooring and a huge gap under the door amplified all the hall noise as well.The water was not hot enough and the pressure was low, making the beautiful tub less of a pleasure. Also: the staff entered our room incessantly.Sure the rooms are large and modern, but I wouldn't recommend it - unless you are an unperturbable sleeper, and never on a Friday or Saturday night.

<Content>Warm and discreet...best spot on the street...LOFT 523 is sweeeeet... We stayed at the Loft for our honeymoon in June of 2003. Upon our arrival we were warmly welcomed by 'greg'- white guy behind the reception desk - and offered to upgrade our room to one with more bells and whistles for a few more pennies. *A note about 'greg' (i am not 100% sure if that is his name) he was definately the best staff member working at the Loft that we encountered during our stay. He was helpful in every single way, bending over backwards to give us proper information, directions, suggestions for dining and shopping always with super friendly charm and great hospitality. He definately made our stay in N.O. at Loft 523 more comfortable, familiar and welcoming. We loved the privacy of the hotel and the fact that it wasn't submerged in the French Quarter but just a hop, skip and a jump away. The hotel's atmosphere is one of space, stylish decor and cleanliness which is carried throughout its entirety. Our room was located on the 3rd floor and faced the street. We never had a problem with the 'big parties' downstairs in the lounge. Ocassionally we went down to join the festivities, have a few beverages and get our groove on with the dj's rythems. Our room was wonderful. The bed, which we still have to get the name of, was one of the most comfortable we've ever slept on. The bathroom was fabulous with the spoon tub, double headed shower system and quality amneties. Having our own dvd/cd player was excellent as we rocked out to our own tunes and also enjoyed cd's by local artists supplied by the hotel (great idea). Creating mellow moods and warm atmospheres in our room was greatly aided by superb lighting and fixtures. All in all our stay was fantabulous!! Highly recommended for easy going folks.

<Content>Cool place to stay Went to New Orleans for Valentine's Day weekend to stay at the Loft 523. My fiance and I enjoyed the low-key staff, modern rooms, and even the club downstairs. Granted if you don't like that type of music in the club, a light sleeper, or go to bed early in New Orleans, you are not likely to enjoy it due to the pounding beats vibrating through the building (we were on the fourth floor and heard sounded like we were just one floor above it). We thought the rooms had the right touch and we felt that it was very private in every manner there. We recommend you stay there if you don't plan to go to sleep before 2 or 3 and feel like being discreet.

<Content>Disco Club 3am music--Not a Hotel--Don't Expect to Sleep Completely dissapointed by this terrific looking boutique hotel. Stayed for a four day weekend. While the chic minimalist decor was cool (entire hotel is no more than 20 rooms), this small hotel is really a nightclub in disguise. In the lobby bar, the hotel operates a nightclub with live DJs every Friday and Saturday night--music until 3am. When we called at 1am on Friday night to complain about the Hip Hop party (loud music and pounding beat that shakes the entire hotel) we were told that there was nothing they would do about it and they refused to stop the music. They said that the Hip Hop party is a regular feature of the hotel. If you are unlucky enough to have a room facing the street (about half of the rooms) you were forced to listen to the noise from the crowd gathered downstairs at the velvet ropes. The crowd noise was almost as noisy as the music. We were unable to call downstairs to complain because the only front desk attendant left his post to hang out at the bar--there was no one at the front desk for half an hour--providing no hotel security whatsoever. When I arrived in the lobby to search for the front desk attendent at 2am there were two other guests waiting as well. The hotel management was completely unapologetic and said that the bar is an important part of the business--a rather crazy answer for a hotel. Preparing to go out to dinner the following night (Saturday at 7), we noticed that go-go dancers were arriving with DJ for another party. When we inquired, we were then told that in addition to the Friday night hip hop party, there was a 70s party every Saturday night. Somehow the hotel management forgot to tell us this when we experienced problems with the hip hop party the prior night. The manager then rudely told us that we could switch hotels to a hotel near the airport because the entire city was booked an there was nothing else at any hotel including the hotel they owned--International House. Throughout the entire weekend management was rude and unaccomodating and lied about the situation. We inquired what we were not informed of the nightclub situation when booking the rooms, the manager finally admitted that the nightclub noise has been a problem and that they might tell guests upfront in the future. We subsequently learned that the nightclub also hosts various parties on other nights as well. There are so many decent hotels in this city--why would you choose one that values it's nightclub business over its hotel guests and makes no attempt to accomodate at all. Just off the top of my head I would recommend these hotels that I have stayed at: W, Omni Royal Orleans, St. James, Omni Royal Crescent, Fairmont, Ritz-Carlton.

<Content>Like dating a supermodel... Yes, this is a beautiful hotel, but aside from that there is nothing. Service: abysmal (you are supposed to be assigned a peronal assistant to cater to your every whim...I got a phone number which was always busy and a front desk that could care less). Noise: Constant (until 4AM, front desk unapologietic, room on 3rd floor as if on the dancefloor). Room: Large, well furnished and stylish, but the sink, toilet and bath all overflowed. Management was receptive to comments upon check out, but acknowledged that the hotel was having trouble with staffing/noise/growing pains. In the end, not even close to worth it.

<Content>Not Your Ordinary Hotel Out of all the hotels I've stayed in in N.O., this was by far the best. I enjoy a spa bathroom and upgraded to the Superior room which has the spoon tub. Yes, it is big enough for two people (maybe even three). They even had Aveda bath salts to use in the tub. The size of the room and bathroom were a definite plus. Any request we had (wine glasses for the bottle of wine we brought, a taxi which produced a limo service) was met efficiently. The only negatives - elevator was out of service part of the first night which meant taking the stairs to the 3rd floor, and the shower above dripped into our toilet but was resolved within minutes of calling the front desk. Fortunately, we never heard the bar - either it was all the fun we had on Bourbon St. or there wasn't much happening. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for somewhere to stay out of the ordinary.

<Content>Not on Cloud 9.... Close enough to the French Quarter but without the crowds or smell. Loft 523 is a very unique property. Just look at it s website and you ll see a hotel unlike any other. That s their draw. That s why I stayed with them. However I wish someone had cautioned me about the following:As mentioned in a previous post, the bar/dance club can get quite loud (and it's not jazz). The second floor would be tough for all but the deepest of sleepers. Even on the fourth floor, I was hard pressed to get to sleep before 2am due to a combination of music, shouting and car horns. I heard partying continue on the street until past 4am! Cars would cruise on by and compete with the DJ on who had the loudest system. I was even able to hear a woman s footsteps from four floors up very poor soundproofing. Try to get a room in the back if you don t plan on partying the night away.WARNING: beware of their valet parking. It is outsourced and the service robbed me blind. On top of the $26 per night cost, the parking attendants will go through your vehicle and steal anything of value. They took all the change from the center console (including a couple bills hidden for an emergency), a couple CD s, a knife I m still trying to assess all that they stole. Make sure you clean out your vehicle or they will. And for you International Hotel visitors they utilize the same valet parking company....

<Content>For the hard to please! I truly enjoyed my three week stay at Loft 523 in The Big Easy. There is a great sense of privacy at Loft 523. I was not bothered once except for the occasional autograph. What I like about this hotel I did not feel like I was in a hotel room. Loft 523 came highly recommended to me and I highly recommend it to others especially those who spend more time traveling for their careers and subsequently living out of a hotel room the majority of their 365 days a year.

<Content>Loft 523 - very nice Stayed here in 9/03. This hotel delivers, providing a large room with a New York style. The extra-large living space was a nice change from the ordinary. The bathroom was very nice, with limestone tile work and dual shower heads. 32 inch TV with DVD and surround sound was a bonus. Downsides: if you stay on the 2nd floor, you may find the music from the bar downstairs to be obtrusive. Also, as mentioned in an earlier review, amenities which you might expect in a hotel of this price are available but not on-site. Overall, a great hotel in a convenient location.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel This is absolutely the most wonderful place! The rooms are huge(600+sqft) and well decorated with high quality Italian modern furnishings , linens,bath products and all the tech toys you could want. The bathroom is large enough for a party, with an amazing duel head shower. This is a boutique hotel with less than 20 rooms (more like apartments)If you are looking for amenities like a gym, restaurant,pool etc. They are not on site. The sister Hotel,International House has a gym and lovely restaurant about a half block away.The staff is helpful, but very non-intrusive. The only slightly downside (could be an upside depending on your taste) was the beautiful and usually quite bar, is filled with local and visiting musicians on Friday nights and attracts large crowds of noisy locals. If you are a light sleeper this could impact your rest.My only regret is thats the Loft 523 is already booked up for Mardi Gras 2004!!!

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at Loft 523 for Mardis gras 2003, and it is spectacular. Rooms are huge, with all the latest bells and whistles. Staff very friendly, outstanding bar located on property. Just a short walk to Bourbon Street, Harrah's etc. Located in a safe area also. Onlky complaint was that the phone never worked properly, but that was not an issue during MG!
