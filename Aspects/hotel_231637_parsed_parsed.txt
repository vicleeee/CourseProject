<Content>peace and leisure among the crowds in a A somewhat old-fashioned or demod茅 hotel in an superb location, just some 200m walking from Puerta del Sol, between metro stops Callao and Sol. The rooms have got very good noise insulation, so you won't notice the noise of the crowds around.The buffet breakfast is way expensive for what you get, but the cafeteria has good prices and the service is excellent.

<Content>Very Good Hotel - Quite Pleased I normally stay near Cuzco, but this time I didn't have toime to make my own arrangements and thsi hotel came up on list. I knew where Gran Via was and how to get to Cuxco from it, so it was OK for location.The reviews on TripAdvisor for teh hotel were all good.I was very pleased with teh hotel and it was a lot beetter than the Shearton in Amsterdam for less than half the price.(a) room was fine and there was a view(b) Shower was the ost powerful I've ever encountered(c) Breakfast was very good - I'm picky but they had good quality muesli, fruit (ofresh pineapple etc) andYoghurt. Also walnuts to go on cereal.So all in all I was very pleased with this hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>Skeeved Out The only thing going for this hotel is the location. The room I had was horribly outdated (70's decor) and the carpet and bedspread didn't look like they had been cleaned since then. All of the other pictures of the rooms I've seen on the internet are nicer than what I actually stayed in. The 'breakfast' in the morning was horrible with virtually no selection. I was supposed to stay longer and instead cut the stay to one night and found a better deal at a 5* for less money. This place is definitely a rip off and not worth staying at even for the location. They should also reclassify the star rating as this is barely a 3 star hotel!

<Content>FANTASTIC location and great hotel We booked our stay at Hotel Liabeny based on the comments provided through Trip Advisor. We were beyond the moon pleased with the location of the hotel because its within walking distance from loads of popular tourist sites. Also, the hotel is less than a block from a pedestrian street filled with restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The hotel itself was very well decorated and the size of the room was just what we needed and the bed was really comfortable. We will be back in Madrid with family and look forward to returning to the hotel and will recommend it to all of our colleagues, family and friends because the price is very fair for what you all get, especially in a larger European city.

<Content>Great Location to explore Madrid This hotel is in a great location with ease of access to Gran Via and Puerto Del Sol. Shops are just around the corner and there is plenty of places to eat.Can understand people wanting a quieter location as night life on weekends can be busy and Gran Via not always the niciest place to walk round at night.I booked a twin room with a friend and the room was of a good size. The bathroom was also good with possibly the most powerful shower ever which i loved. Hotel was very clean and was impressed all round.Staff were very firendly and spoke good English. This made checking in and out a complete breeze which was a great relief as my Spanish is quite poor. I didn't eat in the hotel but the restaurant did look the part. Would stay here again no problem on a return to Madrid.

<Content>Convenient Location, Nice dining options, Request quiet room The location is very convenient, but if you are arriving by car make sure you get good directions as the alley to the underground parking garage is hard to find. If it had not been for the kindness of a stranger who spoke Spanish and assisted us by amazingly getting in our car and not leaving us until we found the hotel we are not sure we would have found it! On foot, it is easy to find, just off a central plaza. Request a quiet room, on an upper floor and preferably in interior. Outside the hotel, revelers revel until dawn. It's Madrid! All the famous destinations (Prado, Thyssen, Palace) are within an easy walking distance. We found the dining options in the hotel to be very nice. The breakfast buffet was great and we regret trying the dining room for dinner only the last of the 3 nights that we stayed here. The value and service were superior to places that we tried outside the hotel. Our interior room while not large was pleasant and well equipped. Maid service was fine.

<Content>Great location Location is the best feature of this hotel; it is spot in the centre of Madrid very close to the shopping areas and within easy walking distances (5 to 10 minutes) of most sights. Metro stations are close by but we only used them to get to and from the airport - which was fine but did require 2 changes and the stairs wouldn't suit those with luggage. Didn't eat in the hotel but the restaurant looked popular. Only criticism would be that the rooms do not have air conditioning. Even in early May we missed this and would not like to stay in summer! We had a room looking on to a central courtyard which was quiet but expect street facing rooms could get very noisy at weekends.

<Content>Good central location Basically a business hotel. It is centrally located, between Gran Via and Puerta del Sol. Rooms are slightly old-fashioned, but well kept, clean. Mine was on an interior lightwell - very quiet. It was reasonable size for a single - would have been small if let as a double - but judging by the floor plan most rooms seemed to be bigger. Television has BBC World News and Sky News for free. Good buffet breakfast (EURO 15 if not included in the room price). Staff seem friendly enough. If you pay by credit card, they have set up the system so that it automatically converts the EURO bill into your card's currency. The receptionist cannot over-write that. I did not check but assume that the hotel's rate is worse than Mastercard's. They also charge a 2% conversion fee - whether that is better or worse than Your card's varies from card to card (having made a point of choosing a card with a zero fee for foreign currency transactions I was irritated by this).

<Content>Great hotel and location I organised my work Christmas party to Madrid and stayed in Hotel Liabeny. The hotel were very accomodating and helpful to me before we even arrived. I had a group of 45 people and they organised a coach from the airport for us. The bus driver had all our room keys on the bus so we did not even have to check in when we arrived! The hotel was lovely and clean and so central (Gran Via). Loads of shopping and places to eat around the area. The front desk staff all spoke fluent english and were always so helpful. The breakfast was a continental breakfast and had plenty to choose from. I would recommend this hotel again and will stay here again on my next trip to Madrid. It has easy access to everywhere, good shopping, good bars and restaurants.

<Content>Perfect location - good hotel We stayed for 5 nights in October. We were a bit concerned about the 'nightlife' described in other reviews but we did not have any problems at all. We had one night when it was a bit noisy (Saturday), but it didnt bother us much. The best aspect of this hotel is the location. All the major sights and galleries are within comfortable walking distance along with most of the recommended eateries. The hotel itself was clean, comfortable and the staff were very helpful. The small restaurant was very busy in the mornings for breakfast, so I would advise getting there early. A good buffet breakfast was served, but not all the waiters spoke English, but that wasn't really a problem.We did the - almost obligitory - visit to Casa Botin to sample the roasts. It was quite touristy but worth the very short queue to get in. All the guide books recommended booking for dinner in most restaurants, but we did not find that it was necessary except for one place (see below), probably becuse we were there out of high season.The one place I would certainly recommend is a visit to Casa Patas, both for the meal and the flamenco show. The meal was the best we had in Madrid, followed by a quite magical flamenco show that was a million miles from the usual touristy shows you get on the Costas. We had to book for the meal and show,on a Saturday, to get in for the following Monday. I would recommend making a booking on your first day in Madrid if you arrive in high season.

<Content>Surprisingly elegant,,, great value Wonderful experience with only one drawback. Our first night we had a room facing the outside and the noise was terrible. We then changed rooms to one not facing the street. It made all the difference in the world. The room was clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the price was great. I would highly recommend this hotel with the caveat of making sure you have a room not facing the street.

<Content>Good hotel, excellent location We found the Liabeny to be our best hotel experience in Spain. Great location, within easy walking distance of sights or transit. Clean, spacious room, helpful service, good breakfast. There is some street noise in the area at night, but we were high enough up that it wasn't a problem. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great 4* hotel near Plaza del Sol We stayed at the Liabeny twice in August, once upon arrival to Madrid and again prior to leaving for home. The hotel is located very close to the Plaza del Sol, the subway, and several pedestrian streets lined with cafes, shops, and the Corte Ingles department store. The hotel's location was even better than for most nearby hotels since we were removed from the noise and congestion of neighboring streets, but close enough to be able to shop, dine out, etc, without taking a cab or the subway. The lobby and our room were both extremely clean. Our room had a hairdryer, shampoo, and bath soap provided. There was also a small refrigerator which helped keep our drinks cold in the heat of the summer. The AC worked well. The hotel staff was extremely helpful and offered ideas for places to see, and restaurants to try. They even offered to keep 2 of our bags in the hotel luggage room until our return a week later so that we would not have to carry all of our luggage with us when we visited southern Spain. The hotel has a very nice lunch room, and breakfast area. There were small grocery stores, ice cream stands, and small boutiques in the immediate area. We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Madrid and wishing to be centrally located yet not on a busy street or square.

<Content>Location This Hotel has a great location. The rooms are spacious and clean.The decor is a little old. The breakfast buffet is good. During the night it can be noisy. It is safe to walk at night to the restaurants and nearby bars. I recommend the hotel mainly because of its location as it is close to all major attraction and shopping. If you are driving as I was it has parking which is great as you are in the downtown of Madrid.

<Content>Nice hotel in great central location This is a very reasonably priced hotel in a great location near Puerto Del Sol and Gran Via. Rooms are a good size compared to many European hotels. Rooms are very clean with nice carpet, curtains and bed linens, decent size bathrooms and comfortable beds. Wireless internet  safe in rooms. Location is ideal for walking to all the sights, shops and restaurants. Very quiet at night. Staff were very nice and helpful. I have stayed in many 3* European hotels and this was one of the best.

<Content>Liabeny great hotel and location Hotel Liabeny has an excellent location it was perfect. Walking distance to sites and shopping, staff was courteous, room was clean and had a good size, the showers were great . A/C worked fine, we stayed in June. The hotel has a cafeteria and a restaurant, both were good. The breakfast buffet was very good both hot and cold food. You can ask for churros and they will prepare them. We had a good experience at this hotel and we would stay again at this hotel.

<Content>Rude front desk I stayed at Hotel Liabeny because of the recommendation I had seen in travel books. I was there for 2 weeks in the fall of 2006. I have allergies and had asked the front desk for a different blanket because the one they had in the room was giving me allergies and skin irritation. I also asked for one extra towel so I could shampoo my hair. The man at the front desk was very rude and said that I booked and am paying for only one person and that essentially I cannot ask for anything beyond what I have in my room. I booked at a 3-story hotel so I can get some of these special needs attended to. I travel to Spain very often and I will never stay at Hotel Liabeny again.

<Content>A happy break Just back form 4 nights in Madrid. Stayed at the Liabeny: comfortable, gd location and gt service. Didn't eat in the hotel but there are many cafes, bars, restaurants nearby. Would recommend and certainly go again. Only negative was that the room was a littel small but bed very comfortable and lots of hot water. BW

<Content>A pleasant enough stay. I'm not sure why this hotel is getting such high ratings, as while it was a pleasant hotel, it wasn't exceptional. True the location is the main attraction, and the rooms are clean and have all conveniences, but I found the waiters in the restaurant and bar very off hand, and prices for a thimble size glass of wine high in a land where wine is next to water. The concierge and reception staff are particularly helpful and the cleanliness of the hotel is excellent. If you want a nice hotel in an excellent location, close to Puerto del Sol and Plaza Mayor etc which isn't too expensive, then this is for you. I would add that Madrid was a lovely surprise - such fabulous architecture and top class art galleries and museums - a weekend is too short a visit. The open top bus is a good way to see the city, but be warned the commentary is hit and miss, mainly due to the poor quality of the ear phone connections in the seats, but I'd still recommend the tour.

<Content>Watch Out for Airshaft Rooms I found this room through Trip Advisor and booked it because of the reasonable rate. I got even less than I paid for. The room looked out onto an airshaft that was miserable. The banging of maids in the hallways was among the loudest I鈥檝e heard in some time. The hotel is getting a bit seedy around the edges. There is a gym, but it is tiny. The staff is professional, but not congenial. I thought I would rate this hotel 3 star, until I moved to Villa Real a few blocks away. It was a world of difference.

<Content>Great Location, Very accomodating Upon arriving in Madrid, I wasn't familiar with the City, but was recommended this hotel by a Cuban-American traveller on the same flight. I was happy with the clean accomodations and internet service, but what sells me on this hotel is the service of the staff. Being my first time there, I had a couple of itinerary issues which went wrong, and the staff at the hotel assisted me to great effort in resolving. I have stayed at a few hotels in Madrid, and a few more in Spain. From my experience, the staff at this hotel was the best of any of the hotels I stayed at. In addition, the hotel is in an excellent location, a short walk from Puerto Del Sol, and numerous other points of interest. When we would leave out in the mornings, we would stroll down to Gran Via and grab breakfast Zahara's Cafe off of Plaza de Callao, or one of the other restaurants along that strip, a short walk away, and grab a bite. I will stay there again in the future. It has a well trained polite staff that makes the greatest impression on me. Richard Hagen, Chicago, Illinois USA

<Content>Reasonably priced and reasonably comfortable The staff let us in about 1:30 p.m., which was very kind, but staff were pretty busy and one concierge, at least, spoke no English. Our room was so small! It had the basics we needed, but the bed was not very comfortable and we felt very crowded. Hey, I know this is Europe, but it still gets to you. What a tiny little bathtub!The location is just fine. We had a room right in front on the first floor, but the noise was not a problem. We ate breakfast one day but at 14 Euros apiece, it was most assuredly not a good deal. The buffet was small and ordinary. I do stay in hotels more than 100 nights a year, and I would compare this in quality to a Best Western or a Comfort Inn.

<Content>Great location, comfort, service, and value We spent 2 nights here in a standard room on the 6th floor facing the front.The room was not noisy; the hotel enjoys an excellent location on the edge of a pedestrian zone that runs from Puerta del Sol to Gran Via. It is thus both central and quiet. The accommodations were spacious by European standards and modern by American standards. We paid 133 euros per night for the room. The hotel has a cafe and a restaurant. We ate breakfast a la carte both days and a lunch once and found the food and service to be good. The desk personnel were entusiastic and helpful. The concierge was asked to provide a good nearby seafood restaurant and recommended Tres Encinos, which exceeded our expectations. This is not a deluxe hotel but it provides everything one needs at a fair price. And the location is superb! I would definitely return to this hotel again.

<Content>Looks a bit unloved and tired from the outside I have just spent a weekend in Madrid. I didn't stay here (see my review of Senator Gran Via) but I passed this one on the street so I thought I'd mention it doesn't look great from the outside: old, dusty curtains hanging in the window. On the plus side it's in a great location and on a quiet steet.

<Content>Great in Several Respects I was a guest at the Hotel Liabeny from 28 Dec 05 thru 01 Jan 06. It was a terrific choice in several areas. These include:1. The location - you can't beat how central this hotel is. It's less than a 5 minute walk from the Metro stops at Sol and Gran Via.2. Room rates - I paid 95 Euros per night for 3 nights booking through the hotel's website. Over the New Years weekend, many hotels in Madrid were increasing their rates for Dec 30 and 31. I had one consistent, reasonable rate for all 3 nights.3. Room size - I had a single room with one twin bed. The bedroom area had storage for one suitcase, enough room to walk around a bit, a chair and desk, and a flat screen TV. There was a good sized closet that contained an in-room safe. The bathroom was plenty big with good shower pressure. 4. Ambiance - despite being in the center of Madrid, the room was very quiet. There was no view, but the ability to sleep peacefully more than made up for that. Room was also very clean.I never ate in the hotel's restaurants. There are too many good choices in the area. I was very pleased with the choice of the Hotel Liabeny.

<Content>Eh.... It is hard to understand why this hotel is rated so highly. True, it is very close to the Puerta del Sol, Plaza Major and major shopping. Our room was averaged size, perhaps a bit small for American standards. Housekeeping was ok. Nothing particularly the matter, but neither did it strike me as sparkling clean. The third bed for my teenage daughter was actually a chair that pulled out to be a sleeper. It was pretty small, even by roll-away standards. I realize this is unavoidable in Spain, but compared with hotels where we later stayed, the room smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke. Service at the front desk was very warm and professional. The attached restaurant / cafeteria was fairly low grade. Avoid this unless there are no other options.

<Content>Great Hotel! The Hotel Liabeny was a real gem. The rooms were great as was the service. Staff was friendly and helpful. The location was great -- close to Puerto del Sol and shopping. The breakfast buffet was good but overpriced (which seemed to be standard at Spanish hotels).

<Content>Great place to stay! We checked into the Liabeny after a couple of bumps in the road with another hotel, and were absolute delighted with accommodations. Ended up taking a junior suite for 196 Euros, which was fabulous - marble bath, sitting area, beautiful linens, etc.Also, the most marvelous food and service in their restaurant that we can remember at any hotel that we have ever stayed at!Marvelous room service, and reasonably priced!Highly recommend this hotel - 4 1/2 to 5 star comfort!
