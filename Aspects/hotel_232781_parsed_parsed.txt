<Content>Excellent hotel, amazing value! The Hotel Europark has a great location in the Eixample district -- just outside the hustle and bustle but within easy walking distance to the main drags of Barcelona, or one block to a subway stop that can take you anywhere else. It's also one block from the Concepcio market, which has numerous fresh meat  produce stands, a supermarket and an electronics store.The hotel itself is beautifully renovated, and I found my room and bed exceptionally comfortable and nice. Usually this would cost a fair amount, but I got an incredible deal on six nights there (granted, in the offseason). With a relatively small but excellent, multilingual staff, it seemed, their prices can probably undercut some of the competition. The complimentary newspapers and Guia del Ocio are a nice touch.There was still renovation work going on during my visit, mainly on the two guest elevators, so guests and staff had to share the freight elevator. But it wasn't a problem, and the lift happened to be one of the nicest freight elevators I've seen.

<Content>Great place Just got back from a couple of days stay in Barcelona. The Europark Hotel is a very modern hotel which has obviously just been renovated. Staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is outstanding. It is only 15 minutes away from the city centre at the most. There are many restaurants nearby, although most are closed over the Christmas period.I would totally recomend this hotel to anybody.

<Content>Good hotel, good location Chose this centrally located hotel based on the positive reviews on this site. The comments were spot on! One street away from a market, 10 min walk east to Sagrada Familia Cathedral and 15 min walk southwest to Placa de Catalunya. Good breakfast buffet, although the eggs were usually cold. So-so view from the rooftop pool. Friendly, English-speaking front-desk staff.

<Content>Great hotel, no complaints! We stayed at the Europark for 4 nights in August '08. We booked two rooms, a double and a single as there were three of us. The rooms were clean, spacious and very comfortable. An unexpected bonus was that the rooms had adjoining doors which was very convenient and made it feel as if we had one massive room. The rooms had everything you could ask for of a 3* hotel and more. Modern design, large comfortable beds, very good air con, large powerful shower, a free safe and minibar which was handy for keeping our own drinks cold. The location was in the more residential Eixample area but it was only a fifteen minute walk to Las Ramblas in one direction and La Sagrada Familia in the other. The Placa de Catalunya was also only about fifteen minutes walk away which is where we got off and on the A1 airport bus, this is a quick, easy and cheap way to get to and from the airport. You will wait no longer than ten minutes for a bus in either direction. There is no need to get a taxi. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and all spoke very good English. Checking in and out was quick and easy. They were happy to keep our bags in a cupboard behind reception most of the day as we had a late flight home. I would recommend this hotel to any one going to Barcelona. It is probably the best hotel experience i have ever had.

<Content>Perfect hotel!! We have just returned from 10 days at the EuroPark hotel, Barcelona. The hotel is perfect, the staff is very nice. We asked for a room with balcony, and that exactly what we have got. Breakfast is lovely with cheeses, eggs, fruit, pastries etc. The pool is lovely but only 80cm deep! Overall I would say this is probably a 3 stars hotel better than a lot of 4 stars hotels I've met in europe.

<Content>Defo recommend My boyfriend  I have just come back from a spur of the moment 4 day break in BCN. We usually stay at Hotel Jazz which is owned by same chain but they were full so we booked here instead.The hotel has been recently refurbished to a high standard. Contemporary, cool  comfortable. The rooms are fairly good size with good AC which is a necessity in summer. Reception staff were friendly  helpful booking restaurants for us when requested. Bathrooms don't have bath however do have large shower and good hairdryer. Iron  board is available on request and there is a safe in room. Sat TV with usual news channels but no MTV.Hotel is located in Eixample district which is mostly residential but has a nice feel to it and you will stumble across funky restaurants  cafes whilst wondering around. It's a 10/15 min walk to Placa Cataluyna and Las Ramblas. This was our 6th visit to BCN and I'm glad we stayed in this hotel as although it's not quite as central as we usually stay, it's good to stay somewhere different to allow you to explore and discover new shops, restaurants, etc.Rooftop pool is fairly small but what is to be expected for a city centre pool! It does the job of cooling you off whilst sunbathing/chilling in the sun listening to music on the BOSE speakers they have outside playing 'lounge' music.I would definately recommend staying in this hotel..

<Content>Very nice for a 3 star Just returned from a very pleasant 4 night stay at the Europark. I was travelling solo, but opted to pay extra for a double room, rather than a single. I requested a room with balcony at the front which is exactly what I got. Check in was friendly and quick. The hotel was recently refurbished and is wearing very well. The rooms are very trendy and functional. The airconditioning is powerful, and my bathroom was great, all in the black  white theme. No bathtub, but large shower with sliding doors. The room had wooden flooring and was kept immaculately clean by the maids.The pool is, as other people have pointed out, only waist deep. No swimming, but still great to cool off. At the moment there are building works next door, it looks like this will be another part of the hotel. Two out of four days there was drilling  hammering, so bring your Ipod to block this out while lounging by the pool. The noise didn't start early though, so didn't wake me up. The hotel is situated on a busy road, so if you want a quiet room, you might want to ask for a room away from the front.I didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on that. Loads of nice places to eat near the hotel though. The best thing, apart from the styling of the hotel, is it' location. In the Eixample, away from the overly touristy Ramblas. Great arcitecture around every corner. I really enjoyed walking around the Gracia area, lovely restaurants  shops, much more of a local atmosphere.There is a PC with printer in the reception area, good for checking emails, checking in for your flight.The only let down was that they wouldn't let me use the shower at the back of reception. Even though an earlier review stated that they were offered this option. in fact, this remark is what made me decide to book this hotel. A bit petty not to let guest, who have checked out in the morning but don't have a flight until in the evening, use this to freshen up.All in all, a good experience, and great value for money.

<Content>Great Place to stay!!! Me and my girlfriend stayed in the Europark Hotel from the 11th of July 2008 to the 13th of July 2008. It was a last minute booking that was made due to the terrible weather in Dublin.We arrived at 11:00 am on Friday morning and we were checked in and in our rooms within 5 mins. It will cost approx 鈧?0.00 by taxi from Barcelona airport (approx 10 mins) to the Europark hotel.. We stayed in a double room and it was perfect. Modern design, spotless and everything you would need from hairdryers etc to a well stocked mini bar. The room we stayed in had not got a scenic view. It basically looked onto the back of other buildings, but we weren't they to look out the window.The staff were excellent. The room was kept spotless.Unlike a lot of places when you travel abroad, the breakfast was excellent. The was so much to choose from. Everything you could have from back home and everything you would find in a Spanish breakfast. The Europark hotel is located approx 5-10 mins walk (depending on age etc) from the main designer shopping street and also from the top of Las Ramblas. It is only 5 mins walk from the Sagrila Familla (not sure of correct spelling) and all the restaurants, shops, bars in that area.You can walk to the beach (which is brilliant) but its much easier just to take a 5 min cab ride. The taxis are cheaper in Barcelona than Dublin. Actually, everything is cheaper in Barcelona than Dublin.We had to check out at 12:00 on our last day and even though out flight home wasn't until 10:30pm were were allowed to use any of the facilities within the hotel. We made the most of this by lounging by the roof top pool having ice cold beers delivered up to us!! The pool area is small but it is decked out well. We had the whole area to ourselves as the hotel didn't seem to be busy. The pool is only waist deep but it was ideal in my opinion. The roof top was a lovely place to relax and catch the last of the sun.We stayed in the Hotel Rialto before when in Barcelona and while it has a more central location (just off Las Ramblas) it didnt come near the Europark for quality.I would use the Europark Hotel and would recommend it for couples in the 20 - 40 age group.

<Content>room only perfect deal but dont expect too much else i stayed here as a birthday treat - did a deal via Opodo where one night was free and flight times excellent. i was a single traveller and was given a fairly spacious double room at the front with an excellent shower and bathroom - fresh clean towels everyday because i left card on door requesting room service - location location location with this place; just round corner from Place de Gracia main aeroport A1 bus stop plus tourist bus plus nearby train station and just near to Casa Battlo. i had hand baggage only so no probs just walking down from bus (4euro fare). DONT bother with the first floor bar for drink or breakfast - soulless and expensive with no service. there are great nearby cafe's and restaurants selling good value fresh daily food (even sunday morning breakfast) and friendly but not over friendly service. (for dinner try Madrid : Barcelona or of course queue at La Rita) couple of bars / restaurants on Catalunya from where you could watch beautiful people right near to Casa Battlo and you could get decent glass of wine plus water for under 5 euro's (Tenorimilo Brasserie i think the best one was called - Browns further down nice but tres expensive)but the best thing about Europark is down stairs public batchroom just behind reception has a full shower in it so my bags were kept under the concierge eye for the last day as i wasnt travelling till 8pm and then i could clean up properly for flight home - as of course i had had to check out of my room usual a.m. would definitely go back as great location and good value if you get a deal

<Content>Great hotel I checked the reviews on this website before I booked and found them informative. I was looking for ages trying to find a central hotel in Barcelona not too far from the city centre but just away from the noise, and this hotel was great for that.Getting to the hotel from the airport was so easy, we caught a bus outside (A1) going to the city cente which cost just over three euros and took about 20 minutes. We then had a short walk to our hotel. On arrival we were greeted by the receptionist who booked us in with no hassel. Our room was 409 which was at the back of the hotel Overlooking some building work next door, but not a problem. The room was very retro with all the furniture in black and white. The room was very spacious with a flat screen tv. hair dryer, a safe and a mini bar. Ideal for what we wanted.We found the hotel staff always helpful and willing to offer advice if you were stuck for directions. We took the option to get our breakfasts at the local cafe which was great as we sat and watched the world go by and relaxed in the sun and cheap er than the hotel.To get to Catalunya it took us abourt 10/15 minutes walking which was a great place to start your day to either catch the bus touristic which cost 26 euros for 2 days an ideal way of seeing the sights of Barcelona.You will be able to pick up a route map at various places in the city, but as a rough guide:Blue Route: Covers the South and West of the City, visiting the Old Town, the Olympic area, the Port, the Zoo and Estaci贸 Sants.Red Route: This route takes you on a tour of the North and the further Western part of the city including Sagrada Familia, FC Barcelona, Palau Reial and lots more.Forum Route: This route covers the East of the city around the Olympic Port, the beach, a beautiful park and the Forum.There are plenty of sights to see we just liked to walk and just see the sights randomly. We especially liked the cable car ride, the walk around the marina, The ramblas, the Gaudi masterpieces around the city and just taking in the general atmosphere.We had no trouble with pick pockets etc but you have to be sensible when you are out and just keep your valubles at the hotel and just take out what you need.Overall we thoroughly enjoyed Barcelona and would go back again. And stay at the same hotel.

<Content>Excellent Place! Accesibility=========Great! Europark is located on Carrer Arago which is perpendicular to the major shopping hub along Passeig de Gracia. Within 8-10 minutes walk would get you there and also to the metro station as well. Being slightly off the main biz hub also provides much needed peace and quiet.Room=====Running along the main black and white theme, the room is cosy and clean. Well laid out in terms of design and comes with all nessecities. The room service keeps the place well daily.Service======Reception speaks some English and they'd try their best to help despite the language barrier.Food  Enterntainment===================This is NOT a place to stay if you intend to party all night and struggle back in stupor. There are almost non of the nocturnal drinking hole around. There are however several modest size restaurants which provides pretty good food. Worth mentioning is La Gremal and Madrid  Barcelona.Activities=======As mentioned, it is not far from shopping. In terms of sights, it is within walking distance (10 - 15 mins) to Sagrada Familia, Casa Battlio or Casa Milla.Overall, I'd stay there again if I swing by the area again!Andy, Malaysia

<Content>5 stars for the hotel europark Barcelona was the last stop on our European Journey this past April. As many know, touring Europe is exhausting! The Hotel Europark provided us with the comfort we needed, while doing so w/ much style. Our room was chic, clean and had all the ameneties we were looking for. The rooftop pool had amazing views and was perfect for our mid day lounging. All of this was made possible because of the extremely hospitable manager and staff. Thank you Xavier for helping make our visit to Barcelona such a great experience!

<Content>Park yourself down!! Stayed at the Europark as part of a group of friends over Sept/Oct 2007. We stayed 3 nights over a weekend.The hotel is fine. Its clean and tidy and the staff were very friendly.Its location is its major plus point. Its about 5 mins from the Pasage de Gracia for all the shops and restaurants and about 15 from the La Rambla for further bars and tapas.The rooms were about average and the bathroom clean and standard white. the shower was excellent, powerful and hot.The lobby is cramped and the lifts even worse!! however i found it surreal being stood on a cupboard that takes you to the 4th floor!A good tip if you are going out for a few beers, start in the hotel bar on the 1st floor. Its not quite the view of the rambla or of Gaudis masterpieces but its very cheap and gets you in the mood with a few ice cold san miguels!I would recommend the Europark as a first or second time visitor to the great Barcelona. Its ideal for the places which need visiting in Barca. Good priced hotel.

<Content>Perfect Location Location is absolutely perfect. So close to the Plaza Catalyuna, Las Ramblas and the Sagrada Familia. You can easily walk to all of them. (My husband and I even walked back from the Park Guel.) It appears to be in a nice and safe part of town. We always felt comfortable.Rooms were tiny but clean and the bathrooms were quite large in comparison. The water pressure was great. Smallest elevator I have ever been in which provided much amusement as we tried to fit 4 of us in it one night. 3 was the max and it was really the size of an old telephone booth.It appears that major rennovations are going to take place and the hotel may actually be closed now for a while. This might jack the prices up considerably according to employees we spoke with. I hope not because it is hard to find a place for $200 a night that is in such a great location. Definitely have dinner down the street at La Rita. Line up about 15-20 minutes before it opens because they don't take reservations. Prices are very reasonable and the food was very good. Loved Barcelona!

<Content>Middle of the road This hotel is about as average as can be. The reception is very nice and depending on when you arrive you'll either be greeted by a nice young bloke or a grumpy old sod. (Manuel doesn't work here, he must still be in Torquay.)Either way, after an efficient check-in (it's 50-50 whether or not you get a smile) your first impressions will probably be dictated by your experience with the lifts. They are only suitable for a contortionist (only one person and a suitcase at a time) but if you're hoping to get close to your travelling companion, make sure you don't take the stairs, you'll literally be all over each other.The rooms are functional but small and the bed is hard. There is a bar with no atmosphere on the first floor but this hotel is generally quite cramped and you probably won't want to spend much time here. Location is OK but not as good as all the reviews make out - there are better located hotels all over town. Barcelona is not really a value for money city, but I think this hotel is over-priced. It is basic and generally OK, but I have had much better hotels elsewhere for the same sort of money. Also, this hotel didn't even include breakfast in the price, which was a bit mean.Pluses? Free internet access in the bar and the nice receptionist says the hotel is undergoing work to expand it next door to add a swimming pool and gym and more space, so maybe this is one for the future. (By the way, we never heard any work going on and traffic is bearable - for us it was the bed that made sleeping uncomfortable.)You could probably do better, but if you're OK with average then this mediocre hotel will do.

<Content>Noisy, noisy, noisy ... Clean hotel, but my God so noisy. Cleaning ladies keep on knocking on the door until you open it ( no Do not disturb - signs). You hear the traffic clearly and when the other hotel-guests come back to the htl at night. Very good location though.

<Content>Value for money My boyfriend and I found this neat little hotel on lastminute.com and it was great value for money. Nice and clean and tidy. Staff were helpful - not particularly friendly but they werent hostile either. The location made up for it.Everything is in walking distance and I absolutely HATE walking! You can gather from this that everything was quite close by -- 5-15 mins walk to most places or 5 mins to the train station or bus stop.Some reviews have mentioned the fact because the hotel is on a major road it can be quite noisy. However, we were on the second floor, facing the road and didnt have a problem. Also, although the rooms are small, we didnt feel cramped and only really came back to the room late at night to sleep. Wasnt in the hotel during the day so cant tell you much about the food there but someone on TripAdvisor recommended a restaurant about 3 mins away called La Rita - thanks, it was fab! I recommend the deep fried baby squid!Would def stay at the Europark hotel again!PS: Buy Time Out's guide to Barcelona!!!!!!!!!! It is absolutely great!

<Content>fine for a base in the centre we have just returned from a fabulous bank holiday weekend in Barcelona. We booked europark because it was cheap (we booked very late) and central...takes about 10 - 15mins to walk to Las Ramblas, the same to Sagrada Familia in the opposite directions, 10mins to Bari Gothic, about 40 mins to Parc Guell (yes, we walked EVERYWHERE!)we just wanted somewhere to provide a good base and that's what Europark did - the room was smallish but the bed was a decent size, as was the bathroom (good power shower and comfortable mattress), we were on a side street so very quiet...the neighbourhood feels very safe to walk around in. It was very clean and the staff were very friendly...letting me stumble on practising my spanish and catalan when their english was perfect!we didn't eat there or use the bar so i can't comment on that.Only two downsides were there is no natural light so we easily slept right through the 1st morning and on our second night we found 3 baby cockroaches running around on the floor!!not a romantic hotel or one where you'd spend lots of time - but if you're going to barcelona to spend it in a hotel, you are in the wrong city!!

<Content>Really liked EuroPark--absolutely recommend Hotel is modest and simple but it's very clean and located in quiet area that's convenient for walking and experiencing Barcelona. I found the majority of the staff to be VERY kind and helpful, though they do appreciate it if you attempt to speak Spanish and are a reasonable person. We had a lovely terrace that was a great place to decamp nightly and relax before dinner and enjoy the sunsets. I don't know how one can complain about that and I personally noticed that some of the guests seemed rude and demanding of the hotel employees--which angered me more!The man at the desk was fab as my friend NEVER received her luggage and he went to great lengths to assist us in making calls and attempt to negotiate with the airport bureaucracy.There is a very convenient internet/tv room that you can use for free and have coffee and a drink. We never ate the breakfast--as it seemed too pricey--but the lady made us coffee every morning and was absolutely lovely.They are doing construction to expand the hotel and modernize and I have a feeling that once that happens price will go up considerably but otherwise, I would recommend this place for sure! And, don't stay near the ramblas--it's so touristy, noisy and full of drunken, shady characters. I really love the city--it's ideal for folks who like to walk and experience amazing architecture, art, design as well as a seaside location. Also, I'm a New Yorker and definitely found that you have to be careful. My friend had her wallet stolen on the way home at the airport...so heed the warnings!

<Content>Good value for money. OK, so the hotel staff dont act like you're their best mate but why should they? We found the staff to be pleasent enough (maybe this was because we tried to learn a little Catalan!) The lady who served us at the bar was very nice and even gave us a bit of help with pronounciation!The hotel was always clean. The location is ideal. The area felt very safe. Overall our stay was very good and we have recommended this hotel to friends and family who are considering a visit to Barcelona.

<Content>Location is the draw I stayed here for 5 days last week. This isn't a place you stay for luxury. You stay because of the central location. In fact, the location couldn't be better. It's so close to Passeig de Gracia, and the metro stations. The other travelers at this hotel complained of street noise- what do you expect, you're in a major city! I had a single room facing the courtyard, so I wasn't subject to too much noise. The only noise I encountered was the sound of people slamming their doors and the loud American family staying next door (I'm an American and this is a plea to other American travelers- PLEASE do not embarass the rest of us, who are respectful, sophisticated travelers. I thought it was an entire group of students traveling. Much to my shock, it was one family of four making all that obnoxious noise. Unbelievable!) Anyway, there's a great market virtually next door (Mercat de la Conceptio) and a few coffee bars, and a lovely bakery. Skip breakfast at the hotel and go to the bakery or a coffee shop nearby. I agree with other travelers- La Rita restaurant (2 blocks away) is an absolute MUST. My only regret is that I went there my last night and didn't have an opportunity to go back multiple times; but, it was a great meal to end my great trip. The prices were shockingly low- I couldn't believe the quality of the food you got for such low prices. I've been to many 4 star restaurants that cost far, far more and I haven't enjoyed many of the meals as much as this little gem of a restaurant. Don't bother asking the front desk anything. They act like you ask for their kidney when you're only asking them a simple question. The front desk is cold, rude and utterly unhelpful. I may stay here again, just because of the central location, but the rooms are very small, and my experience with the front desk sort of tainted my experience.

<Content>Probably not the best deal for that money Me and my boyfriend stayed there for 3 nights during the New Year period.The location very good, even if it is on a noisy prospect, double windows did not let the sound to reach us. It is winter time so no need to keep the windows open, what I believe would be a bigger problem in summer time. The room was very clean, lots of hygiene stuff in the bathroom, the beds are made daily and towels refreshed, but the bed was not that good as I expected. Two twins insted of one double and the wheels kept the beds separating all the time, that was so annoying at night. The furniture pretty aged, one of the chairs was nearly broken while sitting down, and we could not watch the TV without an extra payment. The same with the breakfast - 10 euros per person, what, I think, is really overpriced as the breakfast was just continental, even if the choice was quite rich. The staff friendly except of the quite miserabe receptionist in red jacket. Besides, our reservation sheet was saying that we were supposed to have a room with a cityview, but we were given the one facing the next building windows, and that made us keep the lights on all the time as it was so dark i the room. Overall average satisfaction, I would say, as I believe I could fine a better deal for that money.

<Content>Great location, safe and close to all I just spent 3 nights at the hotel Europark with two friends. I found the hotel's location close enough to walk to the Passeig de Gracia and then onto La Rambla and enjoyed that it felt much safer returning after dark than had I been in the Barri Gothic. I had a triple room on the 7th floor, with windows facing the courtyard in the rear. Probably because of the location I didn't experience any of the street noise that others complained about. Also, with the triple room it may have been larger since the room comfortable fit three twin beds. Clean bathrooms with good water pressure and heat for three women showering in the morning. Room safe and minibar also available. I would definitely recommend the hotel to others who don't mind a 15 minute walk to most any site in town.

<Content>Small Rooms, Noisey, Value for Money Hotel is located in an excellent position with easy access to major city centre attractions and metro link. However the position on a very busy road in Barcelona means you don't get much sleep, unless of course you like the sound of scooters racing down the streets at 3 o'clock in the morning. Rooms are very small and lifts struggle to accomodate more than one guest and a suitcase. Reception staff were in the main helpful although not very talkative.Breakfast (although extra) was good with a wide range of foods.Overall, good value for money hotel in an excellent location but small and noisey rooms. Advice........take some earplugs.

<Content>Beware--booking problems Our reservation was not honored at the Europark Hotel, even though we made the booking a month in advance and even after confirming with the hotel a few days before our arrival. The reason they gave us was construction next door forced them to close a whole floor. We chose Europark Hotel specifically for its location--the sights were within walking distance from the hotel and even made restaurant reservations a block or two from the hotel. Upon arrival, the staff informed us that there was a problem with our reservation and that we were being transferred us to a sister hotel, Nunez Urgell, in another part of town, same hotel, 4-star. They were rather cavalier about the change, when in fact they were moving us from the elegant part of town to a business district. (In fact, the Nunez Urgell was surrounded by automobile dealerships.) When we protested, they offered free breakfast for our inconvenience sigh. We would have transferred to another hotel, but we were tired and had an early appointment the next day.Needless to say, we are very disappointed. This experience ruined this part of our vacation.

<Content>Great Location and Value for money Just back from a week in Barca and stayed in Hotel Europark. This hotel is in a great location - 10 mins to La Rambla - and is great value for money. Breakfast was nice, cold buffet etc and the staff were friendly. Rooms clean with AC.I would definitly recommend this hotel if you want a vacation in the heart of Barcelona but don't want to break the bank. And with your spare euros you can shop till your drop!

<Content>Good choice in Barcelona. We were looking for a quiet hotel away from the main attractions in Barcelona and were very pleased with the Europark. It is only a 10-15 minute walk from La Rambla and a short walk to the Girona metro station. The room was modern and air-conditioned and generally quiet - we did experience some normal street sounds, but nothing really disruptive. The staff were reserved, but when asked questions, were very helpful and detailed in the information provided. The computers were always available for free internet access. We would definitely recommend this hotel. Barcelona was VERY crowded with all the cruise ships in port!

<Content>Good Location and Value Stayed at Hotel Europark for 3 nights while visiting Barcelona in April 2006. Stayed at the hotel based on reviews from trip advisor. I was pleased with the accomodation. The room was small ,comfortable and clean. Stayed in a room that faced the back of the building that looked onto the back of other buildings. I did not mind this as the room was quiet from the street noise. The only complaint was the noise from other people closing doors with loud slams occasionally.The hotel has internet access which was free but you might have to wait as they only have two computers to use. I would recommend having breakfast elsewhere as there are so many places to eat and pick up nice breads, sandwiches or croissants.The hotel is in a central location and is about 5 blocks walk to the streets called Passeig de Gracia and La Rambla. On the same street as the hotel is a restaurant called La Rita. Had one of the best meals of my whole trip at this restaurant and the best part is the price was so reasonable. I highly recommend it. I enjoyed my stay at this hotel and recommend it as I was looking for a place that was reasonably priced and in a good location and Europark fits the bill! Have fun in Barcelona!

<Content>Good Value Good location Recently spent five nights at the Europark and had a good experience. Room was clean, comfortable and adequate size for my needs - which was primarliy to sleep. Bathroom was clean and quite functional. Location is good - you can walk to either Girona or Passeig de Gracia station which is where I usually went since the conection to other Metro lines is better.Front desk was helpful and provided good info on local restaurants - go to La Rita - about 3-4 blocks away. Good food and great price about 22 euros for my dinner which included salad-entre-dessert coffeee and wine.Also try Mussol down by Psg d Grac.Business center is OK - wireless access is not great but they will give you a static IP address for a standard connection which ultimatley worked great.Ask for an upper level room as the noise may be troublesome on lower floors.Breakfast is good - 10 euros may be a little steep but the convenience adds to a good start as you'll not waste time going elsewhere. Good selection of foods.I returned back after 12 on several nights and felt safe.BTW - if you speak Spanish the experience is that much more pleasant

<Content>Good location and value We just returned from a six night stay at the EuroPark Hotel. Room was decent size and clean. Bathroom modern and clean. We were located on the 8th floor, far above the busy traffic street. This might be a problem on lower floors. Noise does carry from room to room - not intrusively though. Front desk merely a holder of keys - no help with local information. Great location - 5 minutes to Girona station. I would stay here again. Did not eat the breakfast as previously suggested. Many little spots around the hotel to eat at for 1/4 the price.

<Content>Great value  My wife and I had occasion to spend 6 nights at the Europark and we were thoroughly satisfied. In our eyes, the hotel provided an unbeatable combination of outstanding location and good value for the rooms. We depended on TripAdvisor reviews to pick the hotel in the first place and we were not disappointed. The room was kept clean, adjacent twin beds are simply a fact of life in European hotels, free Internet access was readily available in the bar on the second floor, the lifts were small but we considered them quaint. We followed the reviews and did not buy the hotel's breakfasts. But less than a block in one direction is a sizable basement supermarket and a convenience store is less than a block in the other, both on Carrer Arrago. Of course, there are several small restaurants nearby as well. Within 10 minutes walking distance are the Sagrada Familia (not much to see inside), La Pedrera (rooftop is worth price of admission) and Casa Batllo. The Placa de Catalunya is a leisurely 20-25 minute walk. We recommend the T-10 metro ticket. We initially used it to get to the Placa (Girona is the nearest stop to the Hotel) but we eventually decided it was faster to walk (changing metro lines can mean a lenghty walk). We also recommend the Bus Turistic (17 euro/ 1 day). Not only is it an excellent way to get an overview of the city, it also comes with a very valuable coupon book which has discounts for just about everything you might want to see. The bus also stops at least 2 places (Parc Guell and Tibidabo) which are difficult to get to otherwise. Also recommended is a Las Golondrinas 1.5-hour harbor boat ride, and day trips to Girona and Montserrat (use coupons for all 3!) Finally, a taxi ride from the airport is about 25 euros, more than the guide books say. Barcelona is great, enjoy!

<Content>Budget hotel This is a budget hotel. The public areas, my bedroom and bathroom were clean, although the surfaces in my room had not been dusted for quite a while. The staff were pleasant and helpful and spoke reasonable English. The room was not very soundproof. I could hear the man in the next room coughing. we were also woken up a couple of times in the night by people returning to their rooms and using the toilet, talking etc.The breakfast was basic. A selection of cold meats were avaialable with cereals, fruit and toast. A self-service buffet operated. Smoking was allowed in the breakfast room, but this is very common in Barcelona. There is a pleasant small bar on the first floor where you can get a drink, sandwiches and use the internet (free). Unfortunately that was also smokey.The hotel is on a busy road (but all roads in Barcelona are busy). It is around a 15 minute walk to Las Ramblas. Best to take a taxi from the airport as the train requires a change of station to get near the hotel.For a budget hotel it was clean and acceptable. However, I would not return due to the lack of soundproofing.

<Content>a nice hotel we booked this hotel for our two day trip in barcelona. Because we came to barcelona from girona airport, it is quite late when we arrived. Fortunately the hotel is near the bus station and the reception is helpful.The room is good and the temperature is central-controlled. The toilet and bath is bigger than our expectation. The hotel is some blocks away from the central street and near the metro. The hotel is quite small from outside, you should remember its street number otherwise you may be lost to find it because the nearby blocks are all look almost the same. Anyway enjoy your trip.

<Content>Excellent choice, value, and location for a weekend in Barcelona This hotel was booked with a Travelocity air+hotel package from Newark airport and was one of the lowest priced options actually in the city. The hotel was in the beautiful L'Eixample area several blocks from the in-progress Sagrada Familia church (a must see) and the Passeig de Gracia shopping district. The rooms were the largest we've had in a big European city and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was fine as well with all the amenities including hairdryer, though the room had no clock radio. It featured an in-room safe and soundproof windows which kept out all the loud cars and especially motorcycles from the busy street outside. Breakfast was not included, and while tasty, not worth the 10E per person cost. A short walk away is a farmers market with several places to grab a cup of cafe con leche and a pastry or bread, or numerous coffee shops. Two metro stations were a short walk away with one offering rail to destinations outside the city on the Renfre lines. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and we were very happy with the four nights we spent over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. I'm glad we didn't stay in the more busy (all night long) Las Ramblas vicinity and had a quiet place to sleep. Barcelona is easy to get around and offers numerous sites in all areas. We were glad it was a 15 minute walk to the Gaudi houses Casa Batllo and Casa Mila (La Pedrera) and plenty of restaurants were nearby. A quick metro ride (and 15 minute walk) gets you to Park Guell, and the Mediterranean beach area near Olympic park is just as close by. Also, make sure you don't miss the fun Fat Tire Bike Tours to get a feel for the city. The hotel staff speaks English (though try some Spanish or Catalan to be friendly) and we had no problems to report. Enjoy your trip!-Scott

<Content>Its fine for a base to see the sights We went to this hotel for the August Bank Holiday weekend 2004 following an internet booking through expedia in the UK. (Room only basis). To be honest there was nothing wrong with this place as a base to see all the sights. We had a room on the front of the hotel overlooking the very busy main thoroughfare (Av Arago) the noise from which is considerable, though the double glazing and air con meant you didn't need to open the windows too often. Bathroom was a bit worn out but adequate. There are two lifts in the lobby (each with only enough room for two people) but it never seemed to be a problem. The whole place was clean and tidy. There was a baggage store and bathrooms on the ground floor if you need a freshen up prior to any later flight home. Out of the front door a few blocks to the right you get to the main shopping/tourist area and a few blocks to the left is the sagrada familia. If you are coming in from the airport by train go to Passeig de Garcia rather than Sants. You can walk to the hotel from this station. When you come out of this station walk up hill (inland) (past some of guadi's most famous buildings till you get to the Av Arago and then turn right for 3-4 blocks ( as described above but this time the other way). You will find hotel on the left. The area of the hotel seemed pretty safe including at night and we didn't see any beggars unlike in Catalonia Square and Las Ramblas. If you have any walking difficulties the 3-4 block walk into the centre may be tiresome but for everyone else no problem at all. (You wouldn't fit a wheelchair in the lift). Anyway it is easy to hail a taxi outside the hotel for you lazy people but we just stolled back to back to Passeig de Garcia in a matter of a few minutes which is also on the metro system. We found a '10 journey' ticket fro the metro useful and really good value. All in all nothing fancy but clean and a bit like a basic Novotel inside. No complaints.
