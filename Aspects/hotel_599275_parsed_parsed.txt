<Content>Good Hotel Booked a package through Eurostar, a nice modern hotel near the peripeherique, 5 mins walk to the metro and then 15 mins into the centre of Paris. In the centre of conference / tradeshow town so could be busy. A good room, clean and tidy and attentive staff. A check in problem was expertly and politely solved. bar expensive and you are better off taking breakfast in a local bar than the hotel (15 euro buffet anyone?). Recommended for a long weekend, we'll stay there again.

<Content>Very Pleasant Stay Had 3 nights at this hotel. Very clean, pleasant staff, loved the room although a bit small, the bathroom is lovely and stylish. Enjoyed using the spa and swimming pool. Stayed in room 202 no view from the room just a motorway didnt get any noise though as they had double windows. Would definately recommend.

<Content>FANTASTIC HOTEL After spending a lot of time going through hotels/reviews on tripadvisor, I finally settled on this hotel and I鈥檓 so glad I did! This hotel is fantastic! I鈥檓 quite fussy when it comes to hotels but this one ticks all the right boxes. The hotel is very modern and the rooms are nicely decorated. We were in Paris for our second wedding anniversary and the room we had was very nice, relatively spacious with nice bathroom and a separate toilet. Pros:Very nice/modern hotelClean hotel/roomFriendly Reception StaffThis hotel is NOT in the middle of nowhere! Less than 5 minutes from train station (Port de Versailles) and 10mins to the centre of Paris.Loads of restaurants across the road from Port de Versailles station.VERY nice breakfast room. Good quality buffet breakfast. From the entrance of the hotel, turn right to the side street and within 5 minutes of walking, you will find at least 4 pizza restaurants, Chinese restaurant, 2 pharmacies, 2 mini supermarkets. Further along, there is McDonalds, KFC and more Italian restaurants.Cons:Absolutely Nothing!I WOULD definitely stay here again!

<Content>huge disappointment Based on the reviews we expected a pleasant stay. Our stay however turned into a big disappointment. The hotel standards do not really meet 4 start hotel. There was not a minibar in the room. The air-conditioning was not working properly, so it was very hot in the room. The hotel does not have a restaurant and there is not a room service in the evening. Moreover, dressing gown disappeared from the room after the first day. The bathroom necesaries were not supplemented (shower caps, etc.). The hotel also asked to charge for our stay already in the middle of our stay, which was really radiculous.The only advantage of this hotel is the location close to the exhibition halls, however, for the services it is offering, it is far too overpriced.We would never stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Great Hotel Very good hotel and is perfect if you want to visit the Exhibition centre as it's walking distance. We stayed to visit the Paris Motor Show. The hotel had very helpful and friendly staff. Had a choice of three pizza restaurants over the road, although not much else close by. The hotel has a pool and jacuzzi, although didn't have time to use them. Overall a very good experience.

<Content>Superb hotel This hotel is although stylish and very modern, although it does lack a parisian feel. The room was of a good size, we opted for the comfort double room. The shower was powerful and has the option of a hand held shower head or an over head rain style. There was a seperate toliet room with sink. The room has wifi, which is not too expensive and a selection of channels from various countries; including BBC 1 and 2. The rooms, as you'd expect from a four star hotel were cleaned everyday and to a high standard. We arrived at 11 o'clock in the morning and although check-in was at 2 due to us e-mailing ahead we we're allowed to get our room key straight away. The staff at the desk were friendly and spoke excellent English. The bar was expensive and we only went there once. The cocktails despite being expensive were very nice and although there is not a restaurant at this hotel they serve a selection of snacks. The large terrace is beautiful and well looked after. It is permitted to take your own drinks bought from a local shop and food onto the terrace, which a lot of people staying at the hotel took advantage of. There are also a couple of vending machines in reception, containing a selection of snacks and sandwiches. These vending machines were cheaper than the shops around the corner.The pool and gym were perfect and something that is hard to find in other hotels in Paris. There is a jacuzzi and endless pool jets, these made the pool area rather noisy and I personally found it hard to relax. The pool was also rather cold despite being heated. There are two hammam steam rooms attached to the changing rooms, one for males and one for females.When we went there were road works going on outside and there is a motorway right outside the hotel. To combat this there are two double glazed windows between you and the noise and this worked effectively.I would recommend this hotel, although I personally on returning to Paris would look for a more central location.

<Content>Great hotel at a great price We choose this hotel based on the reviews at tripadvisor, based on the very good price ($200 per night for a double) and because it offered broadband internet in the room at a low cost. We were not disappointed with our choice. The hotel is new and modern, with broadband internet, LCD TV, minibar and a very nice bathroom. The rooms were clean and the people at the reception friendly. We didn't really use any of the hotel facilities because we were leaving early morning and coming back late at nigh. The location of the Hotel is nice and feels safe, although it is quite far from any of the major sites. The metro station is just a 5 minute walk though. There are some exhibition grounds very near the hotel but they had no exhibition at the time we visited. If you go to this hotel then you might as well check if there is any exhibition there. Also we noticed at Google Maps there is some small waterpark nearby, although we didn't use it. Overall this is a great hotel. We would definitely use it again unless we find another hotel which is as nice at the same low prices but in a more central location. I doubt such hotel exists though.

<Content>Merci Beacoup Great place. The room was fairly small but the bathroom was very stylish. I have not seen that design anywhere else. The metro line 12 was very close about 5 minutes. The number 8 line looks deceptively close on the map but it is at least 15 minutes away. It goes straight to Concorde but it is not worth it. Stick to 12 for all your trips.The breakfast was included for us but it was very poor. Don't bother if you have to pay. Eat out.There is an Indian restaurant called Kamal (I think) near metro 12. It has a rickshaw outside. The hostess is very nice who speaks English, French and Hindi. High quality food.Did not feel threatened walking the streets but we were in our hotel by 10pm

<Content>Amazing hotel I have only just come back from the hotel. Although I booked it via Trip Advisor I was sceptical of the quality of the hotel and location. The hotel is VERY smart and looks incredibly modern. The rooms are all equipped with a bathroom and a seperate shower room. The shower rooms are within the bedroom but seperated by a glass panel. The lighting in the room is amazing and you can choose plenty of options. The location of the hotel isnt as bad as a few people have mentioned. It is closest to Porte de Versailles which is on the end of the Metro line 12. It takes about 15 minutes (if that) to get bang in the centre of Paris. This really isnt a problem. The area around the hotel is pleasant. The restaurants arent great and I would avoid the places which dont look too tasty. The pizza place across the road (looks just like Pizza Hut) do buy one get one free on pizza for take away!!We didnt drink at the pool bar as it was incredibly expensive..but for a 4* hotel, what do you expect? Plus, Paris is very expensive as far as capital cities go. Be very careful of the metros etc for pickpockets and suspiscious looking people. I would advise anyone to stay at Oceania. The staff and amenities and choice of breakfast is fantastic.

<Content>Fantastic Great Hotel!Large pool with endless pool jets at the end. Has great spa plus 2 hammam sauna style things.No need for a car. The velib' bikes which you can hire across paris have a station 100m away near the metro station. There is also a tram and bus. Didn't hire a car but noticed that Avis is just across the road.We found the number 80 bus better as it goes through ecole militaire (the end of the eiffel tower park), Champs Elysees and finishes quite close to Montmatre. It seemed quite quick as well.So would highly recommend taking the bus instead of the metro into town.Rooms were great, TV had french, german and British stations including BBC 1, BBC 2 and Sky News.If you want food theres a pizza restaurant and takeaway  chinese takeaway just across the road. Theres a KFC, Mcdonalds, a large supermarket and more restaurants a 10 minute walk or 1 metro stop at Convention.

<Content>Clean, Stylish and great location I stayed here on a surprise trip to Paris for a romatic weekend with my boyfriend, who booked the BA flights and this hotel on Opodo. It was my first trip to Paris and we had a fantastic time!The hotel room we had was spacious, had a comfy bed, great flat screen TV with lots of channels, including BBC1 and BBC 2. The shower is great too, but the free shampoo etc in the shower makes your hair v.dry. The curtains are amazing and make the room v.dark, so set an alarm or else you won't wake up!The pool was a bit cold, but there is a steam room that warms you up. There was some building work going on by the pool, so the route to get there was a bit strange, but all fine. Don't take your towel from your room as there are plenty down by the pool for you to use.We paid for the breakfast which was great and there was a huge variety. Staff are very helpful and speak good English. However, on the Sunday we spent the day at Disneyland Paris, and the hotel said there were no direct trains/buses from there to CDG airport, yet there was! A TVR train from the metro at Disneyland to CDG airport takes 11 minutes and was 24 euros each - a lot quicker than the 90 minute bus that stops off at all the hotels on route to the airport.The hotel itself is about 200 mts from the metro and easy to find. There are some roadworks outside the hotel, but these do not create any noise.I would definately stay here again!

<Content>Great hotel We booked this hotel on lastminute.com through a 'top secret' hotel deal, and were not dissapointed at all.The hotel is a little out of the way, but only 2 minutes walk from the metro - which is very fast  frequent. I think it took about 20 minutes from the centre of Paris, and less than 10 minutes from Montparnasse. Our room was a standard double, which had plenty of room - but wasn't huge. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the en-suite was fantastic with an incredibly powerful shower plus a rain shower. All were spotlessly clean.The leisure facilities are also very good. The pool is pretty small, but has counter current system for swimming. The jacuzzi and the steam room were great to relax in after spending the whole day walking. The buffet breakfast was very nice, but quite expensive at 15 euros. We had breakfast locally on our first day there - but there aren't a lot of cafes in the area. I'd recommend going into central Paris where there's a nicer atmosphere.The staff all spoke very good English, and were very helpful. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Understand Your Location If you are staying at this hotel, it is important to understand where you are staying and why. This is a very nice hotel. The rooms are very modern and clean. The amenities are very nice. The rooms are definitely superior to most others you will get at this price in Paris. The staff is friendly and speaks fluent English. So if you are you looking for some place nice to stay at where you are close to your convention with nice amenities where you can pop back and forth to the convention and have a really clean, modern room, then this is the perfect choice.However, if you are hoping to experience Paris on top of your convention, then this is not the place for you. It is in the middle of nowhere. If you plan on staying up past 11:00, forget this place. All of the cafe's nearby are closed by 11:00 and there is absolutely nothing to do. Even before 11:00 there are only limited choices. This is a convention hotel and the sidewalks, such as they are, are rolled up very early in the evening. Those cafes and restaurants you will find nearby are limited in both selections and embience.If you plan on getting up early and catching the metro downtown to see the sights and then getting back and going straight to bed, this is probably OK for you. The metro is convenient and you can get to most major sites fairly quickly. If you like the night life in any way, even just to sit at a cafe and enjoy the evening, do not stay here. There is no night life here. Everything is closed.Personally, I would not stay here again. The metro can take you to the convention center fairly quickly from a hotel further down the line and you will have far better choices for what to do when the convention ends at those places than this one. The absolute dead feeling of the area around this hotel kills off the feeling of being in Paris for me, and that far outweighs the relative moderninity of the actualy hotel. Give me a dirtier hotel in a lively area over the cleanliness of this hotel in this dead zone of Paris.But that is me. If you don't plan on staying up late, then this will probably be a good choice for you. Just be forewarned about the area. There is nothing here. Bring a book. Expect to go to sleep early. It is dull here.

<Content>Beautiful weekend in a beautiful hotel. I booked this hotel back in November for March 13th - 16th. I chose it based on reviews and hoped for the best. Needless to say I was not disappointed. The rooms are a good size for a Parisian hotel. Bathroom and shower are fab, and there was maid service daily. The hotel staff were all exceptionally helpful, allowing me to practice my less-than-adequate French on them and speaking in English if I requested. We got a deal with the Buffet Breakfast included, and that was lovely. I expected having to get up super early to avoid the rush before all the food was gone, but the choice was great and the food was bountiful irregarless of what time we went (between 7-10am). It buffet included Bread, croissant and pain-au-chocolat, selection of cold meats, hot bacon, eggs, sausages, fruit salad, fruits, yoghurts freshly squeezed juices, cheese and spreads, and lots of variations of coffees and teas and more. The area itself is quite nice. Porte de Versaille is in the South of Paris (get the dark-green Line 12). Any Irish passengers travelling with Ryan Air to Beauvais are dropped by bus to Porte Maillot in the West of the city. It's just a matter of walking around the shopping centre immediately infront of the bus depot, getting the yellow line, changing at Concorde and down to Porte de Versaille. There's quite a few Restaurants nearby, some better than others but that's up to personal taste. The hotel is pretty visible when you surface from the metro line. It's a particularly nice area. Walking along the street to the left of the hotel's entrance, there are plenty of shops (usually open until 8), bakeries and more restaurants. There's aso a vibrant market that sells local produce and clothing etc. We bought snacks and wine and spirits in one shop in particular and saved an absolute fortune. We brought it for a picnic in the Trocadero Gardens while taking a break from strolling around the city. I wouldn't recommend the bar in the hotel, not because it has a bad atmosphere, but because it's ridiculously expensive (12euro for a Jack Daniels). All in all a fabulous weekend, and to top it all off, my boyfriend proposed!

<Content>All great, except staff We booked our room on ratestogo.com a week before we left and got a very food price for this 4* hotel.We arrived very late due to a delayed flight so we got a taxi from Charles de Gaulles airport which cost us 50 euros.We had some trouble with our hotel room - we got moved as our TV didn't work, then got given a key that didn't work - and the staff were overall quite rude and unhelpful regarding this.The rooms however were lovely - modern furniture, the comfiest bed I have ever slept on in a hotel, a great shower and they were kept extremely clean. The TV is a plasma and has plenty of channels and radio stations.The location is great - a 20 minute journey (5 min walk, 15 mins metro) into the centre of Paris, and quiet. Even though it is on a main road, the double glazing blocks out all sound from the outside.We never ate breakfast at the hotel due to the price but instead found small caf茅s in Paris to eat. The pool in the hotel is a lovely heated pool with a large jacuzzi and we found it perfect for relaxing after a long day navigating Paris via the metro (which is very well set out and very easy to use)Overall I would recommend this hotel for it's location, rooms and facilities (although the bar was overpriced), but be prepared for unfriendly staff.

<Content>Fantastic!! Stayed at this excellent hotel for three nights and found it to of a very high standard. The trip by taxi from gard de nord (came by eurostar) to the hotel cost 25 euros and too about 20mins through rush hour traffic, be warned, the paris taxi drivers will try and fleece you so be warned. Could have got the tube to the hotel but didn't want to carry my luggage in the tube. The hotels room are as shown and are very comfortable and clean and are cleaned to a good standard. th TV channels are plenty and enough to keep everyone entertained. The tube system is easy to use and the nearest metro station is only a few minutes up the road and easy to get to. The only downside of the hotel is the breakfast, its absolutely horrible and a complete rip off at 15euros each, there is plenty of places to eat near by and there is a Mcdonalds about 10mins on the left of the hotel. Otherwise a fantastic hotel and easy to get to see the sights of paris via the metro system...

<Content>Seriously good value, seriously good Just back from a couple of terribly pleasant days in Paris, welcome relief after a terrible irish summer, but unfortunately brought some rain with us.Fourth time in paris, and having stayed in some dodgy joints over the years, Oceania was a complete change.The hotels is modern and stylish (apparently only open in its current guise for the last 2 years). The reception was friendly and very ,very efficent. Thankfully my pitiful attempts at spoken french were met with fluent english. Staff here in gerneral are A1Our room was fantastic, styish, spotless, and extremely comfortable. The showers, as mentioned on another review are a delight (worth the price alone). Despite being only metres from the periphique, there was no traffic noise, due to the sound proofing. Briliant air-conThe bar and pool complex are very stylish. The pool, spa bath, and steam rooms are fantastic. Breakfast is buffet style, and can be eaten in the breakfast room, or out on the deck over the pool. V Tasty. The deck area is a little urban oasis. Bar is nice, pricy though.The location is slightly out of town, but still only 20 mins to Champs Elysee via metro. Metro and tram stops only two minutes from hotel. Tip: If your coming from CDG airport, take the RER B to Cite Universitaire, and take the tram from there. The rack rates quoted were much higher than what we paid, but they would have been worth it.Great Trip, Thanks Oceania

<Content>Nice modern hotel, near Metro with bar,pool, gym and parking My wife and kids loved this hotel. We'd originally stayed at the Classic which is just around the corner but they didn't like the lack of a communal area which, coupled with the fact that the hotel is on the outskirts of Paris and so lacking the wealth of local nightlife, prompted us to move. When I showed them this one they just loved it. The rooms are not large - but that is common for all the Parisien hotels - but it is very modern, clean and quiet (the windows are quadruple glazed!). The basement has a large bar area from which you can watch the kids in the pool. We got a fantastic deal through ratestogo.com (140 euro's per night) however even if you paid the full price of 285 euro's I still think you'd be satisfied. The breakfast - although pricey at 15 euro's - was very good and the service excellent. There's good parking undeneath the hotel at 15 euro's per day. We ate at the Italian restaurant just around the corner (turn right out of the entrance and around 100 yards on the right) on three out of the four nights we were there. Highly recommended by all of us.

<Content>Great Hotel, Poor Location. We stayed here the week after Easter, 2007. We found this hotel very welcoming with friendly, helpful staff. The staff also spoke good English. The room and bathroom were very clean. The room was small, but not a problem and the bathroom had a large, powerful shower. This is a great hotel, but location was a hindrance as it is situated about half an hour away from the city which meant that when we were out for the night we had to get the train back at 11.30pm (as the stations closed at midnight). The 15e district is quite dull and quiet and places seem to close early in the evening.Tip if this is your first trip to Paris-purchase a 'tourist' ticket at the train station as this works out a lot cheaper for travelling each day. We had a fab time in Paris, but again location of this hotel was not great if you planned to go out in the evening.Alison  Michael, Omagh, Co. Tyrone, Ireland.

<Content>Made me love Paris even more ! I was with a tour group from Greece when we checked into the Oceania Hotel. We didn't have a problem with the fact that it was a bit out of the way of Paris' centre because our tour bus was our source of transportation. We were told, however, that a train ride to the centre wasn't more than half an hour, which is pretty acceptable. When we walked in, we were greeted by big chairs and couches in a sitting aread while our stuff was being gathered. Once in the room, I was in heaven beacuse the sheets and matresses and pillows were so comfortable ! haha I couldn't believe it. The comfortors especially. The rooms were small like most European rooms, but then again, they weren't suites or anything. The room was so nice and modern and had a big screen plasma TV with wireless keyboard on the wall across from the beds. The cable was alot better than in most hotels, the TV had so many channels ! ALSO, really nice was the bathroom. A picture could probably do it justice. It was right next to the room and its walls were even modern and really nice. The shower was HUGE and had so many different jets and waterways. There was a seperate room for toilet.The pool was DIVINE . The whole pool was just one big great comfortable hot tub. There was also a cascading waterfall and jets all around the pool. Outside of the pools were nice cold showers to either rinse off before going into the pool, after, or both. The terrace/back was really nice and had tables for sitting and an interesting view of the pool from a top perspective. We had breakfast at the Oceania, and the selection was very large and really good ! The staff weren't snobby at all. I called reception because the TV had stopped working and they stayed with me on the phone and went by the quick step by step process of resetting the TV while they stayed on the line until it was back to normal.

<Content>Fantastic hotel!Better than expected! This hotel was fantastic we were slightly worried about being to far from the centre of Paris but this wasnt a problem at all, and the hotel exceeded our expectations! We found a review on tripadvisor very useful which explained how to get from the airport to the hotel, and may just a couple of things- get on either the 22 or 24 train to cite universitie at the airport and when you get off at at Porte de Versailles the hotel down the road opposite the stop. The reception staff were very friendly and efficient. The hotel was very clean and modern, we were very pleased with the room and it's facilities. We got a great deal on the hotel on travelsupermarket.com, we paid under half the price you would have to pay at the hotel,including breakfast. The breakfast was good, a person on tripadvisor did complain about the scrambled eggs,and they were quite disgusting but i wouldn't say thats anything to worry about!.If you don't get breakfast inculded you're probably better going and getting somewere else in Paris. The pool was lovely and nice to use after walking round Paris all day. The bar was nice to but quite expensive. We didn't find getting into Paris a problem at all. The metro was a 2 min walk away,with one coming every couple of mins. It only ever took about 15 mins max. to get in and out of Paris, so don't let the location put you off.Also if you haven't been to Paris before we recommend going to Ile st louis-just 2 mins from notre dame,as there was alot of lovely restaurants in that area.All i all we found this an excellent hotel, to which we will definately be returning!

<Content>Nice but jacuzzi not hot! I booked a last minute getaway at this hotel in late January. I was a little concerned about the location near the ring road but it was not a problem. The room and hotel was quiet and getting to/from Gare du Nord, and central Paris was not a problem. The area between the metro station  hotel is well-lit and although travelling alone I felt safe, as I do most places in Paris. The room had a the shower/sink visible from the bed - separated by a glass wall/partian. The bed was comfortable, and all was modern and in good working order and clean. The room, as most in the city, was small, but fine for me. I was disappointed because it was the middle of a cold (to me, who lived in Southern California a long time) winter, and one reason I booked this particular (business) hotel was because it has an indoor pool and jacuzzi. I was really looking forward to soaking in a hot jacuzzi. When i got to the spa, I found it was not even tepid. I couldn't stay in more than a few seconds. Very sad. I tried it the following night, wondering if I'd caught it on an 'off moment'. Alas. Still not even tepid. Breakfast wasn't worth the 鈧?0+ (I ate it one morning believing it included in my rate, and was VERY unhappy to find out what I ended up paying. I would not have done so if I'd not been mistaken about its inclusion in my room rate). Better to go to a cafe and have coffee  croissant for half the price.Overall, a nice place, everything worked, quiet, but I won't go back for the same reason, obviously. If you were going to the convention centre it would be the place to be, though, it's unlikely I'd be going to Paris for that reason.

<Content>Fabulous Hotel! We have just returned from a long weekend at this hotel and it was fantastic! Hotel is on a another level, rooms are small but very very nice, gorgeous bathrooms. They proviede towels, hairdryer, toiletries...etc Plasma TV with some Uk channels. If you can get a room with a view of the courtyard it makes such a difference. Pool and jaccussi are lovely, we had them to ourselves all week - you are provided with towels, slippers and robes. Bar is very expensive, about 拢7 a drink of alcohol so we didn't spend too much time in there, was very nice though!Not far from Paris at all, not sure why people say this, you take the metro to Pasteur then next line straight into Paris took 20-25 minutes each day. Disneyland is approx 40 mins away but really easy journeys! CDG airport is about 50-60mins away but again is an easy journey. Hotel isn't too cheap but isn't too expensive for the luxurious feel you experience. Lots of restaurants around in the evening Chinese, Japenese, French, Italian...Parc Des Expositions is on your doorsteep which is like the Birmingham NEC so if there are shows on it is well worth a visit, we had a sports car show that weekend and was excellent!Would recommend this hotel again to anyone, families, couples, groups...etc.Hope you have a great time, I know you will!!

<Content>Nice hotel Really nice hotel. Rooms feel luxurious..by my standards!A little bit far from Paris but I enjoyed walking into the centre and taking in the lifestyle along the way and stopping for coffee. Or the metro is a two min walk from the hotel entrance. Breakfast was nice, lovely pastries and coffee. Bacon n eggs is minging but this is to be expected outside of UK!We eat at a couple of places nearby, little italian virtually next door did lovely pizzas.Would definitely recommend.

<Content>Fantastic, and the location is fine too! I have stayed in Paris several times in all types of hotels. This one was the best I have ever stayed in anywhere, and by some distance. Very clean, professional and helpful staff, 3 lifts to all floors, fantastic bar and pool/jacuzzi, free iced water machine on every floor, rooms exemplary - some say a little small but plenty of room at the desk to work, superb bathroom, ample space and comfortable bed. WiFi internet access was available at a very reasonable 10 euros for 24 hours, the real beauty being that your time was on hold when you logged off, so 24 hours should be plenty for anyone staying for a week or less. All accessable via the flat screen TV which also had an onscreen hotel guide, jukebox, movies on demand an 60 free TV channels from around Europe - cordless keyboard supplied too. No mini-bar but a vending machine in the foyer with soft drinks, beer and snacks. What more do you need? Location? On the edge of the ring road, southwest of Paris, but as seems to be the case anywhere you go in Paris there was a metro station just a couple of minutes walk away which gets you into the centre in minutes. A seven-day Carte Orange travel ticket, which can be bought from the counter at the airport train station (you will need a passport photo for the ID card that comes with the ticket but if you have one from a previous visit you can buy your ticket in seconds from vending machines at the CDG airport), it takes care of your weeks' travel requirements and is valid on the trains, metro, buses, trams etc. for about 拢21. You can't go wrong! Well worth the price just for the trip from the airport and back! Get the train from the Airport - about 45 minutes ride, there's a train every 10 minutes or so and always on time, get off at Cite University, cross to the brand new T3 tramline, 5 minutes later alight at Porte de Versailles (across the road from the metro station) and you're a short walk to the hotel inside an hour. 3 day and 5 day passes are also available and no doubt even cheaper.In 30 years of travelling I have never stayed at the same hotel twice. Oceania Paris will be the exception, I've already booked another trip! Price? Can't really say as I paid with Air Miles I had accumilated (thanks, Tesco!) but a first class hotel well worth a large chunk of your budget. Very, very highly recommended.

<Content>Great Hotel, 30 min metro ride to central Paris Very nice, modern, clean hotel. Very good breakfast, great choice and selection - scrambled eggs could be improved.Room small but sufficient, no minibar or slippers. Reception lounge area/sofas a bit tired. Staff pleasant, helpful and professional.Location OK (30min metro ride to central Paris) but maybe slightly punishing if over for a short (2 night) sightseeing trip.Would recommend and stay again!

<Content>Lovely Hotel! Great hotel with very clean and stylish bedrooms. Staff are friendly and helpful. Great pool area and bar - would agree that it is out the way (15 minutes on the Metro and 2 changes to main tourist attractions) but its actually quite nice way to see Paris. Safe neighbourhood and plenty of local restaurants / cafes. Would recommend unless you wanted to stay directly in the city centre.
