<Content>Absolute gem, close to the train station This hotel was a great find. For 115 euros a night (probably partly because we went during the off season) we stayed for three nights. Clean, modern, spacious and newly renovated. Huge by Italian standards. It's a bit of a walk (15 minutes) to the absolute center where the Campanille and other sites are. But extremely convenient if you're traveling by train.The breakfast was great--even had some american breakfast fare which was a nice break from the typical Italian breakfast pastries and fruit. The staff was extremely helpful and always willing to call a cab or provide more information about tours in Florence and the amount of time it would take to get from place to place.We had already picked out restaurants from our guide book so I'm not sure how their recommendations are on that front.

<Content>Comfortable room I stayed in Florence in this hotel with two other friends.The room was big enough such that the three of us were perfectly comfortable in there, which is not always the case when you get a triple room, so I was very pleased. The room was nicely decorated and the people in the reception were helpful.If you decide to stay in this hotel I highly recommend that you stop by the bar at night, specially if you go there during the summer. It is a great place to have a drink, talk and relax after a day of walking arounf beautiful Florence. It is very nice and cool place to hang out.

<Content>Really good for sightseeing base This hotel was much better than we expected after reading some of the reviews. It was within walking distance to everything. The breakfast was great, and reception area was nice. Room was fairly basic but spotless and had everything we needed. Great to use as a base.

<Content>Close to Railway station Used this hotel for business at the end of Sept.5 minute walk from the Santa Maria Novella Railway station, and about a 10 minute walk from the city centre. Comfortable rooms, good size, but perhaps a little tired in places. Very quiet (even though they are building a tram system outside), and an excellent breakfast. Generally, this is a pretty good hotel, and fairly good value for money.

<Content>Worst hotel we stayed in Italy The wall paper was peeling off the walls...no airconditioning so we had to open the window and the mosquitos bite us alive. Rugs were threadbarren. Not to mention that the road in front of the hotel is dug up and to top it all off, it is not close to anything. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone

<Content>an old but nice hotel it's very close to stazione centrale, but nowadays there is a road shift in the area. so workmen are excavating all around the hotel... a bit noisy...however, hotel is nice, have clean and confortable rooms. if you find a 120euro/room deal, it's worth to stay...p.s. it's 10 minutes walk to Duomo and palazzo vecchio...

<Content>Not a good hotel Checked into the hotel from the very close train station with a semi-friendly staff. Got a super small room on the 1st floor right next to the elevator. The bed was right up against the wall we barely had room to move around. We did like that the hotel offers free internet access which was the only hotel on our trip that did. We accepted are small room until we found ants by the window, desk, and on our pillows and bedframe. We complained although it was late at night. A maintenance person came in and sprayed ant spray and had to wait for the fumes to go away. In addition, the air conditioning was horrible and had a warm room the the mist of a hot sumer in Florence.The next morning, the hotel did re-assign us to a renovated room on the top floor with a balcony to make up for it. The room still appeared to be old and the balcony was very dirty and the windows has white paint smearings on it. In addition, the air conditioning did not work and I woke up several times as night sweating! Beware that the 5th and 6th floors have wireless internet and did not work for us. We complained and were only told that there was problem some network problem. We had to go down to the nice and chilled lobby to login the wireless internet where it worked.Additionally, we rented a car for 1 night and had to park it at the hotel. We asked to have the 20 Euro fee waived since we had problems, but the refused to credit it back to us.Overall, we were disappointed with this hotel and will not stay again and not recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Londra was good value Hotel is good value overall.Buffet breakfast is extensive and available from v early to 10.30am.Hotel is very clean and they provide ample towels, etc. Good maid service every day. Room is fairly spacious.Only complaint was that air con in the room was a bit dated and wasn't really cold enough in height of summer (air con in hotel foyer, etc in contrast, is more modern / effective).Location is good - just a couple of minutes walk from train station - handy for trips to neighbouring towns of Lucca, Pisa, etc and trains are generally modern, on time and cheap. Hotel is within 15-20 mins walk of key tourist locations in Florence.Road immediately outside hotel is being developed for new tram system but noise / disrupton was minimal during our stay.

<Content>Disappointing..Not like it looks on Website I trawled hotel websites for days after booking our Ryanair flights to Florence. We finally settled on the Hotel Londra after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. I really wanted a room with a balcony with a nice view, and in fairness this is what we got. The view from our balcony was gorgeous but there is no furniture so you need to drag the chairs from the room out onto it. They really need to think about sweeping or mopping the balcony floor tiles as they were pretty filthy. Our main gripe with the hotel Londra was the room. After all our research I really wanted to open the door to the room and be pleased, unfortunately our room, 507, hadn't been decorated since the eighties. A highly patterned carpet, floral chintzty wallpaper, net curtains and twin beds is not what is portrayed on their website. I felt pretty cheated so I decided to go back down to reception and ask for another room, I never usually do this but I thought it was probably worth asking. I was informed that the rooms that are pictured on the website are the ONLY 2 renovated rooms in the hotel and they were occupied during our stay. I felt really let down and the receptionist was pretty smug. .We paid 拢142 for the 2 nights by booking directly on the hotels website. I wouldn't pay anymore than this to stay there again. It is a good ten minutes walk to all the main attractions and can be a trek at the end of a hot day. I'd pay more to stay somewhere more central if I was going to Florence again. If you want to see real photos of the Hotel Londra (and not just pictures of their 2 renovated rooms) look on Expedia. They feature much more realistic views of rooms in the Hotel Londra. They still all look better than room 507 though..Also, steer clear of the bar, a Gin and Tonic is classed as a 'cocktail' and cost 9 euros! No wonder we were the only customers for the half hour we sat there! We bought our own wine after this from the supermarket round the corner so asked at the bar on our return for an ice bucket so we could use the ice machine on floor 1, the barman looked at us like we'd just spat in his face and said you have bought your own wine?! then tutted before pratically throwing the bucket as us! The building work mentioned in previous posts is still on going on and looks like it will be for some time. They've just laid the first bit of track in the metro extension so the area around the hotel is pretty dusty and noisy. This is probably another good reason to stay more in the centre where there are no building works. There are hundreds of hotels in Florence are many are very close to the Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio and Duomo so I'd opt for one of them in future.Enjoy Florence!

<Content>No Air conditioning, grouchy staff The hotel's air conditioning does not work. The rooms are hot and small. The front desk staff is not particularly friendly. They know that the hotel AC does not work and they try to shrug off requests and complaints. We had one of the renovated rooms, but the AC still did not work. Also, no laundry service from Saturday until Monday. I would not rate the hotel at 4 stars.

<Content>Very nice hotel, conveniently located in Florence We just stayed one night mid-July and we loved it; the hotel location is quite convenient, close to the station and walking distance from the historic center. ( The only bad thing is the road works being done right now in the area.)Room was clean and bright with a tub in the bathroom.The Japanese looking patio was so pretty at night with the lights and nice music, we had a drink there late at night.Staff was very helpful.We do recommend and would go back there for sure during another trip in Tuscany.

<Content>Londra Hotel - Great Stay  During our recent trip to Italy, among the hotels we stayed at, Londra was the best. Coming from the states, where finding a hotel with large rooms or suites, which can accomodate two very active little girls and us, is so easy, it was a shocker to us at the first hotel we stayed in Bergamo, when they mentioned that we need two rooms for four of us. It didnt matter the children were 5 year and 9 months old. We had to fight tooth and nails to get a one big room with a King size bed and a crib(our own portable one that we bought). We had to pay extra 60 euros a night for that arrangement. I was expecting the same kind of argument when we checked into Londra, but to our surprise, there were no issues  on the contrary, everyone was very nice  the rooms were amazing with every little little ameneties you would expect of a four star hotel. Something very diffcult to find in Europe. The AC wasnt very cool in the first room and they upgraded us to even better room right away. The crib(theirs) was very comformtable, with kid books, toys etc.Room service has american choices like burger and alfredo pasta(yeah ...alfredo :-)). Restaurant, bar, breakfast room, everything is really nice and the staff is extra nice. I would recomend anyone to stay here. dont worry about the construction thats going on outside, as everything else totally outweighs that minor issue. Just make sure to ask for a renovated room. I havnt seen the other rooms, but i took that advice from one of the trip advisor reviews and i was happy. At Milan we statyed at the Le Meriadian Galia - that was nice too. They gave us an extra room for free :-).

<Content>Repeat Visit I have visited Florence several times in the last ten years and have chosen to stay at the Londra three times. I have found the hotel's location convenient to transportation (the train station is a short walk away) and within an easy walk of the major sites in Florence. The rooms have been excellent and the service wonderful. On this trip, I was traveling with my nephew and he was very pleased that the Londra has an exercise room available to all the patrons. That was an added benefit to his trip and he made very effective use of it.Also during my latest trip, I ate in the restaurant in the hotel for the first time. It was an outstanding experience. The quality of the food was exceptional, the service was perfect and the price was reasonable. The meal was truly a high point of my stay at the Londra.I love to travel to Italy and I would not hesitate to book rooms in the Londra when I am next in Florence.

<Content>No Air Conditioning In Rooms!!! DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THIS!!! This hotel does not have working air-conditioning. We were traveling with 2 other couples and all three rooms were the same... very hot! The pictures on the website only reflect the most expensive room in the hotel. The other rooms are outdated and old! The bar area outside is nice but doesn't make your stay more comfortable. For the price, not a good value!

<Content>Excellent Bar abd Restaurant This was an extremely quiet hotel with the best restaurant and Bar I have been in. The Bar Captain Gino was a gem who spoke perfect English and was an entertainer and perfect mine host.The Canap茅s and hordure鈥檚 offered from the bar prior to dinner were 2nd to none.My only complaint is that the Hotel is not close to restaurants and whilst the station is close it is a difficult walk with luggage if you have hip or knee problems.All up the staff were very friendly and if I had a bar in Australia I would hire Gino, today. He would make a perfect replacement for Eddie at the Old Chevron at Kings Cross.

<Content>Would go back again to Hotel Londra, Florence Stayed at Hotel Londra at end of April 2008 and was a great experience. Just a block from SMN train station which is very convenient. We requested and received a renovated room. The room was quite spacious, large king size bed with dark wood furniture; small refrigerator. Shower facility was very nice and bathroom was big. Everything you needed was in the room. Staff was very friendly and informative. Full breakfast was good. Lots to choose from. If you do not like the coffee served, then just request another type - we drank cappuchino. We did not smell any odors as previous review stated. Center of Florence is very small and you can walk everywhere. Suggest the double decker tour bus (jump on and off different sites) from the front of the train station. Booked two tours with Artviva and the tour was wonderful, informative, complete and fun. Highly recommend Artviva also. Would I recommend Hotel Londra?? Yes, and we would stay there again if we ever returned to Florence. Florence was a wonderful city - must see if ever in Italy.

<Content>Almost complete satisfaction We were seven -- five adults and two small (aged 3 and 5) children, meeting from various parts of the world to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary. The reception desk was efficient and friendly, and helped us all through our 9-day stay with advice and information. The rooms are a bit small but adequately sized, and spotlessly clean. Breakfast is magnificent -- and when we didn't like the samovar coffee they brought us espresso on request. The location, though not in the center of the old city, is certainly walking distance from all of the main sights, and practically next door to both bus and train stations. Work going on in the street didn't bother us. Our only complaint was over a slight mixup in the reservations, which was straightened out later. Highly recommended!

<Content>Horrible! The pictures of the hotel on the website are taken from the new rooms, most of the hotels rooms are old, SMELLY, Moldy, small, and dirty! BEWARE!I asked to be changed twice to two different rooms. The first room was the smallest room I have ever seen in my life- like a closet with a twin bed it in. It had mold everywhere, and everything in the room was old and distroyed!The second room has a single bed in it and the room only fit around the bed. The rooms and the hallways smelled so bad I had to close my nose, it smelled of mold and sweat! I also heard people having sex all through the night. Also, one of the men that worked there left me a love note- which freaked me out because they had been in my room ( who knows doing WHAT!)The third room was had two beds in it and was still old but a little bigger than the first two rooms.They said that there were no new rooms available during my stay, but I can't imagine them being any better with the stench in the hallways!The only thing I liked about this hotel was the breakfast- hot food, good eggs and meats.The location is near the train station but you still have to walk quite aways to the center. I got chased by the Italian guys on my way to the duomo from the hotel, so I was scared to go back out at night ( traveling as two women.) The train station has a lot of seedy men hanging around there looking to pounce on the american women travelors.Next time I would stay at the Baglioni, the Savoy, or the Sofitel.

<Content>Delighted customer at the Londra We booked 2 triple rooms during the busy December period and got a reasonably good price. The location is excellent in terms of distance to the train station although it would've been slightly better if it were more centrally located in relation to places to see in Florence. However, as these sights are very close to each other, none of them is more than a 15 minute walk from the hotel, which in good weather, is a breeze. Only one other complaint that while we stayed there, there were some road works going on in front of the hotel.Apart from this, the hotel was excellent - large spacious rooms, clean and large bathrooms, lots of choice on TV, attentive service at both the front desk and in the rooms, free internet access (via which we were able to select different restaurants to eat at daily), EXCELLENT breakfast spread. Very happy overall with the choice of hotel and would gladly stay here again.

<Author>MileHighStyle
<Content>Quite Dissapointed I had 3 problems with this hotel: location, location and location!Sure it's only less than a mile away from most attractions. Relatively speaking though, that's still FAR considering you could get other hotels that are more centrally located for probably half the price! Also, I don't agree for this hotel to be a 4-star. Maybe back in the 80's but certainly not in today's standards! My reasoning as follows: 1) We were given a non-smoking room which is what we asked for. However, smoke still seeped through the vents from other rooms and I could not sleep for the 1st night. 2) I almost burned my hand from the hair dryer which didn't have a handle and got so hot.3) There was somebody else's hair on our bed. 4) We were given a room with a private balcony (I'm sure it was a balcony because there was a chair outside). However, it was quite impossible to get out. Whenever we tried to tilt the window open, it would always get stuck on the curtains! (This is a minor complaint)The free internet was good and the free breakfast was 4-star!! So up to you to weigh your options. If you must stay here, be sure to ask for the renovated room! If you ask me though, I'll take my $300/night elsewhere!

<Content>Great hotel I spent a long weekend with my wife in this hotel. Everything was great, room was really nice and comfortable, staff polite and helpful satisfying all our request. Breakfast was delicious ( I reallyappreciated the wide range of italian麓s cakes). We also had a so good dinner in one of hotel麓s restaurants. I advise this hotel even for a long stay.

<Content>I'd come back to this hotel anytime. The hotel a couple of blocks from the train station. Its just a little bit difficult to find so you should take a map.My room was excellent! Just like the the pictures on there website. I only paid 119 euros for a double room! My room was spacious, I had a nice balcony, and the hotel was super clean.It has a nice space to have meetings in the lobby. I had one for 2 hours and no one disturbed us.Breakfast was served downstairs had tons of stuff to chose from. I wouldnt think twice to stay here again!

<Content>Be aware! We stayed at this hotel as part of a Perillo Tour. The hotel has renovated and unrenovated rooms. Even though Perillo guests are suppose to be in the renovated rooms, our first room was unrenovated - peeling wallpaper, mold on the walls, cruddy bathroom, etc. It took several calls with the hotel manager and our tour director to get the room changed. The renovated room was very nice - hardwood floors, new bedding, good bathroom, wall unit for clothes, etc. This is the room they picture on the website. Make sure you get a renovated room as the old rooms are not tolerable.The hotel's location is far from the sites and shopping that Florence is famous for. The area that the hotel is located in is seedy at best. It took close to an hour to walk to the center of Florence and the walk was through questionable areas. There weren't any nice restaurants or coffee shops near the hotel. There is a great deal of street renovation going on around the hotel. The hotel is near the train/bus stations and there is a lot of street and sidewalk traffic related to this and we were warned about pick pockets in this area.The breakfasts we had at the hotel were fine. The one dinner we had with the tour group at the hotel was inconsistent in quality. The people that ordered the chicken entree were served chicken backs. Hardly what one would expect on a supposedly high-end tour like Perillo. The other parts of the dinner were fine, but since most of the people ordered the chicken, there were a lot of unhappy people at the dinner.The staff lacks customer service skills.

<Content>Courteous staff, great hotel for a family We stayed for 2 nights at the Hotel Londra. We booked a triple and a double room. Both rooms were modern, spacious and clean. The hotel staff were friendly and courteous. They give you a half hour free internet service in the lobby. Breakfast was plentiful enough to start our day of sightseeing. The hotel was about a 4 minute walk from the Central Train Station . It is about a 20 minute walk to the central part where the Duomo is located. We didn't mind the walk to see the Academia Museum, the Ponte Vecchio Bridge and Baptistry. We enjoyed our stay and seeing the beautiful sites of Florence.

<Content>Disappointed My husband booked this hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary. On arrival we are hugely disappointed with our bedroom. The decor was awful, green and rust colours and overall very grim with twin beds. There are road works directly outside on the road, and the hotel had left a note to apologise in the room (we would have hoped to have been informed about this when booking) but it was not what my husband expected when booking having reviewed their website for 鈧?00 a night. Having spoken to the reception desk we were informed they were fully booked however when we returned later we asked again and were moved to a better room but still not what we had envisaged. The location is very good and the breakfast selection and outside area great. We can only hope in time that all rooms are of the same standard they advertise.

<Content>excellent beds Stayed there while attending a congress at Firenze Fiera, Piazza Adua.It麓s 10 mins walk to the venue, 10 mins to city centre. Quiet, clean, cool rooms, very good, big beds.Huge breakfast buffet, eggs bacon, bread, fruit, cereals etc. - and Spumante !! Coffee from dispenser pretty awful- ask for a cup of cappucino instead.Friendly staff.Garden, bar - very well kept. Fitness room clean, not big - but sufficient. Expensive dinner restaurant- walk to nearby restaurants instead. General advice: Book 4 days ahead online for the Uffizi and see Botticelli麓s wonderful paintings without queueing all day.

<Content>Londra Florence - great hotel, would recommend We stayed in the Londra in August for one night and found it really comfortable. The room, although small, was well designed and stylish - particularly the bathroom. We stayed in one of the refurbished rooms (superior rooms?) think that some of the other rooms have older style decor. Location is fine - by the central railway station and only a short walk to the Duomo and all the other sights. Breakfast at the hotel was excellent, plenty of choice and attentive staff. The guy that checked us in on arrival was also very helpful. All in all I would stay at the Londra again when visiting Florence.

<Content>It was ok It was an ok hotel, the rooms were soo small, but the breakfast was good and they gave you free internet. They were having construction outside so that ruined the look a bit and it was dusty outside and i found the cleaning service to be horrible, there were ants everywhere and they never recharged out toilet paper when we obviously needed some. It wasn't like that in my parents room so it depends where your room is but seeing ants everywhere really makes you sick. Apart from it was in an amazing location you could easily walk everywhere from that point i dont think i will stay there again but it was a good experience

<Content>Great Little Boutique Hotel! The Hotel Londra is a beautiful little hotel with great accommodations, excellent service by the hotel staff, and the best dinner that we had in Italy was at the restaurant in this Hotel. Breakfast is served each morning, with a generous choice of bakery, meat, egg, fruit, and drink choices. While the location is a bit of a walk from the center of town, we enjoyed walking and seeing the community every bit as much as we enjoyed all of the historic sites. Our room was clean, spacious, and we enjoyed a magnificent view which was perfect at sunset. We will definitely stay at the Hotel Londra the next time we are in Florence.

<Content>A little bit expensive but nice Stayed for a few days for a business trip. The room is a little bit expensive but nice (stayed at 5th floor, nice view of the city).Old furniture, looks cozy. I'm an European so I would've preffered the new floor (3rd I think) which is newly refurbished but modren. Keep that in mind when booking.Very nice breakfast, polite staff, free Internet. Had problems with Internet in one of the rooms (we had two), staff was didn't succed to fix it before we figure it out to use the other room's....Location is good, only 10-15 min from the Dome and it's not a crowded area. The only disadvantage is the railway that affects your walk a little bit. Area is clean for a railway station (compared to Paris for example)...

<Content>Regular Hotel better for Business Travelers I have spent at Hotel Londra few nights at different times in this 2007, traveling for business to Florence. The hotel, four-star rated, is for international standard more likely a three-star with some features typical of four-star hotels.Quality of the rooms (in the small size range like anywhere else in Florence) varies significantly from one to another, from old-furnished to newly-remodeled ones; I got some times a better, some other time a worse one, but all in all nothing to complain or to be delighted of. The common area in the lobby is nice with a trendy bar, a restaurant and patio. Breakfast is pretty good with lot of choices. There are two shared computers in the lobby with usually a long line of tourists waiting. For those who have a computer, there is wireless available for free in the lobby and in the rooms.Locationwise the hotel is not far from the city center (about 15-minute walk from the Cathedral Square) but you definitely have more convenient choices if you are planning to tour the city. The Hotel caters to both business travelers and tourists. I would definitely consider it a better choice for business.

<Author>CiaoClaudia
<Content>Nice but OK We stayed here 3 nights at the end of June 07. Close to train station, but a bit of a walk from major attractions, not more than 20 minutes. Lovely entrance, dining area and bar. Very boutique hotel feel. Free internet. First room offered was older room that was not renovated and not the one seen on travel web-sites. We ask to change room and we did. The room was a bit smaller but very modern, clean lines. Breakfast was good, with many choices. Staff was so-so. A bit snobby and not very helpful. I learned that they cater to alot of business people. For example, I contacted them by email a week in advance in order to make a reservation at the Uffizi on a certain date. Their responses were few and far between. I only learned as I got to the hotel that they were unsuccessful, that there were no more reservations available. We set off for the Uffizi bright and early the day we had planned to go (so as to not wait the 2 hour average wait). We found out then and there that there were indeed reaservations still available that day. The only thing I could think of is that they did not even bother reserving for us. I was upset, but did not confront them. Nice hotel overall, but I would try another one next time I go.

<Content>Would highly recommend! Great value! This hotel was a haven during our hot and frenetic race through Italy. We stayed June 24th for 1 night. We booked a triple room through Yahoo travel for $173. Our room was huge with the third person being accommodated on a fold-out sofa/couch. It was cool (very welcome on this hot day), and the breakfast was amazing. They had everything and our service was excellent. Also, check-out wasn't until noon so we could site-see in the morning and return for our bags before catching an afternoon train. I highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting Florence and want to be near the train station. We were able to walk to all sights easily (even when I wasn't feeling well).I had a hard time finding anything reasonable for our dates. This was the most reasonable on Yahoo travel near the train station (1 block, if you exit the train station on the correct side).Rick Steve recommends some hotels and I tried them but found them all full. He discourages using on-line booking services but I wanted to share that we had NO problems what so ever. We booked 3 hotels in different cities and all were expecting us, they did not add on any fees, everything worked out great!

<Content>Horrible in almost every way I stayed at this hotel for only one night and it was a truly terrible experience. I am a very undemanding person and don't require a whole lot from a hotel other than a decent, quiet place to sleep. I don't need room service or someone to take my bags up for me...just somewhere to sleep. The front desk staff was rather rude and always acted put-out at the slightest request...such as a map or directions. The room was pretty decent but you could hear EVERYthing from the surrounding rooms. I could literally hear the man next door snoring and the woman on the other side screaming during her sexual endeavors. The bed was also rather uncomfortable, I woke up with back issues for the first time in a long time.  The room cost me almost $400 and because it was a last minute trip I just had to go with it. Anyway, just wanted to warn as many people as possible...for the money you can do much, much better.

<Content>Hotel Londra: hit-and-miss. I stayed at this hotel for 10 days this June. Room: very, very small, including the shower; however, it was brand-new and nicely furnished. Breakfast: good selection, but the service was hit or miss. The reception team and concierge were great every time. Location: away from every attraction, but close to the train station. Overall, the hotel is a bit pricey, but nice.

<Content>Okay accomodation, inconvenient location The Hotel Londra provided reasonable accomodations for a 3-star hotel. The common areas (breakfast room, bar, patio) were lovely; however, the rooms could be hit or miss. We were first shown to a room on the 6th floor that looked like a bad motel room from the early 80s. We told our bellhop we had reserved a room with a balcony and he tried to convince us that we could CLIMB OUT OF THE WINDOW to a shared balcony outside Luckily, we had a printout of our reservation specifying we had paid for the balcony and photos from the website and asked to be relocated to one of the recently renovated (much nicer!) rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floors. Also, the hotel does not provide irons for guests' use -- you have to have your items sent out several hours before, at an extra charge of course.Overall, the accomodations were clean, the common areas were lovely, the service was subpar to what we experienced elsewhere in Italy. I would choose to stay elsewhere on the next trip to be closer to the sights in the center of Florence.

<Content>Hotel Londra - not so much! Service dates: 4/27 - 4/30 2007Good accommodations and a helpful staff. The rooms were clean and the breakfast buffet (and the room it was served in) was superior. A four star in Europe but a three star in the US.The major issue we had with this hotel was its location. Convenient to the train station but VERY far from central Florence. No restaurants within walking distance (cabs were required whenever a venture into Florence was undertaken), construction on the main street outside the hotel was in progress, and the neighborhood was less than one would like when on vacation.

<Content>Massive room, central location Central location near the main train station, although not with good views of Florence sights. But easy to get to these from the hotel - 10 minute walk to the Duomo.The bedroom was huge, and plainly decorated, and the bathroom was also very big.The breakfast was excellent, with a lot of choice. The hotel hosts a lot of business events.There is currently building work going on at the end of the corridor on the second floor, so probably best to avoid this part of the hotel for a while.

<Content>Great lovely hotel, Great location, Highly recommended We are just back from our trip to Italy, This was our third time in Italy, since I love this country, I chose Hotel Londra because of good reviews I read in Tripadvisor and for it's closeness to the train station and all city attractions. Hotel Londra in Florence is a very good hotel, near the main train station (Santa Maria Novella).We had asked for a triple room, Our room was a very comfortable one with clean and comfortable beds and a modern and clean bath, you could make tee or coffee in the room with diferent choices of tee and cofees put in the room free of charge.you could also have access to high speed internet either in your room or in the lobby, of cource free of charge. Front desk staff were very kind and friendly and they spoke a fluent English, They were very helpful. the guy who first showed us to our room spoke fluent English and was a very knowledgable man. The breakfast was great and contained all what you could expect from bacon and eggs, good sausages, ham and cheese to fresh fruits...And last but not the least, The location was convenient to visit the historical center by foot. we saw all the wonderful beauties of Florence by foot. To go to Pisa you only had a short walk to the train station and you find yourself at the foot of the leaning tower. We鈥檝e got a great holiday and I want to return in Florence鈥?it鈥檚 fantastic! I highly recommend this hotel to all those who want to have an unforgettable stay in the lovely city of Florence.

<Content>Conveniently located, suitable for small conferences and workshops The hotel Londra is very nicely located near to the Central Rail Station and easy to reach when coming from different places in Italy. Also, it is on a walking distance from most interesting to view points in Florence. Therefore, it is ideal for combining working and tourist goals during the same stay in Florence.The hotel provides nice conference rooms and accompanying facilities, well equipped with necessary technical stuff.The personnel is well trained and can support such organization in many details. Thus, I sincerely recommend this hotel for organization of workshops and small conferences due to nice atmosphere and good facilities.

<Content>Nice stay We stayed in Firenza at this hotel and we liked it well. It is not very central but we could reach everywhere in town just by walking. It is near the railway station and bus station that come from Pisa airport. So the location is very nice, the rooms are big and clean and quiet. The staff is also nice.

<Content>Lavish Breakfast and lovely lobby A group of 7 people recently visit Italy. We stayed in three rooms: 2 doubles and 1 triple. We arrived at the train station and easily walked to the Hotel Londra. Even though it was near the train station the street that the hotel is on was very quiet. The lobby of the hotel is very nice with leather sofas. We were shown to our rooms quickly. The rooms all looked the same though the triple was slightly larger. The rooms were fairly good sized with good storage and places to open luggage, etc. The bathrooms were clean, but could have used some update. Towels and sheets were clean. The hotel staff was extremely helpful. We called upon them to find a driver and van for excursions two different days. The first day we went to the designer outlets and the 2nd day we were taken to the Chianti region to a winery and then on to the little town of Siena. The hotel staff did an excellent job of proving cars and drivers for an acceptable amount of euros. The hotel staff also helped us with restaurant suggestions.Breakfast at the Hotel Londra was lavish. The dining room is large and bright and the variety of food was amazing. They had the usual pastries and cereal and juice, but also had eggs, bacon, sausage, cheeses, hams and desserts. Even champagne and orange juice was available for mimosas. The location, while quiet, was not all that near to the sights of Florence. That was not a drawback for us since we spent much of our stay out of town. Had we been planning to spend our time in the city of Florence this location would have been a bit far afield.

<Content>One caution... Three of us stayed 7 nights (2 rooms) in mid-October, 2006 at the Londra in Florence. My husband and I have different views on this hotel and I admit my less positive opinion stems from one bad experience. When I missed a step and went flying across the floor on the first afternoon of our stay, I was appalled that the hotel management admitted (with a shrug) that that last step of the main staircase really needs to be marked. Obviously I wasn't the first to create a spectacle there in the middle of the lobby. As we left I noticed that the problem was still there - a dangerously bad joke for unsuspecting guests.That aside, the hotel is conveniently located near the train station, restaurants, shopping, and several major tour attractions. It caters to tour groups as well as independent and business travelers. Not all the room's outlets worked and our toilet made an odd really loud noise when flushed. Internet was available sometimes in the lobby but not in the rooms. The maid for our room was particularly helpful and the breakfast staff maintained the tables quietly and efficiently. The Londra provides a good breakfast spread, but the menu never varies. Within a 10 minute walking distance, you can reach a large, well maintained self-service laundy. The restaurant had good food, slow service and high prices - by far, the most expensive of our trip without anything special to account for it.Before leaving home we had reserved tickets to museums (strongly recommended) and we had arranged a morning walking tour of Florence. Midweek, we had a tour with Giovanni Sirabella (Sunshine Tours) to see towns in Umbria (Perugia, Assisi and Cortona), and that was followed by 2 great days with Angela's Personal Tours going through the Chianti region and visiting Sienna and Volterra. I can recommend staying at Florence's Hotel Londra. Just watch that last step - it's a doozy!

<Content>Don't stay here We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights as it was chosen by our tour group, so we had no choice. It is in a bad neighborhood near the train station. The hallways are dark and dirty with old carpet. Our room was small, outdated and smelly, with yellowish, brownish water coming out of the shower faucet. It was hot at night so we asked the desk about the air-conditioning and they told us that it goes off when the temperature hits 20 degrees celsius. The first night we kept our french door open, but got a lousy night's sleep due to all the street noise. The blind covering that door was filthy. Some other guests complained of a sewer smell in their rooms. This hotel has supposedly been given a 4 star rating, so beware.

<Content>A good choice if you catch a deal The hotel fa莽ade was not too promising (dull 70s architecture) but our room seemed recently refurbished, and quite tasteful too. Beyond the decoration and the furniture, the room had two real bonus: a nice balcony overlooking Oltrarno and a whirlpool bathtub that was truly welcome after those tough walking sessions that every Florence tourist has to endure. I have to admit that the most pleasure I got in Florence was not supplied by Michelangelo, Brunelleschi or any of those fine artists, but by the bathtub of the Londra hotel!The only detail that in my opinion was not too serious is the huge difference between the hotel official price list and the offer prices. So take your time to find a good deal or you will experience the frustrating sensation of sharing the same hotel with people that has paid roughly half of what you are expending.

<Content>Disgusting Rooms This hotel is filthy!! The hotel is not modern. They remodeled the bar area and the patio, however the rest of the hotel and the rooms are filthy. We booked our stay on Hotels and the pictures portrayed reflected a clean, modern, stylish hotel. Once we got to the hotel we immediately thought we were at the wrong location since the photos did not match the lobby area. However, we thought we would go ahead and go up to the room to take a look. The room was filthy and smelled of urine. The rooms were nothing like portrayed on the website or even the catalog that the hotel had placed on the table. I picked up the catalog and asked the bellman where were these rooms and he said only 2 rooms. Based on this statement it appears that the hotel only fixed up two rooms and used these to represent the hotel on the Hotels website and their own catalog. We immediately went downstairs and used the internet (which was another lie since the website advises that you have internet service in your room) to locate another hotel. We looked at the restaurant area and the terrace which appeared to be remodeled and matched the photos, however the rest of the photos were very deceiving. We were at the hotel for less than an hour and booked another room at the Westin Excelsior. I called Hotels and advised them of the situation and they cancelled our reservation immediately. Once we were leaving I advised the front desk of the situation and I confronted them with the dishonest portrayal of the hotel. The concierge at the front desk could not even respond. She starting calling behind the desk for the general manager who came upfront. I advised him that we had alreay cancelled our reservation through Hotels and that the pictures on the website and in their own catalog were deceiving. Once again, it was never explained why such an inaccurate portrayal of the rooms was represented. He just advised us that he would move us to a better room. I advised him that we were leaving and had already cancelled our reservation. He then got very rude and advised me that he was going to charge us anyway (keep in mind we were there for less than an hour and did not even stay in the room). We advised him good luck and walked out the door.DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A CLEAN SAFE PLACE TO STAY!!!

<Content>Modern and Near Everything This modern hotel is located just west of the Santa Maria Novella Train Station (main train station) near the heart of Florence. We had a room that appeared to have been renovated relatively recently. It was modern and extremely clean. The bed was very comfortable. The bath was a bit more modern than I would prefer - the shower stall had folding panels that took a little getting used to in order to avoid getting water all over the floor. There is no lip around the shower (and no tub). So, water eventually finds its way to a drain, but may cover a good part of the tile floor before doing so. So, be smarter than I was.The restaurant serves good quality dinners and wines - though the service was a bit too leisurely for my tastes and the prices were quite high.The best part of our stay was the service we received from the front desk staff. They spoke very good English and were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. I don't think i have ever had better service in any hotel.The price of the room was quite reasonable, considering the quality and convenience of the accommodations.

<Content>Make Sure you get what you want! We travelled to Florence with another couple on a month's tour of Italy. We had stayed in some nice hotels and walked out of one. On our arrival in florence we located the hotel which is about 500 metres from the station and from first appearances it looked fine. We were shown to our non-smoking rooms as the maid was removing the ashtrays and spraying deodarant.The initial view of the hallways was the that the hotel was a bit shabby and in need of repair. Unfortunately the rooms were no better with wall paper hanging off and cracked tiles in the bathrooms. We called reception and asked to be relocated to better rooms. We were shown to different rooms and again the maid was there with the Aerosol. The rooms were not much better.One of the things that had led us to this hotel was the rooms on the internet, which they also have displayed in the reception. Thankfully we had a print out of these rooms and so asked about them. These rooms were on the 1st and 3rd floor which have recently been renovated and it just happened that two rooms were available.These rooms were luxury compared to anything we seen so far in this hotel so we quickly relocated to them. After three attempts we were comfortable in rooms that we had expected initially and the hotel would have saved a lot of distress if they had just given us these rooms initially.The rest of our stay was most enjoyable and the breakfast was always good. The gentleman serving at the bar at night was rude and less than friendly.Let me just add as a post script that we always tried to be friendly to staff where ever we stayed and hoped to get the same in return. Maybe they just get sick of tourists.

<Content>Near train station in Florence The hotel is a short walk from the train station if you are planning on taking any day trips to Pisa or any of the other small towns. There are some good restaurants nearby but it seems to be the seedier side of Florence. You can access the Hop On - Hop Off bus tour easily here as well as the train but that's about it. You have to find a way to the other side of town to visit the duomo, ponte vecchio and other sites. Florence is a great town if you love to walk. The hotel - I give an average rating because it reminded me of staying in a typical US Holiday Inn. The rooms seem to be a bit dated. The full size beds are just twins pushed together and they are hard as a rock!!! Same with the pillows - hard as a rock!!! The bathrooms can be hit or miss. Ours was fine but the friends we were traveling with had complaints and ended up changing rooms.

<Content>Good location, good value. We stayed here last March in a triple room for 2 nights we got a deal on the web for 鈧?50 for both nights and thought it very good value. The room was clean and there were nice toiletries. It is very convenient for the station. (We caught the train from Pisa airport only鈧? return) All the sights were easily walkable - the Duomo, is only about 10 mins walk away. The breakfast was better than most and served in the very funky dining room. A good choice if you can get a deal!

<Content>Terrible Hotel My husband and I just returned from staying at Hotel Londra in Florence. We had to have our room changed several times...the first room smelled of pesticides, the second room the air conditioning did not work and all three of the rooms were dirty. The staff is very arrogrant and unprofessional. We felt the location was not in a very good area. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone who wants an enjoyable stay in Florence.
