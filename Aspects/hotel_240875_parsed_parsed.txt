<Content>Finally, a reasonably priced, clean hotel! We went to Universal Studios for an after Christmas mini vacation and after two days of reading reviews on all the local hotels, I came across this Holiday Inn Express and booked them based on the price and all the good reviews. Plus the Sheraton and the Hilton both had bad reviews. It is a great little hotel. Don't let the aged outside of the building fool you. The parking was FREE, the price was nice, the staff was nice, except for the lady who makes the breakfast, but the rooms were clean, everything in the room seemed like it was new, even the restroom. We requested extra towels and shampoo and they responded immediately. The night crew was great. It exceeded my expectations. I'll definitely stay here again with my kids. It was right up the street from Hollywood Blvd too.

<Content>Great Holiday Inn Express I must say that this hotel exceeded any expectations that I had before I left. The hotel was close to Universal Studios, so close in fact that you could walk if you don't mind a little stroll down the street. I was able to get it for $139 for a Saturday night which is more than half the price of the 2 hotels closer to the park. My cab rides were $5 each way with 4 adults in the cab. The gentleman that checked us in was quite pleasant and accomodating with whatever request we had. The room was on the average side but was clean, clean,clean. I will definately stay here again the next time I take in a show at the Gibson Amphitheatre. Great job to the managment as well as the staff. I travel alot and have to admit that this team has it figured out.

<Content>Very nice Holiday Inn Express We stayed at this Holiday Inn for one night while visiting Hollywood. It was a very pleasant stay. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful with any questions we had regarding the area and directions. The room was average size and the beds were very comfortable. The linens and towels were very nice and I really liked the shower head. The continental breakfast was very good. The location was very close to Univeral Studios and the City Walk and not to far from Hollywood Boulevard. You could get picked up by tour buses to see various Hollywood sites if wanted. I wish we would have stayed longer at this hotel but we had reservations in orange county at a beach resort. It was an excellent choice for seeing Hollywood.

<Content>Great, would stay here again My teenage daughter and I were in L. A. for 24 hours at the end of a soccer tourny in San Diego. We hit Universal Studios, made the last tram tour, came out exhausted, dirty and with no place to stay at 9:00 pm. We checked our GPS and the first on the list was this place. We called, got the last room, and directions-- practically across the street. ( The satelite had not yet located us/it) The man at the desk was so helpful. We got a clean, fresh room at a great rate for LA. The desk clerk helped us the next morning with directions to tourist spots- Graumans Chinese theatre, where all the tours can be had. We had a memorable stay with much thanks to Holiday Inn Express. My daughter is telling all her friends back home here in Wisconsin how fantstic LA is. I think she's ready to move there!

<Content>Will stay here, again !!! Very satisfied customer !!!! Michael was very pleasant and professional in checking myself, sister and niece in. It took all of ten minutes to sign in and get the room. But, all of an hour and a half to get settled. But, the end result was FANTASTIC !! The room I booked was a double queen room, however the tv didn't work. The employees tried to get power to the tv, but to no avail. Alejandra tried, two of Michael's buddies tried, but nothing....needless to say, after a long day at Universal Studios, my family and I were not the least bit interested in lugging our bags to another room. But, we did and we were escorted to a Family Suite, which was wonderful because there was a king bed in one room and two queens in the other......but, they couldn't get the door unlocked to the second room...DRAMA, I tell you, but we kept a positive attitude and were very thankful that everyone was trying everything to open that door.....like I said, it took an hour and a half, but the end result outweighed the waiting time. I was very pleased with how everyone tried to assist and went out of their way to get the job done !!! We had a wonderful night's rest, each enjoying our own bed, and the complimentary breakfast, was on the money !!! A great way to end a great stay and for the road trip home !!! At check out time, the manager, Efrain was aware of all the trouble we had the night before, he was very apologetic and honored the rate I was quoted for the single room !!! Now, that's the kind of customer service I appreciate and I will definitely stay at this hotel, AGAIN !!!! THANK YOU, HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS CAHUENGA !!!!

<Content>Simple but nice for Universal Studios We stayed one night in Holiday Inn Express Cahuenga pass. The hotel is located 5 minutes by car to the Universal Studios and that's was the reason beacuse we choose it. Room are good, we hade room with wiev on the back side of the hotel: the view was not good but it was very quite. What you get for what you pay is good, even breakfast was good.

<Content>Maid stole our bag! We were there during the Memorial Weekend. We stayed at the suite, which is pretty good with one room with a king-size bed and another room with two-queen beds. The rooms were fairly clean and comfortable.However, as we were getting ready to check out, we realized that a bag that we have brought up to the room when we first checked in, was no longer there. In the bag were unopened snacks. I know those things are not expensive, but the thought of the maid taking things from the customers just left me disappointed in Holiday Inn Express. We later came to the conclusion that the maid might have opened our unlocked suitcase. Our suitcase's zipper was closed when we left the room, but when we returned later that night, the zipper was opened. I reported in to the front desk, but the lady just gave me a form to fill. She says they will look into it, but I think it is just a bunch of B/S. I also sent an email to Ben (the manager there), but haven't heard back from him yet.

<Content>Great value for location We stayed here two separate times during the last week of March as we had flights in and out of Burbank airport. This hotel is very convienent to the airport (5 miles away) and also many local sights we were visiting (hollywood area, universal and warner brother studios, hollywood bowl, la brea tar pits). Breakfast and free parking a plus. Bathroom could have been cleaned a bit better on our first visit but rest of the place was good. Both visits manager left basket of goodies (cookies, candy, and water bottles) and these were greatly appreciated after long travels and lots of LA traffic jams!!!!! We faced freeway both times but didn't find traffic noise intrusive. Pool is very small but not the reason we were there. Visited the Hilton property down the street that our friends were staying at which was very fancy/nice with attractive pool scene but considering the mandatory parking and no breakfast provided- the Holiday Inn Express is a much better value if you are site seeing and not planning alot of time to hang out around the hotel.

<Content>Great location to Universal Studios This hotel was a nice find. The rooms were clean and roomy and the breakfast in the morning was chock full of variety. We were very weary travellers when we came upon this hotel, and knowing the Holiday Inn Express name we thought we couldnt go wrong. The staff were very nice as well. Priced at $140/night in LA we didnt think was too bad. And if travellers are hitting Universal Studios on their LA tour, well, the park is just down the street, so it was a bonus for us who were visiting US the following day. Very happy with this hotel.

<Content>A pleasant surprise We stayed for 2 nights in Dec. 2007. Our party consisted of 2 adults, and 3 young children. I was pleasantly surprised! The hotel staff was very friendly, the room was a nice size and clean, and there were complimentary water bottles and snacks (chocolates and cookies). We didn't hear any of the road/freeway noise, and our room did face the freeway. We were in LA to visit family and some of the attractions, and the hotel was centrally located for all our planned activities. I have to agree with another reviewer that for a junior suite it was an average sized hotel room, but we did all fit perfectly. There was even a fridge and a microwave. The hotel has a small indoor pool. Towels are provided at poolside. It's not the greatest pool, but for 3 small kids who love to splash around, it was great to have. Free parking too. I would definitely stay here again and recommended. Great value for the price and location.

<Content>Good stay I was happy with this hotel. My teenage daughter and I stayed for 4 days while in LA. Clean room, felt safe, friendly staff. Our room was next to a family with small children and we could hear them crying and banging things around, but it was not enough to discourage me from staying here again. Close to Universal Studios, with very easy access to the 101 and local attractions.

<Content>good stay This is a nice hotel, close to universal, not a far drive from Hollywood Blvd, right at a freeway exit/entrance. Starbucks is right across street, 2 fast food places down street but nothing else good is close at least that I saw. The breakfast was horrible, the room was not vacuumed well, and there were ants in the bathroom. I paid over $200 a night for a suite and did not feel it was worth that much money. I read the other posts about the window break in. I asked the desk about it and she said it never happened. My window was on the ground floor in the back facing the alley but there is a fence around the back. It looks like a good fence but like anything- if someone wanted to scale it they could- but the fence made me feel better. Though honestly I felt insecure here. I felt like at any time someone could just walk in off the street or in from the window. As we were leaving we noticed that one of our windows was broken and did not close and lock.. I probably would not stay here again. Though the free parking was great and the location was close to sightseeing. I think tours pickup here too.

<Content>Avoid At All Costs We booked our reservation six weeks in advance, requesting the quietest room possible. We were given a room in the front of the hotel, facing a frontage road, next to a major freeway. The traffic noise didn't stop all night. Plus, the room was next to the elevator and the vending machines. This is a quiet room?!At checkout, another guest was complaining because the toilet in their room didn't work, and they had to go to the lobby to use the restroom. They had complained, someone fixed it, and it didn't work all night. Plus, there was a boom box blasting in the room next to them which they complained about, and management did nothing to help them.Don't even consider staying at this place. Drive right by.

<Content>Pleasant (not great) stay My family stayed for two nights during our trip to Universal Studios. Location wasn't too bad , we walked to Universal the first day. A little bit of a hike going to Universal, not as bad coming back to the hotel. The room itself was clean but I thought it would be bigger since it was called a Junior Suite. It did come with a sink, good sized fridge and microwave. The pool, though heated, was a little disappointing. Very small, I think one of the smallest pools I have ever seen. We almost thought it was a hot tub. The breakfast was fine, it actually filled us up until lunch time at the park. Overall not a great hotel but worth the price.

<Content>Great little hotel! This is a great little hotel with all the basics you need for a short stay. If you're looking for a no-frills hotel at a great price then you will be pleased. I spent 4 nights there on a business trip and was very pleased with my overall stay. The hotel is spotlessly clean, smells nice, has very friendly staff and comfy beds. The mini fridge in the room was an unexpected (and much needed) surprise. I also appreciated that they supply the ethernet cable for you to access the internet. The morning breakfast is decent with cereals, bagels, fruit, pastries, juice and coffee. One of the best things about this hotel is the free parking, which in L.A. is very rare! Another bonus is the convenient location to Universal Studios (just down the street) and the freeway entrance to 101 is just across the street. Overall I had a great stay and will be back in two weeks.

<Content>Good, stay My husband and two teenagers, recently stayed on our trip to Universal Studios. It was very accessible to this attraction, I would recommend the location. The pool, is very small like everyone says but it is still functional, as we took a dip. We stayed on the third floor. The room is nice and spacious, very nice bathroom. They had several pillow choices (soft, firm). The mattress wasn't particularly comfortable. The breakfast area was small and the selection wasn't great but we were able to eat. They did have cinnamon rolls. It's a strange location right off of the highway. You go into a garage and the lobby is underground in the garage area. Nothing spectacular, but nothing to complain about either. We had a pleasant stay.

<Content>Great Little Hotel We stayed the very same weekend of the robbery mentioned by another guest. That is so unfortunate. We stayed on the second floor facing the back. I specifically requested this location ahead of time because of the comments that I had seen on this site regarding the noise coming from the adjacent freeway. I'm extremely picky when it comes to a hotel's cleanliness, and I must say that I could find nothing to complain about. The room was impeccably clean, the sheets, bedding etc were divine and pretty new. The continental breakfast was enough to start your day. I did have very noisy neighbors next door who seemed to be trying to talk over their loud TV. After 12:30 am, we called the front desk and he said he would take care of it. They quieted down shortly after. The location is very convenient to all Hollywood sights. Will definitely stay here again.

<Content>Better than expected When I booked the hotel I was expecting it to be noisy being so close toa highway however I was surprised. I booked the hotel due to its proximity to Universal Studios and I was plesantly surprised. The rooms were clean and large enough for a family of four and was quiet. The breakfast was the Holiday Inn breakfast that was expected and ample for the family. Great location if you plan a trip to Universal and Waner Brothers studios

<Content>Great location! A nice surprise! Great location if you are going to Universal Studios. Just a mile or so down the road. Freeway access to the 101 was also very close. Even though this hotel is on a fairly busy street, the noise was minimal. We would stay here again!

<Content>surprised We arrived round midnight. Great room. If I really have to search about negative things: the view was a wall and the swimming pool was very small, but since we did'nt really go for the view, nor for the swimming pool, we did'nt bother. All the rest was super: the rooms were always very clean, there was enough choice at breakfast, the staff was friendly... I'll definitely go back there.

<Content>Still convenient and value for money This was our second stay in this hotel in 6 months, we chose it due to it's location near Universal Studios (5 minutes away), free parking and free breakfast.This time we had a room at the back of the hotel which was much quieter than our previous stay which was overlooking the freeway.For just over $100 we've yet to find better value on this side of town

<Content>Right next to freeway on ramp, gas station...and a couple fighting next door! We booked this hotel online...we were not aware of the exact location of this hotel...it is literally right on the freeway, next to the on ramp.So with freeways come...very loud freeway noise. Traffic was heavy all night, all day..well it is LA, you could imagine listening to the traffic through the paper thin windows all night long.At 5 am...came screaming, fighting and children crying from the room next door to ours. A phone call to the front desk, some pounding on the walls by my brother...made them stop. I could not go back to sleep...Why is the traffic so freaking loud here?, Hmmm why was she yelling sorry to her husband at 5 in the morning? Why is the pool as big as two parking spaces? Why does the elevator creak up each floor? Maybe Ill just try and think about being home in my own bed... and so on and so forth.So as you can see..sleep is not exactly what you will get as you stay here off of Highway 101. I suggest the Hilton next to Universal...seems to have gotten good reviews, and may be worth the extra $50.00 to drive home the next morning without chugging 2 red bulls and still wondering what they were fighting about!Oh..the breakfast was extended, there were cereals, and toast, boiled eggs, toast and fruit. That was the only plus in my opinion.

<Content>good idea to use the security lock Stayed one night. Problems started at check in. Was given a key card for my assigned room on the third floor. Went up there and the key didn't work. Went back to the desk and they reprogrammed the key and assured me it would work. It didn't, and the person already in the room fortunately had the inside security lock on (that's why the key wouldn't work!!) heard me and asked what I was doing. Went back to the lobby and after some time they assigned me a room on the second floor...no outside window..but a large window to the indoor hallway?! The room was clean but very noisy. the heating system was very loud and if anyone upstairs flushed a toilet I'm sure the drains were run thru this room. In the am the houskeeping staff was very inconsiderate shouting and laughing from one end of the hall to the other so don't plan to sleep after 8am even if you want to. Would not stay here again.

<Content>Enjoyed my stay here I made a reservation here for my 2 night stay in CA to attend a friend's wedding. As a 20-something single female traveler, I wanted a place that would be safe, cheap/reasonably priced, and close to the wedding location, and this place fit all the criteria. Well, I would've liked the price to have been lower than the $118/night rate I got, but I think I would've had to forego one of my requirementsI arrived on a Friday morning and asked the person managing the front desk if it would be possible to check in early. He was very polite and friendly and found a room that would be ready for me within 15 - 20 minutes. Breakfast was already supposed to have been over, but everything was still laid out, so he suggested I have breakfast while I waited. The food was still pretty fresh and a lot better than what I had expected for a Holiday Inn Express.My room was clean and up-to-date. The bathroom was OK. The only complaints I have are that the hair dryer had some yellowish stains that would not come off. There was also a hair in the sink, and the inside of the shower curtain had a few brown and yellow stains on it.The cleaning staff was very friendly and courteous. As a caution to light sleepers, they did make a lot of noise in the morning as they cleaned.Parking is limited, but even with full occupancy, I managed to find a spot by the curb.I never felt unsafe my entire stay there. I came back fairly late both nights, and I never saw or heard anything or anyone unusual as I made my way back to my room.Check out was easy since I had registered as a Priority Club member when I booked my reservation.Overall, I had a great experience with this Holiday Inn Express location.

<Content>Great Experience, P:leasant Stay We had a one night stay at the hotel for a show at the Gibson Theater at Universal City Walk at Universal Studios. Other than staying at the very pricey hotels adjacent to Universal, staying at the Holiday Inn Express was a wonderful choice. I was concerned about the negative remarks on this website, but found that the hotel was much better than I thought it would be.The hotel is conveniently located at the 101 South (Hollywood) Freeway. Across the street is a Chevron gas station. Within walking distance, there are a couple of quaint restaurants.When we checked into our room (Room #310), we found a large basket of complimentary chocolates, cookies, and 2 bottled waters. The room had a view of an alley - it wasn't offensive, but it wasn't the best, either. However, I would take the alley over a hotel roof.The room itself was immaculate. There were two Queen beds along with a desk, executive chair, lounge chair, and bench. We had ordered a rollaway bed ($15 extra cost) but it would have been too crowded to have the rollaway in the room. The room also had three phones in the room (one on the nightstand, one on the desk, and one in the bathroom). The bathroom is spacious and clean. The tub is one of the cleanest I have ever seen, and I have stayed at many hotels. It has a very nice Kohler shower head, and the curtain is on a rod that is curved for more bathing space. The towels are of high quality,.The room and hallway was quiet even though the hotel was full. With regard to the bleach smell - I would say the smell is more like a cleaner smell with a floral scent. It is not offensive and is actually pleasant because you know the hotel and room is clean. The carpet was in excellent condition - very clean with no tears and no worn spots. The ice machines are modern and dispense ice quickly. Hotel is well maintained. The hotel room card must be used in order to access the elevator.The breakfast is nice and is served from 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. We did not experience any crowds at all - there were only 2 or 3 at any given time. There is a nice selection of bagels, cinnamon rolls, crossaints, hard boiled eggs, dry cereals (several choices), oatmeal, muffins, donuts, and a variety of juices and water along with hot tea and coffee.Universal Studios is 1.5 miles away. It is challenging to exit the hotel because there is a three way signal light at the hotel. The signal is confusing. You cannot walk to Universal, but the hotel is one of the closest other than the very pricey ones adjacent to Universal Studios.Internet access is free, however, guests must obtain a cable from the front desk. You must connect the cable to your laptop at the desk, so it is not so convenient, as you must be at the desk to do work rather than any other part of the room.Lastly, the parking is limited. Guests must place a paper placard in the window to show they are guests at the room. In addition, latecomers end up parking next to the office rather than in a spot. Otherwise, I feel the room and the hotel was a good deal (I booked two months in advance) and was well worth what we paid. I would stay there again and recommend it to other travelers.

<Content>Great location, nice service, a little pricey The location for this holiday inn express is what you pay for. The hotel was full when we checked in. The parking space is a little tight, but the hotel staff helps youpark.The staff was courteous, and the breakfast in the morning was decent and containedbagels, cereals but no toast. We had booked a smoking room by mistake, and as the hotel was full, the front desk couldn't help us. As expected, the room smelled of strong smoke. They had a basket of goodies (chocolates, cookies) + 2 bottles of water, which was nice.We would stay here again, but would certainly search for a better price

<Content>Good for UHS overniter Not too bad. I wasn鈥檛 familiar with the area, but this seemed perfect for a one night stay. My family of four wanted to do two days at Universal Studios and didn鈥檛 want to deal with driving back and forth from Anaheim. This hotel is about 5 minutes from the UHS entry way. Free parking was close to office and covered. Checkin was easy, lobby was smaller than most. Access to the elevator was thru a small entry way just before the lobby. This area gets pretty crowded when people are checking in and out. You also need a room key to activate the elevator. This is on the outside, something I haven鈥檛 had to do in any other hotel. Room #303 was large for a single king and the bathroom also had ample space. The remodel of the bathroom was a nice touch, see their web site for details. Their internet connection was easy to access and there wasn鈥檛 any portal login necessary to use it. I just connected my laptop and was good to go. Our room faced the road and the freeway just beyond that. It made for a pretty noisy stay, but I found we were so tired, it did not bothers us at night nor in the morning. My son (11) used their indoor pool. It was probably the smallest one I鈥檝e seen, but he seemed to enjoy it all the same. My wife had to grab a few pool towels and we stayed a little beyond the pool closing time, but the front desk ( just in front of pool ) didn鈥檛 seem to mind and was very friendly. The free breakfast in the morning, was closer to a continental breakfast, but still had a lot of good items. My wife was especially pleased with their cinnamon rolls. For the price $118.56 tax included, I would probably stay there again. 3 陆 stars.

<Content>Met expectations Four of us from Alberta Canada arrived late on January 10. Our reserved room was ready and the night manager gave us his parking space because the underground lot was full - a nice touch. We booked here because it is close to Universal Studios Hollywood and easy to access from LAX.The room was fine, everything worked and no troubles. Breakfast standard HIE fare, not much room for seating. As reported by other travellers, an awful smell in the elevator. Take the stairs - some exercise and the smell was much less. Thankfully the room didn't have the smell!15 minute walk to Universal Studios where we spent the day. That evening the manager was helpful in suggesting a place to eat down Cahuenga Blvd. We caught BF the next day and then left. Would recommend for those going to Universal Studios.

<Content>Very Average Five of us arrived 30th Dec 2005. 2 Bedded Suite on second floor with view of brick wall. Probably preferably to front rooms on main road. Nothing special. Horrid smell of ?perming lotion on landing. Breakfast average, not enough seating. No BBC America on TV. Comfy beds. A/C very cold and noisy, had to switch off at night. Nice bathrooms, extractor inadequate. Small indoor pool. Pricey at $199 per night excluding tax. Not impressed.

<Content>Better than expected. Was a little dubious about this choice having read some previous reviews however the hotel turned out to be immaculately clean, provided pleasant rooms and a highly satisfactory complimentary breakfast.The staff could not have been more pleasant.The local area was questioned by some previous reviewers however I did not feel at all threatened and enjoyed a high quality meal locally at the California Canteen and even enjoyed a beer at a bar just across from the hotel.My only reason for not rating the hotel as excellent is the less than adequate pool - not much bigger than a bath really however that said the hotel is excellent value for money.Previous reviewers have said that you can walk to Univeral Studios. You can but would probaly need a shower on arrival after the uphill trek - get a cab stay on for a meal at Citywalk  have a beer.

<Content>Would definitely go back For the price this hotel is well worth it. It is very close to the studios, Hollywood Bowl and Hollywood. The room wasn't anything special, but it was very clean. I would recommend that you get a room not facing the road. They first assigned us a room facing the road and we heard a lot of road noise. When we requested a room on the other side, they did so with no problem and we didn't hear a thing.For some reason there was a peculiar smell right when you entered the lobby. No problem in our room.Breakfast was a not much to speak of, but it got us going in the morning.Staff was very friendly and overall we would return if we are in the area again.

<Content>Great for Universal Stayed one night in August based on website reviews as going to UniversalAs previous reviews have said it is very handy for Universal, not walking distance but only 5 mins drive. The hotel and rooms where clean and despite being close to the freeway didn't suffer to much from traffic noise. Had a suite which was plenty big enough with mircowave and fridge, yet still a reasonable price. Breakfast good but needs more seating to accomodate all guests.I would recommend the hotel for people going to Universal as it is good value for money. Don't book it for the pool because it is very small.The only downside we found was that there are no bars and eating places close. Had to drive to find somewhere - not good if you want to drink!

<Content>Handy for Universal If you intend going to Universal studios then this is a great place to stay. Literally on a 2 minute drive to the theme park. Rooms are clean and the staff are friendly though there is a constant smell that was unusual and couldn't quite put my finger on. Some kind of cleaning agent i think.This is not a place to stay if you want to lounge by the pool (the pool is indoor and very small) but for us going to Universal, it was perfect.

<Content>Just OK This place is fine, if you want something near Universal Studios for a reasonable price. We stayed two nights and had a room facing the freeway, but we were not bothered by noise at all. The parking is free here which is a nice bonus. However, the pool is the smallest I've seen anywhere and is in a cement box of a room right off the parking garage. Not exactly what you'd imagine for a pool in California! As an earlier reviewer stated, the elevator has a strong chemical smell similar to the old home permanent smell. My daughter took the stairs rather than being faced with the smell. Breakfast was fine..good cinnamon rolls and plenty of other choices. The breakfast area is way too small for a hotel of this size. Many people had no place to sit. For an area that attracts mostly tourists, the desk staff was not particularly helpful when answering our questions. There is not much nearby other than City Walk for dining. It's a quick drive there, but will cost you $10 to park. For a hotel so close to area attractions, it is surprising that they don't offer a shuttle.

<Content>Great Place for universal studios visit We just got back from a 2 days 2 night trip to Universal Studios over the 4 of July holiday. This motel was an excellent choice for our stay. I consulted with this site/posters, and I give it a try. The Motel was clean and well kept, the rooms large enough for our party of 4 adults. Our room had a small refrigerator and a microwave. They serve breakfast (continental) from 6:30am to 9:30am, and I was really surprise by its quality. Our room faced Hgw101 and it was a little noisier, but it did not stop us from having good night sleeps. If you are traveling to Universal Studios, you will be glad to stay at this motel. Also, exiting fro 101 south, this motel is right in front of you at the street light. Universal studios, just around the corner. If I am going back to Universal, I will stay here again for sure. By the way, it was one of the cheapest motel we could find, even though it was $128Xnight. May the holiday dates..?

<Content>I would stay here again - no doubt! It took me a while to decide on a hotel and I was very happy with the choice I finally made. I stayed here with my husband and my dad and we all gave it 2 thumbs up! The staff was friendly, the room was very clean and even though our room faced the street we were able to sleep soundly. The continental breakfast was better than expected with choices of cereal, bagels, milk, juice, coffee, fruit and yummy cinnamon buns. The only thing that could have been better was the pool, although I knew what to expect from pictures on the website. It was indoors and not very appealing. I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling with a car and looking for a reasonably priced hotel relatively close to attractions.

<Content>Bargain + convience Positive:1. Convenient location #1 - While it is on a busy intersection (off the freeway), what saves it is that there is a signal for easy ins and outs of the parking lot.2. Convenient location #2 - Close driving distance to Universal Studios. 3. Rooms were small, but they were clean and comfortable - firm beds, great showers, refrigerator and microwave. 4. Laundry room on each floor - clean and spacious.5. Surprisingly good continental breakfast.Negative:1. Rooms are a bit dark. The dark furnitures would've been setoff better with brighter lights.2. Our room was on the 2nd floor (building only has 3 floors), and since we faced the busy road, we chose not to open our curtains. Interestingly, the curtains were the heavy type which blocks out sunlight. It is an option to consider for those who prefer to sleep during the day.3. Not too many places to eat in walking distance - area is not a tourist-friendly location; more options further down Cahuenga Boulevard.Not a fancy spot, but our family was looking for an inexpensive. clean, secured location near the Universal Studios...and this was it. We would consider it again if we're in that part of town.

<Content>Convenient little hotel While not much to look at, this little hotel is right off Hwy. 101 and across from Universal Studios. While I wouldn't suggest walking (lots of traffic) it's an easy ride to anywhere around Hollywood or Burbank. Parking was free and not a problem. The room was what I would expect from Holiday Inn Express - nice and clean. In-n-Out Burger is right down the street as well! Just make sure you have a car if you stay here.

<Content>Great for Universal - strange smelling lifts though! We stayed at this Holiday Inn Express from the 21st-26th March 2005, and it pretty much does what it says on the tin, a 'no frills' experience. It has good size rooms, is very clean and as other reviewers have already mentioned, has free parking. Luckily, we used a rental car with a GPS system, otherwise we would have got badly lost trying to find it (plan your journey!)Breakfast is fine, cereals/toast/bagels etc. although we opted to take our breakfast up to our room as the small breakfast area got busy very quickly.Getting to Universal - my wife and I are relatively fit, and managed to walk along the road and up a hill in 10-15 minutes to the Universal City Walk. Not the best of areas, but not as bad as some have painted, (I felt perfectly safe, although the carbon monoxide in my lungs is a different story) and you are spolit for choice with excellent restaurants in the City Walk.To sum up, a good base for Universal, Burbank etc. Friendly staff, a bargain in many ways.Finally, if anyone from the hotel reads this - could you sort out the smell in the lift? I would gladly come back if you did!

<Content>Good family hotel We stayed in this hotel for three nights during March 2005 while we were visiting several sights in the Los Angeles area. I spent a lot of time on Trip Advisor trying to find a hotel that was suitable for our family, that was close to everything and that wouldn't break our budget. This hotel fit the bill.First of all, I have a total of six people in my family. It is difficult to find a hotel that has accomodations for that many people without having to pay double the price. This hotel has several family rooms that allow you to have up to six people while paying for only one room. The only disadvantage to the room that we had was that ours only had one bath. The others I hear have two. Even so, the room still worked well for us. It was clean, had a small fridge but no microwave (although I hear that the other family rooms do come with a microwave.) The hotel furnished continental breakfast every morning which saves a large family a bundle of money. They also provide free parking which is highly unusual in LA. They have an indoor swimming pool although it is more like an oversized jacuzzi. The deep end is only 4 1/2 feet deep. It was great, however, for my children who are not good swimmers. A couple of them even said that was their favorite part of the trip.Some downsides of the hotel were that it was not close to any restaurants although it does have a gas station with a convenience store directly across the street and a grocery store (Ralphs) about a mile or so up the road. Also, anytime someone on the floor above you was taking a shower or flushed the toilet you could hear water running through the pipes in the ceiling. The air conditioners (which have digital thermostats) were also noisy though efficient. A plus is that we heard no freeway noise. We were on the side of the building that was away from the freeway. I'm not sure if you would hear cars on the other side or not. The entrance to the 101 South is directly across from the hotel and the north bound entrance is a couple of blocks up the road.If Hollywood is your final destination, this hotel is about 2 miles from Hollywood Blvd. It is very close to Universal Studios although you would still have to drive. One thing that we had a difficult time with was actually finding the hotel. There are no signs with the hotel's name on them that are perpindicular to the road and so it's kind of hard to see when you are coming off the freeway (at least the NB side!). Just remember that it's on the WEST side of the 101 off the Barham Blvd. exit.If I decided to visit the area again I would consider staying in this hotel. Hope this helps!
