<Content>Beautiful Shangri-la We spent three nights at the very beautiful Beijing Shangrila. Excellent staff- some with good English!Our twin-room on the 24th floor was very comfortable and spacious. Powerful shower and TV with BBC, HBO and ESPN for us to catch the US Open Golf!Breakfast was fantastic. A huge selection of Western and a several Chinese dishes. They have a beautiful garden with a charming bar where we sat out one night for a midnight snack.The only quibble I have is with the location. A little off the beaten track for sightseeing. That said, when one got back after a long day, this was the place you wanted to be in to unwind and relax- comfort to the max.We were part of a conference so our stay was taken care of. For our extended private visit we did moveto a hotel in the centre of the city (The Kapok, also reviewed) to be in the thick of things.

<Content>Great breakfasts / deal, difficult membership program Great buffet breakfasts and deal for this hotel, especially during the 1-week Mid-Year China Holiday in which all hotels in the financial district had large discounts. Buffet breakfasts at this Shangri-La were excellent. Connected to a mall, for convenience.Only minus: Membership program was poor. We stayed 10 nights, only to be offered the opportunity to *start* a membership (and our nights weren't counted towards the membership).

<Content>Nice hotel for the money They must have recently updated the rooms and infrastructure as everything was clean and new(ish). The rooms were large and the beds had nice linens. Good bath products and decent towels.The breakfast buffet is varied if a little bland, but the traditional Chinese fare was very good. Give congee a whirl.The gym and spa facilities were extremely nice and clean and a great way to work off some jet lag.Good service and an overall good experience for the business traveler. The 'big' attractions are a $4 cab ride away, but with Beijing traffic is kind of doesn't matter where you stay anyway.

<Content>Big Hotel I attended a conference at the hotel and found it to be grand, flashy and another really big, expensive hotel. There was nothing wrong with it but it offered an experience that was repeatable at virtually any big hotel in the world. It had Chinese folks working and a Chinese garden but had that global feel that is universal. The location is a bit remote, and, given Beijing traffic, a good hike to the central sites. But taxis are readily available and inexpensive. On the night I arrived, it was late and rainy so I went to the cafe for food and spent as much for a plate of spaghetti as I had for four really excellent dinners in Shanghai at a local place. Regardless of the location, I rarely feel that there is much value in this kind of hotel. They are very friendly in that here's what you do kind of way as they charge outrageous sums for virtually every transaction. The room was lovely, the pool and other facilities were excellent, and the kitchen provided tasty meals but otherwise I could have been anywhere on the globe.

<Content>fantastic time I can not believe that this hotel does not fall higher up in the ratings for hotels in Beijing.Over the past few years, we have stayed in quite a few Shangri La hotels, but was least looking forward to staying here becasue of the reviews.The hotel itself is smaller than some of the others and is a taxi ride out of the city. (never costing more than æ‹¢2 to travel anywhere, usually about 50p!) When we arrived at the hotel, we were shown to our room by a lady in guest relations. It was our anniversary and there was a cake, box of chocolates, red roses and a bottle of wine waiting for us. The lady wanted to take our photo, but declined due to 15 hrs travelling. Felt really bad about this later. Everywhere we went in the hotel, we were greeted by name. The service really was exceptional!We had a high floor looking over the city and gardens. We even had blue sky on one day!Breakfast was fantastic, so much to choose from. We also stayed at the Shangri La in Shanghai, but preferred this one.Highly recommended!

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Location OK We spent 3 days here at the end of March. Our room was in the tower and was, by American standards, a little small. In UK terms it was quite spacious. The bed a full kIng size was very comfortable and the room was very quiet. The bathroom had a shower separate from the bath a real personal plus point.Our view was out of the back of the hotel over the gardens and was fine, I expect rooms on the south side overlooking the highway intersection may be a little noisier. Others have remarked on the proximity of the intersection but we did not find it intrusive. We've stayed in far noisier city hotels elsewhere. In fact on a positive note the location on the third ring road made it easy to travel away from the hotel. But the location is quite isolated - we had transport so for us this was not an issue. But without it I would expect this could be a problem. In fact the only problem with an otherwise flawless hotel.Service was excellent - attentive, friendly, and everyone we encountered had enough English for us to successfully communicate our requirements.The breakfast buffet was enormous and I would defy anyone not to find something to eat either Oriental or Western in addition there was an a la carte menu we didn't need to sample. We also ate here - a light meal in the Yi cafe late one evening and even though they were about to stop serving we were not rushed and watched as they dismantled and removed the ice sculptures from the buffet for repacking in the freezers!Check in was quick and efficient, and I was addressed by name, always a nice touch.All told this was a great first 'Shangri La' experience and one I would repeat without hesitation.

<Content>Mixed experience Stayed here for 3 nights as part of post-cruise package. Room was in the older wing and showed its age a bit--could use updating. Best part of the experience there was the food in both the Coffee Shop and the Blu Lobster. Also lovely garden which is a respite from the crazy traffic. Location is not great--not pedestrian-friendly. Staff speaks little English but are very nice and try hard to accomodate.

<Content>Fantastic Booked this hotel last August reason being as my daughter is at the university in that area so location wise it suited us brilliantly, so after reading reports about this hotel after I had booked it I was thinking I had made a mistake.. Not to be , we stayed in the orinal part of the Hotel not the new wing, rooms maybe a tad dated but fine infact the beds are the comfiest...Breakfast was just brilliant there was such a geart selection that i couldnt even list everything, staff were polite and charming, not hovering over you wanting to be tipped... but Beijingers do not expect to be tipped so dont.Both restauruants in the hotel were brillant... Blu Lobster was the most probably the best I have had the pleasure to eat in... if its good enough for Celine Dion well.......there you go.Location wise yes it is somewhat out of the way... taxis are cheap, I wouldnt recommend the subway as we used it but my daughter is used to it and can speak the language, we did the major attractions and the longest we were in a taxi was about 40 mins... in fact I was glad i booked this hotel and not one nearer to the other attractions, beijing is ssooooo big you will always be stuck in some kind of traffic....

<Content>Fantastic if you want to be away from the centre of Beijing First of all, this hotel is really far away from the centre of Beijing (ie Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City etc). I'm talking a 30 minute ride in a taxi. Yes, taxis are extremely cheap in Beijing, but I didn't enjoy spending 5 hours a day in them getting to an from our hotel.Also, being in this location, there are no restaurants or shops anywhere nearby. Nothing worth visiting is within walking distance, so you need to be aware you are very isolated, but to be honest, I was relieved we weren't staying in the centre of the city. It was a relief to get back to our peaceful hotel each day.The restaurants in the hotel were superb. I don't usually like eating in the hotels too much, I think it's important to get out there and 'be with the people', but we had so much trouble finding restaurants where menus were written even partly in English (KFC was really our only choice-if you're a fan, you'll be in heaven in Beijing), so we ate in the hotel every night. The food was amazing - I was never disappointed. It's not cheap though, so bring a credit card with a big limit.The hotel itself is nice. We were in a suite, and it was ok. A little dated, and the zebra print on the walls was a bit hard to get used to, but having 2 bathrooms was fantastic.The Horizon Club was ok (staff were fantastic) but next time I'd stay in the Valley Wing. Much nicer for a very similar price.The only bad thing I can say is the service in the lobby lounge broke my heart. We went there one day after going to the Great Wall, and the girls working there wouldn't let us have a table (perhaps because we looked too 'touristy' compared to all the business guests). I was furious and absolutely mortified. I went up to my room and got a bit upset and had a bit of a teary moment, but the girls in the Horizon Club were really nice to us, so it wasn't everyone in the hotel who was rude. The guys on the door definitely deserve a mention - they had the best English of anyone in the hotel, they were funny and a pleasure to see each day.All in all, this hotel is probably more suited to business travellers than tourists. We did not see one other tourist in the hotel for the entire week while we were there and we were told they were running at about 80% capacity, so you may feel like a fish out of water if you're on holiday.

<Content>Great service and comfortable rooms, but isolated location If you need or want to stay in the western part of Beijing, Shangri-la is a great option. Rooms are spacious and well-appointed, and hotel staff is eminently professional and courteous. Restaurants are all great, though pricey-- partly because of the dearth of competition in the neighborhood. Shangri-la is designed to be a small oasis in the city, and it succeeds in this, but as a consequence, you tend to pay for it through high-priced food/drink and other amenities. Still, this is my first choice anytime I come to Beijing for an extended period.

<Content>I miss the Shangri-La Beijing From the outside it doesnt match how the inside looked like. The front desk, concierge desk and the restaurant at Cafe Cha were great. They were all very helpful. The rooms were so environmently friendly with their key card as a slot for turning on the lights to a friendly reminder of where your key card is. Everything was labeled with what switch goes to what. Their use of furniture is so smart and friendly. The beds to their roll away bed are comfortable. Even if you are there for one night, you must try their jacuzzi, steam room and sauna. Their heath center spa was a great bonus! they have a swimming pool that is beautiful, you wouldnt think it was a swimming pool. They have all these amendities for you. They're breakfast buffet is out of this world and their dinner buffet Desserts are incredible. If you venture out remember to ask the Concierge desk to recommend places to go for a bite. They are prompt, safe and clean. I would definitely go back the Shangri-la.

<Content>OK as far a as travel group htoel, but.... We first stayed at the Grand Hyatt Beijing, then transferred here rto begin our Viking river cruise experience.NOT a 4 star hotel, even in China. Maybe a 3. Staff did not really understand English, and were a bit surly. Room certainly was not 4 star. Food not much better,although breakfast buffet was quite good. Right on a major highway, more polluted than most locations from auto smog. Lousy location also caused us to have to taxi for dinner quite a distance.Bed not very comfortable, AC marginal. Avoid if you can.

<Content>Stay in the Valley Wing! From reading reviews it appears choice of which wing you stay in is critical to your opinion of this hotel. I stayed in the Valley wing during my stay and found it to be and extremely comfortable and enjoyable experience.From the check in, where the reception staff escorted you to the room for check in, to the check out where same staff escorted you to the taxi, the service was impeccable.The room was comfortable and practical including king size bed, walk in robe and flat screen TVs in both living room and bathroom (the bathroom a smaller version built into the mirror). For business the desk was set up with multi adapter sockets on the power and the broadband service was free, although a little slow.The Valley Wing has a business lounge on the 12th floor which serves complimentary food and wine throughout the day with an open bar happy hour from 5-7pm- the scene of a few late nightcaps and cause of a few early morning headaches. The breakfast and dinner(snack) buffets were small but good quality.The gym is modern and well equipped although can be a little busy in the morning. There is also a great 25m lap pool.Not matter which wing you stay the hotel is a long way from the centre- approximately 30min by car and the subway is also not convenient to the hotel. There is a travel desk which is efficient in organising either personal or group tours which were good value (personal day tour to Great Wall and Ming Tombs was approx. $150). Restaurants in the hotel are expensive( very!), and would be better advised to travel outside for dinner.In all, recommend if staying here that you upgrade to the Valley Wing and enjoy an extremely comfortable hotel experience.

<Content>Okay hotel, bad location for leisure travelers Having stayed at the Kerry Centre many times, I had high expectations for the Shangri-la. While the hotel was okay overall, I wouldn't suggest that others going to Beijing stay there unless they really had to be in that part of town. I had two rooms: the first was a horizon level room in the Garden wing, the second was a Valley wing room. The Garden wing room was not particularly nice - it reminded me of the Excelsior in Hong Kong. The room is small but adequate. The decor is okay, but not particularly nice. Certainly not as nice as the Kerry Centre or the Peninsula. The real problem with this room was noise. I could hear the upstairs neighbors - kids who jumped on the floor until the wee hours of the morning. I moved to a Valley wing room at the suggestion of one of the hotel staff. This room was much nicer - larger, more natural light, a much nicer bathroom, a sitting area separate from the sleeping area. Importantly, I could not hear the neighbors. I was much happier with this room overall. However, I still think it's a bit much to force people to pay extra to stay in the Valley wing to have what they should expect: a room that offers the ability to sleep in peace. The gym is nice - but not any better than the one at the Kerry Centre. I had a massage in the spa and found it to be only okay. The Chi spa chain has a weird way of branding their spa treatments - lots of tea and bells and stuff I don't care about at all. I wasn't there to feel beautiful or whatever they imagined brought me to the spa; I was there because my back never really recovered from the 14 hour trip to Beijing. As elsewhere in the hotel, they tack on a 15% service charge. They also seemed to expect a tip in addition to this, which I found very cheeky. The food was okay but not great - pretty much what I would expect from a hotel. It was, of course, vastly overpriced. While this is what I expect, it's especially annoying because this hotel is located pretty far from commercial districts where there would be more choice. In fact, it's surrounded on two sides by motorways that are pretty much jammed all day long. That sight, and the thought of being stuck for hours in traffic, did not inspire me to go out and be adventurous, something I always did when staying in Chaoyang (where the Kerry Centre is). Overall, this hotel is okay in a pinch - when you need to be out in that part of town. But I would not put it on my short list for any other reason.

<Content>Out-of-the-Way, Group-Oriented Hotel We stayed at the Shangri-La Beijing for three nights as part of a pre-cruise package. For the previous five days when we were traveling independently, we stayed at The Peninsula Beijing. Though both are 5 star hotels, there is no comparison. The Peninsula wins on all counts.The Shangri-La is quite far from all of the major sights except the Summer Palace. Because of The Peninsula's central location, we could walk or take short taxi rides to the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, Wangfunjing Street, the Back Lakes, Drum Tower, Jinshan Park, the Temple of Heaven, and Lama Temple wasting almost no time in travel. From the Shangri-La these must-see sights are 45 minutes to over an hour away by taxi.The room at the Shangri-La was in the older tower. It was quite large with a comfortable bed. The bath had a tub/shower combination. Unlike many newer hotels, there was no separation of the sinks/toilet/tub areas. Rooms in the new tower may be more modern and luxurious in appearance and function. Much is made of the hotel's location in a park-like, garden setting. In fact, the hotel surrounds a small green area made to look like old Beijing. It is nice but in no way a real park éˆ¥æ’¯â‚¬?just hotel hardscape and landscaping.Except for an ample buffet breakfast which was part of the pre-cruise package, we ate only one meal in the hotel. Surprisingly for such a large hotel, no full-service restaurant was open throughout the day. We settled for deli fare beside the larger lobby restaurant for a late afternoon meal. The charge for two hot sandwiches with fries, some slaw, and two cokes was $55.00 éˆ¥æ’¯â‚¬?quite expensive for what it was.Like the Shangri-La hotels in Bangkok and Hong Kong (Kowloon), this one seemed more oriented toward large groups attending conferences or on tours. It lacked the distinguishing personality and character of many 5 star Asian hotels. But more important its location gave no hint that the visitor was in Beijing. It could have been in any busy, commercial area surrounded by freeways in Asia. For anyone who prefers easy access to sights and freedom to walk to at least some of the sights that they want to see, I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>luxury Although I was wary of what 5 stars might mean in China, the Shangri La is without a doubt the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. Rooms have every amenity you could think of, and many you can't! Def fulfulled my expectations. Hotel caters to westerners, so finding extremely helpful staff that spoke understandable English was easy, as was finding recognizable food and drinks. Two standout areas: 1) The gym/spa is incredible. The wood panelled free-weight room will make you want to lift all day! 2)The coffee. Seriously, it and the whole breakfast buffet was awesome. Other recommendation - the garden bar is a great place to enjoy a drink and a Beijing night.

<Content>great hotel, bad location The hotel and the amenities were everything I expect in a Shangri-la hotel. I stayed there for 2 nights in the new tower. The room was large and clean and well maintained. The fitness center was well equipped. The food was good and there were lots of options.Access to and from the hotel was easy with Taxi's.The only negative I have for the hotel was it's location. I like to explore the area I'm staying in by walking around. There was nothing around the hotel nearby (within walking distances). You have to know where you want to go and get a taxi to get there.

<Content>Top Notch Had a 4 night stay in March and these were our observations.Staff - Wonderfull - nothing was too much for them.Food - Buffet breakfast superb - plenty of western and eastern choices both of very high quality. We also ate in the bar 1 night with very good nibbly food which was actually hideously expensive.Rooms - we had a room on the top floor with a great view - seperate walk in shower , lovely amenities , slippers , robes , spotlessly clean.Location - not a great deal for tourists in local area - there is a supermarket in the basement of the shopping mall if you come out the hotel at the front entrance turn right and walk for 2 minutes. Taxi to the local subway station was 15rmb ( æ‹¢1 ) or to Tiannamen square was 44rmb ( æ‹¢3 ).Facilities - Had magnificent couples massage at the spa which was out oif this world - best spa we have ever been to oozing class - swimming pool pretty small and a big let down for what is a super hotel.

<Content>A Hotel which Oozes Excellence The Shangri-La Beijing acts as a beautiful and idyllic retreat from the hustle and bustle city that is Beijing. The rooms are more than just clean, or neat, they are amazing. The cuisine is better than fine, or nice, it is exquisite. The staff surpass all expectations of what one defines as service, the staff are simply brilliant. The physical hotel itself is marvellous; the lobby with its marble floors heighten the sense of luxury and grandeur. However, the greatest aspect of this hotel is the beautiful gardens which are kept to perfection. The Shangri-La Beijing really is an exceptional hotel and any chance to stay here should not be missed.

<Content>Good hotel, should be even better once renovation is done Great hotel. I know it sounds cheesy, but the buffet is great! After spending 1 week in Shanghai prior to coming to Beijing, I was pretty burnt out on Chinese food (cow's face anyone ?). I was very please to come to a GREAT lunch buffet with food from every corner of the globe. Indian, Italian, American, even sushi! And the food was actually quite good. Staff is very friendly, rooms are decent sized. Cleaning staff does good job turning the rooms. Great cigar store in the hotel if you're in the mood for a Cuban.

<Content>great but watch the location Got into a wide and beautiful room with lots of light and an unusual lay out for the worktable and the fridge area. Hotel is top fly but I realised I was west of the city when all my biz partners are actually located east of Beijing.the buffet restaurant is one of the best I've been in Asia, service was a little unprofessional at time. Great experience overall.

<Content>Excellent in every aspect It was a pity that my stay in Beijing was only for 2 days as I would have loved to stay longer at the Shangrila Beijing hotel. Upon arrival, I was greeted by name and escorted to my room for a personalised check in. I was upgraded to an executive suite on the 23rd floor. The suite was excellent and consisted of a living room with a good area allocated as a mini business center with a work table, ample electric sockets, free internet conection and a fax / printer machine. There was a guest toilet next to it. Flat screen TV with DVD player and an assortment of audio CDs were kept. The other room was a bedroom with a large king sized bed , a full bathroom with a separate shower and quality toiletries. Service was exemplary and excellent in every aspect. We had breakfast in the restaurant and the choice was enormous with all sorts of dishes from Chinese, Japanese , Malaysian and American cuisines. The horizon club lounge was also accessible for us. It was a bright lounge, very well decorated and on the 21st floor offering sweeping views. From 5-7 pm there was an assortment of hot and cold quality snacks and desserts as well as drinks. My overall impression of the hotel and staff was nothing but excellent. The only drawback is that the hotel is quite far off the city center and bearing in mind the traffic conditions during weekdays, it can take well over an hour to reach downtown if your work requires so.

We stayed at 5 star hotels all over China and this hotel had the best beds and most comfortable rooms of all. It has a beautiful garden area, wonderful breakfast buffet.I would definitely give it 5 stars.

<Content>Absolutely SUPERB! I used TripAdvisor to do some research in hotels in Beijing before we booked it. Dragonair holidays gave us a choice of 4 and 5 star and after researching, we chose this one.We had been warned it was a bit further out from the city but we had our own driver so it was ok.Hotel was absolutely incredibly beautiful. beautiful tranquil garders and the cuisine was awesome.Try the Shang Palace.. food in there was amazing and at a good price too.The rooms were stunning too.. very well decorated and very clean and modern.Anyone staying in Beijing, I would urge you to consider this one.
