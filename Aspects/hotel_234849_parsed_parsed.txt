<Content>A little worn  This is probably a good value for Barcelona. The room is large, with a large closet, drawers in the closet, safe, and large cupboards above the closet. There is a kitchen area in the room, with a sink, stove, cupboards above it all,  mini refrigerator, all enclosed with an armoire-type door. You would think that one wouldn't need the frig, but it was actually nice to have. I walked up and down the street looking for some sort of grocery or convenience store one night  finally found it to the left of the metro station. Thus, I got milk, salomi, cheese, juice, etc.  it was nice to put in the frig. The room had a full size bed, which was nice for a change in Europe, where most beds are twin size. The end table seemed built into the wall, like it was a part of the head board or something. There was a fold down table that was handy, and two chairs. Large windows opened up to the street and I found it to be quiet. There was a bidet in the bathroom  I rather tight squeeze, but a nice big tub, with a handheld shower. In the kitchen, there were dishes, utensils, a coffee pot, too. The room was very clean. It had a TV with several channels. The usual English CNN. It had and adjustable heater/AC. It did seem a little worn and shabby, though  did not look like the website picture. There were a couple of cigarette burns on the bedspread. I think they were renovating some of the rooms. On the plus side, the staff were very nice  seemed to try really hard to accommodate their guests. In that regard, it was a proper hotel. There was a computer with internet access in the lobby, and even a printer, for guests to use. The staff seemd to try hard to be welcoming  answer questions, or give one a map to draw on and point things out. I took the Aeroporto Bus #1 from the airport to arrive there, for 4.05 Euro, to Plaza Catalunya. Then I took the metro 3 stops, I believe, to Fontanna. Exit and practically go straight down a street, several minute walk, and you will see 3 flags, and that is the hotel. I'm glad their website said to see the flags, because I got off, asked 2 metro attendants,  they said go to another metro stop. I disregarded their advise  walked down the street anyway, seeng the flags,  there was the hotel. I did not have a problem with getting to the hotel. The metro was a little stressful for me. I guess because I'm not used to taking a metro. There were homeless people there, sleeping, asking for change, or people singing or playing the guitar for money. It seemed like you had to go down, down, down into the metro  walk quite a ways. I had to ask somebody the first time I went  another time I went in the wrong direction  on the wrong metro line. After that I got it. You can buy 10 metro trips for something like 7 euro, or 1.30 euro per ticket. The metro machine was pretty easy to use. After I figured out that you could take a left from the hotel  a right down the main street, I thought that was better than the metro. I caught my hop-on, hop-off bus that way, and avoided the rather hot, busy metro, until I flew out. Plaza Catalunya is a happening place. People all the time. It's about a 20 minute walk from the hotel. As I'm sure it's already been posted, be careful about pickpocketers. I didn't have a problem, but there is so many people, crowed everywhere, especially in the metro tunnel, and Plaza C. that it seems easy to be pickpocketed. A mother  son traveler that I met on my tour to Montserrett said their hotel clerk told them to be careful as she had been robbed twice  she lived there! I'm sure, though, like everywhere, be careful, and take precautions. Oh yeah, there is nice shops, some tapas bars, and a couple of nice restaurants right around the corner from this hotel. (Again, take a left from the hotel, then a right in front of the metro station.)Overall, this is proper hotel, in a good location, easy to get to by the metro  the aeroporto bus, or walking, which is more enjoyable than the metro to get to things. It is in a nice area, too. Probably a solid value for Barcelona.

<Content>Great Hotel Very well located, 2 minute walk to nearest metro station in a nice area. We had a comfort room which was really nice. Kitchen area had a fridge, microwave, kettle and hob. Nice bathroom with shower, all very clean. Room was cleaned daily. Only disadvantage was that our room had no natural light whatsoever making it very dark in the daytime. It was difficult to know what to wear as we couldn't see out of the window! Staff were reasonably helpful. On our last day we were able to leave our bags in reception to save having to carry them around as we were on an evening flight. Free internet access was very useful. Did nid use the cafe/bar as made breakfast in our room and then were out for the rest of the day.A well priced hotel and we would gladly return to both the hotel and Barcelona

<Content>Very convenient The hotel is located just across the street from Fontana metro station, which makes it easy to arrive from El Prat airport (take Renfe train till Passeig de Gracia, then take L3 towards Trinitad Nova / Caneyelles, and you can use the same T-10 trip for this, as long as it takes no more than 1.15 min). What I loved most was the location, on foot it took about 40 min to get to the seaside, on a wide shopping street which gives into Las Ramblas. The hotel room we had (comfort) was fairly big, cleaned daily, I found the kitchen really useful (dishes, fridge.. ), the bathroom was also nice. The only flaw of this hotel is that noise can be easily heard, so make sure to get earplugs. All in all, if walls were thicker, this hotel would be perfect.

<Content>Good location Although on a drab and narrow side street this hotel is just yards fom the Fontana metro station. We found this to be the ideal way to get around for our short visit to Barcelona using the 10euro 2-day pass, Hotel room was small but clean and well maintained and our room was quiet.(Friends had a room overlooking the street and found it noisy on the Friday night into the small hours). We booked through the hotel web-site and got a rate of 105 euro per night - very reasonble for Barcelona. Breakfast was extra - served on a small terrace - continental- adequate - 9 euros. Most front desk staff had excellent English and were very helpful. Good restaurants nearby or a short metro ride gets you to Las Ramblas with all kinds of eateries.

<Content>Great little hotel This is a great little hotel with excellent helpful staff. All rooms are pleasant clean and have a small kitchenette. There is free use of the internet connection in reception. Breakfast should you choose to take it is served in the courtyard garden and there is plenty of choice. It is two minutes away from the nearest metro and there are enough restaurants, cafes and shops within walking distance of the hotel. We only stayed two nights on our first visit but unexpectedly returning to Barcelona a week later we chose to stay again at Hotel Silver. A pity the English Father and son booking in at the same time were so ignorant to the staff who were trying to help them.

<Content>Only the Highest Praise This is going to be such a positive review, people will think I must be the owner or a relative of the manager. Not true!Our family group of 11 people in 6 rooms stayed here twice in the summer of 2008, for one night upon arriving in Barcelona and then for two nights a week later.All our arrangements were made by email with the hotel and everything was friendly and professional; all was as we expected when we arrived.The location is terrific - in the Gracia neighborhood (sometimes called the Greenwich Village of Barcelona), one block from the Fontana station on the L3 Metro line. If you are new to Barcelona (as we were), let me tell you that being close to the L3 is ideal - it makes it easy to go everywhere that you want to visit while in the city. (Get a T-10 pass and figure out the system by which multiple people can use the same ticket.) All sorts of shops and services also are close at hand. The area felt safe and fun - we loved it.This is not a luxury hotel - and you won't pay luxury rates. Instead, it is a medium-size operation with clean, efficient, and quiet rooms at a very fair price. So don't stay here if you want the Ritz. But if you don't want to pay for the Ritz, this is the place for you - you won't be disappointed. Look at their very honest Web site; it gives you a perfect feel for what the hotel is like. If you like what you see online, then it's a good bet that you will be happy when you arrive.The beds mostly fill the rooms, but still they've fit in a desk, a kitchenette (fridge, microwave, cooktop), a closet, and a fold-down shelf. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are functional. Everything was clean and maintained well. There is a charming courtyard where you can enjoy breakfast or gather your group for cocktails in the evening. There's a computer with Internet available at no charge in the lobby (but you may have to wait your turn to use it), or you can pay for access to WiFi by the hour or by the day.If you get the concept that hotel rooms are where you sleep, then you will find Aparthotel Silver offers a great way to save some money and still have a solid and enjoyable base of operations while you visit an exciting and beautiful city (with, incidentally, perfect summer weather).Finally, I have to add a word about the staff. We have never met friendlier, more helpful people. Beyond being cheerful and friendly, they were knowledgeable and eager to help in any way. Thank you, Aparthotel Silver.

<Content>Not bad I stayed at the Aparthotel Silver for four nights last month (April 2008). I was travelling with my mother, who hadn't been to Barcelona since 1989, so I was hoping to find somewhere nice to stay - but not too expensive (we were on quite a tight budget). Unfortunately it seemed to be a very expensive time to book a hotel in Barcelona, possibly because of St George's Day, but we managed to find rooms at the Hotel Silver for a reasonable price. On each floor of the hotel there are 2 rooms facing onto an internal courtyard which is not open to the sky (there's a panel of small glass squares at the top) and because we opted for the cheapest rooms, these were the ones we got. I found it a bit strange not having any natural light in the room at all, and as it was quite warm and the air conditioning is not allowed to go below a certain temperature, it did get quite hot and stuffy. (There was an electric fan supplied in each room, but mine was slightly faulty and my mother's didn't work at all.) But it was a comfortable room, with a kitchenette (which we didn't use) and a fridge, and the bathroom - although small - was clean and had a good shower. The little box of chocolates left for us on the bed was a nice gesture.The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast, served partly in the bar and partly in a kind of marquee going out into the garden, was good - pastries, jam, cheese, ham, toast, fruit, cereal and typically strong Spanish coffee.The hotel is in the Gracia district of Barcelona which is a very nice neighbourhood, busy and attractive without being too touristy. I would definitely stay at the Hotel Silver again, although next time I would save up for an outside-facing room.

<Content>Nice little hotel... We just returned from our 10 day trip to Spain and stayed at the Silver Aprthotel from April 2-5. After extensive research on trip advisor, I booked the hotel for my wife and I as well as another couple and we were not dissapointed. We chose the Silver based on price as well as location (conveniently near the metro). The Hotel: While a small hotel, it has a friendly atmosphere and all of the people who worked reception were kind and spoke excellent English. We stayed in a standard room (double bed for 92 euros). The room was small but this appears to be the trend in Europe (correctly advertised based on the pictures from the website). Not a big deal since we didn't spend much time there. It was clean and had a decent bathroom. Would recommend keeping your windows closed at night though to keep the noise down that comes from passer-bys on the street at 2am. Getting there: It cost us 35 euros to arrive by taxi from the airport (extra charge for 2 pieces of luggage and travel from the aiport itself). Keep in mind this was at 8am and during rush hour, otherwise I expect it would have cost ~25 euros as the hotel site indicated. You can also arrive by taking the aeroport bus (pay when you get on) from the Airport to Plaza Catalunya and then take the metro from Plaza Catalunya to Fontana (L3/Green Line towards Zona Universitat) for ~4 euros + ~1 euro respectively. I would recommend buying the T10 pass (as per other reviews) for the metro which cost 7.5 euros (purchased at the entrance of every metro stop, provides a total of 10 rides per card, and can be used by multiple passengers). The hotel is only 50 yrds from the Fontana stop (which is 3 stops from Plaza Catalunya, the hub of the city). FYI- Our friends took the aeroport bus + metro to the hotel and said it was cumbersome carrying their luggage up the stairs/escalators at the metro. Location: As above, the hotel is conveniently located near the Fontana metro stop and is a 20-25 min walk to las Ramblas (although we always took the metro). There are several restaurants near the hotel as well as small bakeries and such. Never ate breakfast at the hotel so I can't comment on that. It was nice to be away from the craziness of Las Ramblas as other reviewers have commented. Would defintely recommend this Hotel to other travelers based on price and location near the metro.

<Content>Great Hotel!!! We are going back... We were a little worried about where to stay in Barcelona on our honeymoon, but this was by far the best place. We loved it and the people were great. We had a wonderful stay and hotel employees knew every direction we may need. The use of their internet also made it so wonderful when we missed our flight to Paris. Out of all the places we stayed in Spain we liked this the best. We are for sure heading back!

<Content>Good choice for independent travelers Our stay at Aparthotel Silver was lovely. We had a renovated room facing the inner courtyard, which most of the time was deserted. The mini-kitchen in the room was very helpful -- they even have a fold-out table with chairs, so you can dine in your room in comfort if you don't feel like eating at a restaurant. The location is good if you want to be in a more residential Barcelona neighborhood, rather than in the more heavily touristed areas. The hotel is conveniently located near the subway, bus stop, grocery stores, shopping, drug stores, laundry, bakeries, etc. If you go, make sure to explore the neighborhood on foot. I'm getting nostalgic already!

<Content>Decent hotel I booked this hotel after reading reviews here.Pros: Location, location, location; cleanliness, decent rooms, internet access in the receptionCons: Small rooms, housekeeper left the window open and I fell very illThe hotel is conveiently located to the subway, and hence an excellent choice. I wish I had spent more on a bigger room, because my room was a bit on the smaller side and had a very small bathroom. However, since I spent most of my time outside the hotel, it did not bother me as much. What bothered me was that housekeeping left the window open everyday, and covered it with the curtain. It was hard to know that the window was open because of its location in the room. The first night it got very cold and I fell very very ill. That somewhat ruined my trip. I then realized that they left the window open and I made it a point to close it each night. I don't understand why housekeeping would leave it open and cover it with a curtain! Anyway, when I got back home, I had to take two sick days because I was extremely unwell.The next time, I would look for another hotel or pay more for a better room here.

<Content>Great little place, great location, great price Aparthotel Silver is a great little find. It's in the Eixample area of Barcelona. Nice tidy room, friendly English speaking staff, free internet access. Also, great price! You can walk easily from it all the way down Passeig de Gracia, which will get you to Placa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas, or over to Diagonale. The sidewalk cafes along Passeig are great!The hotel's great for its location and price. It's not fancy, but very comfortable for a budget traveller. You're not going to find princess balconies or tons of European charm here. But, you will get a good night's sleep in a comfortable room close to everything Barcelona has to offer.

<Content>excellence on a budget My wife and I spent four days at Aparthotel Silver in May 2007. We picked it because it offered non-smoking rooms, but the hotel has much, much more to recommend it. Our room faced the inner courtyard, so it was particularly quiet. The room was very clean and well furnished, if a little bit small. The bed was also small: full size, but our room had an extra twin bed, and both beds were comfortable.The desk staff was friendly and helpful (and spoke very good English). The hotel gives guests free access to a computer with a high speed internet connection, in the lobby. The location was great, just one block away from the Fontana Metro station. (The Metro is by far the fastest and easiest way to get around Barcelona). We appreciated the compact kitchen, and found a good grocery store just around the corner. The buffet breakfast offered in the attractive inner courtyard looked pretty good, but we passed it up to save some money. Also located within one block: Casa Fuster, one of Gaudi's buildings. We enjoyed our stay there, and would be happy to stay there again on our next trip to Barcelona.

<Content>Good hotel My wife and I stayed here in September 2006 and had a great time in Barcelona. Very good value for money, although we chose an unrenovated room so the decor was quite dated and the fittings/fixtures a somewhat used. The location is excellent, being very close to the subway. We didn't really explore the local area as such as we always had other places to go and the subway was most convenient. Service was excellent though I can't comment on the food as we always ate out. There was a kitchenette in our room that we didn't really make use of but if we returned we would as it's a great way to save on expenses and the local procduce really was fantastic anyway.

<Content>Fantastic! My partner and I visited Barcelona in April 2007 and stayed for a long weekend. We stayed at the Aparthotel Silver and could not fault the hotel in any way.We booked this hotel on the strength of tripadvisor ratings and were not disapointed.The hotel is quite simple but provided everything you could possibly need. Our room was very clean and the maid service was excellent.The staff at reception were very friendly, their English was excellent, they were very helpful with directions and helped with places of interest.The hotel is roughly about 30 seconds walk from the metro which we found to be the ideal way of getting about in Barcelona.All in all we would recommend both Barcelona and the Aparthotel Silver to anyone should they be considering a visit.

<Content>Faultless-Both Stays I have just finished my second short break at this hotel. Both were 3/4 days and last time was back in 2002.I am pleased to say that this hotel is every bit as impressive now as it was 5 years ago. Both times I have stayed with my wife and 2 children (in 2 rooms) and on neither occasion have any of us had any reason to complain.The hotel is friendly, some rooms have kitchenette facilities which is very handy for families, they are visited daily by the maid and kept very clean, the prices are reasonable and you can use the internet in the lobby for free-no questions asked.It is a little out of the centre of town but only a walk of 20 mins or so and its literally one minute to the underground. If you are a family looking for a nice quiet place close to the town centre, you are unlikely to do better than the Silevr Aparthotel.

<Content>friendly place My partner and I stayed here for a week in September. The staff were friendly, including the breakfast staff and chambermaid. Checking in and out was very fast and efficient. While the room was very basic and somewhat disappointing when we first saw it, it wasn't so bad once we settled in, and was clean, with a kitchenette with all basic supplies. The room looked out over the hotel garden and the backs of apartment houses with surprisingly little noise; some noise came from other guests' chairs screeching along the floors, otherwise we slept very well. Turning right out the hotel entrance and walking to the corner you find an ATM, and going uphill from there in the same block is a Condis supermarket where we loaded up on snacks and food for the room.Although the metro is close by, it involved long escalator rides into very hot, stale air, with some connections down long tunnels, not a pleasant experience. We found very detailed bus maps in the hotel lobby and ended up using the buses more, avoiding the metro as much as possible and seeing more of the city. Don't forget to buy transit passes first (in the metro), and stick them in the slots once boarding the buses. We found the 10-fare passes convenient and used two passes each during the week.While on the online reservation form we specified we wanted breakfast included, in fact we were billed separately (each morning at breakfast -- which had a large variety of selections -- the hostess had us sign a sheet), which created some confusion at checkout but not a problem.This was my first time in Barcelona so I can't compare with other accommodations, but I felt like this was probably as good a deal as we could get for the money.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay This was our first visit to Barcelona. We booked our hotel direct based on tripadvisor ratings. We were not in anyway disappointed. We chose to avoid the La Rambla area for noise reasons, but wanted to be within walking distance. Excellent location in Gracia district. Great shopping, close to Fontana subway station and a good walk to La Rambla. We had an interior room overlooking the courtyard. which was very quiet. We did not eat at the hotel so cannot comment on breakfast. This hotel while dated, was clean and comfortable and good value for the Euro charged and a great safe location. Would recommend.

<Content>Good Stay We have stayed 4 nights in this hotel and enjoy our stay. The location is quite good and just a minute walk from the metro station, very convenient. The receptionists are very kind and helpful, the receptionists in the day time can speak fluent English and there's no problem to ask them everything about Spain or Barcelona.We stayed on the 4th floor and facing other buildings' gardens, not a good view but i think it's more quiet than those room facing the street. We have booked a double room, however i think the one we're staying is a family room, coz it's rather big and there's another single bed apart from the double bed, and with all cooking equipments. The furnitures look a bit old but doesn't really matter. The washroom is big and clean, with towels changing everyday.There is a welcome gift which is a little box of chocolate and made every day of our stay sweet!The best thing is the there's free internet accesss in the lobby.The price is reasonable and it's a good choice to stay at if want a balance between the price and quality.

<Content>Great location and good value! We are a young couple and stayed at the Aparthotel Silver for 2 nights in October. The location is excellent in the quiet Gracia, close to the Fontana metro station, only 2 stops away from Park Guell and three stops away from La Rambla. You can also see Gaudi's Casa Vicens which is just a block away. There are nice neighbourhood tapas bars around, away from the tourist crowd.The staff was polite and helpful. There is a free Internet in the lobby. While the decor is a bit outdated, the room size is bigger than what you can normally expect in a metropolitan city for the money. Another plus is the garage for those driving (it's EU 12 extra but this is still very reasonable and convenient).Overall, I'd recommend the hotel as it offers great value for the price.

<Content>Only OK LOCATION: Excellent. Located in the Gracia district, the hotel is only a 1-minute walk to the Fontana metro stop and a few bus lines. There are a ton of restaurants and shops also within a 1-minute walk.ROOMS: We stayed in a room that looked like it hadn't been refurbished in about 20 years. It was fairly small and not clean (a few disgusting hairs in the bathroom). The bathroom was also incredibly small.STAFF: Our limited interactions with the staff were OK.NOISE: Was not a problem for us. The hotel itself is located on a pretty quiet street.INTERNET: Free internet via a computer terminal in the lobby. Not sure if free wireless was also available.MISC: We liked the glycerin soaps that were provided. They smelled like lemon!

<Content>Not the best experience I am currently staying at the Silver Hotel in Barcelona and here is my opinion:The good:1. Very close to the metro (Fontana station) about 100m2. Free computer and internet on the lobby3. Cheap (but you get what you pay for)4. Friendly staff5. Close to restaurants, stores, etc.The bad:1. The rooms look like they have not been updated since the late 1970麓s.2. The air condition in our room sometimes worked (I was so hot one night that I took a cold wet towel and put it on my back)3. the bed is one of the pull out of the wall beds4. If your use to mid priced american hotels (marriott, holiday inn, hilton) etc. then I would advise choosing another hotel. 5. TV is small and the volume does not go past mid way point

<Content>Great location, good service, excellent value. LOCATIONAparthotel Silver is located off the L3 (green) subway line, a two minute walk from the Fontana stop.It is in a residential location that is quiet compared to the Placa Catalunya/Ramblas areas.There is good shopping within walking distance of the hotel and some restaurants too.SERVICEAll of the front desk staff spoke english well. Check in and check out were fast and easy.The hotel also lets you store your luggage if you arrive early or need to leave late. The storage area is out in the open under the stairs, but the staff was nice enough to hold my laptop computer behind the receiption desk until I left.You are asked to leave your key at reception every time you leave the property. Reception is available 24 hours. Check out time is at 11 am.ROOMSI had a standard room, one that hasn't been upgraded. It was in need of an upgrade, but everything was clean and worked fine. The bathroom was nice. TV was basic and had a couple of english channels. The rooms come with a fridge and stovetop, very convenient if you're spending a couple of nights. Air conditioning worked well and a manual fan also is provided. A safe is available as well, and it has an electronic lock that is easy to use. Road noise wasn't an issue.BREAKFASTThe hotel has a breakfast area on the first (second) floor. It costs seven euros. Food was basic but good. It included croissants, cereals, toast, juice, coffee, and bread with meat and cheese. The sitting area is outside in a nice garden area.INTERNET ACCESSThere is a desktop PC in the lobby with an internet connection that guests can use for free. There is also Wifi in the lower parts of the hotel. You buy an access card at the lobby. This card has a PIN code on it. Once you're in an area covered by the Wifi, simply open Internet Explorer and enter the PIN code on the website that appears to gain internet access. Cost for a 24 hour card is 12 euros. You can also buy them in hour increments if necessary. Just note that you'll need a room on either the first or second floor in order to use the Wifi from your room. Otherwise, you can pick up the Wifi in the lobby or in their garden (breakfast) area one level higher.TRANSPORTATIONThe subways in Barcelona are excellent: on-time, clean, and easy to use. If you're there for a weekend, I'd recommend purchasing the 10 ticket pack. It lets you ride 10 times (transfers to other lines during the same trip are not included in your limit) and costs around 13 euros. There are machines at each stop where you can buy tickets, and you can change the language of the machines as needed. Credit cards are taken, although the credit card readers didn't work in some machines.On a side note, I found the cheapest place to buy a water or coke was at the Placa Catalunya subway stop. There you will find a huge vending machine on the wall that sells a 1.5 liter coke for two euros.SUMMARYThis hotel is very cheap compared to others in Barcelona. I paid 85 euros on a Friday in late summer. But it doesn't feel like a cheap hotel, and even the rooms that haven't been refurbished are pretty nice, especially given the kitchenette. The location is really ideal; no reason to stay in the Ramblas/Catalunya area. The metro will take you there in five minutes and is very easy to use. It's nice to break away from the congestion of that area and have a quiet place to sleep. Aparthotel Silver is highly recommended.

<Content>Very enjoyable stay This hotel has lots going for it - efficient staff, free internet, gifts in the room each day (we stayed over Christmas), great location very close to the Metro and not much further to a small supermarket and other shops.We booked a studio room and were very satisfied with it. There was a small kitchenette in the room so we were able to use this for breakfast, snacks etc.The area around the hotel was well lit and we felt very secure walking around the area.

<Content>Great hotel in a great location We recently stayed in Aparthotel Silver in Barcelona for 3 nights. The rooms were clean and comfortable and reasonable, but if you are American don't expect a soft mattress. The area was quiet and very easy to access via the metro. The metro was 1/2 block away. The staff was accommodating and spoke decent English. I would suggest to get rooms facing the courtyard where it is quieter, however, the street is relatively quiet anyway, but cars do drive up and down the narrow street in the AM. Don't bother with their breakfast there are lots of places to eat a very short walk away.

<Content>Friendly service, excellent position I've been several times to Barcelona where I have relatives, last Christmas I was there with some friend of mine and decided to stay in an hotel, Aparthotel Silver has been an excellent choice.The position of the hotel is perfect, in the district of Gracia, once a small town just out of barcelona, nowadays one of the most apreciated residential districts of the city. Downtown can be easily reached with the underground (2/3 stops) and supermarkets, restaurants, tapas bar, etc. are just 5 mins away from the hotel.Rooms are quite large and clean, the bathroom is small but perfectly equipped, the small kitchen in every room is very useful. Personnel is friendly and fluently speaks several languages. At our arrival a box of excellent belgian chocolate was on the pillow and on new years eve a bottle of champagne, two glasses and a small basket of fruits, sweets and chocolate appeared on the table.The only little problem was that at our arrival there was an annoying smell of smoke in our room but the hotel can't be held responsive of the bad habits of some guest and opening the window solved the problem out.

<Content>very friendly hotel We have just come back from our first trip (3 days) to Barcelona - and loved every minute! The Aparthotel Silver has a few different types of room - we travelled with 2 other couples and saw the standard room, the business room and the superior room. All 3 types of room are priced appropriately. Naturally the superior room was the best - lovely big veranda, large bedroom, bathroom, etc. The Business room was good too, though a little smaller, and the standard room that we stayed in had no balcony and was fairly small - the pictures on their website do show the rooms clearly. Breakfast was good - nice selection of fruits, yoghurts, pastries, bread, cold meats and cheeses, etc. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly from the reception team to the maids and cafe workers. Internet access was free for guests. The location is excellent - just 2 minutes from the metro - and in a pleasant area (Gracia).Dont expect five star luxury, but do expect a warm welcome and a superb base for your trip to Barcelona.

<Content>Great location - you won't regret booking this hotel If you want to know more about the Silver, just visit their homepage (Hotelsilver) - there are no pictures / desrciptions that are not true.The hotel is just a hop away from the Metrostation Fontana, therfore all relevant sights of Barcelona are very easy to access.We booked a business (= newly refurbished) room - and could upgrade to a business  terrace room upon arrival for just 6 euros more. The room was excellent. Not very roomy but adequate. The terrace  the kitchenette was a perfect combination. You can have a cup of tea / coffee outside in your pj's almost before you wake up ; )) Although it is stated that there are two beds - they are close to each other. If you travel with a friend, make sure you like to be so close together. If you travel with your partner - the two beds shouldn't keep you from booking this hotel.Make sure you bring some teabags / instant coffee / coffeemate - there's nothing provided by the hotel.Next time I'll be in Barcelona (as I hope there will be a next time - WHAT A CITY!!!) I definitely book the Silver again.

<Content>Loved the friendly welcoming atmosphere We spent a total of four nights in this hotel. It was clean and very quiet. We were most impressed by the friendly welcoming arttitude of all the staff. The breakfast was affordable with a very good selection of food to choose from. Also the location right next to the underground was a big plus. The area around the hotel was pleasant and it was near enough to walk to Guell Park and although a longish walk into the city a very pleasant one. We can highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great small hotel We visited with friends and found the hotel to be well priced offering good value for money. It is located about 25 minutes on foot from Catalunya Square and 3 stops on metro from the same place. Metro station is only 3 mins from hotel. Reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Happily recommended some very good restaurants locally. Rooms were clean and adequate and can recommend.

<Content>Excellent and affordable hotel! My husband and I stayed in the Aparthotel Silver for two nights in Nov, 2005. The hotel is wonderful and the best part...incredibly affordable. The staff at the hotel are all really friendly and helpful. We were on the fourth floor and luckily there was an elevator (not to be taken for granted). We stayed in a standard room and it was very clean and spacious. The bathroom was quite large compared to other hotels we've stayed at in europe. The location is also excellent. It's only a few steps away from the Fontana metro stop and from there you can get anywhere in the city within a few minutes. The location is also very safe, a comfort if you return to your room late. The hotel also has free internet access and a luggage area if you need to store items after checking out. Breakfast is offered at an additional charge, although we never tried it. I would highly recommend this hotel for travelers to Barcelona.

<Content>Nice hotel in Barcelona My wife and I just returned from Barcelona, we stayed 4 nights at the Aparthotel Silver due to the good reviews we found on this site and because we found the price very affordable (80 鈧? compared to other hotels closer to Las Ramblas. We are not dissapointed and would stay here again if we had the chance. Staff is extremely helpful and accomodating, breakfast is very acceptable for 6.50 鈧?and location is perfect, just half a block from the subway station or you can walk to Las Ramblas in only 30 min. If you are very picky you might find the hotel not ideal, for example noises and cooking smells from other rooms (just keep the bathroom door closed!) but it didn't bother us at all. Who goes to Barcelona to spend too much time in the hotel anyway? Oh, and free Internet in the Lobby is a nice extra of this hotel.

<Content>Great value and location This is a great find in Barcelona for reasonable lodging in a nice, quiet neighborhood 1 block from the metro. It is a small, family run hotel -- clean well apointed rooms -- including a small kitchenette. The bathroom even has washclothes and an electrical outlet for curling irons (a rarity in Europe!). The staff were very accomodating and all spoke English. There was free internet access in the lobby. The cost (August, 2005) was 80 Euros per night, including all taxes.

<Content>Safe, cheap, but a little dirty/uncomfortable Slightly disappointed in the quality of our room. A disclaimer though - we took the least expensive room, type D, an interior room facing a courtyard but no exterior view. I think maybe some of the other room types have been renovated and maybe that's where the better reviews have come from. Our room felt old, musty and worn out. The bathroom was small and appeared clean but the tile floor didn't feel clean. The overall experience just did not make us feel comfortable. However, on the plus side - staff speaks English, free internet in the lobby, room rate was a bargain at 72EUR/night, convenient to everything on the Metro (just a few stops from the center of town, and the subway runs every 3 minutes or so). Note on the Metro - buy packs of 10 tickets for 6.30EUR - only 63 cents per ride. Single rides are 1.10 or 1.20. A day pass is 4 or 5 euros so we found that the 10-ride ticket was a much better deal. Several people can share the same 10 ride pass so you don't each have to buy one. We were there for 2 days and went all over the place on one 10-ride ticket. We also walked from Las Ramblas back to the hotel - about a 45 minute walk, but there are some pretty streets along the way... wouldn't walk every time, but it was nice to take a long walk after a big dinner. Parking is impossible in Barcelona but they do have a garage at the hotel. We returned our car to Hertz upon entering Barcelona so we didn't have to park. Bottom line - Aparthotel Silver is cheap, safe, but our experience was NOT romantic at all!! Great for people on a budget (which we were) but if you can find another place with better reviews within your budget, take it. Luckily we spent little time in the room so it really was not a bad deal.

<Content>A wonderful retreat My freind and I just returned from Barcelona yesterday. We planed to be frugal...not an easy task in Barcelona. So, initially we stayed at what turned out to be a disastrous choice, the guesthouse Solyk in the Barri Gotic .FYI- the Barric Gotic is a very beautiful area, but if you want to sleep do not stay in this barrio...pick a quieter more remote location. Don't limit yourself. Gracia is literally 5 minutes away from this location and the metro system is the best and easiest I've experienced in Europe. You can easily get anywhere very fast. Trains run on the dot every 5 minutes.For 75 euros (approx.$100 dollars/night) Solyk offered a sparsely furnished small room....no common area with soft drinks, tea/coffee and a place to relax, only small hand towels in the private bath, and the clincher was there was no phone on the premises and noone available on site during the evening and through most of the day. There were no maps or tourist info. available anywhere. Just lots of advertisments and magazines pertaining to the gay lifestyle. There were no pictures adorning walls....and the lights were always off when we came in. It was deplorable. When we had to implore the guesthouse manager to call the police to chase away the drunken vagrants perched outside on a mattress in front of the building, we decided to look for new accomidations asap. In the Gracia area...a lovely residential, albeit packed with quaint stores, restaurants and beautiful architecture...and close to Guell Park. we found the wonderful Aparthotel Silver. For only 5 euros more...that's right, 80 euros/night which is a great deal in Barcelona, we got a room with kitchenette, TV, phone, full bath, quiet, fantastic location and hotel ammenities including free internet access in the lobby. Unfortunately the 80 euros/night room was not available for the duration of our stay so we opted to take the only other room available which was their suite for 120 euros/night. It was nirvana! A huge terrace with outdoor chairs and tables to eat your breakfast. A lovely huge space of blond wood, a sofa, 2 full beds, TV, stereo, phone, gorgeous huge bath and full kitchenette with microwave, dishes, cutlery, etc. Best of all we could finally have a noiseless night of sleep. Another great benefit of staying at Aparthotel Silver is the breakfast they serve for 6.5 euros. Food is quite expensive in Barcelona. Even buying staples at grocery stores was costly. The breakfast they offer is a fantastic value that we could not find elsewhere. For 6.5 euros they serve coffee, a buffet of fruits, a spread of breakfast cheeses, meats, salad and sliced egg, croissants, rolls, sliced bread and pastries. It was all fresh, plentiful and very tasty. This meal is all you can eat and can tide you over for many hours of exploring the city. This hotel is located at the Fontana station on the green line...extremely accessable by metro and bus and close to all attractions, but remote enough to be more relaxed to get a feel of another side of Barcelona. And there's a beautiful Gaudi house, literally right around the corner! The staff was always lovely and very helpful. I highly recomment the Aparthotel Silver.

<Content>We felt lucky to have found the Aparthotel Silver My husband and myself stayed at the Aparthotel Silver for four days in late Nov. of 2004 and are still telling people about what a wonderful place it was. In a city as lively as Barcelona having a quiet retreat to return to every evening was a Godsend. We ate many a meal in our kitchenette, loving the chance to shop at local markets. The staff was very helpfull, always so courteous and warm - they truly went above and beyond. The closeness to such a main metro line combined with its location within the Modernista area of the city (which contains many of Gaudi's achitectural masterpieces) just made this hotel all the more perfect for us. If you are looking for a location that allows you to experience the city's character, a staff who is pleased to share their beautiful and unique culture, and an excellent value, then Silver may be perfect for you too.

<Content>Good value for money Stayed here in October 2004. For the price paid it was a great hotel. As eating in Barcelona can be tricky, the kitchenette in the room was indispensible. Its close to a metro station and unlikely nearly everyone else we came across in Barcelona, the staff were friendly. The window in the bathroom that seemed to look into someone else's bathroom was a little odd, but easily dealt with by keeping it shut! Overall, great value for money.

<Content>Great Value! Aparthotel Silver is a good, clean, tourist class hotel in a quiet neighbourhood just north of the city centre. It provides excellent value compared with central hotels and offers a great buffet breakfast.Staff are friendly and helpful. Transport links are brilliant - the hotel is 80m from the metro station (Fontana) and then 5 minutes from the heart of the city (Line 3).

<Content>Very good choice We chose this hotel based upon the reviews here and were pleased. It is well located very near a metro stop in a fairly quiet neighborhood with easy access to shops and restaurants. The staff here was uniformly friendly and they try hard to make the stay a comfortable one. The rolling shade (needed to keep light and noise out) in our room was broken. They fixed it very quickly and provided a box of chocolates to make up for the inconvenience :) There's a computer in the lobby for free internet access or a nice internet cafe just around the corner. An excellent choice for a modestly priced Barcelona hotel.

<Content>I will return! We had a wonderful stay in Aparthotel Silver. The hotel is supremely located in a quiet but friendly neighbourhood, and the room immaculately clean. We enjoyed having breakfast in the garden. The only backdrops were the rubber sheets that we discovered after a first sweaty night and our noisy neighbours. But I would defenitely recommend it and hope to visit again, as Barcelona is just absolutely fabulous.

<Content>Homae away from home If you want a flashy modern hotel this is not for you. Its good value for money, clean, family-run with helpful, friendly staff. Barcelona can be a bit of a circus and this is in a quiet area but two metro stops from the centre. I've stayed here 3 times. On my first visit I had apparently dropped a large denomination bank note under the bed. It was by the bed side when I returned!

<Content>Two thumbs up!! Absolutely loved it!! The rooms were nice and clean (airconditioned), the bed comfy, small but tidy bath (with lots of hot water) and a very helpfull staff. Internet is free and it's got a very nice breakfast area in the garden of the hotel. It's located in a quiet part of Barcelona on a small street with not to much traffic. It's a bit off the main touristic area, but everything is in comfortable reach with the metro, which is about 100 meters away. and no problem getting home: the nightbus N4 off pla莽a catalunya (from midnight till first metro) drops you off at the metro station. price is okay too. Don't look any further - you'll love it!!

<Content>loved it My new hubby and I stayed at Hotel Silver for the last 6 out of 15 days of our honeymoon in Spain. Hotel Silver is a great place to stay if you don't want to spend a lot of money, but looking for a great quality, clean, safe, and convenient place to stay while visiting Barcelona. The only complaint I did have was the noise from the elevator (which I actually didn't hear, my husband did). It was nothing to keep you up though. The tub for me was perfect, I had plenty of leg room and it was very deep. It is a 3 minute walk from the Metro and 3 metro stops from La Rambla. There are plenty of restaurants, mostly local, however there are nicer ones you just need to know where to look. The staff was wonderful, they helped with restaurant recommedations, trip planning and went out of their way to make you feel at home. I would recommend Hotel Silver and definately will return.
