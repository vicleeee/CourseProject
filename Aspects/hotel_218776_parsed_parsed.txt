<Content>Great value I booked the hotel through Travelocity and was a little worried reading the reviews. But this was a nice place. The location is excellent - down the street from the Powell St. BART station - right below Union Square. The front desk worker (Kenny) was excellent. Very pleasant and friendly. He mistakenly gave us a room with 1 bed thinking that my friend and I were lesbians (hey - this IS San Fran)!!! But he fixed that when we came back to ask for another room. The room was small but clean. Very nice white down comforters. We had a refrigerator and there was free internet access. There is a full service restaurant if you would like that. Try not to get a room near the elevators because they are old and noisy. The street traffic is loud but that's how it is in a busy city - so maybe ask for a room on an upper floor. I would stay here again.

<Content>Would not stay there again I stayed at the Pickwick hotel for a meeting at the end of October 2008. I purchased the room through hotwire.com and read some good reviews about this hotel but I did NOT like my stay. I was placed on a 2nd floor room, very close to the street and extremely noisy! I got waken up every night with noises from the street and from the hall. I could hear people sneezing at the other rooms! Old rooms with those old places smells... In the morning you can smell the kitchen food being prepared... greasy, fried food. Good location but I would not stay there again. The price you pay there is the same of a 4star new hotel with a lot more to offer like... silence!!!

<Content>Bad room I took my son for a two day trip to San Francisco to see museums. I had stayed at the Pickwick several years ago and thought it was satisfactory and it was near MOMA so I thought it might be a good choice. Wrong. Forget if you've read anywhere that the rooms are newly renovated- not in the part of the hotel we stayed in!!! (Ask to see the room before you check in!!!) The first thing we noticed was the noise from the generator (maybe because we were on 2nd floor). It never turned off. And the loud noise from the non frost-free refrigerator. We called down and they told us to unplug the refrigerator. Then we noticed that a lot of the noise was coming from objects jumping on the nightstand and desk- it was vibration from the generator! We asked to be moved to another room and they said it was the only room available with two beds. Considering there was no convention at Moscone Convention Center next door and at most we saw only one other person in the lobby when we came in and out...what do you think? Only room available with two beds? At night we were kept awake by the refrigerator in the room next to us. The refrigerator was backed up to our headboards and it keep thumping against the wall. We called down and they said the room was occupied and there was nothing they could do. Good note: We had a great dinner at a restaurant called TWO a few blocks away on Hawthorn Lane. I say spend a little more money and enjoy a good night's sleep and experience at a good hotel. If you have to stay there ask to see the room and check out the noise level before you give them your credit card.

<Content>Please avoid and save yourself the money This is one of the most overpriced hotels I have stayed in and it doesn't even include breakfast! The walls are paper thin, You can actually hear people urinating in the next room! It was disgusting. Every morning the maids woke us up shouting to one another in the hall. The standard of cleanliness was non existent. For our entire stay there were two used plasters stuck to the shelf in front of the mirrors and half a cardboard anti slip mat stuck in the bath. The one positive was that the bed was fairly comfortable however that was pointless when it was so noisy-even with ear plugs. Basically you are paying for the location if you're young and don't mind using public transport I'd advise staying about five minutes further out and paying around half the money.

<Content>Great hotel, great location I called to book a room and was a little concerned because they either have 1 king or 2 beds and you can't reserve a particular room. I told the lady that we have 3 people and have to have 2 beds. She said that would be fine. We drove in and the hotel was right there on 5th street. Getting to the parking garage was a different matter. You have to turn BEFORE the hotel to get into the garage. We tried to go around the block but you can turn right, can't turn left, on and on. It took us 45 minutes to get into the garage. Driving in SF is crazy!Anyway, I asked when we got there to make sure we have 2 beds and she said they were out of those but would give us a free upgrade and a roll away was in the room. The upgrade part was that we had a little kitchenette which was real nice since we were staying 4 nights. Our king bed and the bathroom were behind 2 doors for privacy. We liked that a lot. And our bed was devine! Our son was fine on the rollaway. He is 6'3 and was a little too long but he slept great.We each had a tv and there was free internet. No breakfast and I do NOT recommend Venue. That place was a disaster and wasn't good. Across the street is a little pastry place and cereal so we recommend that place instead.The city is very, very noisy! You can ask for a room on the back side of the hotel I suppose but I think it would still be noisy. It seems everytime a call is made for emergency they send1 fire truck, 1 police car and 1 ambulance. It is just noisy.The location is great for using the bus system and trolley. There is a huge mall on the same block so that was handy for food and there is a market in there as well. If we were to go back to SF we would maybe stay out of the area as long as BART was able to get us into town. But if this is your first time in SF I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Love  What I loved about the Pickwick:-good size room that was neat  clean-situated near shopping, city transportation to Chinatown  Fisherman's Wharf. One block from trian station.-Helpful staff who arranged for 5am shuttle to SFAirport for $12.-Small resturant  bar in Hotel with good food.What I hated about the Pickwick:-scheduled four nights with confirmed King room but at checkin they only had one room and it went to the person who checked in before me. The desk clerk said she would upgrade my room at no charge to a very good room. It should've, could've, would've been a good room but two elevators where next to the room and all night long they made it very difficult to get any rest. There was obviously no insulation to buffer the noise. You had to get to the point where you just passed out and you didn't need an alarm clock to wake up because the darn thing bing,bing,binged first thing in the morning.-so I thought OK maybe this room surely had a good view...WRONG! Got to see an alley behind the Hotel and the side of a building next door. Some upgrade for $200. per night?I was glad I had many things to do and places to go. Still a good location. The place has potential but avoid the upgrade.

<Content>You get what you pay for The stay at the hotel was fine. The room was fine for overnight stay or business travel, no frills. I knew that parking was in issue in San Francisco so I called to ask specifically about the rules. I was told since I was a guest of the hotel as well as using a meeting room I could park prior to being able to register as a guest. The room package I chose included a day of parking and I was informed if I went past the 24 hour period I would be responsible for the additional amount. When I arrived I was told by the parking attendant I could not park until 3 PM, check in time no matter I had a 9 AM conference in the hotel. I had to find another parking garage and pay an additional $25 dollars. At 530 PM I was able to move my car to the hotel where I had prepaid for parking. The next day I was told by the same parking attendant I would have to remove my car by 1 PM or be forced to pay additional fees. This was clearly less than the 24 hr parking I was promised in my contract with the hotel. The parking attendant was very rude and emphatic none of that mattered because he did not work for the hotel and the hotel did not control him. After some discussion with hotel management I was able to leave my car until 4 pm when my business was done. Again I would possibly go back to the hotel but only if I did not have to deal with the parking situation.

<Content>Cute Little Hotel I stayed here with 3 other people for a weekend in August. We loved the hotel. It was very cute and quirky and fit our budget perfectly. I must say, however, the little Italian restaurant that's atttached to the hotel on the first floor wasn't my favorite place, but otherwise the hotel was great. The room was nicely decorated, cute and quaint, and the location, although not GREAT, was still in a good area - walking distance from the business district and all the great shopping! (= I would stay here again.

<Content>perfectly positioned The Pickwick Staff could have been a little more informed,we asked how much breakfast was and nobody knew. There was also a lack of information in the roomsabout local eateries, that said it couldn't have been in a better place. Ronud the corner sonycentre was like a food hall and big screens. 2blocks up union square, and the F market tram stop across the road.Lots of shopping all around 15 mins to Fishermans Wharfeon the tram.Rooms were small but beautifully furnished and clean.Food at Little Joes good and reasonabally priced as were the drinks.

<Content>Great, centrally located SF hotel with a bit of character. We were attending a wedding and reception on Nob Hill and then we had plans to go out later that night at a South of Market club. The Pickwick was the perfect central location for both events. I booked the room the day before and the reservation staff were very helpful and patient with all of my questions. I called ahead the day we were to arrive to make sure our room would be available because we had little time to check in and get ready for the wedding and the front desk staff were very understanding and accommodating. In fact, all of the staff were extremely efficient and friendly.The room was very nice and well kept. The parking garage is located under the hotel and accessible from inside the hotel which is very handy.My entire experience at the Pickwick was a positive one. I will certainly stay here again. I highly recommend it to anyone who would like a great, small, centrally located San Francisco hotel with a bit of character.

<Content>In dire need of basic upkeep This is a cheap, clean hotel, but certainly not worth as many stars as hotwire gives it. My room was overly hot because the a/c was not on. I went to turn it on to no avail and when I called for maintenance, they never came. It took a while for my shower to warm up, and the room in general while clean had peeling and chipped paint and a dorm room feel despite the king bed. The TV was also tiny and there were strange noises coming from a phone/modem or something. The street noises included a lot of sirens and honking well into the morning. But it is a decent place to crash if you get a cheap deal. I just won't ever go back with other options available. The restaurant is okay, and has a nostalgic charm, but the food is not that great.

<Content>Very old world, charming hotel--but it's wired! I stayed at the Pickwick after having to return to SF on business on the shortest of notices. I got the standard Pickwick Special (good deal at about $100), but they upgraded me to a deluxe room upon arrival! The place is old, pre-war, and the furnishings are French colonial, and it was this whole set-up the charmed me off my feet. For as long as their plumbing as modern, and the wi-fi was there, I just liked to pretend I had somehow gone back to the past!I would have given this 4 stars, but for the upgrade, the Pickwick deserves a 5!

<Content>Horrible Experience and Customer Service I only live about 20 minutes from the hotel and made reservations for my birthday to stay due to it's close proximity to several clubs/bars I frequent. The weekend of my birthday there was a torrential rainstorm and the overnight stay just didn't seem like a good idea. So I called the toll free reservation hotline to see what would happen if I canceled my reservation. The call center couldn't find my reservation so they transferred me to the front desk who also couldn't find my reservation. I explicitly asked if there would be any charges or penalties for canceling my reservation and was told no because as far as they were concerned I didn't have one.About a week later I going over my credit card statement online I was shocked to see a charge for the full amount of the room. I called the front desk immediately and they still could not find any information regarding my reservation or credit card information. I was advised to call the accounting department in order to sort out the mess and reverse the charges. The lack of customer service I received in this situation is appalling. The accounting representative actually told me I screwed myself when I told her I tried to cancel my reservation the same day and that their policy is to charge no shows the full amount of the room. When I attempted to explain the misunderstanding to her she hung up on me. When I called back to speak with a general manager or supervisor she refused to provide the information.

<Content>Great Value Nice hotel, right downtown - easy to get on cable cars, trolley, or city buses. Close to shopping, museums etc. This is an old, retro-fitted building, but still nice. Room was very small, as was bathroom, but it still had a nice ambiance. TV was also small, with limited channels. Hotel restaurant was OK, but prices were not out of this world as they were at other locations. Knowing that most places in San Francisco start at $200+/night, I would choose this place again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Charming, but they need a new maid. Friends and I stayed here last year for a holiday shopping trip and loved it. We were excited to stay again this year. However, some standards appear to have dropped. Our room had an upholstered chair and ottoman that was FILTHY. The room would have been much better off without it. The rooms are small and it just took up valuable floor space. Also, the bathroom had a lot of hairs (the little curly kind) on the toilet and bathtub. Ewwww. I don't mind the small rooms--it's an historic building built to different standards than to todays travellers. However, there is no excuse for the shoddy job on keeping the room clean. Also, the waitress at breakfast was slow and not as friendly as the last time we stayed. I don't think I would stay there again.

<Content>The Pickwick roaches! I loved this hotel! The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The location was amazing. Right by all the shopping in Union Square and just a short walk to the trollys. BUT the first night we stayed at the hotel I saw a small roach scatter accross the bathroom floor. I let it go and didn't mention it to the hotel staff even though it grossed me out. The second night I saw two HUGE full blown roaches in the bathroom and started screaming. They were running wild around the bathroom floor and my friend and I were frantically trying to crush the critters. The next morning we told the hotel staff and they pretty much did nothing. Besides the roaches we had a great experience but we would not stay at this hotel again in fear of roaches crawling all over us in our sleep...

<Content>Great Location but OLD  We were booked at the Hilton for a conference, but there was a mixup and my secretary was able to get me in here on short notice. Location is perfect as noted by others. Rooms are TINY as are the bathrooms. I mean barely room to bring your suitcase into the room tiny. The website and lobby belie the age of this hotel which becomes visible when you get in the elevator or approach your room. Many layers of paint obviously, with cracks. Only room door closed (bathroom and closet didn't). They added new windows inside the old which likely helps block out some noise, but this is in the city and there were frequent sirens throughout the night. Still we slept ok. Beds were comfortable. Everything was clean. Felt safe. Staff was friendly and helpful.Not so crazy about Little Joe's, but perhaps just not our taste in tomato sauce.TV got only about 7 channels. We weren't there much so not a big deal for us. No internet access near as I could tell.Fine place, esp for the price, and location is tough to beat!

<Content>I'd Stay Again  Great location. Great price. Great level of accommodation. Easy walking distance to the cable car stop and Union Square. We walked with our luggage from Powell Street Station having caught the BART train from the airport. Very easy, clean  safe mode of transport. Little Joe's Restaurant in the lobby is a good Italian feed. Have breakfast one morning at Sears. Pretty good stuff.

<Content>Plerfect place for a getaway My husband and I needed a little getaway weekend from the kids and decided to go to the city. I found the Pickwick Hotel online and the rate was reasonable so I booked it. From the time we checked in until we checked out we were treated wonderfully. Every staff member we encountered was very accomodating and more than helpful. The hotel is full of character and well kept. Our room was quaintly decorated and very clean. The beds were Heavenly with down comforters and plenty of pillows. The location was great-right near shopping and plenty of good restaurants including the one located in the hotel itself. We had a very restful weekend and the Pickwick will be our getaway place everytime we need to.

<Content>Great base for exploring SF I stayed at the Pickwick for 4 nights at the end of August 2006 - sorry for not getting round to writing this review sooner! Overall it was a great experience - you can't beat the location, especially as a single traveler just coming in from the airport, so close to public transport, all amenities and attractions. The room was more than adequate - true, the mock French furniture are a little bit OTT, the TV/fridge console blocks off an entire corner of an already not exactly large room, and there is some wear and tear, but come on, for $70/night (Hotwire) I felt like I got an excellent deal. After all, this is San Francisco - so I spent all my time exploring this fantastic city rather than surveying my room through a magnifiying glass... I did like the view from my 4th floor window, too - right across from the MInt (and the San Francisco Chronicle, which I loved, being a journalist myself!)I never used the restaurant or other hotel services, so can't comment on them. House-keeping was sketchy, and I did feel lucky to have the room all to myself - it would have decidedly felt cramped with 2 people in it - but on the whole, it was a great, clean base for exploring this fantastic city.

<Content>Pickwick a good pick We were very satisfied with The Pickwick; not luxurious but good value for money given what we were charged.Our room was spacious and well-equipped, even though the mock-European furniture was a bit OTT. The one complaint was that our room backed onto the service area of a major shopping centre; on one of the three nights I was constantly woken up by the sound of delivery vehicles.All in all, however, The Pickwick provides a comfortable city centre base at a reasonable price with friendly and efficient staff. It is extremely well-located - just a few minutes' walk to the main stores, the cable car turntable and and the vintage tram line which takes you to the Ferry Building, Fisherman's Wharf, boat trips, etc.As for vagrants in the vicinity, this problem is not unique to The Pickwick - there is no shortage of them congregating near the city's top hotels as well!

<Content>If you're not a bug, do NOT go there! The location is good, only 2 small block from the Moscone center. BUT, after the first night me and my roommate had huge bumps all around our body, probably due to Bed Bugs or Spiders. We told that at the front desk they were surprised (I'm sure they lied when they said us it was the first time) and moved us to another room. We also had new bumps after we moved in the new room, less but that proves that the other room also had bugs or something like that.The hotel is really old and no so well maintained. It's not worth the price we paid per night AT ALL.Do not stay there except if you have no choice... or if you like be covered by big bumps.

<Content>Best value in downtown I'm a local San Franciscan and I've stayed at this hotel twice. I love it - it's simple, modest and incredibly cheap (around $100/night) for the location. The rooms have comfortable beds, free internet access, and a sort of shabby victorian decor - charming oil paintings on the wall, etc. Just one block from public transit and short walks from everywhere you want to be in SF. Parking garage costs $30/day (average for the area).

<Content>Good location, good facilities for the price. The Pickwick was a decent hotel for the money. I must say though that I was travelling as a group of four guys on a 3 week driving holiday and we were on a tight budget, therefore we had the four of us in a twin room for 3 days! This meant that it was cheap split 4 ways, so maybe better accommodation is available elsewhere factoring on 2 sharing? The room we had was away from the street and as a result there was little noise. I must say that as a twin room, it was pretty small, although we were warned about this upon checking in. We were told that this was due to it being a historic hotel dating back to circa 1920!! Bless them, my house and all nearby date back to the 1600's and we don't call them historic!The location was good, right next door to a shopping centre and a couple of minutes away from the subway and cable car turnaround. We spent our evenings down at fishermans wharf which is about 15 minutes by cable car. All in all - I couldn't complain about the hotel. I assume it must be excellent for staying on business due to it's central location, easy public transport access. If I were ever to go with the family, I think I would be more inclined to stay nearer fishermans wharf.

<Content>Paper thin walls... Don't stay at the Pickwick if you want to get any sleep. Can hear television in the next room and conversations as though they were in the room with me. Location is convenient but horrible. It's downtown in the urban section of San Fran. There are homeless people sleeping right outside the hotel. Street outside is very busy and often noisy with emergency vehicles' blaring sirens. Room was very small. Decor was odd. Staff was mediocre at best. I would not have picked this hotel, however I did not have a choice (it was a business trip and was booked for me). Had I known, I would have stayed at the Marriott down the street.

<Content>Great Surprise! Yet another San Francisco hotel I stayed at via Priceline. This review is from 2002 so take it with a grain of salt, but we paid around $50/night at the last minute on Halloween and thought it was a great value. The hotel isn't much to look at from the outside and it's a block away from one of SF's shadiest intersections, but it's still an extremely convienent location to downtown, Union Square, South of Market, and the Castro. The room we had was both bigger and nicer than we expected. Our friends came over to get ready for Halloween and there was plenty of room for the 6 of us putting on our costumes and makeup. I was charmed and surprised by this hotel and unless it's really gone down hill, I would happily stay here again for under $100/night. More than that and you could probably do better.

<Content>Don't pick the Pickwick My friend and I stayed at the Pickwick for three nights. The room was extremely small, the windows drafty and ineffective. The drapes, which I closed to reduce street noise, were held back by paperclips. The renovations supposedly completed recently amounted only to paint, from what I could see. I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Could have been better The location was fantastic, although you have to overlook the street peddlers asking for spare change. The front desk was very nice to us and allowed us to check in early. The staff was very friendly.The room was quaint and very small. The bathroom shower had hair in the drain, there was paint peeling off of the tub. The shower head trickled water. The bed was hard.At night, you could hear everything outside. I would not stay here again. But for the value, it was okay. Due to the excellent location.

<Content>Stay somewhere else if you can The Pickwick Hotel is one of the worst hotels I鈥檝e stayed at in several years. We picked it because it is located a block from the Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco. Other than location, this hotel has nothing going for it. So let鈥檚 start this review from the beginning. The hotel has its own parking garage located underground, but the cost ($28/day) is more than the public parking garage across the street ($23/day). At check-in you鈥檒l be greeted by a friendly staff although English is not their first language, so conversations are somewhat difficult at times. The room was the part that really amazed me. The room is half the size of most hotel rooms today. From the size and d茅cor, you鈥檇 think you were staying some mediocre French hotel. My room was on the interior of the second floor (not recommended) which had a view of the rooms in the other wing. Only 10 feet separated our windows. My colleague had an outside view on the second floor, but the street noise was extremely bad. There is a firehouse nearby and sirens are whaling at all hours of the night. The closet was less then 2 feet deep which is much smaller than standard. They provided hangers, but you had to put them in at a 45 degree angle in order to close the closet door. Of course this also made it difficult to open the closet door at times. The bathroom luckily had a full tub/shower, but the toilet again looked like something from Europe. The TV is a 20鈥?color TV with only 15 channels. In a room this size, the 20鈥?TV almost looked like a big screen. There is a small fridge under the TV, but it鈥檚 too small to really hold anything. I tried to put a pint of ice cream in there, but had to put it in sideways and even then the freezer didn鈥檛 work. I awoke to find ice cream soup the next morning even though I had turned the setting to the coldest possible. Other than a small table with chair and another cushioned chair in the corner, there is only one nightstand. Doesn鈥檛 sound so bad, right? Well if you haven鈥檛 figured it out yet, there is no place to actually unpack and put your clothes. I had to use the ironing board as shelf space to lay out my clothes. Once it night time and you go to turn the lights on you鈥檒l find another surprise. Very little lighting 鈥?2 desk lights and an overhead light, none of which were higher then 40W. The Pickwick Caf茅 provides complimentary breakfast for some guests depending on what rate you are paying. Oddly enough, I was paying $3 less than my colleague, but his rate did not have breakfast included and mine did. They give you coupon cards to use when you get breakfast, but the staff openly tells you that tip is not included which I find rude. When some comes right out and tells me that, it makes me want to leave them nothing, but I still usually leave something. The food is OK and it鈥檚 pretty much the same every day.Anyways, for the price they charge, you鈥檇 be better off paying the extra $10 or $20 a night and stay at the Hilton or Sheraton a few blocks away. Those hotels are new and come with a lot more amenities. Since this was a business trip, I didn鈥檛 have to pick up the tab otherwise I鈥檇 be really pissed off. Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere unless you need to be near the Moscone Center.

<Content>Great little hotel on a hard living street This is a great little hotel on a hard living street (corner of Mission and 5th - one block south of Market Street). Very centrally located with Union Square and the business district within 5 minutes walk and Fisherman's Wharf, etc., walkable (although taking the tram or buses on Market would be easier). It is well located for BART with BART's easy access to SFO and Oakland Airport.Rooms are slightly old fashioned in feel but they have a lot of character and most facilities. The hotel has a gym and a small business center plus the usual vending machines and breakfast restaurant.The street outside is tough with a few unsavoury looking characters roaming around but they seem to leave you alone and there always seem to be lots of other people on the street, even late at night.For those not wanting to spend too much but wanting non-standardized comfort this is a good place to stay.

<Content>False Advertising - Bad management / policy Upon arrival at the Pickwick Hotel in San Francisco, we were informed that the smoking room we had already paid for did not even exist in this hotel. This was a non smoking hotel and had changed over to such after our reservation was made. No one contacted us to alleviate this mistake before we arrived. The email that was sent AFTER the switch over to non smoking, stated we had a smoking reservation. The manager did not offer to adjust the false advertising in any manner. Not only will my boyfriend and I be contacting the better business bureau but we will be absolutely sure to let as many people know NOT to use the Pickwick Hotel. Its a matter of principle that if the customer is finagled into a situation that they do not want, they should be able to be compensated for the changes/mistakes that are not the customer's responsibility to be aware of. It is the responsibility of the provider to give the consumer what they paid for. This was not done, nor was it considered a situation for anyone in any capacity to actually address. It is shameful, bad PR and false advertising and will be stated as such to the appropriate persons.

<Content>Nice, Clean Hotel and Close to Everything We stayed at The Pickwick for 4 nights over the Labor Day weekend. The staff was very friendly, the rooms were very clean, and it was relatively quiet for being right in the middle of downtown. We throughly enjoyed our stay - the beds were very comfortable and we could not hear other guests. We stayed on the 6th floor in a corner room and although a little on the small side, I've been in smaller, so I can't really complain about the size of the rooms. A great experience and we would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Small rooms, but nice location The Pickwick is located right across the street from the old U.S. mint building and close to shopping, BART, muni, and the cable car turnaround. The rooms aren't great.--very small and no dressers. The furniture is old and has that musty smell. The TV's are old as well, the one I had ended up not working. But, they were quick to fix it. I didn't eat in the restaurant but I did visit the pub; a nice and quiet place to have a drink with a very friendly bartender. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel in the heart of the city and you don't plan on spending too much time in your room, the Pickwick might be the right choice.

<Content>good choice ! i had booked the pickwick hotel san fran for a few nights before i left for a california roundtrip and i have no regrets ! everything was perfectly o.k. my room was nice and clean. the staff was very nice and very helpful when i had problems to contact my group and alfie the bellman is a pet. he did some unpleasant phone calls for me with the tour operator when he found out that i had problems contacting them and i didn麓t had to ask him for doing that - they are very considerate there. (as a former travel agent and frequent traveller i know that this is rare in these days). the hotel is in the city centre only a few steps away from cable car, bus and subway stations, shopping centres. the only negative aspect that some people might find disturbing is the traffic noise from the street; the pickwick is situated at one of san fran麓s main street. all in all a good choice - i would book it again any time.

<Content>A pleasant stay My daughter and I stayed at the Pickwick last night and had a very pleasant stay. I had requested a quiet room, and was given a very quiet room on the 6th floor. The beds were quite comfotable and had nice sheets and comforters as described on their website.Our room had 2 doubles, and although it was on the small side, we very much enjoyed the coziness and attractiveness of this hotel. We walked over from Bart at about 9:30 p.m. and did not feel unsafe during our walk. It is very conveniently located to shopping, the Moscone center, MOMA, etc. They have a 2 computer business center (which we used), and a fitness room with 2 treadmills, an elliptical and a recumbant bike. All good quality in nice condition.It might be a bit small for a long stay or for a family of four, but I suppose that would depend on the room.Overall we had a nice visit and we would certainly stay again!

<Content>Excellent location for touring - just eat elsewhere! Stayed at this hotel at the start of a tour of the region as a family in two rooms. We stayed 3 nights.Rooms were clean, reasonably sized although a little noisy as facing the road outside - but no more than any city centre hotel and certainly not enough to disturb sleep. Position is excellent for tourists as buses and the turn round of the cable car only a block or so away. Given the number of riders on the cablecar, being at the end of the line was a definite advantage at certain times of day as you would never have got on further down the line.Only downside was the restaurant which we only tried once. Evening meals were uninspiring and breakfasts, although of excellent quality were marred by one day of slow service and one of unavailability of one of the options (the continental breakfast!). But would not overplay this as there are plenty of restaurants in the area including the all present Dennys around the corner. And in any case, as a tourist, why would you be eating evening meals in a hotel when you have the whole of Downtown, Fishermans Wharf and ChinaTown to choose from!There were homeless about in the evenings but no more than anywhere in SF and none are in any way threatening. Would not have felt this way if this had been LA!Overall a pleasant hotel with a family atmosphere, well used to dealing with tour parties and superbly located. Would definitely recommend. Just eat elsewhere!

<Content>Unsafe!!! When I got back to my room in the afternoon, my door was wedged open with a towel and no one was inside! The cleaning staff had cleaned the room and left it open for anyone who wanted to steal anything. The desk clerk told me there was no manager on duty, so there was nothing they could do.

<Content>Oh My Goodness I like the rest of you read all the reviews for the Pickwick and went there a hesitant. I had an awesome time. I called the hotel to let them know I would be arriving late and they saved us our reservation. It was only on the third floor but I had no problems sleeping. The room was large and had a private bath (a total must), but a very small closet. Tiny would better describe the closet. The only problem I had was that the bathroom tub wouldn't hold water for baths - and they fixed that the morning I brought it to their attention. The staff was friendly and kept the room very clean. If you want perfect quietness go to a higher floor on the interior. Otherwise the location is perfect - right at a Muni stop, the street car stop, and the cable car turn around (All which is under a 1/2 block away). I encountered a few homeless but overall no problems with them. I never feared for my safety. This was a great hotel with a great price.

<Content>Overbooked! We stayed at The Pickwick while in San Francisco for a conference. We booked three hotel rooms (double beds) months in advance. The Pickwick had overbooked and we were stuck with three king beds. One of the rooms was for a group of 3 guys. Two of them shared the king bed while one slept on the roll away. The next day they switched to a room that was supposed to have 2 queen beds but they were instead twin beds and were not allowed to have a roll-away because the room is too small. They couldn't switch back to the room with the king bed because The Pickwick already gave it away. The guys ended up pushing the two beds together and taking turns sleeping on the crack. This hotel may be fine for people traveling alone or couples, but convention attendees sharing a room should definately avoid this hotel.

<Content>Great value for $99 We decided to stay in SF at the last minute and found a great deal here. It was definitely better than most hotels in this price range and other places located South of Market. I've paid $175 a night to stay in dumps in the City.Granted, it's an older property but we found the room to be in decent condition and charming. It was a bit noisy but nothing that kept us up all night. Staff was helpful.If you're going to the City for an evening or two, this is a solid choice.

<Content>Surprisingly fine Made last minute reservations at The Pickwick in Sept. 2005 - the city was totally booked w/ an Oracle conference so we could not get into 1 of our regular hotels. We were pleased to discover that The Pickwick was not a bad choice- the location is good...very convenient for walking to great shopping and dining and even driving to other sections of the city. Parking situation was excellent - right on premises of hotel so very little waiting.... Rooms were clean (a little dated) but not your standard generic hotel rooms, had more character. Bathrooms are small but perfectly adequate and all marble. Elevators were quick and we never had to wait long, even in the a.m. The windows did not keep out a lot of the noise from outside but eventually it quieted down. Overall, not a bad choice at all - a good value for the money and a nice little hotel. (And I'm generally a hotel snob- either boutique hotels or something like a W is more to my liking, BUT this is a good choice in a pinch.)

<Content>Great Find! I have stayed at the Pickwick on 3 different visits to San Francisco. The first visit was for 2 weeks and I was looking for a great value and great location. And I found it in The Pickwick. No it is not fancy, it is a boutique hotel in a historical building. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. The King size bed was so comfy! They are not spacious rooms but we were basically there to sleep. There is far too much to do in San Francisco to just hang out in your room.It is only 2 blocks from the Bart Station and the Cable turn around is next to that. Buses and street cars are on the corners. So Transportation is great. Union square is 3 blocks away and the the San Francisco Shopping Center is next door. A new shopping center is now underway on the other side of the hotel. The Metreon and Yerba Buena is also very close.My experience here has only been positive. The staff has treated me great. In fact on my last visit here when I pulled up in front of the hotel the Bellman recognized me from the year before and even remembered my name! My fiance was so surprised at this. He rushed out to great me with the most wonderful genuine smile, took our bags and found out our room and took them up for us while we were checking in. It was only afterwards that we found out he was already off duty and on his way home when he saw us. And still he did that.I don't need fancy. I have stayed in many luxurious hotels and condos. I want a great value for a great room that is clean and a staff who treats me well. And makes me feel welcome. I will stay here on my next visit and the one after that too.

<Content>A Sleepless Night We were very disappointed with our stay at the Pickwick. Although we knew that the hotel was located in a busy part of the city, we did not expect to be kept awake by constant noise all night long. General city noises kept us awake, including garbage trucks backing up at 4AM, and construction beginning next to the hotel at 7AM (on a Saturday). Even in the heart of Times Square, I have never heard so much street noise while in a hotel room. The building is very old, but absolutely no efforts to improve the soundproofing were taken as there have been in other city locations that I have visited. In addition, our room was musty, and everything in our suitcases smelled damp after our stay, and the windows in the bathroom were moldy. We were supposed to stay for a second night, but decided that a stay a few miles from the airport would be much quieter and more comfortable.

<Content>Yuck DON'T DO IT!! This place was filthy dirty! Stained carpets and sheets. Chipped paint on the walls and a dirty bathroom as well. The staff moved us to a new room and it wasn't any better. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Holiday Inn.

<Content>Don't be fooled by breakfast! We were quite happy that The Pickwick was so close to Union Square. You are literally just steps away from all the great shops. The double room we had was a bit cramped. It was hard to walk around in the room or pull your luggage out. But it was very clean and the decor had character. The king size room was more spacious. The part that really got us upset was the breakfast and the front-desk help. When we checked in no mention was made of breakfast but there was information in the room telling us breakfast is served till 10 am. When we were finishing up our breakfast which we thought was continental since it was a most ordinary buffet (cereal, cold potatoes, fruit, ect.) only then were we informed of the $12 price tag. I don't mind paying for something when I know it's coming, but nowhere or no one bothered to tell us it was not continental breakfast until AFTER we were done eating. I'd call that rather sneaky. On top of that the front-desk staff was most rude when we explained the situation to them and felt that the few pieces of fruit and toast we ate were not worth $12. That service really spoiled the whole experience for us.

<Content>Great Location, Good Value We just returned from a last minute weekend trip to SF. After an extensive search for a centrally located, reasonably priced hotel, we chose the Pickwick for the breakfast  parking included package (and this hotel had the least amount of negative comments on the tripadvisor website!). We were very surprised to find that the Pickwick is convienently located to Union Square, the streetcar line, Yerba Buena center and tons of shopping! We were right in the middle of the action! The hotel staff was very friendly. The buffet breakfast was ok. The hotel itself is old, but clean and nicely decorated. Bedding is comfortable. Rooms are small. Parking is $28/day if not included in your room rate. If needed, some rooms have fridges, but need to request. We would definately stay here again.

<Content>Suprised and Impressed San Francisco is full of hotels and for those people with a family looking for value and watching their money, we found that the Pickwick Hotel met our needs and budget. The Pickwick Hotel was near the convention center and near activities for my family. During the day when I was at the convention center, my family was able to go to the Fisherman's Wharf, ChinaTown, the Golden Gate Park, ride the cable cars as well as the BART and the chocolate factory. In the evening we were closed enough to walk to restaurants and we even took in a movie at the Sony Metro complex.We noticed that there is a larger shopping center almost completed which will only make the hotel more appealing for those people that are vacationing. We will be back to the Pickwick when we are in San Francisco again.

<Content>Split personality....  This hotel's decor was in transition as of Feb 16 '05. The attractive online photos don't capture the stained  generally shabby condition of the bedcoverings, furniture  upsholstery. Descriptions on Expedia claimed high-speed internet connections in every room....but Rm 239 had no connection. The front desk kindly moved me across the hall to a room with an internet connection that was a bit hitchy but free. I was glad for a reason to evacuate Room 239 because the stains on the upholstered desk chair were unquestionably gross and the phone keypad was so grubby I didn't want to touch it. Surprisingly, the mattress was excellent but the bedpillows were a little lame. The bathrooms in both rooms were nicely refurbished with granite tiled walls  floors. The bath fixtures were refinished....but the pedestal sink offered little counter space for my kit. I did appreciate that the bathroom was sparkling clean. However, the plumbing rumbles like a jackhammer in the morning. I thought I was hearing the construction site starting up next door, but it was only water for someone's 6:00AM shower. My room faced a light well so there was no street noise. The biggest drawback at the Pickwick is noise from adjoining rooms and the hallways. There is absolutely no sound deadening between the rooms in the 2nd floor addition above the garage. Even if the hotel finishes refurbishing with new furnishings  paint, the noise between rooms is a major issue. I swear you can hear the people in the next room blink. Bell  front desk staff were helpful with dining recommendations and luggage storage. Nice exercise room with newish equipment. Breakfast buffet in the AM, but the restaurant is closed the rest of the time. Au Bon Pain is next door for pastries, sandwiches, and latte. Mels' Diner is nearby on Mission St. for sandwiches  burgers. Large parking garage across the street is $20 overnight. Great location near mall, Sony's Metreon, Market St.,  BART. But pack your earplugs!!

<Content>The Pickwick was Great!! I spent 6 nights at the Pickwick in January. I found the hotel charming, the rooms, European or boutique style, were adorable. As mentioned in previous reviews, the rooms are small and do not have dresser drawers. You have to live out of your suitcase and a closet. I really didn't feel inconvenienced at all.The staff was friendly and extremely helpful, which was important to me since this was my first trip to San Francisco. I even had breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning and had a delicious omelet made with brie, carmalized onions, apples and bacon. The service was unbelievably fast.I would definitely recommend the Pickwick to anyone wanting to stay in downtown San Francisco or attending a function at the Moscone Center (which only a couple of blocks away.Previous reviewers mentioned homeless people around the hotel. They were not there during my stay and the people that I did encounter did not bother me.I had a wonderful time in San Francisco and the Pickwick was a big part of that!! I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Not bad ! We stayed at the Pickwick in September 2002 and found it just alright. The rooms were reasonable. Advised not to use the restaurant because the service was very slow. OK it's near Market Street and a cable car terminus, but there were too many dodgy characters hanging around nearby for my liking .... is this normal for San Francisco?Would not go back to this hotel.

<Content>Good Deal The room was clean but small. The bed was comfortable and large. I could adjust the temperature in the room. The room was secure. Everything in the bathroom worked and was clean. The staff was friendly. It looked like it had high speed internet (Cat 5 cable outlet, but did not bring my laptop). I did not feel unsafe walking around the area at night (the area is experiencing a revival). If you like to sleep late, construction next door will wake you. Cable TV was average. Sound insulation between rooms was minimal. Two small closets to hang things but no other significant storage. If you don't mind living out of your suitcase, the place is a good deal compared to some of the other places I've stayed in SF. I will go back.

<Content>Great value for money We stayed here 26-30 September, '04. The rooms were clean, although small, with elegant decor. It is difficult to unpack as there are no drawers for clothes so the wardrobe floor was used as well as suitcases. The bathroom was small with little space for toiletries but a great shower. It is a bit noisy as you are in the heart of town, but this must surely apply to most hotels in this area. Staff were all friendly and concierge extremely helpful. The location is terrific with the main San Francisco shopping complex almost next door and the cable car on your doorstep. For value for money this hotel is extremely good and the standards are high, 4 star. We would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel should we ever find ourselves back in SF.

<Content>Better than the Union Square "bargain boutique" hotels Don't be scared by the two star rating. Apparently whoever rated it must not have stayed at the airport sleep cheap that I stayed the night before that had the same rating. The Pickwick is a block south of Market Street and around the corner from the Powell Street cable car turnaround. So what if there are no meeting rooms or bar or chic restaurant? If what you want is a comfortable room with amenities of a four star hotel, a courteous staff and convenience to most of the San Francisco attractions for under a $100 a night, this is your place. I welcome the opportunity to stay there again.

<Content>Not Impressed I was less than impressed with the claims that this hotel made about it's amenities. The bathroom was small and only had 1 small shelf to store toiletries. I had to store some of my toiletries in the window sill. We barely had enough water pressure to run the shower. We stayed there over a week so it would have been nice to have a chest to store our clothes in but we literally lived out of a suitcase for a week. The bed was very comfortable and I did like the free high speed internet and the small refrigerator was nice. Something really needs to be done to muffle outside noises (fire trucks, jack hammers, etc). There were quite a few homeless people outside the hotel and across the street, but no one bothered us.

<Content>good value, great location. My partner and I went over to San Fracisco for a weekend get-away. We found the hotel to be clean and quiet. Our room was bright, recently painted, and had a lot of historic character. I would definitely stay at the Pickwick again, especially for the price.

<Content>My 4th of July was great thank you Pickwick!! Me and my boyfriend wanted a quiet hotel for the 4th of july and that's exactly what we got! Most hotels are most expensive on holidays not the pickwick. The girl at the front desk was helpful and fast. They took care of all of our needs. It felt like we had the place to ourselves! I will be visiting again.

<Content>Would I Pick The Pickwick? The Pickwick is looking rather tired with worn carpets and furniture and some re-wiring taking place.The room I had was obviously half of the original size but it was clean and sheets were changed daily and the air con worked well.I used a safety deposit box at no cost.The great point about this hotel is the proximity to all types of transport and the closeness to many main shopping areas which are within walking distance. There is an excellent bakery in the block which is ideal for breakfast. If I go to SF again I will certainly consider the Pickwick.(Used June 2004)

<Content>Not worth the price, but some staff were excellent Our stay at the Pickwick was a real mixed bag. The rooms were on the small side and a little worn although the beds were very comfortable. That old bug-bear, knocking pipe sounds, was evident once showers started up around the hotel in the morning.Front desk staff were ignorant and the hotel did it's best to rip us off for everything they could above the basic rate - something we didn't experience anywhere else in the South-West US. However, the concierge was really helpful and gave us loads of good advice and help, and housekeeping were excellent when we left something in the rooms after we left and they packaged it back up to us.Parking is very expensive (as it is everywhere in San Francisco). The location is in a less than fantastic bit of town, although we never felt anything other than safe. On the plus side, the excellent Mel's Diner was only two blocks up for breakfast and we were only a few minutes walk from the very centre.I'd suggest looking somewhere else for your stay in San Francisco - a Best Western would be similarly priced and, although more generic, a better bet.
