<Content>beware extras The food was excellent and the service very helpful and friendly. We upgraded from the standard room provided (which was rather small with rather tired furnature) to a larger corner room for 拢35/night) . excellent city view with a spectacular view of the fireworks on new years eve.The sound proofing was poor-you could easily hear next door's TV and the lift bells.Beware the extras!! No bottled water in room and 拢7.50p to buy one in the hotel, no tea/coffee making facilities and a 拢6.00 price tag on a cup of coffee in the restaurant. Plenty of parking space but at a cost of 拢35/day and a 10 minute local telephone call that costa 拢10 etc etc. Ok if you are a business traveler on expences -if you are not careful the extras could easily double the headline cost!

<Content>Good - but standard rooms are not 5-star quality I spent two nights at the Okura for a business conference. I came away with mixed feelingsI drove there. It's conveniently located, 5 minutes off the Ring. The hotel has its own good, if expensive, underground car park.Front desk staff were firndly and courteous, and extremely efficient, both on check-in and check-out: could not be faulted. Unlike some other reviewers, I had no difficulties with the housekeeping, room service and restaurant staff.The basic facilities at the hotel are fine, and the restaurants (Ciel Bleu on the 23rd floor, and the Teppanyaki restuaurant on the ground floor are excellent, as are the bars on the 23rd and ground floor. Having said that, the prices match the quality of the experience - far from cheap! Breakfast was good, if a little quirky with breakfast cereals in plastic bottles!Conference facilities and food were well above average.I was in a standard room that was comfortable enough, but a little small, and fast reaching the point where refurbishment will be needed - somewhat tired and faded. There were minor niggles: a shortage of power sockets around the desk; slightly defective sound insulation from the corridor outside; a very small, incredibly narrow, bath ... ... ... all of which made this an experience worth less than the advertised 5 stars, though by no means bad.

<Content>Wonderful stay! We had a wonderful stay at the Okura hotel in Amsterdam. The staff is very professional and friendly. Our room had a magnificent view over the city. We had dinner in the Yamazato restaurant, which is certainly worth of a recommendation. Breakfast was also good, with plenty of choice. We had booked a promotion with a late check-out on Sunday, which is just a perfect way to have a relaxed weekend.

<Content>Loved it! Stayed at the Okura for 3 nights and was very impressed.We had booked a triple room online for a discounted rate. The room was clean and had a daily maid service - and AMAZING views across Amsterdam. The only quibble with the room would be that it was specified as a triple room, but the third bed was in fact a makeshift one. However, I was only sleeping on it - so it didn't matter too much. TV and toiletries in room were satisfactory, and other bits and pieces included prayer mats, slippers, and bathing robes.Breakfast was great - served in the restaurant downstairs with a huge variety of food. Okura are really trying to please everyone, and they do this - there's a range of European, Asian, and American cuisine for breakfast! We were also impressed with the Moet offered at breakfast for free.There is a small shopping mall below the hotel (for guests only), and some beautiful restaurants around. The hotel is easily reached by tram, and we took a minibus from the airport. Overall, a great stay. I would definitely go back!

<Content>Overpriced and poor for business trip I stayed here for 3 nights in order to attend a conference at the RAI centre. The hotel was booked for me by the conference organisers since it was closest to the RAI. They paid for one of the nights, I paid the other 2 and felt well ripped off.I arrived at the hotel by public transport - the tram 25 gets within about 2-300 merres of the hotel. The walk to the hotel entrance takes you through a run down car park with no easy pavement area and could be improved a lot.Check in was fine and quick.The room was generally OK, although rather small, as was the bathroom/toilet. Given that this was only June, and the outside temperature was only about 20C, the air con was verging on ineffective. The room was stuffy, and the window could not be opened far enough. Bed was comfortable.The wardrobe had a bizarre lighting mechanism - open it at the end where there was no hanging rail (just the safe) and the light came on. Open it at the end where the hanging rail was, and the light went off...The worst feature of the room was trying to work there. The desk had no power supply and no Ethernet cable. I had to pull a light plug out of the wall to charge my laptop. There was supposed to be Wireless LAN in the room, but the cost was extortionate and connectivity was poor. Paying over 200 Euros per night, I expect free internet access (as I received in my $99 room the previous week in the USA).Breakfast was similarly heavily over-priced, and we only ate there when it was paid for by the conference company.It's a fair walk to the RAI, and in future I would find a better value hotel with public transport to the centre.Check out was not as slick as it should have been. As stated, bed and breakfast for the first night was paid for, but I had to remind the receptionist of this twice before she accepted it, and then went and printed my bill with the breakfast charge still on it. It came over as another attempt to gouge for more money.Overall - OK location for RAI, OK rooms, poor for business, exceptionally poor value.

<Content>The only thing 5 star about the Okura are prices First of all this is an ordinary hotel pretending to be a 5 star establishment - it is far from it except for exorbitant prices. It also extremely unhygienic - two observations during my stay:1) I was coming back to my room and found it was being serviced 鈥?the maid was in the bathroom, she was wearing rubber gloves and had just finished cleaning the bath/shower and toilet. Then, while still wearing those same rubber gloves, she took the used drinking glasses, rinsed them out in the sink and then took the used, dirty towels to dry the glasses. Not only is this unsanitary and poses a health risk, it is disgusting, That also means when you arrive at the hotel, your drinking glasses were wiped dry by the used dirty towels of the previous occupant. When I tried to discuss this with hotel management, they were more concerned that I found out what they do, but other than apologizing they did nothing to provide clean sanitized glasses. 2) During a conference break the waiters were setting up for lunch, one of them was arranging the cutlery using their bare unwashed hands touching the food end of each utensil as they arranged it in neat patterns.Stay away, it is unhygienic, lousy service and way overpriced.

<Content>Great Hotel, nice room excellent service This my first stay here. I am a big fan of the Okura hotel in tokyo. So I thought I would try this out when I on business in Amsterdam for one day. The check in was uneventful. I stayed in a room with two beds and a sofa. Carpets are little worn out. Other than than the rooms are good. The bathroom needs a little renovation too. Nice desk to work on. The lobby is typical Japanese style. Also great location in Amsterdam. I went to the gym in th4e afternoon. They charge extra 15 euros for using the gym, which did not make any sense to me. its a good gym though, with an excellent sauna.I will stay here again, when I am back for business in Amsterdam.

<Content>Good Visit, Well appointed suites I stayed at the Okura in March of 2007 and booked a junior suite. I was part of a conference staying at the hotel. The suite was well appointed. The service was fantastic. The hotel wasn't in the city center, however, a short cab ride or nice walk and you are right in the middle the city. I was very impressed wtih the level of service provided. The only downside was the glass shower door leaked water onto the floor in the bathroom. Maintenance couldn't get it fixed during my stay without taking the entire panel off, and they indicated it needed replacing. dso I lived with it.

<Content>second change for Amsterdam's Okura After me being not to positive in my review fro June 2007 I decided to give the Okura a second change. In order to prevent disappointment I booked a recently renovated deluxe junior suite for 鈧?395.00 excluding breakfast.The junior suites are very well decorated; large entrance with a small cloakroom; living room combined with bedroom in which a very nice sofa and some relaxfauteills finish the room. The bed is ok but not as good as the one's in the Marriotts :)!Plus is the mechanisem to close the curtains and switch off / on the lights from your bed!The bathroom is large. well equipt with an extra LCD tv.The promissed rainshower fails the test; unfortunetalyonly small waterpressure is provided.Overall; when you can affort it; go for the Deluxe rooms!, the prices tough are very very high; 鈧?5.20 for a normal Coke!?, 鈧?29.00 for a very basic continental breakfast!?( full American isn;t available ) the Okura is really pushing it's prices to the point where these kind of prices are getting absurd.

<Content>Great room, spacious and elegant Hotel Okura is away from the main part of the city. It is not centrally located, but great for honeymooners, business people with meetings at the hotel, etc. We were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary, so it was special. The rooms are spacious and hi-tech. Loved everything about the room and the huge bathroom with double sink overlooking the canal.The bar/lounge overlooks the entire city and the building is the tallest and the highest point in Amsterdam. We didn't get to eat at the hotel restaurants and need to book two weeks in advance, supposedly a 5 star sushi restaurant, and the only 5 stars outside of Japan.There are nearby restaurants, walking distance, but mostly will have to cab it to go to museums, shopping and city center

<Content>Excellent Business hotel but too far out from center I went to Amsterdam for New Year with my partner. We got a good deal on a fantastic room in the Okura. We had a suite, which was a good size and nicely decorated. The bathroom was good with a big shower and washlet loo, however the shower leaked. The hotel is too far out to really enjoy the city. It is a good 40min walk. There is a tram close by, but not my idea of fun. The French resturant was closed when we were there so we tried the tappenyaki. We had a set menu (75 euros each), add 2 bottles of average wine, then you are talked (pressurised) into upgrading your beef and before you know it, a meal for 2 costs 拢260. This would be OK, if it was an intimate meal for 2, however you could be sharing your table with a family with small children, as we were. The bar on floor 23 was good, if not a little dated looking but the views of the city are stunning. We only looked around the swimming pool and spa, as I had forgotton my swimming costume. The hotel only had PAPER costumes to purchase for 11.5 euros in a bright flowery pattern. Never have I seen anything more hideous. Why they don't have simple plain black fabric costumes, is beyond me. All in all though the hotel was the best bit of Amsterdam for us.

<Content>Just Loved it I have been staying in the Okura Hotel a couple of times while on business trip. I must agree with most reviews telling that the lobby and hallways should be refreshed but I never was disappointed with the rooms. They are very comfortable, quiet and clean. The staff was very friendly and the Japanese restaurant is a top notch one.I once benefited of a room upgrade which was very nice ( I nearly got lost while on my way from bed to the bathroom!))What would have me not to rate it a 5 is the additional fee for using the swimming pool... That's so bad!

<Content>I wish I didnt work so much so I could appreciate this place I used our corporate account and stayed here during my business trip. Far from the shopping and nightlife, but ideal for business travelers. Beautiful facilities, loved the bubble baths while enjoying cheesy US tv shots from the 80's. I am not sure, but I think it was McGuyver...

<Content>Okura is average, certainly not 5 stars I was curious to see how this hotel would turn out given that previous reviewers either raved about it and recommended the service and excellent staff, or were highly critical and commented on the dated appearance and strange smells! My experience was that both are correct. The staff are very courteous and helpful, there are plenty of amenities and the location is convenient with an easy tram ride into the center of the city and a selection of restaurants and shops within 5 minutes walk. However, my room had the previously reported ' strange smell' (and it was a non-smoking room) and the decor was very 1970s, in the worst sense. Given other reviews, I suspect that there are some more modern renovated rooms and that these are significantly more expensive. I was also disappointed at the premium charges that are slapped on everything, such as internet access (there is WiFi available for 25 Euros per day) and the bar and restaurants are expensive. I certainly would not rate it as a 5 star hotel; more like 3-4 stars. Major renovations are needed to drag it out of the 70s.

<Content>Pay per swim! I almost booked to go here, but oriented by an earlier review phoned to check if guests could use the swimming pool, only to discover that this would cost an extra 14 Euros, not per stay, but per person, per day!!! So, given I like to swim each evening, we booked elsewhere. I have never, ever stayed in a hotel where you had to pay a day rate to use the pool before! (In fact, the Hilton where I am a member of the gym extended my membership by a month for free as I had a 3 week stay in the hotel, and all facilities are free for guests!)

<Content>OK for business, but not for families... I have stayed in the Hotel Okura in Amsterdam, while on business, on four previous occasions and, in fairness to the hotel, I liked it. For business I found it to be a good hotel - an expensive hotel, but a good one.So, when planning a family trip to Amsterdam I decided to 'treat' us all to an Okura stay opting to pay the premium for the opulence and then the additional premium for one of their executive suites.This led to three sleepless nights and my families鈥?disaffection with the whole 鈥榩remium鈥?hotel experience.The problems started just after midnight on the first night of our stay. Our room, we now know, was directly below the roof top 鈥楥iel Bleu Restaurant鈥?鈥?or to be more specific, the kitchen of the 鈥楥iel Bleu Restaurant鈥?(to be pedantic, the tiled floor of the kitchen of the 鈥楥iel Bleu Restaurant鈥?. Between 00:30 and 02:45 on Sunday morning, my wife, our eight year old daughter and I lay in our beds listening to the crash and bash of pots and pans being washed, the clink and chink of glasses and crockery being put away and heavens knows what being repeatedly dragged across the kitchen floor just above our beds.Our complaints were listened to with empathy, but the hotel was fully booked. We were not able to move to another room.We just made breakfast, somewhat bleary eyed, before it stopped service in the morning whereupon we where confronted by another issue. Our daughter would be charged the same rate as an adult for breakfast: Thirty Euros (that鈥檚 Twenty UK Pounds or Forty US Dollars) which has be the most expensive slice of toast, as that is all my daughter ate for breakfast, in any hotel anywhere.Sunday night/Monday morning was not as bad. Perhaps the 鈥楥iel Bleu Restaurant鈥?had had a quiet night. Anyhow, we got to sleep by around 01:30.My wife decided to skip breakfast in the morning opting for an extra half an hour in bed, but asked that we bring her back a croissant. The staff, however, did not think much of that idea and so we came to the next issue. Despite paying another thirty Euros for my daughter鈥檚 slice of toast 鈥?that is now sixty Euros (Forty Pounds or Eighty Dollars) - for two slices of toast, they objected to my taking a croissant back to the room. The staff suggested that I pay another Thirty Euros (standard buffet breakfast charge), plus room service charge, to have the croissant delivered to the room. Needless to say that I left the croissant on the breakfast table and my wife went hungry. I will say that as a consequence of this I was now in the dog house 鈥?a noisy, expensive dog house 鈥?and everything was my fault. So much for a family 鈥榯reat鈥?Monday night/Tuesday morning capped the previous two nights. The noise from the kitchen was preceded by the music from the 鈥楥hampagne and Cocktail Lounge Bar Twenty Third鈥?(our room was on the twenty second floor). Calls to reception finally managed to reduce the din from both the 鈥楥hampagne and Cocktail Lounge Bar Twenty Third鈥?and the kitchen of the 鈥楥iel Bleu Restaurant鈥?to a reasonable level, but the occasional accidentally dropped bottle, glass, pot, pan, ladle, cutlery, crockery and who knows what else kept us awake until 03:00.Between 03:00 and 06:30 on Tuesday morning we had a fantastic sleep. Given the option we would have slept longer, but the final issue put pay to that.The 鈥極kura Executive Lounge鈥? was next to our room and opens at 07:00. The 鈥極kura Executive Lounge鈥?has a wooden floor. The staff in the 鈥極kura Executive Lounge鈥?are attractive and pleasant young ladies whose smart uniform includes high heal shoes. High heal shoes and wooden floors are not good bed fellows, if it is your intention to sleep that is. Exasperated I trudged down to reception again 鈥?in my pyjamas this time, not a pleasant sight for my fellow guests 鈥?and vented my thoughts about the Hotel Okura, the 鈥楥iel Bleu Restaurant鈥? the 鈥楥hampagne and Cocktail Lounge Bar Twenty Third鈥?the 鈥極kura Executive Lounge鈥?and the Sixty Euros for two rounds of toast to the attractive and pleasant young lady whose desk was labelled 鈥楪uest Relations鈥?and whose smart uniform included high heal shoes.I returned to reception a couple of hours later to check out. The attractive and pleasant lady whose desk was labelled 鈥楪uest Relations鈥?offered, after listening to my criticisms and much debate, to deduct one nights stay from the bill.It still is a nice hotel and the staff are very nice and efficient. But, the hotel does not understand or cater for children 鈥?do not take yours there. Do not pay the extra on top of the extra to stay at this hotel to stay on the Executive floor (the 22nd), you will get no sleep.And finally: you (or at least I) usually leave a hotel with a feeling for its rank; ones own star rating if you will. I left the Hotel Okura Amsterdam with a niggling feeling that its modus operandi was that of a money making machine rather than a luxury hotel - the sort of niggling feeling that makes you think when the staff smile at you that there will be a charge for it on your bill. A bad illustration because, as mentioned, the staff were very nice, but the feeling remains and the hotel鈥檚 rank, to my mind, is as a consequence a lowly one.

<Content>wonderful experience I took my parents to the Okura for their 44th wedding anniversary and it is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. I had booked 2 rooms and , not only were my parents upgraded free of charge to a deluxe room on the executive floor, but so was I. There was a beautiful bouquet of flowers, chocolates and a card from the management in my parents room and chocolates in mine - completely unexpected. The staff were unfailingly courteous, helpful and efficient and we felt very well looked after. Never before have we had our beds turned down for us at night! My parents enjoyed the experience so much, they are considering returning there for their 45th wedding anniversary next year.

<Content>Lovely hotel ..... Wonderful staff My Husband and I stayed at the Okura during a recent trip to Amsterdam to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary.On arrival the Receptionist was very polite and extremely helpful. On learning that it was our Anniversary she arranged an upgrade, free of charge to a Junior Suite. The Bell Boy who took our baggage up was wonderful. When he realised it was our first visit to Amsterdam - he spent approx 15 mins explaining the transport system, showing us the areas to visit and where to find the good restaurants.The room we had was lovely - very large, well decorated, with everything we needed. 30 mins after arriving another Receptionist arrived at the room with a complimentary tray containing flowers, chocolates, a bottle of wine and a hand written note from the General Manager congratulaing us.During our 2 night stay all the staff we dealt with were very pleasent and courteous. We had no complaints at all and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

<Content>Not a 5 Star - Need refurbish This Hotel can NOT be considered as a 5 Star Hotel. The Bathroom was a old fashioned conditioned and the room seems like you were on the 80麓s. I am Spanish and I am used to go to 3 Star Hotels which are less than half the price of this Hotel and with double quality (Bathroom and room). The Breakfast (almost 30 euro) is expensive and not worth it.This Hotel need to de refurbish!!!

<Content>Very nice It was a bit pricey - 275 Euro per night. But I got upgraded to a suite, and it was beautiful. It was a corner room that had two big windows. The southern facing window overlooked a canal. the bathroom was very nice too. there's a lot of automation in the room. You can control the curtains, the lights, the alarm clock all from a touch screen console. When it works, it's great. When it doesn't work, it's a pain - like the lights coming on in the middle of the night. I had to unscrew the light bulbs so that I could get some sleep.I like the location. It was in a very quiet part of town, away from all the hustle and bustle. But Amsterdam is a small city, and it doesn't take long to get to where the action is. There is a tram stop very close to the hotel. There's a tram every 15 minutes that takes you to the Dam and the Centraal Station. The Van Gogh museum and the Rijkmuseum are just a leisurely 20 minute walk from the hotel, and a good part of the walk is along a canal on the Hobbemakade Street, so it's very scenic.Be prepared to spend a little extra money in this hotel. Nothing's free. Wireless internet was 25 Euro per day. Local calls 3 Euro. The restaurants in the hotel are very expensive. I paid 75 Euro for a Japanese dinner. Good quality food, but overpriced. Another guest told me that you even had to pay to use the swimming pool.

<Content>Needs imporvement 4 nights in April. 2 nights leisure, 2 nights business.Smelly dark lobby. Vey 1970's. Smells like an astray. This is inexcusable in a 5 star hotel.Poor service on arrival - 5 star hotels usually have someone to help you with your bags.Check in was unhelpful - I like information e.g. we have a leisure club and a bar on the top floor.Room key kept failing.Leisure club cost eaxta (but was really excellent).Great delux room room @ Euros 355 per night (cheap plastic bathroom bin though and also own-brand soaps and shampoo's which I think is down market).Japanese restaurant is excellent - but decor is awful 70's.Bar on top floor...drasticlly needs renovation and overhaul. It lacks 'Cool' and style. Boring place - should be an exciting place.Quite unhelpful lobby staff.

<Content>Mediocre and over-priced I stayed at this hotel for three nights as a business traveller so my review is from a different perspective to a holiday-maker. I really felt that the hotel did not deliver what I had expected. From the website and various reviews I had expected it to have a Japanese style and boutique feel to it, but in reality found it to be a rather standard and quite dated hotel.The rooms were mediocre 鈥?fine for a short stay but nothing special. The view was great 鈥?I was on one of the upper floors and so had a view of the entire city. Beds were reasonably comfortable, but being in a single room I rather frustratingly had two single beds.What stood out most about the hotel was the exceptionally slow service. I was running a conference in the hotel and so good service was paramount to the success of my event but throughout my time at the hotel I was repeatedly frustrated by the laid back attitude of staff that did not seem to appreciate my need for speed and efficiency. The communal areas of the hotel are horribly smoky 鈥?perhaps this will change when regulations take effect. I noticed too that ashtrays were not frequently replaced.The hotel also takes every opportunity to charge extra for simply anything it can. As a company we were spending 拢20,000 at the hotel and were charged for everything from extra adaptors to a single extra bottle of water on site. The hotel would get far more business if it made allowances for customers 鈥?I have not seen such an attitude in any hotel I have ever stayed in.Room service was also quite poor and pricey. The conference fare was also quite substandard 鈥?the eggs in our salad nicoise weren鈥檛 cooked properly. Portions served at our sit down lunch were small too to the point of being embarrassing to delegates.Location 鈥?absolutely fine... Pleasantly out of the way and peacefully quiet. A great shuttle bus to the airport (return ticket 19 euros)Would I stay there again? No 鈥?not unless a business trips requires me to and even then I would do my best to go elsewhere

<Content>Great Room - outdated lobby We stayed here for a week in September. The room was spacious, clean and had all of the amenities of a 5 star hotel. It looked like our room had been renovated in the past few years.However, the common areas of this hotel are very outdated. The lobby looks like it was last renovated in the 1970s. The typical patrons of this hotel are business travelers. It is also far from the city center (about a 20 minute walk), so I wouldn't chose this hotel if you are only coming for a weekend. However, since we were in town for a week, we enjoyed the walk to the city center.

<Content>Was I in same hotel? We have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Okura hotel.Having read several of the earlier reviews I wonder if I have been at the same hotel as some reviewers.Our room was on the 14th floor with a lovely corner view. The room was very clean and comfortable. Our 10 year old daugter had a camp bed onto which was placed a separate supply of toiletries and towels during the turn-down service each night.We wondered why no coffee facilities were available in the room but guessed this was a ploy to charge for room service. We did not eat in the restaurants apart from breakfast, as we had seen the cost of meals and decided to eat in the centre of Amsterdam. Besides, due to the location of the hotel, we found that once we were out for the day it suited us to stay out until the evening, so taking our meals in town.The breakfasts were very good, with lots of choice including the favoured bacon and eggs, as mentioned by other reviewers the champagne is indeed a lovely treat when you are on holiday. I also agree that it is a cheek to charge for use of the pool and gym, but we didnot get chance to use them anyway due to sight-seeing. Although the hotel is not in the centre of Amsterdam, the tram leaves from about 100 yards away and is regular, cheap and friendly. We would stay again without hesitation.

<Content>5 star service My boyfriend took me to this hotel from 22-24 March, we had a WONDERFUL time, the bed was soft and comfortable, the bathroom was amazing, and the maids cleaned everything perfectly. We stayed in a standard room, and although the decor was a little dated and the view was the building next door (we were only on the 3rd floor), we still made the most of it and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.On both days we used the spa which was bliss, you get slippers and a robe  towel included in the 鈧?4 fee. There is a sauna, steam room, pool (didn't go in - water too cold!!) and jacuzzi with very comfortable pool-side beds to chill out on. The mini bar was overpriced - 鈧? at least for everything, including the water! We just were careful about what we used. We ate breakfast both days and have nothing to moan about, it wasnt amazing but not bad either. We ate in the downstairs restaurant on the 2nd night - not the Japanese one - and although the portions were average the food was AMAZING and the service was top notch. Yes the hotel is away from the centre but we were happy about this - besides, a tram goes from right outside the hotel to the centre and a taxi back late at night will not cost you more than 鈧?2. We ventured into the city to check out the famou red light distrcit - what an experience!!!All in all a WONDERFUL mini break, amazing birthday treat, and 5 star service throughout - apart from the crazy cab driver (we booked the shuttle back to the airport for 鈧?5 for the 2 of us, and got a mad, very pierced man in a car driving like a maniac and texting the whole time to the airport. Needless to say I am glad we made it there in one piece!!). The other downside was the 8 hour flight delay to get back to London (a 50 minute flight!!) - but that was booked through easyjet and is a whole other story!!!!!If you go - enjoy! They are renovating at the moment but we weren't bothered by this at all.

<Content>okura beware We specially picked this hotel because of the health club facilities and offer for massage. The room was located on the 14th floor so the view of Amsterdam was nice only partially covered by netting on the south side due to renovations. The room was a corner room a bit larger expected but the interior was outdated. WE should have asked for the japanese rooms but my friend had unpacked and didn't want to change rooms.On Sunday morning I got woken up by the sound of glass bottles being chucked out in a metal container and never really got back to sleep! Terrible!We had dinner at the Ciel Blue and though it was nice but not worth the michellin star, portions were very small and we both felt it was not worth the money. And the presentation was definitely very early nineties...cubed pineapple in a checkered pattern...chocolate cake was delicious though.Staff was well trained but really wanted us the leave past mid night as we were last one there. We did get the nice chocolates with after dinner coffe but as the dinner was overpriced it only was justified.Oh we sat at the bar past its closing time and the bartender ignored us so we got up and left and used the overpriced minibar. So far for a 5 star hotel.We had dinner at the Odessa boat the next night and dinner there was very very lovely and much more in balance and a 1/3 of the price... a real special gem. Room service breakfast was fast and good. And the milk for the tea arrived promptly.The unpleasant surprise was the parking a steep 24 Euro a day and though we took the car out on Saturday we got charged the full day price. We tried booking the massage but it was fully booked and no alternative was offered so we never tried out the spa. The whole hotel is a bit outdated and though I truly believe the Yamazoto is excellent this hotel is way overrated.

<Content>Stay Away From This Hotel Booked the hotel through Otel/GTA and was shocked at the condition of the room given to me. It was so dusty that the room made me sneeze incessantly and I'm a smoker! The room I was booked into was a standard room. Quite frankly you can not call this hotel 5 star. It deserved a 3 star rating. Renovations were going on and if you get an old room you'll know what I mean by tired and worn. I tried to get an upgrade but was told by the duty manager that they have a policy of not upgrading anyone for free- not what I read in the previous reviews here. I then asked that I pay for an upgrade but because of the inconvenience of repacking and changing rooms maybe they can throw in free internet access or something else as a gesture of goodwill particularly when I explained that I come to Amsterdam very often and can give repeat business. The duty manager was very firm and said why should they? wow! quite frankly I have never had that sort of remark from anyone in the hotel industry before and I used to be permanenty checked into a hotel for a period of 2 years. I can not recommend this hotel to anyone and the location is far from the centre of town. I will never stay there again as it was my worst ever hotel experience.

<Content>Great room The renovated room was great and reminded me of the best Mandarin Oriental rooms. Excellent Japanese restaurants. Full sauna facilities (including cold plunge pool), which is rare in city hotels. Drawbacks: location quite far from old city centre, 1970s decor needs updating (except in the new rooms and the Japanese restaurants), cigarette smoke in the lobby (Amsterdam is not a great city for non smokers).I would go back, especially once the ongoing renovation progamme is completed.

<Content>A bit hit and miss I have stayed twice at the Okura in the past 12 months. The first time, I got a room upgrade to a 'luxury room'. This room category is fantastic, very spacious with plasma TV's in both the bedroom and the bathroom. Also a nice walk-in shower. This year, I stayed in a standard room and although there is nothing 'wrong' with it, it is not 5 star quality. Not all that spacious and definitely dated. No power outlets to charge phone etc (except for the shaver outlet in the bathroom).The service is generally very good, but when I asked to leave a parcel at the concierge to be collected a few hours later by a friend, I got fobbed of by 'try the business centre', where they had no idea why I was sent there.As mentioned in numerous other reports, the charges for everything (WiFi Internet, Health Centre, Mini bar) are outrageous.All in all, not value for money, unless you get a room upgrade!

<Content>Wonderful Staff I must say the Okura is a lovely hotel. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms are very spacious and well equiped. I cannot complain about the service. And I particularly enjoyed the champagne at breakfast!The only thing that did bother me was the hotel owners audacity to try and charge you for everything. The internet connection and mini-bar were way over priced and there was even a charge to use the leisure centre. I got the feeling the hotel suffered from its own dillusions of grandeur and the large number of business guests who seem to frequent it. But having said that I had a thoroughly enjoyable stay and would happily recommend this hotel.

<Content>Loved the Okura Stayed from the 26-28 oct and loved the hotel, check in was 2pm we arrived about 9.30 and was let into our room straight away. The room was large and comfortable and the bathroom was fantastic, yes it is expensive for breakfast, but when you stay in a 5* hotel what do you expect, also try out the french restaurant on the 23rd floor, very nice. would definatly stay here again and would recommend it to everyone (and im very fussy!!!)

<Content>Five Star? I don't think so Not a great experience,right from check in. I asked for a canal view and was immediately hit with an extra 35euro per night charge. The room was new and the bathroom was excellent...with a tv built into the wall!I went for a swim - and it was freezing,but the best bit was yet to come...I was charged 14euro for the pleasure! (In a five star?)If you have forgotten your razor,you pay. If you need anything,you pay.On the positive side,the breakfast was excellent and most staff (except reception ) were on the ball and helpful. The consierge was super and booked an indian and chinese that were both excellent.It is much closer to the Airport than the city,so not really an excellent choice for a few days break.Would I use it again? No,and no way can it claim to be five star -except when it comes to charging.

<Content>Not what I expected I was booked into the hotel while I was attending METS and was very disappointed, although promoted as 5* it is not - and the room was showing its age. The food was expensive and unless you ate in the themed restaurants bland.I had a real problem with their accounts, my company had paid in full 6 weeks before and, because I did not have that card with me; at one time I was locked out of my room. Eventually they admitted that they had had two recent credit card frauds by Brits and that they had been a little over zealous, apologised and offered me a complimentary dinner and complimentary weekend for two. We will not be taking up the offer...

<Content>A worthy 5 * rated hotel I have stayed at some of the finest 5* hotels in London , Asia , Europe , and North America and the Okura is amongst the best. I stayed for a 4 day break in a deluxe room and could not fault the staff service , facilities , or food.Room - Excellent - wanted for nothing and very cleanService - Easily worthy of 5* rating - couldnt do enough to helpLocation - A little out of the city but not a problem.Gym and pool - first class facilitiesFood - Excellent choice from Michelin cuisine to snacksIf I had to criticise anything , it would be the main reception - looks a little old and needs modernising , but was probably stunning when new. The hotel has a number of suites at various levels and prices and so can suit everyone.

<Content>Some details missing ... I stayed for 2 days at this hotel while attending a meeting.LOCATIONLocation is good for the RAu conference center. The hotel is on a road with atram line, so you can get to all parts of town, but the trip to the heart of the city will take 20 minutes. It's located close to some canals, but not he nicest ones with the istoric houses. The view from the rooms is good, but not really below the 9th floor. The entrance road is bumpy and not well kept. They need a new gardener. There is an ugly car park and and office block between the main road and the hotel.RECEPTIONCheck inn is relatively fast and staff are on hand to take care of lugage. The whole atmosphere is of a good 4 star hotel, but not really 5 star. Staff speaks several language, but oddly enough I had difficulties getting the staff to speak dutch, their native language (well not for all of them it seems ...)The lifts are quite slow and rattling.FACILITIESThe basement has a business center and a small shop. Efficient, but the low ceiling and decoration make it more like a 3 star experience down there. I didn't use or see the Spa facilities.ROOMSMy room was on the 19th floor and did have everything one needs or expects in a luxury hotel room. It was nice and clean, but warm and not easy to cool down. The room is nor very large for 5 star standards, and decoration is 'decent' but there are no surprises and the more modern minimalistic or 'lounge' styles are not present in all roomsPROBLEMSThere were tipsy noisy people in the corridors at 2am.The lifts are slow.Rooms are not sound proof (internal wamms and doors).Doubtfull individuals in the bar area.5 star amenities but 4 sar atmosphere.

<Content>Fab Okura My husband and I have just returned from a 3 days stay in Amsterdam, staying at the Okura hotel. I was slightly sceptical about this hotel - due to mixed reviews, but I have been nothing short of amazed by the excellent service offered at the Okura. The staff were always pleasant and helpful. Room service was efficient - even after midnight! The hotel is very close to the tram service, and travel into the city took an easy 10mins. The hotel location was lovely - as it wasn't too noisy around the surrounding areas - as opposed to some hotels I saw within the city centre. There is a beautiful canal next to the hotel to have an evening stroll. I would definately stay at this hotel again. Although - the breakfast was pricey at 27 Euro's - we opted to go to nearby cafes.

<Content>Some rooms may be 5*, but not mine I had high expectations after my secretary told me that she had booked me into a very nice 5* hotel. However, I suspect that not all rooms fall in that category. I was on the 3rd floor, which also hosts the fitness room and other facilities. It appears to be the only floor where residents do not need to swipe their room card in the elevator for access. My room was comfortable, but quite standard. All through the night, at intervals of about 30 seconds, there were very annoying, high pitched sounds coming through the ventilation system (although I had turned the fan and climate controls off in the room.) The noises were loud enough to make sleep difficult. Breakfast was not included in my rate, and the only option appeared to be a EUR27 buffet. That seems quite extravagant if one only wants a light breakfast, as I did, but increasingly seems to be the case with continental hotels. I managed to negotiate a slightly reduced rate for a bowl of cereal, OJ, and coffee.

<Content>Cracking hotel Myself  my wife stopped at this hotel from 9th Feb to the 11th Feb 06. We had a double room on the 22nd floor.The hotel was superb. Clean, friendly  to of the standard i expected.Our room had a wall mounted plama screen at the end of the bed, which was a nice touch. The bathroom was nicely layed out with a bath big enough for 2!!, and a walk in shower!!.The room had a double bed, as apposed to two singles pushed together, which seems the norm in europe.The staff could not do enough for you.Breakfast was included in the room, and was fantastic.Champagne breakfast before setting off into the town, seemed to start the day appropriately =)Room service was good, the food was lovely.We will definately stop here again, hopefully in the next couple of months.

<Content>Its OK My opinion is based on comparing this 'Leading Hotel of the World' to other LHW and amazing 5 * hotels I have stayed in across the globe, it does not reach the same level at all. It is to be expected that the standard in Europe however will always be lower than that in the US/Far East. This is a lovely hotel, large lobby, amazing restaurants (I ate in the Japanese one and the food/service was excellent). Despite being a resident at the hotel we couldnt get a reservation at the one on the 23rd floor, and when we later went up to have a drink in the bar, we noticed the restaurant was in fact half empty!? I was upgraded to a suite upon check in, which gave ma a corner room, very spacious with a great view (and slight canal view). The standard was as you would expect: Very clean, functional. Furniture was by no means modern, but all in a good condition, the bathroom was tiny but well equipped with toiletries/robes/slippers. I forgot my plug adapter and when I called down to ask for one, it took 10 minutes for it to arrive for them to bring me the wrong one, I then had to sign and later realised that they charged 5EUROS for the 'convenience of borrowing it'. The leisure facitilies looked great but I didnt get a chance to use them. The location is good, if you want to be in a 'nice' area slightly nearer to the airport rather than the immediate centre. Everywhere in Amsterdam is easy to get to within 15 mins, and to get to the centre you would take a taxi which (dependant upon the time of day) would take 5-10 mins.Overall, this is a well-kept hotel, with OK service (in the restaurants and reception) and had good facilities particuarly for business customers. It certainly wont 'wow' you but I am guessing it is probably one of the best hotels in Amsterdam.

<Content>Luxury stay for the Conference The Okura is a 5-8 minute walk to the RAI Conference centre which makes it ideal if attending a function there, with the idea of staying in a reasonable level of luxury. It is a 15 minute ride on Tram 25 from the Central Station, but the area is quiet, and tram travel in Amsterdam is easy. Ask for a room as high as possible - we had the 15th floor, the highest non-smoking floor but we were also lucky to have the corner, giving a 180 degree view, even on to a showery city. Rooms are comfortable, service friendly. We did not dine in-house since there were enough restaurants/cafes nearby, and then in the city centre. I cannot understand why there is an extra charge - 12 Euros per person per day - for their gym; good hotels should be able to incorporate this into a package.

<Content>Hotel Okura, Amsterdam: Good location, great service I spent a week at the hotel during a business conference at the nearby RAI. While the rooms were not avant-garde designer chic, they were comfortable and clean. The concierge and night manager (important in a city like Amsterdam) were knowledgeable and responsive. Recommended for business travellers.

<Content>SUPERB We arrived after a 4hour train journey from Paris and a taxi ride from Central Station and were greeted by the doorman and an air-conditioned foyer. The hotel lobby was stunning and the staff quickly and efficiently booked us in. The room overlooked one of the many canals and it was roomy and tastefully decorated. I did miss a coffee though!! We had booked via the internet so our room was at a very good rate for a 5* Hotel. We ordered a sandwich and coffee from roomservice and it was really good albeit pricey.Overall, the Okura is a superb hotel, the buffet breakfast had a huge and varied choice and the room was fabulous. The stay was just what we needed after a hectic 5 days in Paris - it was warm and friendly without being obtrusive. The staff were extremely helpful and courteous and helped us with our sightseeing and getting around on the trams. The BEST bit of our stay were the WONDERFUL STAFF who were warm and friendly and made us feel at home whether we were in our Sunday best or in our jeans. I wouldn't go anywhere else !!

<Content>A long way from the center We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights because my husband was attending a conference in the hotel. We quickly discovered the website is deceptive as to its proximity to the city center. It is a good 45-min. walk to the center, and about a 30-min. walk to the Van Gogh Museum. The route is through construction sites and unattractive streets. Trams are conveniently located, though at certain times of the day they're spaced 20 min. apart. Considering its location and that's it's not more than a 4-star, even though it's billed as a luxury hotel, it's way too expensive. I have never stayed in a hotel of this quality where you have to pay 12 euros a day to use their gym. The walls are thin--we could hear our neighbor's every word in the wee hours when he called home. The best thing about this hotel is the pleasant, helpful, well-trained staff. They also have a couple of bars and restaurants, which is good because there is absolutely nothing in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, the rooftop bar has no terrace, which is really a shame, with such a beautiful view.

<Content>Great view and breakfast, though not worth 5 stars Upper rooms have an excellent view over the whole city. Ask for a corner room. Not very central but in Amsterdam everything is quite close and the Pijp area where the hotel is located has become quite hip in recent years with many bars, restaurant and shops.Room was decent. Normal size and Clean. But it could use some re-decoration. Many japanese. The upper level (23rd floor) restaurant has a michelin star for its japanese food, but I didn't eat there.
