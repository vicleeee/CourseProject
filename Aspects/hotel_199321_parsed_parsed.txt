<Content>don't be put off by the exterior having book online nearly 6 months in advance and having read reviews on line i was quite shocked when we arrived and not only was the hotle litrally ove the road from the train station it looked really run down.however once we were inside it was lovely with marbel floors in the lobby and commfy sofas, check in was hassle free despite the fact i have forgotten most of the german i learnt at school!our room was large and comfty and the en suite bathroom was small but clean, the free minibar was a nice touch especially considering the cost of drinks in the city (small soft drinks were 2.5 euros in most bars/ resturants)Breakfast was included in the cost and really did include something for everyone.when we came to check out there was a locked luggage room where we could leave our bags which was usfull as we had 7hrs after checking out befor we need to get our bus.we went fot the christmas markets and for us the hotel was goos however it was about half an hours walk (we chose to walk along the river as it was prettier!) which may not suite loder travlers or those with young children. (saying that ther was a tram stop right outside and numerous taxi's)overall a lovly hotel with everything we needed we would recomend it to friends and stay again if in frankfurt.

<Content>Memorable Experiance Hotel Excelsior Since the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed. Some times fancy hotels are just that fancy no consideration to the vacationers long awaited vacation. This hotel was not fancy but it gave us the attention and consideration needed to complete a wonderful vacation experiance.

<Content>Good location but not clean This was one of the more unpleasant hotels I stayed at during my trip. I actually stayed here on two separate nights.First, the positives. The location was excellent, right across from the train station. The computer room had five or six computers with internet access, which was very convenient. As mentioned in the other reviews, all the drinks in the refrigerator were free. The breakfast was good, with scrambled eggs, sausages and smoked salmon, as well as cold cuts, cereal, bread, etc.The negatives unfortunately outweighed the positives. The non-smoking I was given had a strong smell of stale smoke. The furnishings were old and didn't feel clean. Luckily, my room did have a fan but my friends down the hall did not have one.The second night was later in the week, and the room on first sight seemed newer and was smoke-free so I was initially happy. However, I later discovered bugs resembling small cockroaches on the bathroom floor which went into a crack in the wall and after that, I didn't feel that comfortable. Despite the positives, I wouldn't stay here again because I didn't feel it was clean. There are many different hotels directly across the street facing the train station and I would recommend researching some of those with similar prices to this one.

<Content>Good for a short stay The room was okay. Did not get an opportunity to try the breakfast buffet as we had an early flight. The beds were comfortable. There was no air conditioning but a fan is supplied. There is a free mini bar. You are directly across from the South end of the train station so very convienent. The room overall was clean. The thing I did not like is that there was no water at all in the room for the first hour we were there but were not advised of this at checkin. The wake up service does not work on the self programmable phone. And if you call the front desk you more then likely will not get the wake up call so be sure you have a travel alarm.

<Content>great stay, good value. i was staying alone in frankfurt for 3 nights, so was of course very nervous where i was going to stay. After tons of online searching, i decided on this place, since it was close to the train station, and it was a great deal...Well out of all other hotels i stayed in in Europe, this had the best breakfast and a free internet lounge with about 5 computers or so to use for free. i really liked that.after not checking email for awhile, it was nice to have free access whenever i wanted. the location was so conveinent.When i had to go to the airport in the morning, i just walked across the street to catch a train.It is not a far walk from the Zeil, and the Romer. i enjoyed walking around Frankfurt all day, then going back to my room at night,maybe not the safest area to walk in at night, since of course it is close to the train station.room was SMALL, but clean, basic, and good enough for sleeping, etc......recomended.

<Content>Great value for money! Stayed here because it was conveniently located 60m across from the main train station. Booked it through the travel centre at the train station but I would just walk there or call yourself and save 鈧?. It was quite cheap at 鈧?7 for 2 plus a baby (who ate breakfast). The room was bigger than I expected with a small bathroom that had a deep bath. It was very clean and we had non-smoking. Friendly, helpful staff.It had free mini-bar (2 bottles water, coke  a beer). Free Internet downstairs or wireless in room. Free tea, coffee, fruit  cake all day downstairs. An amazing breakfast included. It had everything - fruit, yoghurt, cereal, eggs etc plus rice and noodles for Asian guests. It is walking distance to town  the river.The only down side was it was 30 degrees  there was only a fan in the room. We were all still able to sleep but if you are heat sensitive, it would be hard.

<Content>Not good - 2 star feel This is a two star property right next to the main train station.Rooms are so small, you can't swing a tennis racket.No A/C meant that in summer this was a furnace.Internet was free. Only consolation. The deco is horrible, the toilette very, very small. No redeeming features other than free internet, location, and a surprisingly excellent breakfast. Other than that, you should avoid this hotel unless your standards are 2 star or below.

<Content>Phenomenal value for money! CHECK-IN DATE: 17 May 2008CHECK-OUT DATE: 18 May 2008NUMBER OF NIGHTS: 1ROOMS BOOKED: 1 Double (BB) Daily total17/05/2008 67.00 EUR 67.00 EURTotal price : 67.00 EURIncludes breakfastPhenomenal value for money! Much better than good value! The Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce must be subsidizing heavily for this room rate to be possible. (But we found many Frankfurt hotels really inexpensive after Paris, Rome and Venice and even smaller French and Italian towns. On return trip we tried to stay at same hotel and could not as fully booked 鈥?instead we stayed at Colour Hotel just around the corner - 鈧?5 for two incl breakfast and almost as good. Adjoining 4star National hotel only 鈧?7 incl breakfast) Our plane landed in Frankfurt one evening and as we were due to catch an early train the next morning we wanted an hotel very close to Frankfurt station to make our late arrival and early departure simple. Hotel was 60 metres from station. Really!The room was very spacious. About 42m2 for room and bathroom. Simply but adequately furnished, bathroom small but adequate. Bathroom had been recently refurbished and retiled, and bedroom carpet was new.Included in room rate was incredible breakfast 鈥?just about anything you could imagine for breakfast anywhere. Not just the basic breakfast we experienced almost everywhere else. Easily the best breakfast we experienced in our last two trips to Germany, France and Italy covering about 5 weeks in total. Based on our experiences at other European hotels the breakfast was worth 鈧?0 for the two of us.The hotel was very efficiently run with minimum services and almost no staff. There was a small restaurant we did not try. Included in the room rate were- breakfast as mentioned- free minibar in room (generously stocked with beer, water, fruit juice, and pepsi)- Free internet usage from internet point in room - Free phonecalls within Germany- Use of business centre with PC鈥檚 and printer and internet access- Use of small meeting room- Free ironing of two garments by staff- Use of ironing room- No coffee/tea in room but lounge area at reception stocked with coffee tea and cakes, self serviceOnce again phenomenal value!

<Content>great stay Excelsior was our first night in Europe and it was a great start. From the minute we walked in we felt welcomed. The beds were great, must have been pretty new with lovely duvets. The included breakfast was beautiful, catering for everyones needs. Well positioned straight across the road from the station. Which is great when new to a city.

<Content>Excellent Hotel I recently stayed at the Excelsior Hotel after reading other reviews. I was not dissapointed. The hotel's location is excellent right next to the main railway station and only a short walk into the city centre. The room was spacious and very clean and it had a free mini bar which came in handy. The breakfast was excellent too with plenty of choice to suit all tastes. It was excelelnt value for money and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to other people.

<Content>Excellent breakfast/free internet; Small rooms with no AC and tiny TV This is a clean two-star hotel given the lack of AC and the small size of the rooms and tiny TV. There is only one English-speaking channel (BBC world) anyway!I would NOT stay here in the summer. You will not be able to sleep because it will be too hot and opening the windows means major noise from the grand central station. But it is a good stay for a night or two or anytime it is cold if you want to save money. We had only a one night stay in frankfurt (plenty to see all the good places in frankfurt if you ask me!) and for 69 Euros for two people in April, it was well worth it, especially with the nice breakfast and FREE internet access in the business center, not to mention the location and the easy access to the airport with one train ride of 15 minute duration with S8 or S9.

<Content>Great central location, good value for money The Excelsior is right next to the Central train station in Frankfurt, and has tram, underground, trains, buses and a taxi rank on it's doorstep. A fantastic base for travel, you can also walk into town in 10-15 minutes. The staff were nice and friendly, and the rooms and bathrooms were fine although the decor is a little tired.There is a free minibar in each room which is great, and there's also tea, coffee, cake and fruit available in the lobby all day. I didn't have a chance to sample breakfast, but it does go on until 11 which is nice.

<Content>Right across from the Hauptbahnof I booked a guaranteed rate room to save on money in order to be at a hotel right across the street from the hauptbahnoff.The wireless internet was not working the day I was there and their internet business room was full of travelers using their computers.The breakfast buffet was OK with a decent selection.The room was very small and noisy. The fridge has a free minibar set up.There were two very small and slow elevators.The location is near the Romerberg area and with the Hauptbahnof, you can connect to the rest of the city in a short while.

<Content>Excellent Value Excellent value for your money. I booked the hotel by calling direct. It was very easy to find as it is just across the street from the main train station. I came in approx 1 hr early and they let me check in. The elevator is a little small and slow. The room was a bit tiny. But, the place was clean and provided great service. Free minibar and excellent morning buffet. It is walking distance to a lot of sites in Frankfurt. I am going to book again when I swing by Frankfurt in a few months.

<Content>A curate's egg Upside: Great location, very nice staff, clean, no outside noise at my room at the rear.Downside: Paper-thin internal wall to my room - I could hear everything the guy in the next room did. Happily he was a considerate sort who retired early  didn't get up before me, so once I had my earplugs in, I didn't hear him  slept really well.Overall, I'd probably go back because judging from the reviews, most of the rooms don't seem to have this problem. One thing I search for when booking hotels  would pay a premium for is free wi-fi in the rooms. This hotel lacks it. There's one wired access cable in the lobby,  there's a business centre, however.

<Content>Good budget value near train station I stayed here during my recent trip to Germany, and enjoyed it.Positives:- Great breakfast buffet included in room rate- Property was clean and maintained, I smelled fresh paint- convenient location- let me check in early (10 am) when jet-lagged from 10 hour flight- free internet- free beer/Pepsi/mineral water/juice in minibarSome cautions:- my room was small; the bathroom was OK, but the sleeping area was cruise-ship sized. You're likely to get a room like this if you book a single.-TV reception was dodgyAll in all, a great value for 55 euros a night. Perfectly fine as a 2/2.5 star if you don't mind the small room.

<Content>Excellent Value! We stayed for two nights in early January, and the hotel met our expectations. We contacted the hotel directly and stayed for E69 per night - a real deal, we thought.It was convenient to get to, fairly centrally located, the room was clean and comfortable, the breakfast was just fine for us, and we enjoyed our Binding beer when we arrived!We ate at the train station one afternoon, and there is a small grocery on the metro level where we purchased incidentals and snacks.We found the hotel staff to be pleasant. We were pretty tired after check-in and had a little difficulty figuring out the room key, but we finally got it.There is a second lift near the breakfast room which we used when the main lift took so long (we stayed on the 8th floor so stairs weren't too convenient).One evening when we returned to pick up our key from the front desk there was quite a wait. There was a large party checking in (about 15 people) and the staff was a bit frazzled. I tried to sneak in by the side, but ended up waiting about 20 minutes since the agent was unable to locate my key. Not a big deal, just had a cup of coffee and visited with my husband until the crowd was taken care of.We were just a 5 minute walk to the river, and strolled along the waterfront both nights. Lovely stay! It's a budget hotel that definitely offers a better-than-budget experience.Cheers,D

<Content>No Complaints from us Just got back from a 10 night stay in Frankfurt (1/27/08-/2/06/08). The staff was friendly and spoke English very well. We looked forward to breakfast every morning and enjoyed the snacks and warm beverages in the lobby. The internet room was a great perk as we checked our e-mail every couple days. The drinks in the mini-bar were another nice perk (O.J./ Beer/ Pepsi/Water). We used Frankfurt as a base for several day trips (Basel, Strausbourg, Wiesbaden, Cologne) so the location right across the street from the south entrance to the Hauptbahnhof was ideal. About 10-15 minute walk to the Main, Romerburg, the Ziel, Stadel etc. We will stay at the Excelsior again.

<Content>Well located hotel The hotel is situated right outside the Frankfurt main train station making it really easy to get around Frankfurt. No complaints about the location of the hotel and the free access to internet. However, the rooms are pretty average. A bit tired looking but clean nevertherless. They also offer free drinks from the mini bar in the room. Just be careful as we had one half opened bottle of pepsi in our mini bar upon our arrival. Not exactly a sign of hygiene. The lifts in the hotel are also very limited. There is only one and you have to wait ages for it. Breakfast is not fantastic either but it was a free buffet. They also offer free tea/coffee and cakes througout the day in the lobby as well.

<Content>Clean, free minibar, great breakfast Spent a short night before catching flight back to the States. Staff welcoming, in a German kind of way. Free minibar was a surprise but only contained 2 waters, 2 beers and 2 sodas. Room was clean and, as noted in other reviews, conveniently located right across from the Central train station.Breakfast was robust and multi-cultural -- had smoked salmon, udon soup and local favorites and it was included in the very reasonably price of the room.Definitely recommend this though I didn't have time to explore around the location --- others would know more about that.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location for Xmas Market! We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in December, while we were in Frankfurt for the Christmas Market. The staff are polite and helpful, and all speak fluent English. Our room was very clean, the bed was enormous and the heating was perfect. The room was certainly not very big but we didn't feel we needed a bigger room. The minibar was free(beer,water,Orange juice...), which was a nice touch. The bathroom was so clean and looked almost brand new. We also had a balcony with a nice view on the train station and the city...The hotel is opposite the central train station and is about a 10-15 mins walk to the historical centre of Frankfurt (Romer) and the shopping area. I felt safe walking to and from the hotel all day and in the evening too. The location is also great as most buses, trams and trains pass through the station area....We also enjoyed the free internet in the business lounge, there are a few computers and connections to laptops there....So overall - a great hotel!

<Content>Great value and location Stayed 3 nights at Hotel Excelsior to visit the Christmas market in Frankfurt. Would definitely recommend this hotel. The rooms are fine - basic, but clean. The position is really handy - directly across the road form the main Station. It is an easy 15 minute walk to the City Centre, or 5 minutes to the banks of the river. Some reviewers have commented on the nearby red light district, but it was not a problem - walking straight into the city centre, you miss the dodgy area by a couple of blocks.Excellent buffet breakfast - hot and cold food - endless coffee. Free minibar in room (with 2 bottles beer, plus various soft drinks). Free computer and Internet access on ground floor. Staff friendly and helpful. Great value for money

<Content>Best cost benefit in Frankfurt The Hotel is center located, just a few steps from the south exit of Frankfurt Main railway Station (Hauptbahnhof).The rooms are not that big, but pretty clean, with cable TV, free minibar and a good wardrobe.If you plan to stay in Frankfurt, near the city and in a good place, this is the right place. I paid around 65,00 EURO per day, including nice breakfast.

<Content>O, those fluffy comforters! Stay at the Excelsior if you want good value for your dollar. You'll get: free internet; coffee and tea always available; big, fluffy towels; fresh, white linens with a thick comforter; a small, very clean, well-appointed room; desk clerks who sort of speak English; tiny elevators; a breakfast buffet for all tastes; and a great location near the train station within walking distance of the river, museums, and the Romerberg. Booking through [--] will make it even more of a bargain.

<Content>Perfectly Okay We stayed at the Hotel Excelsior for the first night of our European holiday and it was just as we expected - convenient for our train trip the next morning, clean enough, comfortable beds and good breakfast. If you expect any frills whatsoever, you will be disappointed. The free mini bar would have been great, except ours was not refrigerated and after a 16 hour journey, there is nothing worse that a warm beer, even if it is free. But there are plenty of places to buy a cold beer at the train station across the street or anywhere within walking distance in Frankfurt. We had a good dinner at a Biergarten nearby and enjoyed walking off our jetlag to Romer Square and some of the other interesting sights. We enjoyed our night in Frankfurt and it was a good jumping off spot for our two weeks in Germany. This hotel is a good choice if you are looking for value and convenience.

<Content>Terrible Behaviour, good breakfast The hotel as such was good with a very good breakfast. I stayed here along with a friend for more than 20 days and the behaviour of the guys at the reception was terrible. As an instance, I went to ask him about reservation and he said We will talk tomorrow morning, Thanks you without even looking at me. The rooms are small and there is no place to move but I guess it is ok for the price. Connectivity from the hotel to all important places is good as it is right in front of the main station.

<Content>Fair price Great breakfast I found this hotel had all it claimed to have during a recent stay with my wife  2 grown up daughters. We took 2 rooms [1 double  1 twin] both fronted the street giving us a view of the main railway station. The girls room was a good size with a small baloncy  an even smaller bathroom. Our room was off the fire stairwell with no balcony but a large bathroom. Both rooms were clean  the beds comfy. Only on the 2 second floor so it was quicker to take stairs as elevator slow. mini bar IS free  is refilled in the morning. The breakfast is very good with a wide choice of cold stuff  some hot bacon  eggs. Plenty of fresh friut. Free use of internet is a bit of a bonus  the staff are a least friendly.

<Content>Hotel Excelsior - Frankfurt, Germany Very fairly priced hotel locted right across from the Main train station. From there, easy to get to airport and just about anywhere you're likely to go. About 10 computers in a room just off the main lobby with free internet access. Great free breakfast and free mini-bar in room for soda, water, juice, and beer (2 of each). Not glamorous at all but much more than acceptable. Would definitely stay there again. Very accomodating front desk - allowed me to stay first day, leave and return for third day of planned 3 night stay. Traveled to another city for 2nd night and appreciated not having to pay for 2 hotels for that night!

<Content>Awesome value, great location We stayed here for four nights in June. The hotel itself is nothing fancy but well worth the money. When we were there, the mini bar was free. The mini bar included two bottles of Pepsi, two bottles of sparkling water, a big bottle of water and two bottles of beer. Internet was free via the business centre in the lobby. There were about 6 computers in total in the business centre. Local phone calls were free. There's a free ironing service (didn't manage to try this one out). Everything you would expect to find in a hotel room were present except for a safe. There are plenty of television channels but only 2-3 were English (CNN, MTV, BBC). Only thing I wasn't too happy about the room was the lack of air conditioning. In summer, it tends to get a bit warm but they do provide a fan. Location wise, the hotel is right next to the train station which puts it 2-3 minutes away from the metro station. Being the main train station, nearly every line (U-Bahn, S-Bahn, national and international rail services) passes through this station. All the main tourist attractions are about 1-3 stations away by metro and possibly 20 minutes by foot.

<Content>Great value for money Right outside the main railway station with large sign inside the station so you know exactly which exit to take (south). Very clean (but small) rooms, free minibar (ie 2 beers, 2 fruitjuices, 2 soft drinks, and water), free internet, free breakfast (really excellent) and within walking distance of some museums, the river, the old city, although you have to walk through one fairly sleezy street.

<Content>Great location, clean room w/small bathroom, terrific breakfast... My husband and I stayed here for two nights at the beginning of our Germany trip. We made the reservation from a european travel website where we were able to pay after our stay. We were not sure about the hotel for there were mixed reviews from other customers yet we were quite pleased apon arrival. The location could not have been more perfect. Right across the street from the main train station, Hauptbahnhof. Yes, at night, there are a few sketchy folks hanging around yet if you keep to yourself and use your common sense, you shouldn't run into a bad situation. The hotel staff was very professional and we were able to get all of our tourist questions answered. Free computer usage available to customers and there were snacks available in the lobby throughout the day. The breakfast, included in the price, was excellent. What a way to start the day! Seems like several patrons mentioned the main elevator and how slow it is. This is true. Just use the second, smaller elevator, by the entrance to the breakfast eating area. The room was nice and clean. We had a room on the third floor facing the backside of the property. The bathroom was small yet it suited us just fine. Only complaint about the bathroom, the shower drain was slow. The room did not have air conditioning yet a floor fan was in the room and we utilized it at night. Yes, free mini bar. We drank pretty much all of the contents in the frig and the next day, when the room was cleaned, the mini bar was refilled. We would stay here again for you cannot beat the price, location and all of the amenities. We walked everywhere and the hotel is only a five minute walk to the river or to the center of town.

<Content>Just so so PROS: The hotel is offered at a great price and is located just a bit west of the city center near the train station. The mini bar is free (though it is not refilled after you take something out). The food in the morning is also very good. You can walk from your hotel to nearly all points of interest. CONS: We were set up on the first floor with a room facing the train station. This turned out to be very very noisy so ask for a room on the back side of the hotel. Also, they have a bit of an air circulation problem as we had to ask for a fan to get the air moving and get comfortable. The rooms are a tad cramped and a little run down, but again, it is offered at a very low price.

<Content>Great value The hotel is in a very convenient location - across the road from the main train station with taxi stand just outside . Parking isn't an issue as there is a large open-space car park beside the station. The hotel has a self-park underground garage that it shares with another hotel. The hotel garage is rather small and tight.The reception was warm and very efficient. Staff at the front desk spoke excellent English. Guests had free use of internet at the business centre (24*7). For those with their own laptops, there were LAN cables available. There were sufficient terminals and we did not have to queue.We requested a quiet room and got one facing inside and did not find it noisy with the windows opened. The room was spacious and clean. The amenity in the bathroom was adequate.A wide range of food was on offer at the buffet breakfast (including Japanese miso and rice) and it was very filling. The free mini-bar was also appreciated, especially arriving on a hot day!We paid EUR58 for a night. Although the website and the reception said there would be a fee for parking but this was waived. We were not sure if this was waived because it was a Sunday and the garage was not full, but we were certainly delighted by this gesture.This was one of the best value accommodation we had in Germany - definitely recommend it!

<Content>great location and value This hotel is located literally right across from the main train station. It's about a 10 minute walk to the main tourist area of Frankfurt.The hotel has lots of little extras, like free internet use and printing in the business center; free coffee, tea, and biscuits all day in the lobby lounge; and free items in the minibar (2 sparkling waters, 1 large still water, 2 beers, 2 Pepsis, 2 orange juices, replenished each day).The rooms are not by any means luxurious, but they are adequate. I had a single room and it's the smallest hotel room I've ever been in, narrow and with a single bed. I had two companions who had a double room and their room was bigger and nicer. The bathroom is small but adequate and they provide soap, shampoo, and shower gel. They also provide a washcloth, which in my experience is lacking at many European hotels.As someone mentioned below, the main elevator gets a lot of use and you may have to wait a while for it. It is also quite small. However, there is another elevator around the corner that I think some people never noticed and it always came faster.The breakfast buffet is quite large and runs till 11. The staff at the desk were friendly and we got a good restaurant recommendation from them.

<Content>Do NOT Give them your credit card info!!!! I booked a room for June via the Internet, and the charges were to take place only upon my stay. Well they've already charged my credit card and no longer have my reservstion! I contacted the hotel and they say I cancelled and therefore charged me full rate. This is a total lie and my attempts to rectify this with them is falling on deaf ears. My cc company says they cannot dispute online hotel bookings, because they have no way of knowing the terms. PLEASE BEWARE. This hotel thieves foreign tourists!

<Content>Pretty bleak Okay, the price is great and there are good inclusions: minibar, internet connection in the lobby, breakfast...but if you're on your own be prepared to go back to the days of the single bed!Mattress too soft, only 1 pillow, small comforter, tiny washbasin with no space to store your toiletries, doubtful carpet. Try the amazing physics experimentation in the shower when static (I guess) combined with the draft induced by the shower make the (too short) curtain stick to your body. You'll get your 'front' freed only to have your 'back' stuck to immediately by said shower curtain! General atmosphere of the hotel is bleak, room decoration inexistant. You'd think you were in East Germany in the 50s.You'll get to know the emergency stairway because the elevator capacity is so small and slow that you end up using that and whoever chose the paint for that part of the building really had a bad 'stair' day. Next time I'll spend the extra euro and choose something better, and there is no lack of small, nice hotels around the Messe fair grounds.

<Content>Great Value and Great Location This hotel is in a great location - particularly if you only have a short time to spend in Frankfurt. It is opposite the main train station, and just on the edge of the CBD. Hotel itself is clean, modest and is very good value for money considering its central location. It serves a very good breakfast, and there is a free mini bar as well.

<Content>Not What We Expected My husband and I decided to take a weekend away to Frankfurt.So we booked this hotel.Upon arriving it was impossible to park outside the hotel.The website did say they had parking ,this parking is underground and you have to get them to open the main door up to park the car.As there was no parking directly outside the hotel to be able to ask them where their parking was we had to park in the main car park near the train station and that cost.Once inside the hotel we noticed an awful smoke smell .The girl at the desk was not very helpful at all.The lift to the rooms is tiny and very very slow.They give you a very strange key to open the room with.Once in the room ,we knew we did not like it ,it smelt awful of smoke,the mini bar they say they have is not what we thought either.I asumed like in other hotels it would be small bottles of spirits ,its not its a couple bottles of coke and water.The beds are very soft ,only two English speaking channels unless you pay for a movie which was very expensive.Tried calling down to the front desk never got through.The room is a good size ,and bathroom ok.There where times there never seemed to be hot water.If you want a quiet stay this is not the right hotel for you ,it was very loud at times,we could hear others in their room.The rest of the hotel is a bit run down.The breakfast they serve is great .The location is good ,right across from the train station,we did have the red light district also ,not a very safe area we thought.And if you have a big car then good luck with parking in this hotel,they charge you 11 Euros a day.

<Content>Basic, but cheap hotel I stayed at this hotel 16th - 18th March. The room was basic, but very clean. The free mini bar is a nice bonus, but make sure you remove all the contents before the maid cleans your room - she will only replace what has been used. I think security could be tightened up. The key to your room is quite large so many people handed them in to reception when they left the hotel for the day - but no I.D was requested when you asked for the key back. Breakfast was OK - not a huge choice, but the area to eat it in was well presented. Be aware that there is not much nightlife in this district. There is an O'Reilly's Irish bar and not a lot else. On a budget, I would stay here again.

<Content>great stay All the reviews I had read before we went to frankfurt were true. The hotel is fantastic the room was huge (compared to other hotels we've stayed in around europe) the bed was so comfortable and massive too, staff are great, breakfast great, loads of towels and clean sheets. We stayed for four nights and would definitely go back. We felt very safe in the area and there is a great Irish bar across the street.

<Content>Cheap you pay, cheap you get I totally agree with the previous review.As a couple, we had booked a room with a king size bed, and what did we get? A tiny room with two single beds. I do not know if anything else was available as we did not complain, but when we saw the endless corridors of this hotel, we should have thought better than to stay in this tiny place.Nevermind, as we were only going to be there at nights and werein a Christmas mood (which the hot wine helped further) we coped with it.I agree that breakfast was excellent, plenty to choose from, sausages, eggs, hams, cheeses, marmelade, chocolate, cakes, honey... and so made for breakfast and lunch.The location is good if you plan to arrive or leave by train, and also opposite the bus stop to come from Hahn airport (where Ryanair flies and which is about 1,5 hours from Frankfurt city). Now to go to the city centre, you will have to walk through a nightly part of the city, so I would recommend you to walk along the river if you have children.

<Content>Value for money This hotel was great, as it was located directly opposite the main railway station which were caught directly from the airport. We paid only $100.00 per night which included a full buffet breakfast which was the heartiest we had on our 6 week adventure between USA and Europe. Free coffee and refreshments were provided free to guests in lobby throughout the day and free internet also added great value, especially for business travellers. Free mini bar also.Unfortunately thats where the fun stopped. The rooms were so small, the smallest on our whole journey. In fact it was a lot smaller the the cruise ship cabin we booked, a lot smaller. I have never in my life seen a room so small, it was ridiculous. The staff at the desk were not very accommodating and although there were bigger rooms available chose to release the smaller rooms first. Bad move. If its value you want and not comfort then this is your hotel but dont go there and expect nice rooms.

<Content>Great value, variable service, dinner in sister hotel (Monopol) next door awful Stayed here for a couple of nights to go to Christmas markets- fantastic value, great breakfast, nice clean room. They offer free tea and cakes all day which is great, though they always seemed to have run out of one or both, or had no cups whenever we turned up! Most of the staff (apart from one) very friendly, helpful and responsive. Went for dinner on Saturday evening to their sister hotel next door, the Monopol, which I have to say was one of the worst meals I have ever had, served by an extremely surly waiter who never once cracked a smile. The food (a risotto) was cold and looked (and tasted) like it had been microwaved from a packet as some of the bits of vegetable were still hard... Only warning you about this as they advertise this restaurant in the lifts of the Excelsior and the menu looks quite nice so you might think it's an easy option - don't do it! Loads of nice places to eat out with better food, cheaper prices, better service and more atmosphere!

<Content>Great I have to agree completely with all of the other reviews of this hotel - it can't be beaten for value for money and would recommend it highly.Location - excellent - great links via train, tram and bus to all other areas of the city. Slight downside of the fact it is so central is traffic noise. We were in room 109 with a balcony facing directly onto the train station and it was difficult to sleep at times.Rooms - very comfortable and reasonably sized. Decor and furnishings were a bit dated and the layout of the bathroom was odd but all you need for a short stay. Very clean. The free mini-bar is good.Food - nice selection of food at breakfast. The breakfast room was always busy but never so bad that you couldn't find a table. Afternoon coffee and cakes seemed to disappear quite quickly! If you fancy a cake buy one from the train station opposite. The hotel must put out a limited number as there were never any cakes or clean coffee cups left past 3pm.Staff - extremely friendly and helpful.Overall a great hotel!

<Content>Breakfast rocks! Based on other Tripadvisor reviews, we stayed for four nights at Hotel Excelsior. Right across from the train station, it's centrally located (10 minutes to get to most tourist sites, and the tram stop is right in front). Staff was friendly and accomodated our 6:30 check-in. The free minibar (two each of beer, oj, sparkling water and Pepsi, with a large still water bottle) was wonderful, as was the breakfast buffet (huge selection of pastries, cereals, yogurts, meats, cheeses - more than we could eat). The only downside was that our room (with a balcony overlooking the train station) was a little bit noisy - didn't bother my boyfriend, but I was fine sleeping with earplugs. The room was spotless, and we were very comfortable walking around the area at night. This hotel is one of the best bargains I've found in Europe!

<Content>Thanks for the recommendation As advertised--out the south door of the station and cross the street. Typical small single European room. Nice staff. Nice minibar, free local phone, and Internet access. Left before breakfast. Only cons--shower small so curtain keeps touching you while trying to get clean; TV takes up half the desk; no peephole or chain on inside of door; elevator slow. Stuffy with window closed and heat on minimum; with room in rear no substantial street noise, but did hear sirens, horns, etc. Still, a good buy.

<Content>Great Location, Great Facilities, Great Price My husband and I stayed in room 511 at the Hotel Excelsior in Frankfurt on 30 September 2006.We arrived to the city by train to Haufbahnof. The hotel is across the road from the right hand exit (looking from inside the station upon arrival), no more than 5 minutes walk from your platform. The location was extremely convenient especially as we left for Prague by train at 6.30am the following morning! The hotel was about 10 minutes walk to the main shopping area in Frankfurt and about 30 minutes walk to some of the more touristy areas of Frankfurt.The owners accommodated an early check in (7.00am) and an early check out.Keys had to be handed in upon exit from the hotel. A lift was available.The hotel room was comfortably appointed with a double bed and bar fridge the contents of which were complimentary (water soft drink and beer). The ensuite was appointed with a toilet sink and shower. Complimentary soaps and shampoo were provided.Downstairs in the lobby the hotel provided free cake, water, juice tea and coffee. Complimentary internet access was also provided.Overall this was a very clean, convenient and very importantly economical place to stay. We recommend it to anyone considering staying in Frankfurt and commuting elsewhere.

<Content>Gotta love the freebies I was looking for a hotel for our family's three night stay in Frankfurt. Reading the other reviews posted here by previous guests, I figured to give the Excelsior a try. I'm glad we did. The location is very convenient, directly across from Frankfurt's main train station and subway lines. There is also a taxi stand in front of the hotel. Finding something to eat on a budget is easy to do in this area too. There are lots of food vendors inside the train station, ranging from McDonalds and Burger King to sandwiches and doner kebabs. I reserved a triple room and was upgraded to a four-bed bedroom instead. There was a double bed for the wife and I and a bunk bed for my two little boys. The rooms were a little small but for E81 (including taxes), it was a deal. My room faced the trainstation and street, but the traffic noise was not bothersome. My best part of this hotel was the freebies. The drinks in the minibar (2 beers, 2 Pepsis, 1 large water, 2 waters with gas and 2 orange juices) are free and restocked daily. Free telephone calls within Germany, which I used a lot to call Ramstein Air Base. The free breakfast downstairs has a good variety of foods to choose from: breads, cereals, yogurts, fruits, scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, even rice. The hotel also advertises a free laundering and pressing of an article of clothing but I never used it. During the day, the lobby serves cakes and tea/coffee for its guests, for free too.The front desk is a very busy one here, yet the front desk staff maintained friendly and jovial attitudes. They were very helpful.I am glad I read the other postings about this hotel from other posters because it's all true. For the location, price, and, of course, the freebies, this hotel can't be compared.

<Content>Excellent Hotel I stayed in the Excelsior for one night last month.I wholeheartedly agree with all the positive comments about this hotel.The reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful.Don't forget that all domestic phone calls are free which was useful for us because Lufthansa had lost our luggage and I spent quite a lot of time telephoning their lost baggage department.I wondered whether it would be noisy (since it is close to the station) but no problem at all in this respect.The rooms were perfectly adequate-don't forget that this is a 3 star hotel.The whole stay was a positive experience and if I ever go to Frankfurt again I would not hestitate to use the Excelsior.I paid 70 euros a room through the internet.However when I was in reception I overheard thre staff on the telephone confirmig a price of 60 euros so I think it is better to book direct

<Content>Spot-on for Weekend stay We wanted to visit Frankfurt and Heidelberg by rail so booked this hotel as it's directly across the road from the south train station entrance (turn right as you come off the platform and keep going). Clean, well-appointed with friendly, efficient staff. Ideal location to start a walking tour of the town or head off elsewhere for a day trip on the train (good weekend deals from DB). Taxi rank bang outside the front door. If unlike me you can't afford to eat out every night, in the station there's a plethora of fast food outlets on both levels and a wee supermarket that sells wine. Of course you've got coke, juice, seltzer and beer in your free minibar restocked every day. Then look forward to the profligate breakfast buffet, open till 11 a.m. Free internet too. Loved our stay, bathroom a bit cramped though.

<Content>Does the job ! A perfect place to crash whilst in transit through Frankfurt . This Hotel is clean, cheap, ideally situated next to the Central train station and staffed by friendly and professional people who do their jobs very well. It isn't exactly a Hilton / Sheraton but in so many ways is so much better ! A honest budget Hotel that will almost certainly exceed your expectations.

<Content>Not bad at all Walking from the ryanair busstop in the city centre ( after a long commute from Frankfurt Hahn airport), hotel excelsior was one of the first hotels that caught our eye...and we stayed there for our whole trip. The twin room was small, although extremely cheap-35 euro each per night. We were on the seventh floor overlooking frankfurt city and had exceptional views. Situated across from the main train station and a taxi rank just outside the door and a short walk to the shopping areas, it was an excellent place for budget travellers looking for somewhere to lay their heads after a long night in the city. The room was very clean, the service was excellent (although there is a [----]concierge who will offer any willing female company for the evening) and the mini bar was very handy...and free. the hotel provided us fans for our room free of charge. There is also a free breakfast and internet access all day, along with teas and coffees and other such treats. All in all we had a wonderful stay..and for just over 100 euros for a 3 night break, who could complain???

<Content>Great inexpensive hotel Taking the advise of other Tripadvisor travellers, we spent the last night of our German vacation at the Excelsior. The location was really convenient, right across the street from the train station. (a rather interesting part of town, not for everyone). The hotel was clean, the staff was super friendly. The room was large by european standards. As promised, the mini bar was free and stocked with beer, water, juice, and Pepsi. The beds were clean and comfortable. Our timing was not great, there was a heat wave, so we had the windows open, and it was the night of the final game of the World Cup, so the horns were honking in jubilation all night. But the hotel was great. The very best part was the free breakfast the next morning. The buffet was huge, everything you could possibly want...really! I would absolutely recommend it for anyone with an early flight out of FRA. The S-Bahn takes you right over to the airport. ( I think the group fare was 13 Euros)

<Content>A very good hotel for the price. My wife and I stayed at The Excesior Hotel for 6 nights this past May 2006. We booked a superior double room and it was well worth it. Very comfortasble bed and duvay. The bathroom was spacious and clean. The buffet breakfast was outstanding and varied. A free mini bar contributed to the ambiance. Reception staff spoke English well and were most courteous and helpful. The hotel is very conveniently located,just across the street from the very busy Frankfurt main rail station.The Excelsior Hotel was a surprisingly good hotel for the price. Should we have the occasion to visit Frankfurt again, we would for sure stay again at this fine hotel.

<Content>Terrific Value The Excelsior isn't fancy but has a lot going for it. It is accross the street from the main train station in Frankfurt and has great breakfasts. The staff was pleasant and gave us a break by letting us into our room well before check-in. The rooms were clean and the price was affordable.

<Content>Great services Hotel  rooms were very clean and easy to get to-- it's directly opposite the south exit of Frankfurt main station. The staff were lovely, spoke coherent english and provided me (free of charge) with a current edition of a magazine that they thought i would be interested in. There was a problem with the lifts on one of the days i stayed there, but by 6pm that day it was in full working order. Huge breakfast, with lots to choose from. Free internet  printing services a huge bonus. Only problem encountered was the door entry system, defintely a unique system. A clean hotel with the essential services, nothing fancy -- no grand lobby, bar or restaurant. Perfect for people who want a convienent, acessible  comfortable hotel.

<Content>Great value centrally located hotel I recently stayed at the Excelsior while on a short three day city break in Frankfurt. The hotel was ideally located within easy access to everything, especially the main station and the airport. The hotel itself was clean, comfortable and surprisingly quiet. My room was a little on the small side, but that really was not a big deal. Breakfast was excellent and set me up nicely each day for my sightseeing. The staff were courteous, efficient and well switched on. The free extras included were fantastic, Free minibar, internet, newspapers, telephone, laundry service and afternoon refreshments in the lobby. In all of my travels, and my many years of experience working in the hotel industry it is certainly as good a value as I have come across. It is easy to understand the popularity of this hotel. If ever I revisit this beautiful German city I will most definetly stay at the Excelsior

<Content>Good Location We stayed in the Hotel Excelsior for 3 nights last weekend, it is located opposite the train station and a 2 min walk from where the bus drops you off if travelling from (hann airport). The staff at reception were very polite with good english, the free tea  coffee etc in the lobby was a nice touch. we stayed in rm 617 to the front of the hotel with a balcony, the room was quiet, clean, confortable beds  warm, hot water any time of the day. The free mini bar was stocked daily, 2 beers, 2 juice,1 large still water  2 sparkling water.The buffet breakfast was excellent, great choice even for vegetarians like myself. This hotel was great value and would recommend to anyone visiting Frankfurt. The Irish Bar (O'Reilly's) across the road serve good pub grub,friendly staff and Karaoke on Sat nights late closing.... This time of the year its quiet around and very cold hat and gloves a must...

Great value with free internet, free mini-bar, free local German calls and free refreshments. Great service upon check in and also at the fully inclusive delicious buffet breakfast. Room was quiet and simple, with very small bathroom but perfectly okay for a couple of nights. Thoroughly recommend as good value, great location hotel.

<Content>Had a nice stay Me, my husband and my 5 year old daughter stayed in this hotel mid December for two nights. Good value for money. We walked about 25 minutes through town to get to the Christmas market (which is an absulote must in December) . We stayed in 9 different hotels in Europe in our 4 week stay and this was the only time that we did not make use of the public transport as the hotel is so centrally located. The free coffee and cakes throughout the day was much welcomed after walking in the cold. The rooms are not luxurious but very clean, we found it a bit small compared to some of the other hotels we stayed in even though we were upgraded to a 4 sleeper upon our arrival. This, by the way was done for free. The rooms also have a tiny balcony which is quite nice to get out for a bit of fresh air. Across the road at the Hauptbahnhof (the central station) there are many places to grab a decent something to eat at very reasonable prices.

<Content>The Secret Is Out...Grrrr I travel to Frankfurt on business often. The Excelsior was my special find--clean but plain rooms at a great price, with free breakfast, free mini-bar, and a free Internet center. No place for a romantic weekend, mind you, but just fine for a weary traveller who wants to sleep. Its only real problem is the dorky electronic room keys--just about every first time guest has trouble with them. With the high rating for the hotel shown by Trip Advisor, I fear I will no longer be able to book rooms at the hotel on the spur of the moment. Too bad! The hotel gets some Asian tour groups travelling on budget packages. That the Japanese will stay at the hotel is a good sign for me. A dirty hotel and Japanese travellers generally do not mix.

<Content>Excellent Location and Value Stayed here two nights at the end of a 12 day tour of Germany. Arrived at the rail station and found that the hotel is literally across the street from the south exit. The room was great, free minibar, a huge breakfast buffet, which they share with their adjoing hotel next door (Hotel Monopol, which is a bit higher in price) in a large room right between the two hotels. The rate was very reasonable (best rate was online).

<Content>Superb Hotel Date: December 2005Reviewer: Scottish CoupleWe have just spent a week in Franfurt, staying at the Excelsior Hotel. We got an excellent rate for our 5 day break. We arrived from Hahn Airport at 0130 hrs and found the hotel 2 minutes walk from the airport bus arrival point. Very large choice in the Breakfast Buffet, and the free mini bar with beer and soft drinks excellent. Free tea and coffee and cakes all day in the foyer. Room was clean and comfortable. Hotel was opposite main station and buses and trams stop outside. The Christmas market in Frankfurt made our stay absolutely great.

<Content>Free Mini Bar, Yes it's true Well I guess you get what you pay for. It is very convenient to the train station, It is walking distance into town, there are a number of trams that you can take if you do not want to walk or there are always tons of cabs sitting outside if you fancy a splurge.The hotel does have a free mini bar. There is 1 bottle of still mineral water, 2 fizzy mineral water, 2 orange juice, and 2 beers.The bathroom is what let's down the whole experience. They suck!!! The tiles are very tired shall we say and there is no water pressure and the shower head would not stay up above shoulder height.Breakfast does have a large selection, but rice and noodles not top of my pick.But the service at reception and the breakfast staff was very friendly and helpful. So overall I give it OK but not for a long visit.

<Content>Great Location We stayed one night, at the end of our vacation, and found this Hotel to be excellent value. We arrived by Eurail, and the Hotel is right across the street. Which made it very convenient to take the train out to the Airport the next morning. We spent the afternoon walking through the quaint older section of town, and back along the shopping area. The Hotel staff were very helpful, the mini bar was free, and huge buffet breakfast was included. Our room was modern and extremely clean and comfortable. What a find. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Very convenient, great value! Frankfurt is not the easiest city to get around in, especially if you have never been there before. So I was very happy to have stayed at Hotel Excelsior. It is literally across the street from the Hauptbahnhof which is where all the train lines intersect. There is just no way you can not find your way back to the hotel. OK, so the hotel itself is no Four Seasons, but it is clean and efficient. Mini bar is free and they provide free internet, and printing in the business centre. I did not use the phone but apparenty you can even call long distance for free too. That's enough free addional services than most hotels would give and it was very convenient for me as a business traveller. All in all I think the value for money was excellent, 69 euros per night in central Frankfurt with all those amenities. I don't think you can do better than that. Yes, the bathroom is ridiculously tiny and no body lotion is provided, but if you know what type of hotel you're going to before you get there and you are prepared for something non fancy, this is a very good choice.
