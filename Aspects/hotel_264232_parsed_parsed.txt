<Content>Great Place, Great Time Off to a good start from the excellent directions to the hostel. We were booked into our room before check in time. The check in and out times are great, noon check out and 1pm check in. Our train didn't leave on our last night until 10:45pm and we were allowed to leave our luggage in a safe room so we could explore the city and return to use the internet until we were ready to leave for our train. The rooms are clean, safe, colorful and have everything you need from internet, bathtubs, refrigerators to blaconies that over look the streets. Some may say it's too loud or noisy, but that's an unfair review. The staff make sure to provide a comfortable and quiet hostel with double sliding glass doors and thick walls, and anywhere you stay in Madrid that is central city located, you're bound to hear the bass and boom from the clubs till 5am anyways. The closeness to the clubs, bars, shops and attractions as well as the unique setup and feel of this hostel provides enough comfort and exhaustion to drown all that out and sleep comfortably.

<Content>Really loved this hostel Really loved this hostel. Location is great. Staff are excellent and place spotlessly clean. Very comforatable and perfect for a city break. Free internet access a bonus. We stayed in sister hostel that has no lift and 69 stairs. Perfect for young and healthy but not so good for slightly older.

<Content>Feels like home.... Just returned from a 6 night stay at Hostal Adriano. The staff was very helpful, the room was spotlessly clean, with a silent airconditioner. The room was immaculately cleaned and towels and sheets changed. The tiny bathroom did not bother me at all. It was clean, plenty of hot water and shampoo and soap supplied. The area around the hostal is full of shops, fashion chains and very good nightlife.The hostal is easily accessed by metro, but surely would recommend Aerocity to and from the airport. I would surely recommend this hostal to my friends.

<Content>Good place, tiny bathroom! This was a great place to stay for a few nights, was very clean and tidy, our room had a tiny balcony which was really just an aircon unit but you could at least open the door to the outside.We had twin beds, not sure if that was because they didn't have any doubles left or we just messed up our booking, didn't bother to ask.The bathroom in our room was very small and i can imagine if you were on the larger side you might have difficulty getting in and out!Staff were very helpful and friendly and this was easy to get to from the tube station.

<Content>Cute room and excellent location Loved this hotel! Well kept, beautifully furnished room, with ensuite (albeit TINY bathroom!)Right in the middle of Madrid, with lots of tapas bars, restaurants, and places to get a drink. Very handy to wander out of the hostal at night and choose between heaps of places to eat and drink in a popular part of Madrid. Felt like a very safe area, lots of people strolling around going from bar to bar. Room was quiet too, though our room looked onto the street.Great location in the centre of Madrid, a very short walk to Sol metro station means its in a very convenient area for access all attractions, as well as other transport options and the airport. Atocha regional train station is just down the line - where you can catch the train all around Spain, very handy!All in all - a well priced, convenient hotel!

<Content>Great place for a short stay in Madrid Great hostal in a central location, right next to all the tapas bars, restaurants, and cafes. All the rooms are individually decorated (and IKEA furniture). The room was very clean and tidy. The staff all spoke excelent English and always on hand and helpful. Again like the other reviews find it hard to understand the negative reviews; it's a good hostal and you get value for money.The rooms are quite large, and like most hostals, a small but tidy bathroom. The lift was working well and the hostal has the bonus of being on the top floor so you have a great view over the rooftops, right over to the Plaza Major and beyond. The street does have a few prostitutes hanging about but so does half of Madrid it seems. Don't let that put you off, as the tapas and bars are great. Plus points: The hostal is 100 yards from the Medina Mayrit arabic baths which is must for any visit to the area. Downside: the walls do seem a bit thin so some noise at night is possible. The background noise of Madrid does seem to drown it out though. All in all a good short stay.

<Content>Excellent Hostal  Hostal Adriano/Adria has an excellent location - basically in the heart of Madrid. Very well decorated rooms with little balconies to let in some fresh air (or smoke). A lot of space, blowdryers, safes in room, refrigerator in room, and plenty of soap/shampoo. Noise wasn't a problem for us and the staff was typical stiff Spanish professionalism. I was impressed with the rooms given the great location and low cost - definitely a treasure we found and can't wait to stay there again!

<Content>Not bad for the price I stayed at this hostal, and it was average but decent for the price. A clean room and good prices worked fine for me. The beds were comfortable, and a safe was available for use. It did get noisy at night, but it did not bother me. It was located close to the subway stop and quite convenient actually. If you are looking for a clean room, a bed and a bathroom for low prices, then this is the place. The rooms are quite small. My only suggestion would be that if you do plan to leave your luggage here after check-out, let them know a day in advance. I did tell them the first day I got there, but apparently I was supposed to tell them the night before. After an argument with the front desk, the guy finally allowed us to leave our luggage in another room. Other than that, not a bad place. However, I wouldn't stay there again - I would probably find a better place.

<Content>Still Gorgeous but a bit noisy I stayed here last year and loved it for all the same reasons as on this website - the rooms are sunny, colourful and extremely welcoming and the location and price are perfect. I still found it gorgeous this time but a bit noisier than I remember. I think that I must have had the air con on last year to drown out the noise. It was pretty noisy until 3.30am but if you麓ve had plenty to drink or the air con on then you won麓t notice it. Please do try and go to the medina mayrit morrocan baths which are nearby which are fantastic.

<Content>Loved it! This place is so quaint! Each of the rooms are decorated in a certain theme/color - my room was done in a red/peach/yellow and was just so welcoming when I stepped in. The show is large by European standard and actually has a tub! The staff is friendly (I woke them up at 8AM to drop off my luggage since my overnight train had arrived at 7AM and they were completely unruffled) and speaks fluent English. Plus, the hotel is located in a central, safe location (5 min walk from Sol metro stop). The only minus is that my room had a window facing the street and I could hear the nightlife until the early hours of the morning. Overall, it's a great hotel for a great price!

<Content>Excellent,central and cheap hostal We are two 70+ year old travellers who stayed here for a week in November. The hostal is on the fourth floor but has an efficient lift and the building has good security. Our room was very clean and bright,warm and en suite. Although it looked out onto the street, it was not noisy at night. Breakfast was available in a restaurant about 10 yards from the front door of the building. The staff on reception were pleasant and helpful and spoke English.It is very centrally located and we were able to walk comfortably to most of the major attractions including the Prado. A short 300-400 yard walk takes you into the Puerto del Sol which has great connections to the excellent underground system.[Be sure to buy books of 10 tickets at a time] There is a wide selection of tapas bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hostal.We thought it was an excellent place to stay if you do not want the facilities, bar etc of an expensive hotel and are active tourists who do not want to stay in your hotel for most of the day. We find it hard to understand the really negative report which appearsand feel it must be about some other hostal!

<Content>ok, but not all that Stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of my visit to Spain. The room was small, but ok. Had 2 twin beds, small desk, and a wooden straight backed chair. There was a tv, but I dont think it had any english channels. The walls are a bit thin, you can hear noise between the rooms.I took the airporter service from the airport to the hotel, and it was a good thing, I dont think I woudl have found it otherwise. This hotel is located on the top floor of a converted apartment building. There is a small elevator which was working fine for our visit. The stairs are very uneven and often dark. Be careful if you take them.The check in process was quite easy, Staff at the desk speak english and were friendly. Check out was also easy. The staff were not very available between the two processes. We booked for room over the Internet, and they were quick to get back to us.We found we had to run the airconditioning all night or it was much too hot, did not leave the windows open as we were facing a very busy and noisy street. The a/c works very well, almost too well, we were freezing as the beds only have one thin sheet on them. Made use of the fridge for bottled water, and it was good to have the room safe. Decor is all from Ikea as stated by other reviewers. The bathroom in our room was not as tiny as some have said, there was a tub/shower combo, sink and toilet. Enough room to move, but not enough for a party. I did not see any bugs, and it appeared to be clean. This hotel is in a good location, but there are litterally dozens of hotels in the area. It is about a 10 minute walk to the three museums, and just a couple of min's to Sol. There are lots of bars, restraunts, clubs, etc in the area. We paid 60 euro's a night for this hotel, it was ok, but I would not stay here again, I would try something else in the area.

<Content>Bring your sleeping bag and bug spray We were looking for an inexpensive, yet nice place to stay for the 2 nights we were spending in Madrid. We had read all the great reviews of the hotel and the pictures looked great as well. We arrived, extremely confused, to see that there were several other hostals operating out of the same building. We tried entering the building, but the prostitute blocking the door, who wouldn't budge made it a bit difficult to get past with our suitcases. We pushed past and proceded upstairs and had to ring the bell to get in. The guys operating the place are super friendly and speak great English. Our room was small, we could hardly fit in the bathroom, I had to sit sideways on the toilet seat. The beds had one thin sheet for a cover, we had to run the a/c at night because if we opened the window, the street noise was too loud, so I shivered all night. The curtain on the window was so sheer that the entire night, the light from the window of the next building was illuminating the room. Furthermore, when we got up in the middle of the night to use the toilet, turned on the light and little cockroaches scurried everywhere. We were outta there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Content>Keep away Having read all the fantastic reviews of this place I decided to give it a go, especially after seeing the hostal`s website photos.I have never been more disappointed with a place.Having walked up the steep hill from Sol metro station in 40 degrees heat with our luggage we had to walk past several prostitutes who use the entrance to the hotel as a pick up place.We then discovered that the hostal is on the 4th floor and the lift seemed decidedly dodgy.However we finally entered the hostal and tried to check in - a process which took at least 30 minutes(in the soaring heat - no air con in the lobby).The room seemed at first to be clean but very very basic.However after 10 minutes I saw several large termites on the floor(and on bed). There was a foul smell of sewage in the bathroom - we had to keep the door closed at all times.We decided to stay only because we had travelled all day to get there and we had paid in advance.Madrid is generally a hot, dirty,overpriced city - not typical of the rest of Spain.We cancelled the rest of our stay and found a room in a 4 star hotel(with free cava) for the same price - just off Gran Via! In short - don`t bother with this place.It`s rubbish and you can get luxury rooms(including breakfast) for the same price without trying too hard.Don`t be fooled by the other reviews.

<Content>Great Location  The location was great, right in the heart of the action. Easy to get to the metro as it is just around the corner. Loads of tapas bars and restaurants w/n minutes of the front door.The rooms were very clean and modern. The room had A/C and a ceiling fan so no worries about the heat. The fridge in the room was great for water, fresh cheese, meat and fruit.Bathroom was extremely small, but its the European way.Highly recommend this place.

<Content>Fine for budget traveler Hostal Adriano is in an excellent, central location within walking distance of many attractions and very close to Madrid's main hub for transportation. It is also inexpensive by Madrid standards. We stayed for 3 nights in July. The hostal reception were friendly and spoke English well. The rooms are quite small and loudly decorated, with an extremely small and also loudly decorated bathroom (compared to 3 other hotels in other areas of Spain). It was relatively clean, but the glasses in the bathroom were dirty (with sand!?). The bed did not have a top sheet, only a duvet cover (without a comforter in it). Additionally, you are required to turn off the air conditioning (which did work well by the way) when you leave the room or you will be charged extra per day. We felt safe at the hotel, though it is in a busy street, you have a key to the outer door, a key to the hostal, and a key to your room.

<Content>Fantastic Experience! Lovely little place to stay. This hostal has tons of character. Our room was smallish (but comfortable for my sister and I since we weren't there to stay in our room), full of IKEA furniture, and was equipped with a TV and electronic safe. Don't come here expecting perfection or you might be disappointed. If you are looking for a clean, safe, friendly and excellently located place to stay - book it!

<Content>Fairly good We stayed 4 nights at Adriano Hostel. The staff are very helpful and well-versed in English.However, in average, rooms are tiny as far as i understood and provided that this hostal was basically 3 or4 appartments transformed into hotel rooms. The rate is fairly reasonable, no breakfast or lunch facilities, this is logic as the hotel is located among a hub of madrid popular tetaurants and lively bars. In general, i recommend this hotel for sigles and couples but not for families.

<Content>Great place to stay We were a group of friends and stayed here for 4 nights. The room is clean, has a tv and phone, the bathroom is clean, tiny but the shower has a small tub which is glass enclosed and the water pressure is great. If you have a laptop there is a free internet connection which was really nice. The staff is very helpful and welcoming. I would definately recomend staying here.

<Content>Fantastic Hostal I visited Madrid with my husband and his parents, who were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary. We booked directly with the Hostal and Alberto, who speaks wonderful English, responded to my queries immediately. We had stayed in the Hostal Tijcal on a previous visit, so knew the fantastic location of the Hostal Adriano. The rooms were lovely, all of which are different, and spotlessly clean. The bathroom is a little small, but still manages to fit in a small bath with a shower (just a tip, shampoo is not provided, but soap is). We will definitely stay there on our next visit to Madrid.

<Content>Yes, it's excellent We stayed from 16-20 april, in room 112 (alias room # 7 on their webpage, the black-and-white one) and payed 63 euros per night for a perfectly clean room with shower and bath, TV, fridge, air conditioning and windows that did prevent most of this city's immense noise from getting in. Staff was friendly at check-in and check-out, and somewhat invisible during the rest of our stay. We did get fresh towels more than once (yet not on a daily basis, the details remained unclear to us). The elevator was working (even it did not appear to us to be reassuring). Our friend from Madrid once came to pick us up at the hostal and also said he would definitely recommend it to other visitors.It is centrally located, yes, but the nearest cafes, bars and restaurants all seem to welcome mostly tourists. If you head out for something more madrileno, you should not walk down to the Puerta del Sol, but instead walk uphill to the Plaza de Santa Ana and the Calle del Prado, where there is a great variety of places to eat and drink.

<Content>Perfect location for seeing Madrid We paid 63 euro a night to stay at this hostal. I did not request a particular room, so unfortunately, we got the one room I didn't think I would want. It was room 517 at the very end of the hall, with one tiny little window. My parents got the black and white one, 512, which was actually a little bigger than it looked in the pictures. They had a much bigger window. The one advantage to our room was that we did not hear any street noise. This being an older building, however, we could hear our next door neighbors a little and a strange dripping (?) sound at night. It didn't bother me, and my husband just put in earplugs to sleep. The only other complaint we had was one of the pillows was very lumpy. It was not a down pillow like the rest of the others. In any case, I am still glad we stayed at Hostal Adriano because it was the perfect place from which to see all the sights. If you don't mind walking, you can walk to all the sites in Madrid. If you'd rather take the metro, the Sol is the nearest metro stop, and everything is within about 4 stops from there. There are many restaurants and bars within walking distance of the hostal, and plenty of shopping around Puerta del Sol, including El Corte Ingles, which is a department store, book store, supermarket, etc. I highly recommend staying at Hostal Adriano. The elevator works now, so getting up to the 4th floor should not be a problem. If for some reason you have to take the stairs, be careful, as the steps are not evenly spaced, and the stairway can be dark. Another bit of advice - when trying to find the hostal, look up! The signs for the hostal are at the very top of the building.

<Content>Stylish Hotel I stayed one night at the Hostal Adriano, it isn't a hostal that most backpackers would use with dorm room style accomodations. It's a quaint little hotel with stlye and lots of color. They were very helpful in trying to direct my friend and I to nearby locations that we were trying to find(even those they weren't familiar with) All in all a nice place clean place to stay at a great price(63 euros a night). There was great shopping just around the corner, lots of cute fashionable and young stores at a good price!If you like to stay a place that's not very generic and hospitalesque at a good price. STAY HERE! they'll even store your luggage after check out(definately a plus)The nearest metro was near plaza del sol, it's around the corner and down the street...about 10mins walking

<Content>Fantastic place to stay! Excellent location and lovely, clean rooms. There is a lift now. The rooms are excellent value for money and the windows are double glazed, so no problem with noise at night. Would highly recommend.

<Content>clean and tastefully decorated hostal If you want a change from the standard brown and dark 80s style hostals in Madrid, this is the place for you! I know the city quite well as I lived there for some time and know how difficult it is to find reasonable accomodation for a good price. So, recently I went back with my girlfriend and we stayed at Adriano for 4 nights. The rooms are small (as in most places in the city centre) but absolutely spotless. Each one has a different decor and colour theme and the athmosphere is very welcoming. The staff are very helpful, and even though the location is close to Chueca and Sol, the noise level is lower than in many other places I've stayed. Each room has air condition, tv and wifi. There is a young and positive air about the place and we would both FULLY recommend it.

<Content>Superb place to stay We stayed here for 4 nights. We had a great room with flat screen TV, big fridge and a comfortable bed. It is on the fourth floor and the lift is now working! The area is rammed full of bars and places to eat. Being on the 4th floor is important since it can get very noisy at night in Madrid if you are near bars and clubs. Great stay.

<Content>Perfect for us This is a lovely hostal. (A Spanish hostal is a small, family-owned hotel, not to be confused with a hostel). We booked a double room for three nights at 58 EUR, taxes included. I had read great reviews at the Madridman website, and was not disappointed. It's in the Puerta del Sol area, close to a metro station, and in the middle of everything. The room was smallish, but very clean, with new everything, and tastefully decorated. The tiny bathroom had all new fixtures, including a tub, and was super clean, as the rest of the room. No alarm clock provided, but we found out that the TV has both a clock and an alarm feature! The window/small balcony facing the street had new double sliding glass doors that closed tightly, so we had no street noise problem. This place is highly recommended. The building has an elevator, and many tapas bars/restaurants on the same street. (Best places for a drink or bite are those full of locals.)

<Content>Excellent hostel The hostal is in an very central location in a lively, old, crowded and also somewhat dark and chaotic part of Madrid. Once you're inside, it's a different world: it's light, airy, quiet and modern. The rooms have air conditioning, fridge and even wifi, but no elevator (not that I'd use the it anyway). The place is great value for money and very much recommend.

<Content>Nice, clean, central I have spent 4 nights in this hostal (from 3 to 7 August 2005)As already described in the previous reviews, the hostal is very nicely decorated, very clean and central.The hostal is located in a nice area, full of restaurants, bars and shops. Rooms are equipped with double (=2) windows, so you will not hear anything from the noisy nearby streets.My room was Room 115 (room 10 in the website); it was exactly as you can see it in the hostal website, but for bed covers (mine were white with thin blue and light blue stripes, very nice)The bathroom was very small, but, again, very clean and nicely decorated (orange color). The lift was there, but it was still out of order.
