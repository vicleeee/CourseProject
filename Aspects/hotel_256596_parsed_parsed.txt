<Content>Watch your bill! As per the other reviews the location is great, the apartments are big but a little tired but perfectly acceptable. The roof top pool, spa, sauna and fitness room are great too. So what lets this place down is the administration. There were three of us in the queue checking out and all of us had a dispute on our bills of some form or another. Unsure what the first person was disputing but the person in front of me had been charged for mini bar items not consumed. They tried to charge me for breakfast that was included in my room rate. However, in both cases the dispute was settled quickly by recepetion without arguement. However I have now noticed an extra charge on my visa card, I called the hotel and they said it was for mini bar, and I definately did not consume any other items other than the one I paid for on departure, they said they would call back but 5 days later still waiting guys! Now I have to go through the process of disputing the transaction through visa.Pro'sLocation, pool  spa on the roof top. Size of the apartments.Con'sRooms a little tired, undergoround parking a bit of a hassle, beds a bit firm, THEY CAN'T GET THEIR CHARGES RIGHT AND DONT FOLLOW UP ON COMPLAINTS!I would have given Above average if they had bothered to follow up on my complaint about their bogus mini bar charges.

<Content>Beautiful apartment, incredible view! We spent five nights in a 2 bedroom harbour view apartment. The apartment was spacious and the view was simply incredible. We were there with children, so we really enjoyed the location. It is just a short walk over the bridge to the aquarium and the ferries to circular quay. The monorail is right outside the hotel and the harbourside mall below the hotel has tons of great restaurants overlooking the harbour. The Mercure is also adjacent to an Ibis and Novotel hotel. As they are all considered part of the same property you could charge meals to your room from the other hotel restaurants.We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back. It was hard to leave!

<Content>Terrible service, a big dissapointment WE booked this hotel through a travel agent as a special treat for ourselves and were expecting a five star luxury hotel. We booked the hotel three months ahead and so I was expecting to be given one of the best rooms. When we arrived we were shown to a room right by the elevator and a room with very little harbour view. When I asked for another room we were told none would be available till the morning, and we would have to repack in the morning. We were staying for seven days and had bought groceries as the apartment had a full kitchen. This meant repacking all the groceries from the fridge and our bags which we did, having been told we would be moved during the day. We arrived back that evening to be told we had not been moved and would have to wait another day. We had wasted a part of our morning packing up for nothing and still weren't able to fully unpack. The next morning I spoke to the third person and found nothing had ever been logged. We were told we would be moved to a Harbour View room and had been given the most basic room because that was what our travel agent had booked. The next day the fourth manager again said there was no note on our file to mention any of these previous conversations and we would not be moved. So we finally got to properly unpack and stop wasting precious time and had to make do with our original room. During our stay I requested a newspaper three different times before we got one. All bar one of the staff were offhand and not at all helpful. We had spent the first two nights of our trip to Sydney at the Marriot Hyde Park, where the staff were friendly gave us maps, directions and found transport routes for us. In comparison the staff at the Mercure did nothing and gave the impression you were interrupting them. On top of all this the rooms were not clean. There were nuts from a previous guest on the floor and the benches were dirty. Overall an extremely disappointing experience. Having to wait four days before fully unpacking based on promises from several different managers only then to remain in our original room. We were also told as the accommodation was prepaid there was nothing they could do. Obviously it doesn't pay to prepay or book in advance.

<Content>Lacking in Service and Cleanliness We stayed here for 7 nights during May 2008. Initially we thought the apartment was large and spacious in a good location. We soon discovered that the apartment was dirty and wasn't serviced properly (the only thing the room attendant did was remove the rubbish bin!). The management here are totally useless and unhelpful. I reported the problems to the Duty Manager and he told that it would be brought up at the next management meeting (there's customer service for you!). Needless to say no improvement during our stay (and the manager continues to work there attending to other poor customers). The swimming pool lights were not switched on after dark. Again I reported this to 'management' without any action being taken. There was a minor accident with a child in this pool which had no lights on. This apartment is certainly not worth the money, find somewhere else with better service and cleanliness. We will definitely not be returning or recommending this any friends/relatives.

<Content>Location! Location! Location! Arrived approx 14.00 hours, for a one week stay. Reception area full of people and cases. Room not going to be available until 15.00 which was the official check-in time. Left the luggage, and went for some lunch. Returned approx 15.30 and received the keys. The 2 bed apt was spacious, with en-suite shower, and a separate bathroom with washing machine  tumble dryer, large lounge, kitchen, balcony with table  chairs, good air conditioning system. The apts were clean and serviced daily. The only things we were missing was the view of Darling Harbour / Cockle Bay and a room safe. It would certainly have been nice to have the Darling Harbour view, as it is wonderful setting whether it鈥檚 day or night, however you do get excellent views from the rooftop swimming pool and sun bathing area, and I suppose it is some compensation to have the afternoon /evening sunshine to enjoy on the Pyrmont side of the building.In regard to securing valuables, you can obtain a safe deposit box for free from Reception, which is worked on the dual key principle.Sydney is a fantastic city, and from these apts you can do so much on foot, and have good access to almost everything the city has to offer. The sights, the various transport systems, an abundance of restaurants, shops, supermarkets all situated just down below the Apts. The mono-rail station can be accessed from floor 2 of the building. The nearest jetty for the public ferry is Pyrmont, situated at the rear of the Maritime Musuem. The ferry will take you to Circular Quay, and from there you can get another ferry to Manly Beach, which is a very pleasant 30 min sail, and of course you get wonderful views and photos of the Sydney Bridge and Opera House, for the price of a modest 鈥榙ay tripper鈥?fare.For Bondi Beach head across Pyrmont footbridge, (alternatively take the Monorail to City Centre) walk up Market St, to Elizabeth St. Cross over and the bus stop for the No 380 is there at Hyde Park. Regular schedule and $3 for the journey which takes approx 40 mins. We did all the usual sightseeing things, but I would just mention a great day trip to the Blue Mountains. If you can check the weather forecast and have time available to select a clear sunny day then you will definitely be impressed with the sights. I had initially intended to go independently, taking the train to Katoomba and then using the hop on bus. However, I am very glad that I changed my mind and went with AAT Kings. We purchased the tickets from their office on the quayside at Darling Harbour just in front of the Aquarium. I would recommend the trip. The driver (Brad, I think) was excellent, informative, and organised, and he kept the air con running at all the stops, so that you could sit in comfort if you returned early to the bus. While we were having lunch he got our tickets for the Skywalk, Train, and the Cable Car, so we had no queuing or wasted time. Returning to Sydney he let us off at the Olympic Village and we had a cruise down the Parramatta River and into Circular Quay. An excellent time efficient day with great photo opportunities and all done with ease and in comfort.  If you need more than a hotel room for your Sydney stay, then I would certainly recommend the Grand Mercure Apts.

<Content>At least its got a balcony! We stayed here for five nights in January. The location is good for first timers in Sydney, close to a ferry stop and I would imagine if you have kids excellent, as its close to lots of attractions.The accommodations is ok, but could really do with updating, its all a bit old and drab. However, the apartments do have a balcony and great views over Darling Harbour.The reception staff aren't that helpful and seem to get stressed if more than two people turn up at a time.Overall its ok, wouldn't really recommend, stay near the Rocks or Surrey Hills instead.

<Content>Disappointing At first sight everything here seems quite nice - great location (if you like Darling Harbour), pleasant reception area, spacious and fairly nicely decorated apartment with good facilities and amenities. However there were quite a few negatives for us.....The service was very hit and miss (a lot more miss). Some of the staff were helpful but there just didn't seem enough of them. Friends trying to contact us by phone said the phone was never answered, and calls from our room to reception met with a jammed switchboard. Our lift floorkey swipe didn't work on several occasions (this seemed fairly universal, we definitely weren't the only ones) and we were left to take care of our luggage on arrival and departure. There was usually a queue if you wanted reception face to face, so overall pretty frustrating.The shower looked great, but leaked so much the floor was soaked and needed several nice clean towels to mop up. I then wondered if it was supposed to be a wetroom as surely that amount of water outside the shower wasn't normal, and the response from reception was that the showers were designed badly and that's just how they are. Management was aware of the issue but until the hotel was renovated there's nothing they can do. Hmmm. Bear that in mind if you book this hotel, or at least ask for a less leaky shower.The website specifies DVD or VCR in each room. I requested a DVD room, but got VCR. We had young kids and had brought only DVD's with us, so requested a DVD player which was promptly brought up. Now this was definitely a new one for us.... their DVD players do not play English DVD's, yes that's right. They only play zone 4 (if you've ever bothered to look English ones are zone 2). They are aware of this, and despite having lots of English guests they continue to buy cheap zone 4 only DVD players. We managed to play our DVD's in other Sydney hotels, but despite them bringing us 3 players, none were successful. Annoying.At the end of the day I think we got what we paid for and the hotel was reasonably priced. I wouldn't not recommend it, just don't expect 5 star service. Unfortunately we didn't particularly like Darling Harbour, a bit plastic, a could have been anywhere type place, but it was very lively and always packed so obviously a popular spot

<Content>Handy for Darling Harbour but disappointing accomodation Having stayed at the Meriton Bondi Junction apartments on our first stay in Sydney we were looking forward to our second stay in the Mercure Grand Apartments.... we were disappointed.The location on Darling Harbour is very handy (but personally we would never stay on Darling Harbour again as it is a taxi/ferry/bus ride to Circle Harbour and you feel slightly out of it)The rooms were well used, slightly dark and shabby. The kitchen was not well equipped (we had a two bed apartment and were given 3 forks, 2 teaspoons and 1 pan - and other crockery was mismatched and a couple of bits cracked). Would guess they were under-staffed as it took 24 hours - and a number of phone calls - to get additional equipment. Some staff were great but others were disinterested.We had a Pyreton view which is over the city (not Darling Harbour) - no view as such but for us the afternoon and evening sun on the balcony was great.For families with young children be aware that there small steps (about 1) inbetween rooms - for adults a few nasty stubbed toes, for youngsters a trip hazard.The pool, gym and sun bathing area were lovely with great views and pool towels were provided which was a nice touch.

<Content>Old and decrepid Service was appalling, towels taken and not replaced, pay for view movies didn't work, tried to charge xtra $74 for cot bed for 2 yo child, 2 of 4 elevators working only, thus 15 minute wait for lifts, whole place looks old and in need of major upgrade, staff lied to us regarding room charges then accused us of lying, booked several rooms and they resold one to someone else when it wasn't ready at 3 pm and we came back at 8 pm to find it resold. An awful experience.

<Content>Spacious - will always come here Get a room takes on a new meaning here. Smack bang in the middle of Darling Harbour, this is a great HQ for holidays or conventions. It certainly was a great HQ for us while in Sydney for a convention.The price is reasonable and our two bedroom apartment overlooking the Darling Harbour side was spectacular - the deck outside the room provided a nice way to relax with a view of the city and a cold drink.On a previous visit we had a bridge view which is OK but try an insist on a Darling Harbour side room...also, beware the resident chefs in other apartments who cook up a storm of curries and other delights - you'll be high tailing it to the supermarket for supplies to compete or racing to the restaurants! - ventilation could have been better really.All facilites are well maintained, the Internet reasonably priced (although very slow at times) and all eateries and entertainment a mere walk or Mono-Rail journey away (the latter leaves from level 1 near the the hotel).The staff are excellent and the only negative I could garner was that the lobby was a little dark but hey! how often are you in the lobby!

<Content>Spacious, qulaity and location What a nice place, well located, nice appartment with some views and some surpises. My 71 year old mother was visiting from UK, so we booked into an appartment where we could have some privacy and still explore the city.The visit started badly when the exasperated reception advised that rooms were not ready at 3pm. We later discovered some families had been waiting 3+ hours for their room and this was an on-going issue throughout our stay. Apparently there is a staff shortage and so room preparation and cleaning is late, rushed and unreliable. However having got into our appartment in only 15--20 minutes we were luckier than most. One day the cleaner arrived late to service our appartment and was in and out in about 10 minutes. While we're not dirty visitors, this seemed less than even a cursory clean. If they keep this up the place will start to look grubby.The car park /elevator arrangement is also strange and a bit complicated for the novice. The reception has to issue you with an electronic key, which activates the roller doors in the adjacent car park at the lowest levels (1  2). It also is required to activate the elevator everytime, even if people are already in the elevator, unless of course they've already selected your destination floor.I overheard one guy requesting additional electronic keys as they only had one for a family of 5, which seems a bit of an oversight from the reception on check-in, but maybe demonstrates how stressed they were with the room availabilty situation. One elevator seems to be permanently reserved for top floor permanent residents, so everyone else has to wait longer for the 3 other elevators, which at times got overcrowded.The views from the gym and pool area on the roof are exceptional, even better at night. The views from harbour facing rooms are better than the others, so request this at the time of booking. The hotel seemed to have guests made up of mostly young groups or young families who went out evenings to the local city nightlife.The appartment itself is well catered, with a full kitchen, diswasher, microwave, stove, crockery, cutlery etc.. the fridge leaked at one time and it took 12 hours for the cleaners to mop up the mess, after several calls, but that goes back to the staff shortage issue.The lounge was very spacious for 2, maybe only adequate for 5+, with tv and stereo. The bedrooms were nice, clean and spacious. Each had either an ensuite or the use of the main bathroom. A laundry is located in an alcove that can be shut off in the main bathroom, with washer and dryer.The only other issue was the location is very noisy at night, constant cars, trucks, clanging of bins, street noise and revellers. It didn't keep us awake on the 7th floor, but would not impress light sleepers and the water takes a good 5-7 minutes to come through hot first thing in the morning.The rooms were nice, clean and well appointed overall and the staff although friendly were stretched beyond the norm. There are no restaurant facilities, but plenty just locally in Darling Harbour or next door in Ibis or Novotel. The Sydney one-way system around Darling Harbour makes it quite complicated to enter or exit where you want to be, but after a day or 2 you get the hang of it.

<Content>Fantastic. Lovely apartment, great staff, great location We stayed here in December 2006 and had a great time. the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. We had a 2 bed apartment (being a family with 2 young children). The aprtment was clean,well equipped and spacious. We used the kitchen a couple of times for meals and breakfasts and it had everything we needed.There was a very large group of young men arrived on our second day and I had visions of being kept awake all night, but the rooms were remarkably well sound proofed and we heard nothing at all. We had a Pyrmont view which could have been better but it wasn't a problem.The pool was lovely and the views spectacular.Location is amazing. Darling Harbour is buzzing and the array of retaurants there is amazing. it is also very easy to either walk or take public transport to the rest of the city - it is easy to walk most places in Sydney - it isn't that big really.I would definitely recommend it.

<Content>Great Location, Price and Decent Rooms We stayed for one night in the 02 bdrm Pyrmont View Room (ok the view wasnt as glam as what the Darling Harbour View would have been but it was still nice to have the freedom to overlook Pyrmont harbour and parts of the city from your balcony).Nice decent rooms (yes there is wear and tear which is not really an issue).Check in-out was fast, easy and efficient (we used their carpark) and the staff were friendly. Views from the Pool/Gym are fab.Cant fault this place - ive stayed and paid more for worse in the city. Location is great - close to everything.I would definitely come back here again.

<Content>Great position As the previous review says this property is beginning to look a little tired around the edges A freshen upof the paint and proper cleaning of the Shower grouting is really all that is required.It is very conveniently placed for lots of restaurants, shops, ferries etc.Taxi drivers do not seem to know where it is ( But then they also do not know where the Sydney Harbour Bridge is ! So what does that tell you !! )Found staff to be very helpful, we were originally put in a 2nd floor harbour view room but we had very little view of the harbour as it was obscured by the Maritime Museum, I asked for a higher floor and this was agreed immediately. We were then on the 8th floor and had fabulous views over Darling Harbour.Would definately reccomend this hotel to anyone.An added bonus was the free wireless internet access we discovered as we were right next to the Ibis Hotel, where this is included. Wired Broadband is available in the apartments but at a cost !! Think the management should make free wireless available in the apartments as a whole, not only if you happen to be in close proximity to the Ibis next door.

<Content>great location I am in agreement that these apartments are a bit 'tired' but there is plenty of space and the location is wonderful. I didn't speak to the staff a lot but happened to mention that it was my birthday, A bottle of champagne and chocolates were left in the apartment with a card!We were upgraded to a two bed-room apartment, not facing darling harbour, but nice and quiet with views down to the maritime museum.The washing machine and drier in the bathroom were very handy and the kitchen was very well equipped (not that we did any cooking with the choice of restaurants nearby!)I was very impressed by the security system, you can only access your own floor, and the roof top pool is lovely with fantastic views.

<Content>Great Location, Nice Apartment Great location right on Darling Harbor with easy access to downtown Sydney attractions. Great views and the pool on the top floor was a big hit with the kids. Our 2 BR suite was very well furnished and clean. No problem cooking meals in the kitchen and eating in the dining area. Staff was very helpful and efficient. It was expensive but then even the hotel rooms in downtown Sydney seemed expensive. Ideal for families who want more space than a hotel room and can afford it.

<Content>fantastic location Only stayed for one night but the location is so great that we would be happy to return and stay longer. We paid $298AU through Accor website. Thought this was pretty good value for a 2 bedroom apartment. Full size kitchen, two bathrooms, great pool for the kids. Decor a little worn but furniture like new. Very happy to recommend.

<Content>Great views harbourside but rooms a bit tired - super location Part of the Accor group this hotel boasts superb views if staying in a harbouside apartment  great location being No.1 Darling Harbour - everything is within easy walking distance.Always enjoyed our stays here but has become very expensive lately  seems to cater for the weekend party animals more  more - gets very busy at weekends  waiting for lifts is a nightmare.Rooms badly in need of a makeover now.We will be staying there again if the prices are right

<Content>Good location, badly maintained rooms, terrible staff Fantastic location right in Darling Harbour. Close to fantastic places to eat, aquarium and IMAX. Beautiful views from the room, however staff were rude and obnoxious. They had no understanding of what customer service ment. Worst hotel experience in a very long time if not ever. The rooms were badly maintained and stained.

<Content>Can't Beat the Location, Location, Location We stayed for four nights from Easter Sunday. We are a family of five with three young children aged 9,6 and 4. Arrived early, but receptionist located an available room for us. Staff were very friendly and helpful.Pros:Location is the biggest plus about this hotel; it has a monorail station at the front door which takes you to many of the attractions including city centre, Powerhouse Museum, Aquarium. Hotel is at Darling Harbour; our 2 bed appt had great views of city and Darling Harbour.Water Taxis located outside Hotel or a short walk to Ferry stop. We used the Ferry to have a trip across Sydney Harbour to Luna Park.Plenty of food options and convenience stores right near Hotel; all restaurants were welcoming of kids - some even pulled out the colouring pencils and sheets before the menus were offered!!Only a $10 taxi fare to Circular Quay if you are in a hurry. We did this to catch the Ferry to Taronga Zoo.Cons:Rooms a little tired and carpets in need of a good clean.Room only had a VCR!! no DVD player - kids bought plenty of DVD's to watch.Bathrooms dimly lit.Beds too hard for our liking.SummaryWould highly recommend this Hotel if you are travelling with a family. Hotel is located right next door to the Maritime Museum. Darling Harbour has many attractions - so many that we ran out of time and on the last day literally ran from the Maritime Museum to the Hotel to get our bags, jump in a taxi to the airport to board our flight.

<Content>Great Apartment July 2004We spent a week in a 2 bedroomed apartment in May. We had excellent views over Darling Harbour. The standard of the apartment and the accommodation was excellent. The kitchen was the best equipped rented kitchen we had ever experienced. The staff were very helpful and the parking facilities and security was very good. The pool, spa and gym were good too with great views over Sydney. Good value for money, we would definitely stay there again. PS London

<Content>Location, location, location! What a location...straight out of the door onto Darling Harbour! Sydney Boat Show was on during our visit so we were spoilt!Apartment was very comfortable but the bedrooms were a little cramped.. Good maid service and every facility. One or two bulbs not working but nothing serious. Fairly bland inoffensive decor! We didn't have a harbour view, but it didn't matter, as the balcony was still a little suntrap! Easy walking distance from George Street shops and short bus trip to Coles supermarket, again on George Street. You could walk back but the bags of shopping might make it a drag. Secure underground parking and easy access to the A40/A4 out to Homebush, Blue Mountains etc.

<Content>Loved Grand Mercure Apartments Would certainly recommend these Apartments to stay. Great family place, fantastic location, really good size room with quality furnishings and fittings.All the Staff were really friendly and helpful in organising tours etc. Just walk outside and hop on Monorail which is terrific.Children loved the roof top pool and spa. Would certainly stay there again and have already given verbal reference to friends who are going to Sydney for week-ends.

<Content>WOW Unbeatable views from the huge private balcony, enough spac inside to host a party, trendy decor with marble kitchen and bathrooms, the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on, fantastic central location, great pool, spa and gym, and has every convenience you'd expect from a top hotel. Couldn't be improved if they tried! If you're a tourist looking for a place to relax looking over the most beautiful part of Sydney, or a local couple looking for a romantic getaway, go the Mercure!
