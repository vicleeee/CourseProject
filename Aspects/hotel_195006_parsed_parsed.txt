<Content>LOVED the Hotel Lungarno My husband and I spent 5 days in Florence and 5 in Rome for our honeymoon and I really belabored over picking some good hotels. I studied in Florence, so the pressure was on. I struck gold with the Hotel Lungarno. It was fantastic. The location is PERFECT. The room was a great room - had a balcony and view of the Boboli Gardens and the Uffizi. They upgraded us for free. It was a great boutique hotel that had the personal feel that I was looking for. The lounge area overlooking the Arno was a great place to relax at the end of the day and get a few glasses of wine before heading out for dinner. I loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Perfection We absolutely loved our stay at the Hotel Lungarno. It's in a great neighborhood with several excellent restaurants just across the street (Mamma Gina's and our favorite, Camillo). It is also just across the Ponte Vecchio from the busy part of the city, so it feels wonderful to get away from the crowds while still being an easy walk to everything. Now, as to the hotel, the room was lovely, the linens and bed perfection, the staff incredible and the location on the Arno is so gorgeous. We found this to be the best place we stayed in Italy and after we left, we talked about wanting to be back in our comfy, luxurious bed at the Lungarno. The only drawback is that breakfast is not included but there is an espresso bar just down the street by the Ponte Vecchio so it's easy to get a bite to eat first thing in the morning. But don't miss sitting outside at a table on the Arno and enjoy a glass of wine at sunset. Beautiful!

<Content>Loved the Hotel Lungarno My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during our honeymoon. The hotel (and Florence, in general) were fantastic.We booked through the American Express Fine Hotels program and were upgraded to an amazing room with a private balcony overlooking the Arno and Ponte Vecchio. The staff was incredible accommodating, throwing in a free breakfast the morning we arrived, providing complimentary champagne and making our stay a delightful experience.i would recommend this hotel to anyone -- great location, room, view and staff!!

<Content>Perfect Location, Perfect Service, Perfect View This hotel matches perfectly with a stay in Florence. A 5 minute walk to the best spots, yet on a quiet street. Staff is very helpful and will take care of any need. Put in a wake-up request and coffee shows up at the door. Breakfast is great and very relaxing. Doesn't have the feel of a hotel, more like someone's home. The staff took every single hassle out of renting a car, shipping packages home and making reservations. We had two rooms and love Hotel Lungarno!

<Content>Love the Hotel, hit or miss with the staff What a view! This is a gorgeous boutique hotel located just a couple of blocks from Ponte Vecchio. The hotel is just charming but the staff ... hit or miss ... some of the staff members where as charming as you would expect from one of the Fine Hotels and Resorts booked through American Express Platinum but some others would make you feel like they were doing you a favor by letting you stay there ...they would not even look at you when giving you a reply ... I can only describe my experience as having a great meal with a really bad waiter ... however, I would actually stay there again ... the hotel is just so charming and we got a really nice upgrade for booking with Amex

<Content>Not too much more you could want There really isn't too much missing at the Hotel Lungarno. The number one quality is the location. I spent a semester abroad at Florence and had the fortune to live four door down from this hotel. I can honestly say there is not a better location in the city. You are mere footsteps from the Ponte Vecchio, and once you cross you are on the main road in Florence with will take you to the Piazza Signoria and the Duomo. Also, by being on the other side of the river you have the best views, a bit more quiet and definitely more authentic and value-oriented restaurants and shops. In terms of the actual hotel: breakfast is delicious, offering you a good spread of cheeses, meats, poached pears/apples, breads, eggls, etc. Also you have the availability to order a la carte too. In general, the Borgo San Jacopo, the hotel restaurant is very good and high end, but I'd recommend you leave the hotel for more traditional, rustic fare.For those that are clausterphobic, a word of caution, the elevators are terrible. They are very tiny, one of them can only fit two people max! However, the hotel staff, the river views and pretty much everything else more than compensate.It is a pricey hotel, if you have the opportunity to, book with Amex as we did and were upgraded to a junior suite with breakfast included. All in all, I think for the price point, the location and boutique feel is vastly superior to some of hte other hotels in its price range.On the other hand, it's Florence, so pretty much anywhere you go won't end up being too bad!

<Content>Simply the best! We were booked into the Lungarno for a 9 night stay as part of a private - 4 couple - tour. Given the location and the great views we saw on the web site we did not expect much from this hotel. When our driver from Rome had difficulty finding it, we were sure it would be a so-so hotel as many are in tourist areas. We could have not been more pleased with what we then found. This hotel is simply marvelous and is a hidden jewel in Tuscany. In the future we will stop in Florence just to stay in this hotel. Despite the fact that we travel for about three months of the year to many countries, this is the first hotel we have written a review for. They are simply great.The room was good sized and had great storage with everything well thought out. The attention to detail was obvious. The river right outside the window and the view of the Ponte Vecchio was great also.Food service was great both in the room and in the restaurant (which is a jewel). Breakfast was very cozy and almost like eating in a private home.The lounge/bar and its especially helpful staff was an unexpected draw and became the last stop of the day and was often where we had a light dinner as well. It was both welcoming and yet provided a sense of privacy to each group - something that is not usually the case. There are not many hotels one can stay in for 9 days and still wish they were staying longer. This is one.We will go back.

<Content>A Beautiful View of the arno River With a million euro view overlooking the Arno River the Hotel Lungarno is a not to be missed Boutique Hotel in Florence.With approximately 80 rooms the hotel has the charm of a small hotel but with the big hotel amenities....such as breakfast dining included.......a nice lounge for cocktails.......a small outside area to have a drink overlooking the arno river.Just footsteps from Ponte Vecchio and just a brisk walk to Duomo it is a hotel that is within walking distance to shopping and some very fine dining (where the locals eat)you can spend your day roaming the streets of Florence or take the local train to Pisa (about 45 minutes) and enjoy that wonderful leaning tower.We journeyed on to Lucca from Pisa but it was not worth the time or effort........skip Lucca ........go to Sienna instead.........Taking the local train back to Florence (Trenitalia) I suggest you do it before dark..the riders become a little dicey after the sun goes down.....you can get all your tickets at Santa Novella train Station but be sure you validate your tickets on the platform.........Ask the hotel they can explain it to you...........The euro being up and the dollar being so down it is hard to find any great bargins..........we did a lot of window shopping....as did most other tourists we noticed.........Driving anywhere in Italy is not recomended as it is like watching a race with cars going in all different directions........anyway it is safe to walk in the city ...........lots of great pictures to be taken so be sure to stock up on memory cards.

<Content>Great location, wondeful staff... dignified atmosphere Having arrived at the Hotel Lungarno very upset that BA had lost our luggage AGAIN!!! my wife a family friend and I could not have been looked after better. The Staff were VERY helpful, even upgrading our rooms to spectacular river views. They told us where we could quickly get stocked up with all the things BA had lost.The breakfast is excellent with all the usual buffet items, what was a very nice surprise was the 'cooked' Breakfast... great bacon and sausages with Fresh Scrambled eggs.FREE Internet connection in every room and use of laptops if you need them.We had a wonderful stay and will DEFINITELY return.

<Content>Best Boutique Property in Florence From the very start, The Ferragamo group鈥檚 Hotel Lungarno ranked immediately among the best hotels I have visited in Europe. Its location along the river and subsequently stunning views of the Arno, the Ponte Vecchio and points beyond might have been in itself enough to vaunt it to the top of my list, but the food, service and quality of the rooms were just as impressive. The building itself melds perfectly amidst its neighbors along the south bank of the Arno and the semi-private entrance provides a welcome sense of exclusivity. The public areas on the ground floor are bright, cheerful and intimate, with a spacious check-in desk, a well-appointed bar and a lovely dining room overlooking the river. The check-in experience itself was virtually seamless, and the staff could not have been more pleasant or hospitable. Our room, which was modestly sized, though perfectly adequate, faced the river and boasted a small balcony. The classic interior was a perfect reflection of the public areas downstairs; dominated by the bright blues and cream-colored trim that are this property鈥檚 signature. The bathroom was a typical European affair with a deep tub, white marble floors and brass fixtures. The double sink was a welcome amenity. This was my third visit to Florence, and my first stay on the south side of the river. I cannot recommend this location more highly. While the idea of staying 鈥渋n the heart of it all鈥?is understandably tempting, I generally vacation in the summer when the crowds are at their peak. This location, close to Piazzale Michelangelo, the Pitti Palace and its adjacent Boboli Gardens is a calming respite from the throngs of tourists teeming amidst the Uffizi and Il Duomo across the way. Mine is clearly not the first glowing review of this property, neither shall it be the last. The Hotel Lungarno sets a high standard for boutique hotels in a city known for its charming accommodations, and in my opinion, this standard is unlikely to be matched for some time.

<Content>Spectacular location If you choose any hotel in Florence and don't mind spending some money, I can't think of a better spot than Hotel Lungarno. The setting on the banks of the river is nothing short of breathtaking (be sure to bring a drink out onto the terrace), and walking distance to just about everything. The hotel's amenties are wonderful...the bed was unbelievably luxurious and comfortable. Our only regret was that we only had one night to enjoy here. We'll definitely be back!

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel right on the Arno River We recently traveled to Europe for our honeymoon and Florence was one of our stops. The hotel Lungarno is a boutique hotel with tons of great amenities, and little extras. The bath products were fabulous although the bathroom was rather small. But the room was awesome, we opted for a river view on a high floor. The room is nautical style with dark wood and creams and navy. Very chic. We had a direct view of the Duomo cathedral. The staff was so friendly and helpful. We never ate at the restaurant but it smelt delicious. There was a little, Italian grocery store down to the left of the hotel, where we brought back sanwhiches and baked goods and sat at the hotel's riverside table area. The hotel is located just on the other side of the bridge from the more touristy area of Florence. The location was great to sit and watch people on the Ponte Vecchio. We would definitely stay here again! Florence is a lovely town and very easy to navigate. We cant wait to come back. Thank you hotel Lungarno for making our stay so memorable and special.

<Content>Gracious Hotel on the Arno Great accommodations, location and service. The bar was a perfect spot for a drink and the restaurant was a nice respite from the other restaurants in Florence. The location is close to everything but seems far away. No crowds!!! The Hotel is typical of the quality you find with anything that has the Ferragammo name attached to it. Worth the trip to Florence just to sit on your own terrace viewing the Ponte Vechio and Arno.

<Content>Elegant Hotel We stayed in a two bedroom apartment adjoining the hotel in September for 3 nights. The Apartment on the 1st floor was beautifully decorated with a kitchenette but no laundry facilities or view, which meant it was a little on the dark side. We had a lovely small balcony onto the street.As you can see in some of the photos it is a really elegant hotel with a gorgeous lobby and bar area where you could sit and admire the view, which we did each afternoon. Whilst the apartment was expensive at over Au$1,400 per night it was well worth it to have the space while travelling with two boys aged 7 and 12. Two adjoining rooms were more expensive.The location was ideal and the service mostly good. We wondered why our mini bar didn't have a price list and why there was no coffee for the coffee maker. There was also an empty wine bottle in the kitchen for the entire length of our stay. It was only after 2 nights when the housekeeper finally updated the mini bar and left a bill for 32 Euros that we realised we didn't have everything we were meant to have!! Obviously no one had checked when the previous occupants vacated. This was immediately deducted from our bill when we pointed out the error to the reception desk. This was a bit annoying as we thought we had to buy our own coffee and milk for the coffee maker.We would be happy to stay here again if we came back to Florence.

<Content>I'm ready to go back! We booked two rooms here for our three day stay in Florence. From the very first moment we were greeted kindly and happily. Both rooms were beautiful. One on the 3rd floor had a beautiful floor to ceiling view across the Arno. Our 6th floor room had a huge terrace and beautiful views of the Arno, the Ponte Vecchio and the Duomo ... it was heavenly. The hotel had lovely food and we had a perfect stay from start to finish. I wish I'd stayed at their establishment in Rome instead of the Hotel Eden (not bad, but not as special). The concierge was super helpful and the hotel comes with a fantastic discount at stores throughout Florence.When I go back to Florence, I'll be going back to Hotel Lungarno.

<Content>Location, location, location We were there 5 yrs ago and knew we had to return. This is subtly elegant but the best is the location - on the Arno w/ views of the Ponte Vechio from our room and bar terrace. This hotel is a stone's throw from the Piti Palace, Uffizi + Bargello museums.

<Content>Should be a five star! What a treasure! This hotel offered everything you could want to enjoy your visit. We later stayed at a five star, and Hotel Lungarno offered accommodations that met everything they offered, but the bathroom (Huge double walk-in shower) had the five-star beat. You can't go wrong. The staff is terrific, fantastic location, beautiful hotel. Book it!

<Content>The best We stayed in the Lungarno Apartments for 3 nights last week. When I initially contacted the Lungarno Hotel, I asked for 2 adjoining rooms for my family of 2 adults and 3 children. The Lungarno kindly suggested the Apartments, which had 2 beautifully appointed bedrooms and a very, very large living room and separate kitchen. Every detail is well thought out...we almost felt bad letting our kids lounge on the beautifully upholstered furniture!The kitchen came in very handy since we have young children. We shopped in the daily morning market in Santo Spirito and bought staples at an upscale store across the street. There is also a little restaurant that does take out across the street too, as well as Olio and Convivium down the street. The green grocer on the corner of San Iocopo and the bridge that leads to Via Tornabuoni charges a lot more and the quality is much worse than the greengrocers in Santo Spirito...or perhaps I just got treated as a tourist and was sold the mealy peaches and the past-their-prime grapes.There is a parking garage next door which is convenient. The Lungarno Hotel provides room service, house keeping, etc. For a gym, one has to go to the Lungarno's sister property across the Ponte Vecchio.One small thing though...the bell hop who brought our luggage up to the room sniffed at the tip (it was a good tip)...he ignored us everytime we saw him in the lobby...perhaps he's just the shy type...also, though it wasn't the hotel's fault, there were a couple of American businessmen each working on their lap tops and working their cell phones in the lobby bar...one was calling probably everyone he knew, and just mentioning that he happened to be in Florence, overlooking the Arno, etc...

<Content>Mixed results Hotel Lungarno is the fashionista鈥檚 working hotel in Florence 鈥?it is owned by the Ferragamo family  while I was there, I saw Narciso Rodriguez checking in. The interior design is flawless.I had a mixed experience with this hotel, as my stay was split into 2. For the 1st portion, I absolutely loved it. I had a breathtaking view and large, modern yet sensual room. Then for the next portion I had a small room without a view. It鈥檚 possible that I still would have liked it, had I not been spoiled by the 1st room. I requested to change it, but was told that there were no other rooms available 鈥?I can believe this as it was busy  it鈥檚 a fairly small hotel. End of story.

<Content>A truly remarkable experience My partner and I spent five days here and still relish on the experience. The hotel is beautiful, the place couldn't be better - a block away from the Ponte Vecchio and overlooking the Arno river...! (Tha'ts what its name means - 'along the Arno'). The rooms are cozy and nice, not too big, not to small. The bathroom had every convenience. It also pleases you with complimentary wireless internet, breakfast buffet, a lovely and comfortable lobby, in a word, excellent! The staff deserves special mention: always helpful and eager to give you advice -and always in a friendly mood. Thanks to all of you for making our stay in Florence a memorable one!

<Content>A Few Problems... We booked the Hotel Lungarno based on its website and reviews from the TripAdvisor, however there were a few problems. The person who showed us to our room said not a single word, not one. None of our amenities鈥搘elcome drinks, fruit or car service to and from the airport/train station were mentioned or offered. We received the drinks and fruit after several requests. The other amenities; we just dropped, decided the staff was indifferent or overworked or both. On the first morning, we had no hot water, I telephoned and the desk person hung up on me at mid-sentence; after 20 minutes, my husband found the maid and she went for help. We were very disappointed with the overall attitude and poor service this hotel offered.

<Content>Get the apartment! My wife and three young adult children stayed at the Hotel Lungarno for 4 nights, then again for one night later in our stay in Italy. With 5 people, we either had to choose 2 rooms or get one larger place. We chose one of the apartments at the hotel and it was a great choice!We got the Vespucci apartment on the 4th floor of the hotel. It is large, bright and nicely appointed. We loved it! The hotel is wonderful. It is right on the river, has a great lobby and the staff is excellent. For a high-end boutique hotel you will not find a better place anywhere. Oh, by the way, it is owned by the Ferragamo family, so it is very tastefully decorated. All things considered, it is one of the nicest, most comfortable places I have stayed.

<Content>Excellent location, beautiful hotel My husband and I spent a 3 night weekend (March 2007) at Hotel Lungarno, Florence and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel's location is excellent - it is within walking distance to all tourist attractions and about 2 minutes away from the Ponte Vecchio. The hotel is immaculate, as seen in the photograhs. The staff were very helpful, friendly and courteous. The rooms were serviced daily to a very high standard. Hotel Lungarno is not a cheap hotel. but if you have the extra cash to spend and want to spoil yourself - this is the hotel for you. The only negative was that we checked in very late and were allocated a room next to the elevators. Avoid these rooms if possible.

<Content>Loved Hotel Lungarno This was the best hotel of our 13 days trip in January. Charming, welcoming, comfortable, almost all you can have in a relaxing trip in a historical city. They have even Jean Cocteau's drawings on the lobby, and a great view to the Arno River. Great location, just a few steps from Ponte Vecchio, and 2 minutes to Piazza della Signoria. Very close to all attractions. You can do everything on foot.It's a bit expensive, but it worths it! I'd go back and recommend to all my friends. Tiny bedroom, but extremely comfortable.

<Content>The Best Place to Stay In Florence We celebrated our 25th anniversary in Tuscany and ended our trip with 3 days in Florence at the Hotel Lungarno. We highly recommend this hotel. It sits on the Arno on the opposite side and the Ponte Vecchio is only a block away. It is a very convenient location to walk to all the sights. The staff is very helpful and courteous. While we were waiting for our room, a woman came running in hysterical that her handbag with airline tickets and money had just been stolen at the train station. We overheard her say that she was frustrated with the local police and was also unable to get in touch with the US embassy because it was Sunday. She had just checked out that day and came back because she trusted they could help her. And they did.. That started our stay with a sense that the employees, especially those at the resgistration desk, were experienced and knowledgable. The rooms are quite luxurious and the bathroom pleasingly large. You must request a room on the Arno it is well worth it. Also the hotel made our reservations for us for the Accademia and Uffizi and that saved us a lot of time waiting in lines.

<Content>The best choice for a Florence hotel My new husband and I stayed at the Lungarno for the first few days of our Italian honeymoon. We have never stayed at a nicer establishment. My luggage was lost--a tragedy for a newlywed bride!--and the hotel was gracious and informative, and any time one of the staff members spotted us, they gave us an update on the status of my lost bag. They continually called the airline until my luggage was delivered almost 3 days later. The views from our suite were absolutely incredible, and our rooms were spotlessly kept by the helpful and unobtrusive staff. We were given fabulous recommendations on local restaurants, including our favorite, Celestinos. We enjoyed this place so much we ate there almost every night we were in Florence! Rarely have we felt so welcome at a hotel, and it was a refreshing change from what we are used to. The staff went out of their way to ensure that our stay was wonderful, and we are already planning our return trip to Florence and the Hotel Lungarno. We HIGHLY recommend this hotel!!

<Content>Absolutely loved the Lungarno! The Hotel Lungarno, owned by the Ferragamo family, was fabulous. We stayed there for 4 days on a trip celebrating our 20th anniversary and it was terrific. The service, the rooms - everything! Our room was lovely and the balcony had views up and down of the bridges and the water. The location is nice too, because it is quite close to the Ponte Vecchio, but slightly off the beaten path, and so much quieter than many other luxury hotels.

<Content>lovely hotel, elegant rooms I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. We got the promotional rate of 190 Euros through the hotel's website. This rate seemed very competitive for Florence at this time of year, and for what I feel is a luxury boutique hotel. The rooms are, as others have noted, on the small side and we did not have a view of the Arno. Nonetheless, I found our room to be very confortably, with elegant decor and a great bathroom. The lobby is also charming with a stunning view of the river. You can get wireless internet access there, though not in the rooms. Concierge was very helpful, made dinner reservations for us and answered questions about travel etc. We never ate at the hotel, so not sure what that's like, but had drinks in the lobby and on the small terrace overlooking the river. Overall an excellent stay. I doubt there's much better to be had in Florence at that rate, if you can get it.

<Content>loved the Lungarno My wife and I recently celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary at the Lungarno and we were both very happy with our stay.Excellent location, being about a hundred yards from the Ponte Vecchio and walking distance to everything on both sides of the River Arno. The room was small (well, it's Europe), but immaculate and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was good...clean, nice and with a great shower head and plenty of hot water (sometimes you take these things for granted). We had a balcony facing the old city which was absolutely worth paying for.Service all around was very good...not one complaint. The first night we were there, we returned to our room in the evening to find a complimentary bottle of champagne, which was a nice touch. The restaurant served what was one of the best dinners we had in Italy. And the complimentary breakfast was very good.The Lungarno is indeed expensive, and I somewhat felt that at that price, Internet in the rooms could be provided. I also am a little accustomed to American hotels, where if you're paying that kind of money, the place would have a fitness center (especially since you will get run over if you dare to go jogging in the streets of Florence). That would be my only suggestion for improvement to the facilties. I would definitely return to the Lungarno and recommend it to others.

<Content>great location but a bit full of themselves Just spent a week at the Hotel Lungarno. We needed a Hotel on the South side of the river so my husband could attend a conference and this Hotel fitted the bill. Tried to get an internet booking but was told Hotel was full. Travel agent managed to get us a room. Asked for junior suite with river views which we recieved. Room was clean and quite large.It was on the first floor so views not as good as what higher floors would have. Bathroom adequate. As we where there for a full seven days you would have thought that for 820 euros a night breakfast could be included. It was not. Asked for late check out as was leaving Florence at 7pm for 30 hours of travel to Australia. Told very superciliously that they could not possibly do this. Noted that when we returned for our luggage the room had not been reoccupied.Toiletries included where shampoo and bath foam only with the occasional satchet of hand cream thrown in at bed turn down. No internet service we could find. We had spent the previous week at the Luna Baglioni in Venice and felt we got much better value for money with bigger and better rooms and much friendlier staff.

<Content>Highly recommended, perfect location, service levels 95% excellent We have just returned from Florence today and this was a surprise trip for my husband's 65th birthday. We simply loved this hotel and highly recommend it for rooms, service, and location. Rooms : We had a room with a river view and balcony (653) Rooms are 'compact'and bathrooms really compact - but all very beautifully decorated, beds are very comfy and all you need is there. It was worth paying the extra and having a river view and balcony - we enjoyed a celebratory glass or two watching the goings on of the river and Ponte Vecchio and you have a magnificent view of the Duomo, Campanile, the Uffizi and various other historical buildings. We felt we had space around us and were able to really relax and enjoy the room instead of looking out of a window onto another building which is often the case with many of the hotels (even expensive ones). You also get to hear the bells toll (which I enjoyed as it adds to the atmosphere of a historical city) and the ambulances blaring up the road on the opposite bank, but when you stay in a city you have to expect traffic noise. We met up with some people who had a 'classic room' facing on to Borgo San Jacopo and they said that although the road is very narrow, it is busy. They also said the room was quite small but they were very happy there. Service : reception staff could not have been more helpful and willing to assist. The only negative - I agree with one of the previous reviews that the breakfast staff are somewhat surly and the charges for breakfast are a bit confusing, but what is on offer is very nice. Location : is really excellent and everything you want to see is a 10-15 minute walk, as is the station. You can even walk to Piazza Michelangelo which is about a 25 minute walk (uphill!!) Restaurant and bar: We had afternoon tea which was lovely (although they do not make tea like the British, so maybe its best to have coffee) and evening drinks are served with snacks and you can enjoy the view of the river and bridge. We did not try the restaurant as there are so many wonderful places to eat nearby (some lousy ones too!). We will definitely return to this hotel and I was very pleased with my choice having seen a number of other hotels that I had considered booking. We found it to be comparable to a number of stately homes converted into hotels that we have visited in the UK and yes, my husband thoroughly enjoyed the treat.

<Content>Almost Great. The Hotel Lungarno has a great location near the Ponte Vechio. The Hotel, and Rooms are clean and decorated nicely. The building is getting a little worn down, and could use some work. The rooms were small, but nice, and clean. The staff was excellent, always willing to help with tours, car, taxi, anything we needed. I would say this is what sets this hotel apart, is the service. It really was great. Now, if they can just fix up the Hotel a little more. Definitely worth a stay.

<Content>OK, But Not Great We stayed three nights at the Lungarno in Feb. The room itself was very nice, smallish but with a great view of the river and a nice bathroom. When we entered the hotel lobby and sitting area there was an unpleasant smell, like wet dog/mildew that did not go away. The service was not good, for example at breakfast we got one coffee then had to wait and finally track downt the waiter to get another, there was no toilet paper in the room and when it finally came there was a lot of attitude as well, we ordered room service-dinner and a bottle of water-and they forgot glasses for the water, we were told to use the glasses from the bathroom. You mean the ones with the toothbrushes in them? Not nice! Other stuff like that -it sounds nit picky but it adds up. We wouldn't go back.

<Content>A wonderful spot in Florence We enjoyed a wonderful stay at this hotel for myhusband's 50th birthday.The location, just a half block from the Ponte Vecchio is ideal. Everything youwill want to see in Florence is within walking distance if you are an avid walker. The hotel itselfis in excellent condition and decorated beautifully.The lobby and restaurant afford lovely views of theArno, as do many of the suites. Our was decortatedin navy and white -- very clean and crisp. The bathroom was nice, but not over the top for $1000per night. The staff was extremely helpful. For example they arranged a car and driver to drive usto Modena for the day on less than 24 hours notice andwere extremely helpful with restuarant recommendationsand reservations. We would absolutely stay again whenwe return to Florence.

<Content>Great place, great location We stayed at the Hotel Lungarno for the second time in December. It is in a great location - away from the tourist area but everything you want to see is usually not further than a twenty minute walk away. Via San Jacopo and the surrounding area is filled with stores and restaurants frequented by locals and tourists alike.The rooms are average sized (for Italy) and are kept immaculately clean - there is maid service twice a day. The Lungarno toiletries are great too.We did not eat in the restaurant but did have a drink in the lounge one night. There are complimentary hors-d'oeuvres during the cocktail hour.

<Content>Brilliant hotel My husband and i stayed at Hotel Lungarno for 3 nights and we found this hotel to be a great find.It is located a short walk from the shops and restaurants.We booked a suite room and were pleasantly surprised by the size and the decor was lovely throughout the hotel not just our room. We had a huge balcony (although we did not use it due to it being too cold) which would have been perfect for breakfast with views over the river.The staff were freindly and efficient, the bar excellent and i can say the restaurant was one of the best meals we have had and we travel frequently and have sampled food all over the world.I would recommend this hotel as a great place to stay in Florence.

<Content>Great Service and Location Enjoyed a fabulous 4 day stay at the Hotel Lungarno in December, 2005. Very romantic, best views in Florence, several cozy, non-touristy top restaurants a block or two away. The staff was always available and went out of their way to arrange private tours, museum tickets, and to recommend restaurants. Room was immaculate and well-decorated. Lobby bar was excellent. Breakfast was overpriced, and is about the only aspect I wouldn't reccomend. Would happily stay here agaim.

<Content>elegant small hotel Stayed 4 nights at Hotel Lungarno. Got online rate of 150 euro per night. Lovely small hotel South of Arno in stylish Oltrarno district, very near Ponte Vecchio. Convenient for walking to sights and good for avoiding the tourist mobs in the city center. Very good restaurants, trattoria, and cafes on same street. Helpful, professional, English-speaking staff. Everything very tasteful and elegant. Lovely artwork throughout hotel. My room had plenty of closet and drawer space and writing desk and chair, windows w/street view. There are river view rooms available and a great view from the top of the hotel. Beautiful marble bathroom w/bidet, shower, tub. Excellent water pressure and plenty of hot water and fluffy towels, nice touches like towel warmers. Nice bar and eating area on ground level floor w/great views of Arno river. They offered a variety of hors d'ouevres, gratis, every evening. Breakfast was not included in our rate, there are three differently priced options the most expensive running 25 euro per person which included a very good buffet spread of fresh fruit, fresh juices, eggs, bacon, meats, cheeses, croissants, pastries etc.I definitely recommend this hotel.Can be slightly tricky to locate first time as the hotel entrance is in a courtyard area, not directly facing street.

<Content>Lovely Hotel Our stay at this hotel was wonderful. The location and service were perfect, and the room was great. We were in a deluxe double which had a fabulous view (#433) - definitely was worth the money. The only negative I can mention is the hotel offered to reserve us tickets to the Academia and then charged us 15E/person when they were 6.50E at the door - it just didn't feel good. All else was great.

<Content>Fantastic Restaurant *Borgo San Jacopo Ristorante* What a fantastic hotel - we did not stay there as we could not get in but I had to write a review of the restaurant. They fitted us in at short notice on the terrace which only had 4 tables of 2. It was the most amazing venue sitting over the River Arno and being a stone's throw from the Punte Veccio. The food,wine and service was amazing and really reasonably priced for such an exclusive location. A must visit for a romantic evening meal!

<Content>Elegant serene I went back a second time this summer because I loved this small, chic and most restful of hotels. Outside is a magnificent view of the river for which the hotel is named and parallel is a cobblestone street filled with a wide range of charming shops. I am going back a third time this year because this hotel is so attractive.

I would say that hotel Lungarno is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in in my life.It was plush  exclusive. Amazinginly helpful staff. Not much else to say, but awsome view, great atmosphere. This hotel is rated as one of the top 100 small hotels in the world - what else can I say!

<Content>An amazing spot The Hotel Lungarno is an amazing spot. Every detail is done so perfectly. I would have to say that the Hotel Lungrno is now one of my favorite hotels I have ever stayed in. My wife and I stayed in a double room with a terrace for 4 days, 3 nights and have absolutley no complaints. We ate breakfast at the hotel every morning, where we were offered a wide variety of pastries, breads, cereals. The location, views and decor were the three most impressive aspects of this hotel. I would highly recommend staying at the Hotel Lungarno, it is truely a spectacular place.

<Content>Good Hotel, but... We stayed for 2 nights at Hotel Lungarno. We payed about 250 us/a night, so I guess for our value the rooms were fine. It reminded me of a boutique hotel. The room was pretty small with an inner view. The bathroom was beautiful though. Our biggest issues was that the Front Desk is the same for the Concierge, so there was always a line to ask a question or call for a taxi.The terrace is beautiful with a view of the Vecchio Bridge and Arno River. I tried to order breakfast on the terrace, but they would not serve me there!If you can afford to stay in a river view room or suite, then book it!

<Content>Just a note about construction Just wanted to let everyone know I booked the Hotel Lungarno for our trip in August and after it was paid and confirmed we received an e-mail from the reservations manager informing us that due to construction / remodeling the breakfast room would be closed and breakfast would be served in the lobby. He also mentioned that many rooms on the third floor would be closed for the same reasons. The e-mail was polite and promised the same service but did not offer any room upgrade or discount. Not a big deal, unless the construction is noisey (we're hoping not). I just wish they would have mentioned it BEFORE we booked, which is why I am mentioning it to you all.

<Content>Loved the Lungarno Our recent stay at the Lungarno was a lovely beginning of a wonderful 2 week vacation in Italy. Our room, with a balcony overlooked the Arno, was small, but immaculate. The bed/bedding was so comfortable; no nasty bedspreads. Breakfast was delicious with a huge spread of eggs, cheese, breads, fruit, pastry, etc. The staff was always gracious and very helpful. We will definitely stay again at the Lungarno.
