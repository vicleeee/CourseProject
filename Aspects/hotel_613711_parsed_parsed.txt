<Content>No way a 5 star Very dissappointed with this hotel, the website makes the rooms look very nice when in fact they are poorly fitted out, not too clean, toiletteries are very cheap and nasty, no extractor fan in the bathroom which meant a very black and mouldy ceiling above the bath! Staff very laid back, I had to ask three times for some glasses in our room they never arrived. breakfasts okay if you get in at 7.30 if not a bit sparse and you take your life in your hands if you use the coffee machine! Location very good, and a beautiful garden which just needs to be kept a bit tidier. With such a beautiful building, location and garden this could be an amazing hotel but it lacks that special touch you would expect from a four star.

<Content>No restaurant No bar You should know that there is no restaurant apart from breakfast, and no bar at all. A hotel without a bar seems very strange to me. The hotel is labelled as High Tech on every piece of print, and the whole emphasis is on the male business traveller.

<Content>Avoid like the plague This is a terrible hotel. They had no hot water for the duration of our visit and after complaining 5 times did they own up to the fact that there was something wrong with the plumbing. Not to mention the water also stagnated in the bathroom. After numerous complaints they suggested I go to another room in another building to take a shower!! For a 4 star hotel this was the worst ever and real bad value for money. Worst is not being compensated since I prepaid.Also trying to sleep in that hotel was impossible since you can hear every door and elevator sounds in that hotel. Avoid like the plague!

<Content>fantastic location This hotel can't be beaten for location in Barcelona. Just off La Rambla with excellent public transport links. Rooms were clean, breakfasts were fine and we also made use of the Tapas bar opposite on a couple of occasions. The decor is all very new and modern and the only fault I can find is that it seems too flimsy and too cheap. The sliding wardrobe doors looked a little worse for wear and areas of the dining room would benefit from a lick of paint. Overall, this is a great place from which to explore the city. If you are a football fan, make sure you get to go to a match at the Nou Camp! Accessible from here without too much hassle.

<Content>Great Location Location Location Just steps off the Rambla, the Petit Palace Opera Garden is an upscale hotel in a near-perfect location, less than 2 blocks from the Mercat St. Josep La Boqueria and an easy walk to the PlaèŽ½a Catalunya. The hotel itself is very modern, and our family room for four was very spacious with a large bath (jacuzzi tub) and a foyer with storage which made it simple to deal with all the luggage we had. There was a laptop in the room and complimentary internet access. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel has recently begun offering a 15 euro breakfast option, but we passed on that.Despite being in a busy area, our room was pleasantly quiet and relaxing.

<Content>A good standard of accommodation in a great location I stayed here with 3 friends in August - in a family room! Despite 4 adults sharing, the room was perfectly adequate for the amount of time you spend in it on a city break. 2 of the beds are bunk bed style - but much more comfortable than we expected. All looks recently refurbished and modern. Great shower.This hotel is fabulously located - within seconds of Las Ramblas and the Boqueria market and a few minutes walk from the everything else the Bari Gottic area has to offer.Only thing that lets this place down is the lack of decent bar. They have a great terrace  gardens out the back of the hotel, but no one serving drinks. When we came in to see if we could get a drink from the so called bar, the guy basically had nothing on offer except coffee! Service was generally a little slow, but staff were helpful.Would recommend and would return

<Content>break in barcelona my friend and i wanted a few nights stay in Barcelona without the hassle of public transport every where we went. The hotel was a fantastic location, didn't need breakfast as there was a tapas bar just across the street. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was large and clean. Bathroom fantastic. Bar could have been open more frequently - just to enjoy sitting in the garden area - but this was not a major problem. If every I return to Barcelona, which I hope to do. would not hesitate in staying here again, or recommending to friends. Thank you for a fantastic break

<Content>Stolen bag at breakfast Ok hotel, looks better on the web than it actually is, very over priced. securtiy is dire, anybody can walk in off the street without being questioned as i learnt!!i had my bag containing wallet, passport and camera stole from underneath my table during the breakfast serving, the guy who stole it enters the hotel and serves himself breakfast, other guests think he is staying at the hotel, but he is just there to steal from you. the hotel are aware it has happened before but do not warn guests, the few staff that is in the hotel attemped to help but by that time he was long gone along with another ladies bag.i realise your own belongings are your own responsibility, but surely a 4 star hotel has a duty to provide guests with basic security, safer sleeping on the beach.

<Content>Noisy. Clean. Polite staff. Great location. but Noisy! We stayed here for 3 nights pre-cruise. I booked with Venere.com. We chose this hotel for its family rooms-a room where we can all 4 stay. The price seemed mid-range to me. I found its location to be ideal. We walked to many places, restaurants, tourist sites. The room was small but clean and adequate. The staff were english speaking, and helpful. We did not purchase breakfast at hotel. We ate at local cafes.However, unfortunately, we will not choose this hotel again. While I did enjoy our room with tiny balcony overlooking a side street on Las Ramblas, we found it very difficult to sleep. We could hear all sorts of folks on the streets, many partiers, and lots outbursts until the wee hours.

<Content>Absolutely love this hotel This place is brilliant , right from the very start the hotel staff were brilliant very friendly and helpful, allowing us to check in early. The hotel is very modern and yes the bathroom doors are frosted glass, but isnt that what makes travel interesting staying somewhere different to home. The hotel gardens are lovely very peaceful and quiet. Now the location is right in the Ramblas which is right in the thick of it which is perfect, yes it is noisy but only because everyone is out and about. The area is full of little shops bars and restaurants. I was travelling with two teenagers and they both loved the place.Dont hesitate in booking this hotel , its fun.

<Content>Great location This hotel is really comfortable, clean, perfectly located and boasts a friendly staff. One memorable incident which involved the cleaning lady entering the room, despite us having put up the do not disturb sign, resulted in the staff leaving us complimentary champagne and fruit! A lovely touch!! A really enjoyable stay but somewhat overpriced.

<Content>Petit Palace Iéº“ve stayed in Petit Palace Opera for 4 nights. Their mayor positive point is the location...Just near a tube station...Everything became very near this way... Letéº“s start from the beginning. When we arrived to the Hotel the baggage man has come to take the bags to the reception...nice impression..... Then became the first mistake.... The reception boy has made a mistake and checked us in a small room, not the requested one, not the one we asked for....But well mistakes we can all make..Another thing I didnéº“t like was that room service was only till 23 hours.... But then happened something I consider absolutely irresponsible and not the expected from a 4 stars hotel.... In the breakfast the cereals were out of date... (9/2007).... This was unforgivable and unacceptable from a 4 star hotel... But there were some positive points as the room towel service....and the simpathy of all the employees.Positive Points: Location, PriceNegative Points: Breakfast, Room Service

<Content>Very well located  My husband  I have just returned from staying one night at this hotel  I have to say that it is in a great position just off La Ramblas.It was much closer than I thought  very easy to find.The hotel is modern  clean, with a very modern  good sized shower room.We have a double sized shower at home  this one was as big, complete with Jacuzzi style shower.Not bad for a 4 star hotel! The staff were very friendly  helpful, not that we needed much as we were only there for the one night, but still, I got the impression they would have helped out with any problems you may have.The only issue we had with the room was the bed.It was bigger than a king size but very, very hard!My husband says he might aswell have slept on the floor it was that uncomfortable, but maybe it's just him as I slept just fine!I would definitely book this hotel again when we return in April (if it's available), mainly due to it's great location.There are so many bars  restaurants close by, you will certianly find one that suits your taste  budget.

<Content>nice design, poor maintained This is a potentially nice hotel in a perfect situation for tourists. Near rambla, newly refurbished in an old palazzo with a nice little garden. We were there for 3 days between xmas and new year and had mixed impressions. Hearty welcome at late night, but it was impossible to change the room (dirty shower) Next mornings change went without problems. Breakfastroom not what you expect from 4 and a half star hotel. Shower in the next room not so dirty, but didnt drain. We told the frontdesk but it was not repaired next night. Computer in the room didnt work, but i had my own laptop and got from the reception a password for free wlan which made no problems. Sadly to say this place has all the possibilities to be a perfect little touristhotel but you get the strong impression that the managements only interest is to economize. The rooms furnishment looked cheaply made and was worn out after seemingly short time. information papers in the room and toilet items in bath very few and obviously without regard. Would take the hotel again but only with other management.

<Content>A hotel in Barca that'll take children Hotel is half way down Las Ramblas, just 20 mtrs along one of the many small streets.The hotel entrance is very nice, the rooms are clean but very basic. It's MDF heaven, everythings made of it. Our room was in an annex that is reached by crossing the garden area. There are stairs but the porter took our cases so it wasn't a problem.I don't think I'd stay there again but very few hotels in Barcelona caters for a family of 4.It's convenient, clean and the staff are nice. The breakfast is the worst I've ever had and if you want a drink in the bar you have to sit outside. The beds are very hard, after 4 nights I was glad to get home to my comfy bed.It's cheap, reasonably cheerful and is clean.

<Content>really nice staff but this new hotel needs repairs and improvements hello i stayed at this hotel 11th nov 2007 to 16th nov 2007 i had read mixed reviews on tripadvisor but took a chance because some reviews had said the good location outweighed the problems .in my opinion it is not a high tech hotel in any way at all the entrance hall is the best part of the hotel its 20 metres up a side street half way down the famous rambles the twenty metres is frequented by prostitutes but to be honest unless you were looking for them you would not notice them they are very young and concentrate on young men so my wife and i were safe we are fifty anyway once in the hotel it looks good but the rooms are badly fitted out the furniture is poor quality the tv is nice but only sky news is in english language the rest is spanish and german and french the glass door to the bathroom is nice others commented on it being a problem but if you are sharing a room with someone you should be able to cope with a green glass door you cannot see anything other than a shadow through the glass however the shower screens are useless and water on floor is unavoidable sound proofing is rubbish.beds are hard but i like that so no complaints.the breakfast on three out of five mornings was poor no replenishment so if you went after nine the choice was very poor indeed.the gardens in the centre of the building are a feature of this hotel but in november pretty useless but in a large hot city in summertime i reckon it would be fab for cooling in its shade. getting there take a taxi to 78 rambles 30 mins 30 euros from el prat airport the tapas bar opposite front door of hotel highly recommended excellent food and wine and cold beer nice people run it

<Content>Great Garden! The Petit Palace Posada Opera was in a great location just off of Las Ramblas in the old section of Barcelona. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were immaculate, like another Petit Palace we had stayed in in Madrid. The Family Suite is a great set-up for a family of four like ours. There is a king bed and two bunk beds that are mounted on the wall. The bathroom is large. Heed the warnings about the water getting all over as the glass enclosure only goes part of the way, and not behind the stream of water. You will need to only use the handheld nozzle, and even then, still clean up afterwards. That is not a reason not to book this hotel! The garden was lovely, and we enjoyed several evenings of sipping wine, while our children (ages 9 and 11) played in the garden with the kids (ages 11 and 14) from our accompanying friends' family. Breakfast for us was included in the price, but it was not quite as extensive a spread as the Petit Palace in Madrid; but for the price, it was good enough. I would recommend this hotel highly.

<Content>Terrible stay Stay in June, 07, Good location, next to some seedy streets, at night beware of all the prositutes hanging out at the corner, they tried to pick up my husband and 13 year old son. leading up to the room you must enter dark hallways, they have BLACK wall paper on walls and motion lights that go on only when you enter the hallway. Motion lights are very dim. VERY SCAREY. You will never know if someone is hiding in corner of hallway. Once the lights turn on you already walked down a completely dark hallway with no windows. Upon entering the room the accent pillows on bed had staines not only in my room as well as my friends room too. and the room they changed us to also. Cockaroches and flies in the room, spend all night killing flies, changed rooms because the overwhelming smell of sewer coming from the bathroom. Hotel had power failer and you better have your own flashlight because you are in complete darkness. My friend fell down the stairs because no lights on stairs. My friend spend vacation time in the hospital with sprain foot and torn ligaments. Manager said they cannot put emergency lights because they are on a historic site. DO NOT STAY HERE !!!! There are better hotels in the neighborhood.

<Content>Very Stylish Really loved the swish and contemporary look of this hotel. Managed to get an excellent rate from hotels.com at 65% off the hotels standard rates. The rooms and bathrooms are of an excellent standard. One down side to the hotel is that they can only manually switch from aircon or heat in summer and winter. Although it was November, it was particularly humid and the rooms very hot. They were unable to switch any air-conditioning on and suggested opening a window! The breakfast buffet was very good and the staff very attentive. With itéˆ¥æªš perfect location, I would recommend this hotel but check out what offers you can get first as itéˆ¥æªš not the cheapest.

<Content>barcelona with children - great location to make it short...the Hotel is highly recommended,we enjoyed our stay.. read the review to know more...we are a family of 5couple + 2 kids (7  9 y.o) + a baby.booked this hotel after reading the reviews here.for a fmaily room or suite , the options are very limited to begin withand as we wanted a premium locatin and a high standard we have spent the extra $$$s and booked the opera garden family room .prices on the web and directly with the hotel were the same..175 EU + tax ($235 inc. tax) per night...definetely not cheap but barable for a family.the hotel is located just in the middle of la ramblasthe main tourist street of barcelona..and directly over the metro station ( LICEU)so its easy to get to everyplace.the hotel is in walking distance from la ramblas, the port , the gothic quarter , placa catalunya , and a few more minutesto la pederera (Gaudi's casa mia) , and casa batillo...which made it very good for us,as going up and down the metro with a baby strawller usnt easy.the rooms are very nice, clean , and large.the kids twin beds , are hang up linke bunk-bedsand the porblem is that they have no security measures to make sure kids dont fall from 6 ft highso we took down the mattresses and laid them on the floor.unfortuantelly we received 2 twin beds next to each otherinstead of one king size, and the modern bed means , the mattress keep moving and you find a large hole between you and your wife...also the mattress was too hard fro me, ao i am sorry to say the bed was not comfortable.(i didnt think of asking to replace the bed)the room had some nice things like a lcd tv , a fridge , and a hair dryer , a few designed chairs, and a working table. also free internet :-)no bath in the room, but instead you get a hi-tec shower, with jacuzzi style action, and radio..problem with the toilet and shower is that the door has no lock !not the best thing when you travel with kids and want your privacy.also there is no seperation between the kids beds and the parentsso no privacy here either.the staff were very nice and helpfull.cleaning services were good, and the room was nice and clean.the air condition was heating only, so for cooler air we had to open the window to the street which ment alot of noise.also the window was very hard to open/close...for some reason while the hotel and room is hi-tec stylethe windows were old wooden style which were hard to work.breakfast at the hotel was prices very expensive.. 15 EURO per person (8 EU for children) so we chose to eat outside..the hotel dosent offer lunch or dinner, and dosent offer much services other than the rooms.no real lobby , etc...overall, our stay was niceand we recommend it, though we would be happy to see these small thingsa fixed.the hotel is rated at 4 starts, which is reasonable looking at the rooms,but the hotel servicdes are very limited.after reading the reviews here we made sure to ask for

<Content>Not quite 4 Star I can only echo the comments already posted, which are absolutely right...- Superb central location next to La Rambla and tube- Clean, stylish decor- Not so clever room design: Beds are single but pushed together on flimsy bases to make a double; Furniture placed in odd and arkward places (a desk was almost touching the bed); the shower jets spray the entire bathroom; no lock on bathroom door plus large gabs around door so you can see in; All the furniture has not round edges you walk into it - it hurts!- The rooms overlooking the side alley were noisy all night with people talking and early morning deliveries, so after 2 nights of this we moved to a new room, which was quiet until the maids arrived before 0900 making an unecessary amount of noise.- Breakfast was not included, at a rate of 15euro per person, making it so overpriced. (There are a couple of breakfast bars opposite the hotel charging only about 7euros!)Despite the problems, staff were good, and it didn't ruin our holiday, but we wouldn't stay again.

<Content>Mixed Feelings.... We are a family of 5 (3 young children)--Americans living in England and doing lots of travel. Several UK friends suggested we visit Barcelona. This was the ONLY hotel I could find that had a family room available (during our stay in Barcelona there was a HUGE conference that took up many hotel rooms in the city).The BEST feature of this hotel is location. I think it was meant to be that we stayed here, simply because of the location....right off Las Rambles, a 5/10 minute walk to the waterfront, near the Metro station, 5/10 minute walk to Playa de Catalunya. So many restaurants, shops, street performers. We fell in love with the city!The second best feature of this hotel is the size of the family room. I think we may have been upgraded to a larger FamRm--ours had 2 sets of bunk-beds and a large bed (one of those European king beds...i.e. 2 twins put together). Now the not so great part....--upon arrival and throughout our stay, I felt that the hotel staff just didn't have a smooth set of operating procedures for anything. Although our reservation was in the system, I felt check-in was handled clumsy--the person behind the desk kept switching computers, looking in file folders, asking the other desk person questions. It just wasn't as smooth or organized as you would expect.--our room was in the 2nd building. As a previous reviewer mentioned, we had to go up stairs, up more stairs, down stairs, go across the courtyard and then up the stairs. Not good with 3 suitcases, and a toddler in a stroller. Yes, the hotel staff helped us with our bags getting to our room, but it was incredibly awkward. And each trip in and out of the hotel was just as awkward.--I learned that the High Tech part of the hotel description is actually the group/chain which owns/runs the hotel. This isn't listed on expedia, yahoo, orbitz, etc, and is why you can't find the hotels website just by looking for its name. Otherwise, there is nothing high tech about the hotel.--I think the staff/managers were more interested in THE LOOK (funky, uber-contemporary decor) of the hotel than customer service.--the breakfast is overpriced. Again, a lack of customer service. At all hotels I've stayed at, even if it's a self-serve buffet, a waiter/waitress asks if you want coffee,etc. This was not the case. The pastries looked amazing, but the warm options were mediocre.--A lock on the bathroom door would have been nice. So a mom of 3 boys could have some private time instead of them looking for me while in the shower. --Although my 2 older sons loved the bunk beds, the top bunks weren't very safe. At night, my husband took the ladder and used it as a guard rail, so then they couldn't get down without our help (a.k.a late night potty trips). --I think the rates are a bit overpriced for this hotel.Although this may sound overly critical, we did enjoy our stay....primarily for the location. If they could just work out the kinks, this might be a great hotel. While we were staying, they were landscaping the courtyard. I'm sure it'll look amazing when done.

<Content>STILL not finished Had four rooms booked via a booking website. We were given rooms in the annexe (out past reception, up stairs, down stairs, across the garden and up some more steps - no good if limited mobility, inclement weather or with small children) - from an internal note that was pinned to the reception desk (in full view of clients) this is the norm. Reception are told to put clients booking via websites other than the hotel's own, in the annexe and then reallocate them if the request is made. I did ask for one of the rooms to be changed to main hotel building and this was done with no problem. I also asked for rooms to be close to each other - we were given one on ground floor (in front of lift), one on first floor (in front of lift) and one on second floor (in front of lift) - could this also have been due to booking via a non-hotel website?The rooms are small, but comfortable. The workmanship as commented here is shoddy and some details are very badly thought out - one wardrobe could not be shut as the safe was in the way, it was so narrow that the clothes could not hang normally, but had to be twisted. In one of the bathrooms the bath/shower door could not be opened/moved which meant sliding into the shower through a small gap and climbing out carefully afterwards!Lot of noise (obviously from the lift, but also from the door to the annexe slamming shut everytime it was used), cleaners vacuumed the passage outside bedrooms at 8.30 am (and then forgot to make up room one day!) and the builders, landscapers, maintenance workers who are still working on the hotel!High tech means a lap top in the bar area (which had no internet connection for the first two days!)Positive points: the location is fantastic, staff are very pleasant and helpful, breakfast is good (if you get an inclusive rate). This hotel is just not ready yet, and the management of it seems rather haphazard.Would I stay there again? Yes, but certainly not at the full price, and would request a room in the main building.

<Content>This is the one! After reading mixed reviews, i thought i was in for a Ghost Train come underwater experience however, I have been to Barcelona at least 10 times now, stayed most places on the Rambas and this is by far the best hotel I have been to.The hotel is centrally located in a side street of Las Ramblas (side street meaning just left a bit and a few doors on the right not 6 miles down a dark alleyway. Glass doors open to welcome you and it struck me that what I saw was equal to or better than the pictures on the websites (i am sure we have experienced lovely pictures on the face of it but end up staying at a hell hole). Our reservation was in the system, we were told to come back at 2pm (checking in time) and we left our luggage there and took a stroll down the Marina for lunch.The rooms are located on dark corridors, however there is a certain style about this i liked. It looked very classy and each room had a light above the door which illuminated when you were inside.The bathroom was large and had a frosted glass wall. The doors do not have locks and there is a few mm gap, but who shares a double bed and worries someone will see them?The room itself was well proportioned. A little stark and clinical at first but you have to appreciate this is a very mod hotel. We had a wall mounted LCD TV which had Sky news - not much more to be honest, but you don't come to Barca to watch TV? Small banconies overlooking a typical (quiet) sidestreet (residential not commercial shops, bars etc)Bathroom and Mini bar stocked, credit card activated safe. The shower screen (glass) didnt meet the bottom so after jetting my body with the massage jets the floor was pretty flooded, but who cares, it isnt your floor at home. Use one of the several towels to mop it up.The hotel has a garden (via the reception up some steps). I have to say, for a central location the setting for the garden was quiet and at night with the lights on, its a fab place to relax. PLEASE VISIT IT!The breakfast was varied, bacon, small sausages/frankfurters, spanish omlette, bread rolls, pastries, dougnuts, youghart, cheeses, ham, juices (pure orange), tea coffee etc etc and prob one of the best hotel breakfasts I have had in Spain. Again modern and stylish setting.In view, no hotel is perfect, if the shower leaks, dont panic, but you are staying at a hotel which has had a lot of money spent on it, a great deal of style implemented, staff that are friendly and trustworthy, a location perfect in everyway and a City I would rank as one of my favourites,Would I stay here again - yes I am back in 2 weeks. Suitable for all yes, but if you do like your beds very soft or like fluffy pillows and rose patterned curtains, this isnt for you as it is very 21st Century.

<Content>Mixed Feelings Great Locatatin but few problems The hotel has a great location, is very near las Ramblas in the Gotic Quarter on the center of the city, it has a subway station a few steps from the hotel so is easy to get around. Our experience was the following:-We arrived and our reservation was not on the sistem. So after arguing with the clerk at the front desk, there was no problem.-The rooms are very small.-The mini bar almost empty with few choices.-The bathroom is inadecuate, the door has no lock, all the water on the shower goes out.-The computers on the lobby DID NOT WORKED, ( the hotel advertises as a HIGH tech with free internet)-Cleaness OK.-Breakfast ok with natural orange juice.

<Content>Centrally located  Centrally, but quietly, located in a pedestrian street just off the Ramblas, the Petit Palace Opera Garden Ramblas was an ideal location for a few days in Barcelona. It was 5 minutes walk from Plaza Catalunya and the airport bus terminus, a minute from the Rambla, and 2 minutes from the Cathedral. We requested a quiet room and were given one overlooking the rear garden. Our room was upgraded to a Hi Tech room, which included a massage jet shower, flat screen TV  installed laptop (free connection). The bed seemed bigger than king size, and was very comfortable (room 1305), probably the best night's sleep ever in a hotel. Part of the Hi-Tech group, I believe the hotel was recently refurbished/opened, and is decorated in a modern minimalist style with a colour scheme of black, white and orange! Safe boxes in the room were free, and operated with your own credit card. The breakfast room and other public areas were a bit on the stark side. Comprehensive buffet breakfast. We paid euros 113 plus taxes for 2 of us, per night including breakfast. The published rate at reception was euros 275 (not sure if that was a standard room or hi-tech price). Overall, a good choice for a short break, where central location and a good night's sleep is important!

<Content>Great location The location is fantastic with a good tapas bar right opposite the front door. We found the black walled corridors a bit like a ghost train but the room was bright and cheerful if a bit small. We arrived about 8pm and literally only checked our email (good in room facility) and slept there for one night, any longer I think it would have been too small. Staff were pleasant and helpful, didn't sample the food. We got a good deal 107 euros so can't complain.

<Content>Lack of atmosphere Just back after 4 night stay in Petit Palace hotel in Barcelona. The hotel was very clean,was very central and the family room was ideal. On the down side it lacked atmosphere and there was no place to chill out after a busy day sightseeing. The bar area was very clinical as was the breakfast area.RegardsPat{ireland}
