<Content>Chic and Convenient We had a tough time settling on our hotels in Spain, and this was the last one we chose. It was a terrific selection and made our trip to Barcelona just that much better. First off, it's in a great location - off the main thoroughfares but exceptionally close to both the metro and the Aerobus stop (for a ridiculously easy trip to the airport on the morning we left). The lobby is just like the pictures - modern and sleek with couches and a piano. The man at the front desk most of the time we were there was a doll (!) and indulged all my questions and my rusty Spanish. The room was exactly as others have described. It's very clean and chic. It's true there's not a lot of privacy between the bathroom and the bedroom, but you can manage, and if you're a couple, it makes for a good laugh at times. We had a floor to ceiling window that opened up for fresh air and a view, but once it was closed, you couldn't hear a thing. The whole place was very quiet. We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't speak for the food, but the front desk was helpful with everything from restaurant recommendations to an adapter. This is just a terrific choice for a stay in Barcelona. Some of the other hotels we considered did look luxurious from the outside (montecarlo) and the lobby (1898), but I don't think you need to spend that kind of money to have a great time in Barcelona. The Petit Palace had plenty of character and sophistication and was much more affordable.

<Content>Excellent Stay at Petit Palace Museum Stayed here for Christmas. Excellent location, blocks away from everything you want to see. Simple to get to/from BCN, take the Blue bus from the airport to Plaza Catalunya (last stop) and walk about two blocks up and over (will take you 5-10 min). Buy the return ticket for about 7 Euros from the driver. The ticket machine at the airport bus stop requires exact change so just buy from driver (like everyone else). If you need to get oriented at the bus stop just ask the driver. We also had a map. So simple and cheaper than a taxi. Also there are Metro stops right around the corner.Room was not as big as those shown in some of the pictures. Probably a little bit bigger than the avg Euro hotel room but well planned. High ceilings. Clean and comfortable. Bathroom was nice and shower was excellent. Walk-in shower! No need to pole vault into the tub here as you do with most showers in Europe. Excellent water pressure and temperature. Other reviews suggest this may have been a problem in the past. In my travels, I have experienced a variance in water pressure/temp depending on when I shower and try to avoid peak shower times (as you would in a private home). I did notice that on the water on/off, is like a kitchen faucet, left/right=temp, out/up controls the pressure. I just mention it as my husband didn't know at first how to control the pressure.There's a frosted decal on the glass bathroom door now (or was in our room) for privacy. Looks like they responded to feedback. Thought that the snakeskin pattern tile in the bathroom was a neat ode to Gaudi as well as the picture on the bathroom door decal.Loved having a laptop with internet access in the room. Even with our guidebooks we found ourselves looking stuff up at the last minute. A-plus addition to the hotel experience. Didn't eat at the hotel but they did have room service and a restaurant. There's a little space in the mini-fridge for your water etc. Didn't use the phone. Didn't ask for help, but the front desk staff seemed happy and helpful and spoke English, and were patient with our poor Spanish. Cleaning staff was very nice and did a great job. Ordered a wake-up call which came at the proper time. They did have a clock/radio with alarm but I unplugged as the buttons are somewhat lit and the light bothered me. Strange how sensitive to light I can be when everything is dark.There were other people staying at the hotel but we never heard our neighbors. They either have excellent sound proofing or spaced us out considerably. I saw people in the lobby and on the elevator and even on our floor but didn't hear anyone within the room. Room was a bit warm (even after we monkeyed with temp control), we opened the window. You hear the occasional street noise or noise from people on the terraces but nothing that kept me up (I'm a light sleeper).Bed was clean and comfortable. On the firm side. Linens are very good quality, soft. Extra pillow in the cupboard/closet. No luggage rack. There's room on top of the cupboard for luggage but no collapsible luggage rack to put your bag on while unpacking. We used the chair to pack/unpack. No coffee/tea tray in room but Starbucks was open on Christmas morning!Excellent place to stay. We're fairly picky. We will stay here again and will checkout the other High Tech Hotels. Can't say enough nice things about our stay. You get full value and beyond for your money. Don't write reviews but felt compelled to do so about this place.Last 2 hotels we stayed in and liked: Sofitel St James in London, Hotel de Vendome in Paris.Also, on Christmas lots of restaurants around were open this year.

<Content>Very Nice hotel We enjoyed our stay at the hotel, it was as described on the website but perhaps the bedroom could have been bigger. We requested and got a balcony, which had views over the main street. The room was warm despite the freezing temperatures outside. We did not use the restaurant or had breakfast so we cannot comment on the food.Whilst the hotel was nice, we had a very poor experience at the El Raco restaurant around the corner, the staff spoke no English even though the menu was in English, the crepe starter was cold and our well done steak was raw. The chef stormed out and the waitress then turned our steak into charcoal. Avoid at all costs....

<Content>Funky boutique hotel We stayed in Petit Palace Museum for our first wedding anniversary at the end of November. My partner had been to Barcelona before and stayed at Barcelona Central which he absolutely raved about. However I really liked the look of this hotel on the website and the reviews were fantastic so we decided to give it a try. I am so glad - this hotel was exactly what I'd had in mind when I intially started looking at Barcelona. The entrance to the hotel is stunning with a wonderful grand piano in the foyer. The reception staff greeted us with warm smiles as we checked in which was a great start as hotel's like this sometimes can be a bit 'standoffish'. The room was lovely. The style of the room is very funky and ultra modern. I was particularly impressed by both this modern sleek style as well as the size of the room. We had a separate dressing area which was wonderfully luxurious for a city centre hotel. The bathroom was to die for. A large enough shower to fit in a whole rugby team - wonderful!! I can not say enough about this hotel. If you are looking for a good value, modern boutique in good location to all barcelona's amenities you must stay here.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed 4 nights in the Petit Palace Museum. The hotel was really nice, we had our own laptop in the room with free internet acess whenever we wanted. It came in very handy for looking up things to do or how to get around, and booking tickets. The room was lovely very nicely decorated, very modern, a good size, the bathroom was big with a fabulous shower! The only thing with the bathroom is that the bathroom door is glass without an awful lot of privacy but it didn't bother me. There is room service available to the rooms and also massage and beauty treatments available in your room after a long day sightseeing, we did nit avail of either but I thought it was a nice touch.The location of the hotel is great with only a ten min walk to Las Ramblas, shops and restaurants are even closer! I would definatley reccommend the hotel to anyone interested in a break in Barcelona.

<Content>Boutique palace The name caught my attention!! Petit palace museum..how cute and boutique-e i thought! Right at the top of the La Rambla (the main touristy street of Barca) a taxi ride costs about 23euros from Barca Airport. Hotel pictures on the website did not disappoint me and were absolutely accurate! Very chic interior and classy i would say! Paid for a high-tech room which was cool, had a plasma TV, funky IPOD stereo/charger/AMAZING HYDROSHOWER (!!!) and a great balcony view of the busy street. Room was spacious, tho i would highly recommend having a full length mirror in the room, also we booked for a king sized bed...it turned out to be 2 singles put together and the beds parted if you tried to sleep in the middle!! (not ideal for honeymooners!..and not funny if you fell down between the 2 beds in the middle of the night)..also to mention, laptop with free webacess was useful for searching all the opening times of tourist places to go the day before!Didn't go for the breakfast...15Euros per person was a bit steep!Bad points about the hotel: banging/drilling work was done one early morning! not good!Room Card sometimes failed to work...had to keep getting it re-activated!Staff was great help, didn't involve them too much during the stay becuase we was out and about most of the time, but if you do get a cheap deal on this hotel, defo go for it, you won't ever stay in another hotel like this!!

<Content>Amazing!! Booked through lastminute.com in August, flew from Manchester, two days before we left! We're both nineteen. We absolutely loved the hotel, perfect location just above Placa de Catelyuna and Las Ramblas. It should be a 5* hotel..rooms are huge..gorgeous..laptop with free internet, lcd tv and mini bar in room..can't stress how perfect this hotel is! Great staff and we would recommend hiring the free bikes to explore Barcelona in a different way! We would return tomorrow if we could!!

<Content>Penthouse with yacuzzi! We booked our trip at Lastminute.se and were positively suprised (read: chocked!!) to found out that we got the penthouse with a 50 m2 terrace and outdoor yacuzzi!! What a stay...We started every night with champagne  wine in the water under the open sky. Do I need to mention that the location of the hotel was the best possible with two blocks to Casa Batll贸 (Gaudi), close to the beach, clubs and placa de Catalunya etc. Cool design of the interiour, nice staff and lots of extras.

<Content>Such a good time My girlfriend took me here for my birthday; she chose this hotel as she thought I might appreciate it as a designer. I absolutely adored the place, the rooms where very fun, with some lovely furniture and buckets of space. The bathrooms where just incredible (hydro-showers!) We had a view out of the back of the hotel, which looked on to a huge dilapidated old building which was just stunning. The location was perfect. Overall I can鈥檛 speak more highly of this hotel. If I ever went back to Barcelona I won鈥檛 even bother looking at what else there is out there, as this has it all!

<Content>Really liked this hotel Date: August 4th 2008The staff at the Hotel were helpful, we had a 22 month old with us whom needed his milk bottles washing everyday  they provided us with warm milk when needed. If we asked, they would give information on sight seeing but options on different travel method was not offered. Theres aircon in the room, the balcony was not very big to enjoy a sit down, food  drink was very expensive in the hotel, my cup of tea was 10euros. The hydro shower was lovely but the shower tray was very slippery for our baby! There was not alot of room from the beds end to the desk where the laptop  tv is set  because the bedframe has sharp edges, it is pretty dangerous for baby.I read a review here on not being able to find the DVD, CD player, well i've worked it out for you, its all in the laptop! :-)There were only 3 english channels, so there was not much to watch, the news was a repeat.Its location is great for shopping  places to eat.

<Content>really nice This hotel was a real surprise for me.Much more than expected from a 4* hotel.I booked a double room + a child and it was huge in size.The room design is very modern and stylish. All rooms are equipped with laptops with free internet and a gacuzi!. They even had free bicycle renting. The location is great,10 min walk to the ramblas, 2 min walk to the shopping street and the metro station. Restaurants are just next doors.Very friendly and experienced staff, they can help with all your tourist questions.The hotel is very child friendly.The breakfast was good.The only complain is that the bathroom had liitle privacy; the door is transparent and unlockable. Should be ok if you don鈥檛 have kids.I recommend this hotel for all.

<Content>ideal hotel for sightseeing and comfort stayed at this hotel from 30th june for 4 days.on arrival the receptionist was welcoming and informative.the hotel is ideally situated for all the sights of barcelona.the rooms are comfortable, and the bathroom was to die for. after a long day sightseeing, the power shower was heaven and so ivigorating. We stayed on a B  B basis, breakfast consisted of cereals, fruit juices, hot and cold selection, toast and jams, and tea or coffee, enough to set you up for a days sightseeing.We found the tourist bus an ideal way of seeing all the sights, you can buy a day or a 2 day ticket, you have commentry on the bus, and you can get on and off at all the attractions you wish to. The buses are very frequent (every 10 min or so ) There is so much to see and do in Barcelona, we are definately going back, and this hotel is an ideal base, being only 5 to 10 min walk from the ramblas.

<Content>Nice Hotel - Great Location Stayed at this hotel for a few days in June. Nice hotel - very modern room and bathroom with excellent shower. Room had a small balcony also. We overlooked the street, but this wasn't a problem as it was quiet. We did not eat at the hotel as prices were quite steep, but the location was excellent and only a short walk to restaurants and Las Ramblas. The staff on reception spoke very good English and were helpful. The hotel had a bar area, but there was never anyone in it during our stay, so we didn't use it.Barcelona is a lovely city and we would return. The tour buses that cover various routes are a good option for sightseeing - and you can get on and off the bus whenever you like as the ticket is valid for the whole day. There are also two metro stations within a few minutes walk of the hotel. Overall - great city and great hotel - would return.

<Content>Great hotel, lovely room and perfect location I had a brilliant experience at the Petit Palace. We were four girls travelling together for a short break. I came across this hotel as it was one of a few which offered a room all for of us could stay in together. We had a family room which was a very good size and came complete with a huge bath which was almost a hot tub! we also had not only bedroom and bathroom but a dining area and not one but four televisions! The hotel and room were of a very high quality and as there were four of us sharing it was very reasonably priced. The facilities were also great and we found it quite useful having a laptop and free internet access in the room when in a city we hadn't visited before. We didn't have any passwords etc to use the internet which a previous traveller had complained about. The location is brilliant, a short walk for the Metro and right next to Las Ramblas. We found the staff extremely polite and helpful. All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city.

<Content>Lovely but not good value! Generally a nice hotel in a great location but not value for money. It was on average in total 拢140 per night, not including breakfast. We chose not to have breakfast there as it was 15euro each.The bed was hard and the pillows even harder. The shower was brilliant, as was the location.Staff are friendly but just don't seem to go the extra mile for you. Free internet access via a laptop in the room but no coffee/tea making facilities.Not a great nights sleep due to the comfort of the bed.If you're after a great location and an awesome shower then go for it.If value for money and comfort is what you're after, look elsewhere.

<Content>'petit palace' is no palace much of the staff was terribly rude, many of the features were not what they were advertised, for instance the high tech features turned into my having to ask for passwords for my internet usage on my personal computer three times. Go elsewhere. This was a buisiness/tourist stay for me, if I had to do it again I would stay in a warmer, more friendly place. The architect had fun designing the place but it isn't like friendly Barcelona at all, and it isn't even comfortable.

<Content>A very pleasant surprise The hotel was a surprise from the very beginning: great location, next to La Rambla De Catalu帽a, great design, big open lobby, polite receptionist, great corridor design, big beautiful room (for a single traveler), huge bed.The staff was helpful and very nice, you could even play a piano in the reception (almost like everything's allowed). Very modern design, but comforting at the same time (some of High Tech chain is a little too modern).Great room, very beautiful, huge bed.Big bathroom with jacuzzi bath, equipped with champoo and bath gel, and also a comb, dryer, etc. I did not hear any neighbors, drilling, or whatever I read in other reviews. Absolutely quiet.This hotel is ideal for single travelers, however I imagine it can be good for any business travelers and tourists, for travelers with pets, for couples and honeymooners.Minuses: small wardrobe, the balcony door did not close and nobody cared, neither me, although I informed the reception.Pluses: everything else.I reserved it on the hotel website, paying in total in advance (it was the best price on internet), and I paid 155 euros per night.

<Content>Fantastic place! I stayed at this hotel last week with my husband, daughter (5) and son (3). I am really fussy when it comes to hotels and holidays and research like crazy. This hotel did not fail to impress! We decided to take a taxi from El Prat airport to the hotel and it took 15 minutes and cost 鈧?4 (this was at lunchtime). The taxi pulled up and we were 'wow!'. The hotel is very stylish. Reception staff were very friendly and checked us in quickly and efficiently. We went to our room and it was enormous! We had a family room so had a double bed plus bunkbeds. The kids loved the bunk beds as they had their own little tv sets with cartoons. Our room had 2 large wardrobes, a minibar, safe (free), large TV and laptop with free fast internet access. The bathroom was also very big and had a stylish handbasin, hairdryer, toilet and large bath with hydroshower. The water was piping hot and very powerful and was an absolute joy. There was a step to help people get in and out of the bath and plenty of places to put your soap and shower gel. The breakfast would have cost us 鈧?6 per person per day but we found a lovely Spanish cafe just 1 minute away (La Tramoia) where we ate and it only cost a TOTAL of 鈧?4 ( we had juice, coffee, toast and croissants for 4 people). The hotel is in a great location - only 2 blocks from Placa Catalunya and the top of La Rambla. It took only 5 minutes to walk here. The Placa Catalunya is where the tourist bus starts and we took a 2 day ticket on this and used this as our transport in Barcelona. It took us everywhere we wanted to go and we just got off and on at each place. The kids loved it, too, especially sitting upstairs on the opentop and enjoying the warm sunshine.I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It was stylish, quiet, great location, friendly helpful staff. The negative points that people have mentioned in previous reviews have all been taken care of by the hotel ( I presume they read this and take note?). The water was hot and powerful, there was a step and rail to get in shower/bath, the elevator didn't creak, the lobby was all one level so no little bits to trip over. Will definitely be staying here if we ever return to Barcelona!

<Content>I will be back Have been here for one night and it has been very good. The room has been outstanding. Clearly above average. Large. All amenities available. Including WiFi for free. Contrary to other contributions I found the staff very kind and helpfull. Always a smile. And that helps sometimes a lot. The Lobby was Ok and very design. Breakfast buffet was sufficient and all you could wish for. Location is pefect. Close to Placa de Cataluna and at some distance of the other purely touristic places. A good starting point. Will defenitely go back. This is a chain hotel. Have also gone to BCN Hotel which was less amazing. Saw one in the old town with same style which I might try next time.

<Content>Undiscovered Gem! This hotel was a wonderful surprise for my family and me. We booked a room there because we could put all 4 members of my family (two adults, two teens) in one family room. This is really hard to find in Spain without resorting to renting an apartment. When we arrived, we were so pleased to find out that they had upgraded us to a junior suite upon discovering that it was my husband's birthday on our check-in date. Our room had a 6-person hot tub and a huge, walk-in shower. The hotel was sleek and had a trendy boutique feel. We had plenty of room to spread out and wished we were staying longer instead of leaving for Madrid the next day. The hotel is located in a nice part of town, but is not near Las Ramblas, if that is what you are looking for. It was fairly quiet. When our son did something (!) to the toilet and caused it to run constantly, they sent up a maintenance person and had it fixed within the hour. The front desk personnel were friendly, welcoming and helpful. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to any traveller. Great value for the price - and a fun, funky place!

<Content>Great hotel but not for older couples Very nice hotel and efficient staff. Very modern decor which was refreshing. However, the shower/tub was very dangerous and definitely not for mature couples or persons with disabilities. There was no handle on the shower wall to assist getting in and out of the tub/shower which was quite high. Aside from this, we enjoyed our stay.

<Content>Good Location, shame about comfort When booking we went for location and this hotel didn't let us down. Near enough to get to most sights, including several very good cafes and restaurants, but out of the main busy streets, so night times were very quiet. The staff were very helpful, polite and spoke good English.The hotel is very modern with a stylish interior, but this can be its downside. When going for style, someone missed out, comfort, in the brief. Would have been good to have comfortable seating in bedrooms and reception. Also whoever designed the bathrooms, never checked out its practicality. In our room we had a bath with overhead shower. Admittedly a very good shower, but as the shower screen was fixed to the bath, it meant it was very difficult and dangerous getting in and out of the bath. I can see an accident waiting to happen! Ask for a bedroom with a separate shower cubicle.As this is supposed to be a High Tech Hotel, where was CD player?Overall I would recommend this hotel on location, but not to elderly people, people with back legs/ back or other minor disability, or someone looking for comfort.

<Content>Great Value I stayed here for two night in September 2007. I found the hotel to be in an excellent location - about a 5 min walk to the top of La Ramblas, which was good as it was away from the noise etc. The room was clean and tidy and was of good size. It is very modern looking with flat screen tvs, laptops etc. The room i had provided free internet access which as amazing - very helpful. We also had a room with a hydro massaging shower, which was good to however the water wasn't as hot as i like it to be. However this was my only fault with the room. Whilst i was staying at the hotel renovations were being carried out. I knew this at the time of book and hence why the room was so cheap for a 4 star hotel. As i wasn't in the hotel during the day it didn't both us at all, however they did start work about 7.30am which did wake me up on both mornings. Overall a lovely hotel which i would recommend to friend and would go return to.

<Content>Amazing Hotel We stayed here for 3 nights as a treat for ourselves after missing out on a summer vacation; and any disappointment in missing out were instantly dispelled as the taxi pulled up outside the hotel and we saw what looked like the most stylish hotel we have ever stayed in.The reception area is very smart and modern with designer sofas, black marble, mood lighting and flat screen tv's, backed up by helpful and freindly staff.And when we entered our room, we was greeted by the same stylish design and quality, along with very celver mood lighting. The room was very modern and decorated with some real subtle flair.But our favourite was the bathroom which whilst it had a designer basin and toilet, the best was the huge shower cubicle (plenty big enough for two) and with the most fantastic shower, with body jets that could knock you out the bathroom when turned up to full power.This hotel is situated in a pefect place to see the city, sited just off the top of the Ramblers, just away from all the noise so nice and peaceful at night and is just around the corner from the Metro (Passige de Gracia) and Gaudis two buildings, Casa Batlo and Casa Mila.If you want to feel like you have stayed somewhere special and you fancy treating you partner to a bit of luxury (its worth it guys, trust me) and you want to be somewhere central for sight seeing, then I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

<Content>Excellent hotel, great location. the hotel is a short 5minute walk from the main palza in barcelona and right above the ramblas area, great location for shopping and dining in barcelona. during my stay at the hotel, i found everything was clean and there was a maid service everyday. the laptops in the room were useful, bathroom was compact but clean and modern; there was pretty much nothing i could fault our room on.the only downside to this hotel was the fact that there was still some very noisy building work being carried out which started up at 8am most days.the staff were attentive and spoke great english, the lobby area was clean and modern, and i found great last minute rates on [--], making the whole stay a lot cheaper than advertised on its website.overall a great hotel for a short break for a young couple, highly recommended.

<Content>Good, will be better when copleted Stayed at this hotel between 22nd and 28th August, with my wife and two children.It had only been open a week and therefore all the facilities were not available however it was a very stylish hotel and I would recommend it.I went with my wife and two daughters (12  5) and stayed in one of the family rooms. The room itself was quite strange it had two areas one quite cramped with the a large double bed and two bunk beds, tv, wardrobes, mini fridge etc and the second had a sofabed, huge windows that were the whole length and height of the room but nothing else in it. It seemed a waste of the space, but I suppose it may be developed more in the future.There was a laptop with free internet access and each of the bunk beds had a small tv screen that could be pulled out of the wall, which the kids enjoyed despite only one english channel being available. MTV in German and Disney Channel in Spanish seemed to appeal to them.My only real complaints about the room would be the lack of wardrobe space, there was only enouggh room for 1 person's clothes and as you could potentially have 6 people staying there if the sofabed was used this was nowhere near enough. Also despite the shower being superb ( you can have the water coming out sideways if you want ) there is nowhere to put the soap and shampoo.The hotel is fairly central, it is only a five minute walk to a couple of different metro stations and also to Las Ramblas.Overall very stylish but not 100% practical, but I would go again.

<Content>Loved It! The hotel itself was lovely, very modern, friendly staff and luxrious rooms. You could tell it had not been open long as lots of things did not seem very established, for example, the bar in the lobby did not open one night we were there, there was no information in the room about the hotel, restaurant etc. The staff were really friendly though and dealt with any questions we had. The only problem we had was we had to change rooms 2 nights into our stay due to a problem with the hot water. This, although inconvinient for us was apologised for profusely by staff. Once we had moved we had no other problems.The room had its own laptop, flat screen television, air conditioning and hydro shower as suggested on the website which added to the luxurious feel. The hotel on the whole was very clean, only downside was the maid obviously has sneaky fags on her way round leaving the rooms smelling of smoke!Breakfast was included in our package price and although nice was nothing special, would recommend rather than pay to have it at the hotel go and have it in a nice cafe of which there are plenty around!!
