<Content>Very Dirty Our hotel was very unclean. Our standard room looks very worn and the bathroom has very dirty floors and black mold growing in the shower. There is a strong odour of mildew from the shower curtain. The location is great - right next to Tin Hau station, but I would definitely not stay here again.

<Content>Recommendable Hotel, going to stay here again I paid $180USD for this hotel during Dec 07, and I thought it was a bit too pricey, but then, it was a business trip and I found the room very spacious in HK standard, and it was very clean throughout the bathroom, the beds, the sheets, the towels. I like the fact that the hotel staffs are strictly enforcing the non-smoking policy and that's good. This hotel is located within walking distance to Victoria Park, and MTR stations, and many bus stops, including bus stops that will take you to airport, which is awesome! I am going back again in a couple weeks for leisure this time, and the rate now is $110 (booked through Orbitz) due to poor economy, and I think this is a great deal. I'd not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Find another hotel... We stayed at this hotel during the last 1 1/2 weeks of 2008. We had booked a standard room but was pleasantly surprised when they upgraded us to a suite. But that positive aspect wore off quickly. Pros: Close to MTR station, free water bottles (2) and quiet area of Causeway Bay, for the most part the staff was friendly and accomodatingCons: Unclean rooms, smoke smell for a non-smoking room, lack of free internet in room, weird room layout, a hair dryer with a button that had to be constantly pressed on for it to stay onThe restaurant is nice looking but for the price it was not really a place I'd go back to. This is an artistic looking hotel, but more of it was form rather than function. The bathroom layout was just bizarre! We had a bathtub that was not enclosed by any private walls. We probably wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Would not stay here again Stayed here on the last leg of a 3 week trip through China. Hotel is very dated for a new hotel. Workout area is terrible. Pool was okay(we never used it but it looked nice and clean)The rooms were small and had a unclean feel. My husband and I each had some type of insect bite on our legs and back after leaving the hotel. Although, the hotel is located close to the subway, the hotel was not conveniently located to the local attractions of Hong Kong. Of the 5 hotels used throughout our travel the L' Hotel was the worst. The breakfast was only okay. The staff was pleasant.Would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Reasonable budget style hotel We checked in for 4 nights for a birthday celebration. Our first night we noticed a rather bad musty smell however we were so tired from a half day travel, we put up with it for the night and escaped for a day of shopping quite early the next day. After returning, the smell was quite incredible and so we asked to be moved. A couple of room changes later (we were moved to a smoking room and then a twin single bed room) we were accommodated on the 37th floor in a room that was reasonably clean but most importantly did not smell.This is definately not a 4 star hotel, but rather a good 3.5 star Hotel. It is conveniently located next to a MTR Station and the staff are pleasant and accommodating. It would be more realistic though to pitch this Hotel for what it is, and that is a good solid budget option to the 4 and 5 Star Hotel chains we all know such as Sheraton, Conrad, Marriott, etc.This place is very cheap (around 1,000HKD per night) by HK standards, and if you can put up with EXTREMELY hard beds and a little bit of rough around the edges then it is a very good hotel for you. For a new Hotel it was a little bit knocked around and the room we ultimately ended up in was a adjoining room which was noisy when the other guests were present. Overall, I probably wouldnt stay here again, but I would recommend it to others if they are staying on a budget and need something reasonable.

<Content>Love the location Good points:perfect location for anyone who want travel to anywhere in HK or Kowloon but don't like the hustle bustle of Mongkok or Causewaybay.Tin Hau MTR station is right opposite the hotel.Causewaybay shopping haven is just one stop by MTR.Many cheap eateries, supermarket nearby.The hotel price is right on the money.Love the mattress  the size of the room ( not big but not small by HK standard)Bad points:Only 2 free internet terminals downstairs in the lobby and there is always people queuing for it. If some kids stayed there watching video or playing games on the net then good luck.Couple of nights I could hear TV, people talking from next doorand one time people upstairs was moving furniture aroundin the middle of the nite. Though it said Harbour view hotel ; I found it misleading as it is smack bang in the middle of concrete jungle and can hardly see the harbour.To be fair it is not bad for the price  location and I would stay there again.

<Content>I would not hesitate to come back to this property Great location, right across from Tin Hau MTR (subway station) - provides fast access to the whole city. Is a more residential area and offers a more pleasant street experience than having to deal with all of the hawkers in Kowlown. Hotel is clean, staff are friendly and helpful. Hotel doesn't tell you that high speed internet access is available at a very low cost ($300 HKD for 30 days). Pool area on top of hotel offers great views. Used American Laundry across the street, 2 bags of laundry cost 90 HKD (great deal.)Restaurant is reasonable for price, and food is good. Staff are very polite and efficient.PCCW Mobile offers a pay as you go phone package with a free international calling option.

<Content>Good Value ! Stayed here recently. Good value for money. The location is excellent - across the Tin Hau MTR and within walking distance to Causeway Bay shopping areas - Sogo etc.There are a few eateries nearby along the main road - try Cafe Coral - excellent menu with variety of choices.The room in the hotel is clean - try to get upper levels - good view of the surrounding - excellent night view. There is no carpet in the room - parquet and tiles and hence they are kept extra clean. The toilets are in good condition as well.Highly recommended !

<Content>Great Value! We booked our two night stay at L'Hotel through Skoosh, and everything worked out perfectly. The hotel staff was quick in answering any email inquiry I had, including how to get from the airport to the hotel. We arrived at 9am and they let us check in early. We were able to shower after the long flight from Los Angeles and get to sightseeing right away. The room was clean and bright on the 15th floor, but the view was directly into the neighboring highrise building. Service was efficient but impersonal and the location of the hotel was right across the street from the Tin Hau subway station. We found the dim sum across the street at Viking Seafood Restaurant to be quite good and affordable.The room did not include Internet access, which was a let down. There are two Internet terminals in the lobby for guests' use, but they were frequently occupied.Overall, I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>very good hotel and travel tip We arrived tired after a long flight from London. It was just after the Chinese New year, I believe a quiet time for hotels, we were welcomed by very friendly staff and were upgraded to a suite on the 23rd floor overlooking Hong Kong and the bay. The room was very well appointed and very very clean and comfortable. We only stayed the one night as we were joining a cruise the next day. We did not eat in the Hotel but did see the restaurant on the first floor which looked very nice.After the cruise we returned to the Hotel (not upgraded this time but given a superior room) again this room was well appointed and very clean. Check out is 12 noon which allows loads of time for a lay in. Travel tips in Hong Kong.. get an octopus card $150 (HK) you can use the train, bus and trams with this card it is so easy to use and you get $50 back when you hand it in. We used it to go to the 'Big Buda', all areas of Hong Kong, Kawloon and to the markets in Stanley .The public transport is great and we did not have to top the card up once! On your last day you can go to the Central Rail Station in Hong Kong (from 6am onwards) and check in your bags for your flight (we even sorted out our flight seats) leaving you bag free all day.

<Content>Smart  Having been to HK numerous times I decided to stay in a part not visited before. This hotel is right opposite Tin Hau MTR station which is four short stops away from Central. So it is a bit outside the regular tourist area but very accessible. As I was there for a week this was not a problem. The hotel looks fairly new. It is a tall slim building, all glass and chrome.Each floor only has about 8 rooms. We were on the 32nd floor with stunning views of the skyscrapers. The rooms are very modern and quite trendy. The floors are wooden so you can hear people upstairs moving around.They have all the usual things, toiletries, slippers, tv, coffee making facilites ect.We did not use the hotel coffee shop and the bar was closed. Also the swimming pool was empty and was locked so you could not even go out to look at the views even thought it was very warm and sunny.All in all the hotel is perfectly adequate considering the little amount of time you spend in it. Though I would not advise anyone on a short stopover to stay there, it would be worth paying the extra to be more Central.We had a fab time as always. We purchased the hotel  flight together and found it was excellent value for money.

<Content>Little Disappointing After staying at the MetroPark Hotel in Causeway Bay, the L'Hotel was quite disappointing. This is not a 4* hotel, more a 3*. It's located opposite the Metro Station which is good. The reception staff were polite and helpful. We found our room to be extremely cold and were told that the heat had been switched off, which I found surprising given that it's winter in Hong Kong. The room was on the small side, but clean and the bathroom was an adequate size and clean. The bed was like a concrete slab and not very comfortable. I would not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Not very clean, just average Stayed at this hotel for several nights. Some general information:Located in Causway Bay, right next to the Tian Hou (Tin Hau) Metro station. To Causway Bay shopping area about 5 min by tram or 15 min walk. There are plenty of very good dining options around the hotel. But to the hotel. It's supposed to be a new hotel, but it is already worn:- They say it's a design hotel - it looks cheap. Bathroom looks like a operation theatre- My room, especially bathroom was not cleaned properly. Dirt in the corners, baisin lacked thourogh cleaning, glass appliances looked dirty. Bathtub appliances were limy.- All in all, room made a rather neglected impression, especially for a new four star hotel.- Internet is 300 HKD / 28 Euro / ca. 38 USD per month - expenisive, as other hotel don't charge at all- Staff was ok, but not very friendly. Concierge service was rather unfriendly.If you need to stay at Tian Hou area, pick the Metropark Hotel. It's 100 meteres away, offers free internet, excellent staff and clean rooms.

<Content>Great stay at the l Hotel Stayed at the L Hotel in HK during the last week of Dec and first weekof Jan. Had a great stay...rooms were small, but typical HK size I would say. They have a nice sized table and two chairs in the room which is helpful to put a laptop. Rooms were clean and customer service was great.Really nice and large sized bathroom, with heated floors! Housekeepingdid a good job of cleaning the rooms when I was gone.Hotel is convenient to Causeway Bay, only a few minute tram ride away for only 2HKD.Internet was quick via ethernet cable and two bottles of water are provided daily. Refridgerator is available in the room too, under the tv. My only gripe would be the relatively slow elevators and lack of an iron in the room...but with a call to housekeeping they brought it up quickly, usually less than 5 mins so that was not really an issue. Also, there are only a few hotel rooms per floor so the hotel is quietand didn't experience any noise issues on the 23rd floor.TV was OK with a lot of chinese channels, some austrailian and german tv as well. No american channels though I did see StarTV once in awhile which has US shows.All in all you should be satisfied and I'd be surprised if you were disappointed, unless you are expecting a 5* establishment.

<Content>good for the money! Visited on October 07 - location was great - not too near the hustle and bustle - and just 5 mins walk from all the shopping anyone could need! The park across the road gave us the space to relax on the way home and watch all kinds of sports on the way. Convenient for the MTR and buses also. One point to note - there is a massive sign outside saying 'BAR' - we asked where it was - and the staff said they didn't have one - we asked on another day later on during the stay and was told it was within the restaurant, this was a little confusing to say the least - so we didn't bother. Rooms clean, staff friendly enough - although not that knowledgable. A pleasant stay all round

<Content>Nice clean Hotel 1. The 8 of us stayed in 3 rooms for 3 nights. A nice clean hotel. 2. Tin Hau MTR station is just downstairs across the road. 3. No problem finding food, there are lots of eateries and bakeries within walking distance near the hotel. There is even vegetarian.4. We have 2 rooms with extra bed. A word of advice, the extra bed is really small. With the additional bed, there aren't walking space, i have to shift the coffee table and seats to one corner of the room. If I knew the bed is that small, i would have paid a bit more for another room.5. But overall, a pleasant stay here.

<Content>Excellent Little Boutique Hotel L'Hotel is a great place to stay in Hong Kong. It is a neat little boutique hotel, there is not a lot of great shopping or restaurants around. However, it is a quick walk to Victoria park, which is nice. Conveniently located right across from an MTR stop so its a quick ride to just about anywhere in Hong Kong. Rooms are neatly decorated. The small rooftop pool and work out facility is nice as well. Free internet access in the lobby, but you have to pay for it in your room. We found it was best to buy it for the our whole stay for about $35. Never ate at the Hotel restaurant, because there is really no reason to when you're in Hong Kong. Concierge was very helpful.

<Content>Very new and convenient, good value Got very good rate on Wotif and it was very close to Causeway Bay so I didn't hesitate. When we arrived at the hotel we were pleasantly surprised by how new and modern the place looks. The whole building was built 2 years ago from what I heard, so it's not some old formerly-nasty-but-refurbished building like a lot of places in HK are. Room was a decent size, still slightly on the small side, but efficient and nicely decorated. Naturally, everything is still new and in good condition. I got a room on the 31st floor, and the view from my room was brilliant. They have this clever little sensor that turns the room entrance light on when you walk towards the bathroom, which is very handy at night. Overall, very good room with all the essentials. The hotel is just across the street from Tin Hau station, literally. It's one stop away from CWB station and there are a lot of small restaurants around the area that are open into the late hours of the night. Also the convenient store chain Watson's is next to the hotel so it's a breeze to buy things you need. Maybe this is why the mini bar in the room is completely empty. I like this location very much, as it is close enough to CWB but away from the craziness. Breakfast was not included in the good rate I got, but I tried the breakfast here anyway. It was all right, could have been better in terms of variety. Main grouses -- I don't know if the walls here are thin or if it's because they put me in an adjoining room with my colleague but I could hear her in her room. If I could hear her cough and blow dry her hair then she can hear me. It didn't give me a feeling of privacy. Also, I know it's not standard but it is always a nice touch to provide free internet in the room. Here they still ask you to pay. I would've given this place 5 points if it weren't for these 2 things. However, it is still a very nice hotel with great value and I would recommend this place to anyone and would stay here again.

<Content>Poor value for money A group of us(14 people) have just returned from a tour of China and Hong Kong. We stayed in six different hotels,all were excellent except L Hotel in Hong Kong.The rooms were small ,the fridges were kept empty and the bathrooms were not cleaned properlyThe food at the LHotel was of very poor quality.The staff especially the management were rude and miserable.They would not give us directions to nearby places because they said it was off their map,we found it was only four stops away on the local underground train.We had to go to a nearby hotel to get help with information. The staff were surley and at times rude....some would not talk when we greeted them with Good Morningor Good evening.They only acknowledge us when it was tipping time.!!When the management spoke it was in a harsh and severe tone in Chinese although I did hear them speak in English. I would not recommend this hotel ,there are others in the vecinity which I would go to in th future

<Content>nice change My husband loves to visit Hong Kong and we usually stay at the three Marco Polo hotels in TST. But last week, we stayed at L'Hotel in Causeway Bay. It was a refreshing change. The air is cleaner, the streets are not crowded. The hotel room was smaller but it was very clean and they tried their best to make our stay most comfortable (at less than US$100 a night, our room had a breakfast nook and a soothing view of a forested hill). There were very few English-speaking TV channels and the hotel staff were not very proficient in English but they were very accommodating (the rate that we paid is for a smoking room on a floor not higher than the 11th. But when they learned that I have asthma, they gave us a non-smoking room on a non-smoking 22nd floor). It is a little out-of-the-way compared to TST but the MTR station across the hotel makes it very accessible . We were happy at the proximity of a Wellcome supermarket, a bakeshop and a Cafe de Coral. I was even able to get brand new items at a Salvation Army in Wing Hing Street two blocks away. We will stay at this hotel again, God-willing. Thanks to all the tripadvisor members who wrote good reviews about this hotel!

<Content>Great value for money Just back from a weeks stay in Hong Kong at L'Hotel. Just opposite Tin Hau MTR station so really handy for getting around Hong Kong. Rooms are good size- expected them to be really small - but more than enough room for two adults in a double room.Get Octopus cards at the airport and then get the E11 bus from the airport to Tin Hau bus station - just next to the Tin Hau MTR and only across the road to L'Hotel - cost approx 拢1.50 when compared to taxi fare of approx 拢30 (although taxi was worth it after a long flight!). Journey time on both occasions was approx 45 mins to 1hour.Reception and concierge staff were all helpful. Don't try to find the bar as is 'under construction' but staff in restaurant are good and will sort out for you to sit at one of the tables in the restaurant-even though it gets busy in there.2 bottles of water provided every day in room which was really good as weather was very hot and humid.Found the district to be more quieter than the others but was more authentic on a night - not a major tourist area but all people very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Good value hotel We stayed at L'Hotel for 3 nights in July as part of a package with Cathay Pacific, on the recommendation of our travel agent.It is a newish hotel, quite modern in design, and the rooms were large by Hong Kong standards. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom clean and modern. We stayed on the 38th floor and had a view over nearby buildings and some parkland, which was fine.The staff at the hotel were very helpful, and most of them spoke very good English which was unexpected. The concierge organised airport transfers for us, as well as a day tour of Hong Kong, and reception staff were efficient and friendly. We were given a late checkout due to the time of our flight at no extra charge. There was free internet access in the lobby and free bottles of water in our room. Overall the staff service was excellent. We thought it was extremely good value for money.We did not have breakfast while we were there, but did try the lunch buffet (midweek) once, which we thought was quite good value, with a buffet plus a la carte main course for 88 HK dollars. The kids especially loved the desserts. It was a mixture of Chinese and Western food.Probably the only downside we found at this hotel was the location, which could be good or bad depending on what you are looking for. It is a bit out of the centre of things, although the MTR station is across the road, and it was only 5-10 mins to the centre of Hong Kong.

<Content>Value for money I stayed in this hotel from 05-10 Jul 2007. Overall, this hotel meets my expectations and value for money. The room is small but given it is in HK, it is reasonable. I stayed in 37th floor which have a great view on the The Peak and a small part of the harbour. The location is great. Opposite Tin Hau MTR, 1 stop away from Causeway and there are few restaurants and a 7-Eleven nearby. MTR fare from Tin Hau to Causeway is HKD4. Also, it takes about 10 mins of walking thru the Victoria Park to reach shopping area in Causeway. You can also experience Tram ride to Causeway. 5 stops from the hotel to Times Square. Tram fare is HKD2. One disadvantage that I found is that the hotel doesn't have a covered front porch for guest to get down from car or taxi where make it difficult during rainy days. So happen that it is raining when I reached the hotel on my first day. The hotel staff had to run to me with an umbrella. Fortunately for me, no rain for the rest of my stay. The check-in is fast and the staffs are friendly. There also 2 PC for free internet access at the lobby. Didn't try their breakfast but finding food to eat in HK is never a problem. Enjoyable stay and recommended for those who want to stay away from the busy shopping area.

<Content>Poor experience I stayed two weeks in this hotel by the end of May. It鈥檚 a so-called harbor view hotel with no harbor view except you鈥檙e assigned to 36th floor or above. Regular room size is acceptable for a typical hotel in Hong Kong, but smaller than expected as what we鈥檝e seen on their office website. Towels are somewhat dirty. Toilet seats are stained for the two rooms I served with my family, as photos showed by other traveler from this web. Bed size is good but bed sheets are not replaced daily for long stay clients. Hardwood floor instead of carpet in room would be a good design of avoiding smelly after years. However, it鈥檚 a bit noisy since there鈥檚 no carpet to absorb the noise. Residence from next door closing the closet door or banging the washroom sliding door produced noise in late evening. The sliding door is light and loose so everyone slams it on closing. Walls in room are stained unevenly, and doesn鈥檛 like a new hotel at all. Hallway is hot but elevator is cold. Some residence smokes on non-smoking floors, and sometimes even the elevator is full of smoking smell. Pool and exercise room closed very early. Sauna that mentioned on their website becomes invisible. I can鈥檛 find it in exchange room on 39th floor or no sign for it at all. Where is it? Staffs were very inattentive. The hotel is not facing the main street. Staffs at door were not insisting of getting transport vehicle like taxi to visitors, especially on rainy day. Worst of all, there鈥檚 no first aid in this hotel. I hurt my leg in hotel due to their sudden construction on hallway. There鈥檚 no notice or precaution advice to residences. They were neither providing first aid support to me nor compensate on my medication, but only with a discount on consumption of their restaurant. But they mentioned online that they鈥檝e 鈥渄octor service on request鈥? One of the three elevators has been out-of-service for more than a week. It鈥檚 extremely poor on management.I tried their buffet lunch once, not too bad except pricy. Like other travelers experience, only one fast food restaurant on the same side of the road and McDonald鈥檚 across the street with a few other restaurants. There are not many choices in walking distance. You鈥檝e to take a ride to Causeway Bay to get better dining and more varieties. Overall, I would also recommend a pass on this hotel, unless you just wish to take an economy rate and only for short stay.

<Content>Great hotel for the price We booked this hotel as part of a package with Cathay Pacific where the flight from Amsterdam plus five nights cost little more than the flight itself. I checked online when we were there (late May 2007) and standard rooms at this time of year were available for 鈧?20, given the location and quality of the hotel this is excellent value. Located just over the road from the Tin Hau metro system it is a modern glass and steel block. On checking in we were offered an executive harbour view room for an extra 鈧?0 per night. This we took and were rewarded with a 37th floor room with magnificent views over the harbour.The room was a reasonable size for Hong Kong. There was a good size double bed. The mattress was on the firm side for our liking but it was comfortable enough. By the window there was a glass topped occasional table and two chairs. Here we spent many hours watching the activity in the harbour as the occasional eagle flew past our window. Along one wall was the ubiquitous combined working surface, dressing table and baggage storage area. Under this were ample drawers and an (empty) fridge which we found very useful. In the hallway was a wardrobe with a good size hotel safe. Curiously there were slippers in here but not any bath robes. Previously stolen perhaps? The bathroom was well equipped with a good quality shower set inside a smallish tub. The raised basin sat in front of a large, well lit, mirror, there was a smaller magnified one to the side. There was a wide range of toiletries and accessories.Room aside, we did not use much of the hotel鈥檚 facilities. There was a buffet restaurant on the first floor. The front of house staff all spoke English. Reception was efficient and the concierge staff helpful. Throughout our whole stay only two of the three elevators were working. This sometimes led to waits of five minutes or so for one to arrive. Linen in the rooms was changed daily and the standard of cleanliness throughout was high.I would place this hotel in the upper three/lower four star category. Not super deluxe but still a very clean and comfortable place to stay. It is very good value by Hong Kong standards. The location, just over the road from the Tin Hau metro station, is excellent.The hotel's web site is [-------] you may find better deals for it by shopping around.

<Content>Disappointed Unbelievable small rooms with even smaller bathrooms. Room dirty and had to ask for extra cleaning after first night. No real improvement over the entire stay. Hallways needed a good cleaning. Friends on different floor also had to ask to have room cleaned properly. So wasn't just our floor. Really was disgusting.The Hotel is located close to the subway, but it is very difficult to find good eating establishments anywhere close.Although breakfast was plentiful, there was no change to the offerings over the entire stay. Perhaps the worst eggs I have ever eaten.I would recommend a pass on this hotel, add a few extra dollars and you will get you a much better place..

<Content>Great value for the money This hotel was perfect for our stay in Hong Kong. It was directly across the street from a MTR stop making transit around the city a breeze. The rooms were very clean and very modern. The staff was very professional. I have absolutely no complaints and would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Hong Kong in the near future.

<Content>Great place thisis a good hotel. Very good value for HK, right next to the MTR station, views of the Harbour. Choice of TV is a bit limited but who needs TV when in HK?

<Content>Nice hotel, me and Panda Stayed at L`Hotel for 5 days in the beginning of January and was pleased to find it actually much better than we expected.1/ Rooms are spacious enough, a lot of place to stoge your baggage and belongings. We booked twin beds, high floor, non-smoking, and they met all our requirements without questioning. Frankly speaking L`H has no harbour view at all, we lived on 21st floor facing Victoria harbour, but the view was completely blocked by nearby buildings, we had only a 5sm glimpse of harbour through local condominimums. May be if you are positioned somewhat on 37-39 floor you`ll have a better chance of a view. But still this minor inconvenience will not spoil your stay there.2/ Hotel is new and clean (one of the major advantages on my esteem). Nicely furnished, well mantained. Room service is efficient and unseen in the same time. Bathroom is nice too, new modern and clean with full number of bath ammenities.3/ Hotel stuff is polite, chek-in/chek-out - swift and friendly. But some lateral questions put them into confusion as far as their English is poor (the service problem all around Hong Kong).4/ Gym and sauna are OK if you know about thier existence. Sauna is very well hidden - no sign on the door, no mentioning in the hotel directory. On our direct question WHERE IS SAUNA we`ve got a direct answer from reception girl NO SAUNA. But... from this wonderful forum we know for sure that THERE IS SAUNA, and finally they gave up and pointed to its location. Housekeeping explained to us that to have sauna always ready is very expensive so if we need it they`ll prepare it in half an hour. We said we woul wait (as far as it was very evening and our dayly programm was over).5/ Location is OK, not central but Ok. Right accross the road from Tin Hau MTR, bus and tram stops. Mc Donald and other eateries are nearby too.6/ Definitely if we are to HK we`ll stay there again. This is my recommendation to all.

<Content>Great Value, Location  We were in Hong Kong for 2 weeks to attend a family wedding during the Christmas holiday season. Our party includes my husband, me, and our 6 and 4 year olds. We were a bit concerned about the room size at first due to our previous stay at Emperor Hotel in Happy Valley. Our first pleasant surprise was how spacious the room was especially relative to hotel room size in Hong Kong. 4 of us shared 2 twin beds, with plenty of floor space and desk space for kids' activities and snacks and even visitors. (At Emperor Hotel, we had a King size bedroom and we had to use the window ledge as extra space. The room was not even big enough for 4 of us to walk without bumping into each other.) The bathroom was fairly spacious as well. We were able to give baths to our kids comfortably. We were also able to stow 4 pieces of luggage out of sight. We were also very pleased as to how clean the room and the hotel is. Growing up in HK, I am aware of the potential cleanliness and mold situation. None of that was a problem at the hotel. The decoration is not fancy but very clean cut and modern. Our 4 years old had a minor accident at the hotel due to our fault. The hotel staff was very attentive and offered to take us to the doctors' office ... etc. It ended up to be very minor so we didn't need to seek medical attention. The front desk and housekeeping staff is always very friendly during our stay here. My husband used the gym here. Though it is small, it is a big plus. There is also a swimming pool. It is quite attractive but it is only open during the summer time. There is one restaurant in the hotel offering buffet for lunch and dinner. The spread was quite impressive. Since I was with my family and the local friends most of the time, there were just too many other dining options for us to try the buffet. The location was wonderful. It is actually not right IN Causeway Bay but between Causeway Bay and North Point. Though the description of the hotel is a bit misleading, it is still in a great location. I actually prefer this to Causeway Bay as it is one notch more quiet than Causeway Bay and it still has all the convenience: right across from Tin Hau metro, tram and bus stops, taxis accessible within a few seconds, right next to convenient stores and walking distance to Electric Road with great local eateries. It is a very safe area. Even our family and friends were quite impressed with the hotel. Since it is quite new, it is still not widely known. We definitely will return to this place again. Because our stay is 15 days, we privately negotiated a rate with the hotel. We actually paid more 2 years ago at Emperor Hotel. We think the comfort, room size, convenience and value is far superior at L'Hotel. This is a relatively new hotel. Hopefully when we return, the place will have only improved for the better.Highly recommended for all types of travellers including families with kids. They do have suites available for families with older kids.

<Content>Great Hotel - L'Hotel My wife and I had arranged a very short 2 night visit to Hong Kong and we chose L'Hotel as it seemed to fit our needs.On arrival the cab driver knew exactly where to take us - at the hotel staff unloaded the car and took us in. Registration was swift and service good.Room - small, and the bed rather firm, but very clean and pleasant with a modern decor. View was of residential buildings, but then we hadn't paid for a better view.Dinner - good value buffet, but room service quite limited.Service - couldn't fault it. Prompt and courteous, nothing was too much trouble and concierge gave good advice and assistance.Location - quiet (for Hong Kong), 3 mins from Tin Hau MTR station. Can also pick up trams easily on Kings Road. Taxis seemed a bit sparse, especially during peak times, but never more than 5 mins wait. Opposite looks a bit tatty and run-down, but not unsafe or sleazy.Looking forward to going back soon with the kids for a longer trip.We're looking forward to going

<Content>NEW, MODERN AND NICE but dont bring your kids.. My kids and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The hotel itself is lovely. As I was travelling with my kids (ages 15, 11  7) on my own I wanted to have them in an interconnecting room or at least in a room on the same floor as they said they could'nt accommodate all of us in one room. We did book 2 months ahead but they still told us they would not guarantee either. On check in the hotel said that none were available and the best they could do was put us in a king suite which meant that my 2 girls and I shared the king size bed and my son slept on the sofa. This was annoying but at least they were with me. The suite was very spacious and did have lovely views. As the hotel is relatively new, it felt to me like the staff were learning on the job. It seemed that lots of small things added up and ended up being extremely annoying. One that springs to mind is that when I travel I don't like my room serviced, but even though I put the Do Not Disturb sign on my door, I would find my room cleaned and made up everyday, even after asking the staff not to! As stated in other reviews, english at reception is a problem, although they are nice but it was very difficult to get the information I wanted and in the end I gave up and worked it out myself. Another problem was that I had booked this hotel based on the lovely pool seen in the pics as its hot and I thought that it would give my kids something to do, after a day shopping, well the pool is there and looks very inviting but its padlocked as the council has yet to give it approval. The location is nice and not as busy at Kowloon, which is what I was looking for but I think next time, we'll stay around Admiralty as that is on the main line and doesnt require a change of trains, having said that it only takes a few minutes on the train anyway. In summing up, the hotel was very nice, but the service side of things really let it down.

<Content>Great location We stayed two nights in this hotel in late July. The location was the best part - opposite the MTR so it was prefect for travelling around Hong Kong (its so easy to get around the city and areas like New Territories). The hotel is also nice and close to Victoria Park and all the shops at Causeway Bay.The room was standard but nice - we had a good view of all the high rises. It was a good size. The heated bathroom floor was pretty nice!The reception and concierge staff were lovely and very helpful but the staff in the restaurant were a bit funny (their job keeping the restaurant nice and organised seemed more important than making sure the guests had what they needed).Overall, it was nice (but not wonderful) and I would go back if I was looking for a good hotel at a reasonable price.

<Content>Great location Stayed here in August 2006. The hotel is obviously very new and is ideally placed for all the transport. Tin Hau MTR, the bus station and a tram stop are all right outside the door. The walk across Victoria Park to the main Causeway Bay area is fascinating and is probably one of my favourite memories of Hong Kong.There are 2 supermarkets nearby as well as bakeries, pharmacies and at least one laundry.The staff were very efficient and friendly and the free internet connection in the lobby was really useful. We were also given the connecting, non-smoking rooms we had requested.The restaurant does a buffet dinner which was good value for money for 4 of us and the food was extensive, interesting and tasty.The only downside was the fact that we had chosen the hotel because of the pool, knowing that August would be hot an humid and the pool was not open.Would definitely consider staying here again were we to go back to Hong Kong.

<Content>Highly Recommended A modern, new, clean, convenient location. This hotel and it's staff get 4 and half stars! My three criteria for a nice stay are high pressure hot water showers, a comfy bed and quiet. It had all of those. The pictures are accurate. The rooms are reasonably well finished. A few corners have been cut. The AC is effective. Room service TICK. The only two downers were a very cheap and subsequently slow kettle and they have gone for the cheaper slow lifts. So expect to wait and then to get to know your fellow travellers!!!! We actually ended being upgraded to the harbour view suite. So this made our stay even more pleasant. The MTR Tin Hua stop is just across the road. I would definitely return. Can't go wrong.
