<Content>Good location and service Used my points to stay here and upon checkin got upgraded to a very nice suite on the executive floor. But for some reason they would not let us use the executive room.The bed and room were very nice with plenty of space to store our luggage and other items. The location is good with easy access to Darling Harbour and public transporation. Another plus is that Chinatown is a very short walk and there is some excellent places to eat there. The staff was very friendly and even called our room to let us know when our ride to the airport was ready for us.I would stay here again if the price is right.

<Content>a lovely hotel We arrived early in the morning, way before the check in time. We explained to the reception staff about our 24 hour flight, and they were very understanding and were able to get our room ready 2 hours before the official check in.The hotel is very close to a busy couple of fly overs, so close you can wave at the drivers over breakfast! Even so there are 3 walk ways to Darling Harbor, less then 5 minutes away.Darling Harbor is a great place for tourists, many restaurants, shops and bars. We had the best steaks at the meat and wine co, just by the IMAX. Chinta Ria is a nice chiense and the there are a lot of seafood restaurants around. The take away fish and chips at ice cube restaurant (also by the IMAX) are best eaten on the wooden steps round the bottom of the harbor watching life go by!Back to the hotel, the staff were all very friendly, always tried to do what they could to make our stay easier, the concieage team were fantastic.2 downsides that we found, the high cost of internet access and the cost of washing clothes. The hotel cost was well over 拢90 but we found a little place to do a service wash across the road for just 拢7.If we ever visit sydney again, we will be staying at the crowne plaza.

<Content>Below Average We found the standard of the Crown Plaza hotel way below 5 * ratings. Depending on your hotel experience and your expectation of a hotel I would not chose or recommend the Crown Plaza. If you can afford a five 5* hotel, try the Amora Jamison Sydney. My husband and I stayed at the Crown Plaza for three nights whilst he was at a Business Conference in the city. Our stay was during 鈥榃orld Youth Day鈥?and many Pilgrims were staying at the hotel so the volume of people catching the lift was quite heavy. The lifts were disappointing, very small and extremely slow. I was also pregnant and went down for breakfast one morning, requested boiled water and waited 20 minutes only to realize that the waiter was never coming back. Dinner at the restaurant was expensive. The menu choice was limited and the meals that they did provide was tasteless and average. The room size was OK, but the bed was quite 鈥榟orrible鈥? It was a queen bed that was very low to the ground and the mattress extremely uncomfortable. It was also in winter and they had no blanket on the bed and only one fitted sheet on the bed. The pillows were uncomfortable and not very clean. My husband asked for extra sheets and pillows. They obliged and told us that it is hotel policy that the bed is made with only one sheet. The last night of our stay (which we couldn鈥檛 wait to leave) our 14 months old son joined us. They provided a cot for him that was completely old, tattered and toured. I quest the only good thing about the Crown is it location close to most things.

<Content>Great hotel Stayed at the crowne plaza the other week-was fantastic. Really nice people that showed us all the spots we didnt know about Sydney. I only live 1 hours drive from the center of Sydney and the Concierge team were able to make our stay feel like a real holiday and adventure!

<Content>Liked the Crown Plaza Staff at this hotel was very friendly and helpful. Room was modern clean and comfortable, couldn鈥檛 find a fault. Didn鈥檛 have much of a view unfortunately, that鈥檚 about the only fault I can think of. Breakfast in the hotel was very good with plenty to choose from. Hotel is well placed to see Sydney鈥檚 sites and only a short walk to the Darling harbour and a wide choice of restaurants.

<Content>Your property is not safe at Crowne Plaza TRAVELLERS BEWARE! My jewellery was STOLEN from out of my suitcase in my 'locked' room during our stay at Crowne Plaza Darling Harbour on the weekend. Yes, I am stupid for assuming that when one stays in a reputable hotel in Sydney that my property would be safe if hidden inside my own, closed suitcase. Almost as bad as the fact that someone has been through my personal belongings, and chosen to take $5000 worth of rings, is the fact that I haven't received as much as a phone call from the hotel since reporting the incident last Sunday morning. I had to make a follow up call myself - without receiving so much as an apology. My advice: your belongings, and your privacy, are not safe at this hotel.

<Content>It's OK I booked this hotel in a hurry, without any time for research about Sydney. I was in a party of about ten, all going to Sydney for a series of meetings from different countries, but travel organisation had not been centralised, so everyone was staying in a different place and I had not had time to talk to anyone else. Overall, I was satisfied about the hotel, but nevertheless I won't be going back. The location is quite good, central, yeards from Darling Harbour. This would be perfect if there weren't other hotels actually on Darling Harbour. Breakfast is very good. I must say I remember it being particularly good, actually looking forward to breakfast. I had one meal in and it was room service. It was OK. The room was a reasonable size, neither too small nor particularly large. The common areas were OK, albeit a bit soul-less. The price was low (relatively so, at least), so for the first day I felt good because I was being wise and saving company money. This lasted until I visited the hotels were my fellow travellers were: the Shangri-La, Four Seasons and the Park Hyatt. That is were I am going to go next time. My advice is: if on business, it's not bad but you can find better. Particularly, there is no point staying at Darling Harbour for business: you want to be near Circular Quay and the Rocks. If on holiday, might be OK, but perhaps I would choose a similar hotel on Darling Harbour, or if your budget allows it, one of the three I mentioned above, which seem to be where everybody stays anyway.

<Content>A Perfect Stay In Every Way We stayed at the Crowne Plaze in January 2008 and were very impressed. The staff were all helpful, courteous and pleased to answer questions, give directions, and assist at any time. Even while standing in the foyer looking at tourist brochures, staff would approach and offer advise and assistance. We arrived dressed in shorts and T shirts and were treated with the same respect as those who rolled up in big cars and hoards of jewellery flashing and dangling off them.The foyer and ground floor bathroom facilities were extremely clean. The elevators seemed rather small however we never had to wait long to get one (there was 3 of them). We arrived earlier than expected and our room was not ready, the consiege took our luggage and we went for a walk, when we returned our luggage had already been delivered to our room for us.Our room was HUGE with a small entrance hall and seperate bathroom. The bed was King size (I think) with good linen, plenty of pillows and extremely comfortable. The bathroom was big enough to have a party in too. The bath was nice and deep but didn't seem very wide and the bathrobes were lovely and soft. The complimentary bathroom products were of good quality and very nice to use and everything was spotlessly clean.Room service was very quick although we didnt order anything, just requested more coffee and sugar sachets which did not cost extra. The view from our room wasnt much although we had a huge window but we didn't spend much time in it anyway so that didnt matter. Walls and door were thick enough that we never heard any sounds from the hallway or other guests while in our room.The position of Crowne Plaza could not have been any better, it is a comfortable stroll to see the cruise ships in port, to Chinatown, the Aquarium, the Casino, Sydney Harbour (we walked under the bridge), Circular Quay and the Opera House. And if you prefer not to walk far then the ferry is handy and not expensive. There are lots of fabulous eating places within a 5 minute walk and plenty of good shopping; there is even a playground for the kids. The night we were there Cirque de Soleil entertained on the water at the end of the harbour with fireworks which was an added treat - free entertainment . We were extremely pleased with our choice of accommodation - it was the ideal location and service and facilities were exellent. Highly recommended for couples, families, singles.

<Content>Beware Hidden Charges Booked and paid for two nights at the Crowne Plaza in advance at a fairly good rate for Sydney. Seems that these rates are offered to get you in the door and then the hotel slaps a number of hidden charges that are levied when you check out. We're only talking relatively small money (A$12 per night), but at no stage was I informed that they would be applied, nor were they satisfactorily explained. As I was in a hurry to leave for the airport I didn't have time to take it up with the Duty Manager. Seems like a good little earner for the hotel. A very sour taste in the mouth. Won't be back.

<Content>Good hotel but conceirge a problem The Crowne Plaza at Darling harbour is one of the better hotels that I stay at in Sydney and I do stay at a lot! I like the Crowne Plaza for its convenience to Town Hall station.Rooms are great especially 1021 which i stayed at. Top floor overlooking darling harbour. Go for a Darling Harbour view room when staying there.Only concern this time was the Conceirge. They nearly broke the boot of the hire car and then proceeded to argue with the driver. When I got up into my room, they tried calling me to get the drivers name. I said i couldn't remember but they still tried calling back another 30 mins later which was by now 10:30pm at night. Get over it guys!

<Content>Great Location We stayed at the Crown Plaza Darling Harbour whilst touring Australia in December. This hotel is in a great location giving you easy access to everything you'd want to see in Sydney.The hotel rooms are beautifully decorated with everything that you could need and is very clean throughout. The staff are incredibly helpful booking excursions and giving you tips on where to visit and on what days etc.Darling Harbour area is great by day and night with street entertainers, bars, restaurants and shops. The best meal we had in Sydney was at the Meat  Wine Co. on darling harbour this really is a must.

<Content>Great location, average hotel I stayed here for 4 nights in May, attending business meetings in Sydney.The location is fabulous, easy walking distance of Darling Harbour, Circular Quay/Opera House, The Rocks etc.The rooms are beginning to look a little in need of renovation  the bathroom I had was fine - clean  all the facilities but just tending a little towards renovating time.All the basics are there - flat screen TV (although the channel selection is a little biased towards local Aussie TV. I couldn't find CNN for example but there are LOTS of sports channels  local channels), broadband internet  a comfy bed.Breakfast is a little on the slow/bureaucratic side if there are more than 2 guests in front of you. Everyone has to stop, confirm room #  sign receipt before they will seat you. Result is efficiency for hotel but queues for guests.Staff are VERY helpful  will help you get taxis, decide where to go for the evening etc. Check-out is fast  efficient.

<Content>Lovely hotel!! On the drive to the hotel I was a bit worried about staying in the city and coming from Malaysia was expecting the standard of hotel service to not be so good but I was pleasantly suprised! On arrival we had a slight problem in that we had accidently given our driver the voucher for the hotel instead of the transport- the girl behind the desk informed us that if we didnt get it back we would be charged on our credit card again for the entired 5 nights. They helped us contact the car company and the consierge took it upon themselves to make sure the vouchers were swapped so we didnt have to worry about it. As soon as we checked in our cases were transported to our room for us and the porter was very friendly and gave us advice on the best places to eat/see. Our room was lovely and spacious - view wasnt that great but then we werent in our room much so it didnt bother us. They had also given us a complimentary bottle of bubbly for our honeymoon which was a lovely gesture. The hotel was a 5 minute walk from the harbour where there are loads of fantastic restaurants (try Jordons for the best fish and chips we have ever tasted!! On the harbour there is also a wildlife park with koalas and lots of animals and an aquarium. Its just a short ferry ride to Cirular Quay and there is plenty to do - the harbour bridge climb is a fantastic experience! Overall we had a fantastic time in Syndey and would definitely stay in the Crowne Plaza again.

<Content>Great for business travellers I stay here regularly for work and this hotel is in a great position. It's in the heart of Darling Harbour near all the restaurants and it's 2 blocks away from the Queen Victoria Building in the centre of Sydney.Clean rooms, prompt friendly check in and checkout. Taxi's don't take long and the guy that makes the omlette's in the breakfast restaurant is a real character! There is internet connection and a large desk if you need to do work.

<Content>Nicely positioned hotel I was dissapointed when our travel agents came back to tell us that our original hotel (the Four Points By Sheraton) was over booked and we had been transfered to the Crown Plaza, but the hotel was really good. It was nicely postitioned (we had booked a harbour view but it was not that good - Four Points had a better position for views) but it was a stoned throw from Darling Harbour (via a walkway). The staff were very friendly and helpful, apart from the receptionists when we booked in she must have been having a bad day! The rooms were quite spacious, clean and modern. We didn't use much of the hotel facilities as there was so much else available at Darling Harbour, which was fantastic. Sydney was the highlight of our trip. It was lively, bright, clean and beautiful. The people were friendly and I would definitely go back there.

<Content>Overbooked My husband and I booked the Crowne Plaza in Darling Harbour for two nights. When we arrived after our evening flight from Tasmania the receptionist told us that they were overbooked and we don't have a room. That he proceeded to start searching for a room for us in other hotels. Eventually ( twenty-thirty minutes later) we were told that we can go to Rydges ( the night manager told us that is was a nice five star hotel and it was not!) and we had to switch hotels again next day. At least we got some taxi vouchers for all the hassle between the hotels. The night manager promised that we will be taken care of when we come back to Crowne Plaza the next day but I really did not notice anything different in the room than the any other Crowne Plaza room in any other city in any other country. The check out process was easy and seamless.

<Content>Decent accomodations but really your just paying for the location In June I spent 2 days exploring Sydney at the end of a long business trip. I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Darling Harbour. The hotel lobby and dining area's were all really new and nice. I strayed down to the bar to have a few glasses of wine and was surprised at how expensive it was. The wine served at the resturants around the city seemed much cheaper then at this hotel. The food on the dine in menu was the same way. I wouldnt reccomend spending the money and eatting or drinking at the hotel. However Darling harbour is right across the street and there are plenty of nice resturants and places to eat.The rooms with a view of the harbour are more expensive then the rooms that do not have a view. In general, the room was clean, however they very small and very dark. So dark that it was acutally difficult for me to put my make up on in the a.m. Overall, the hotel was clean and the most resonably priced for that particular neighborhood but you are really just paying for the location as the hotel is right across the street from the famed Darling Harbour.

<Content>Overpriced, paying for location only We spent 6 nights here as part of our honeymoon. Over all the hotel was quite good, very clean, spacious and comfortable but there were a few issues:1) upon arrival (7.45am) we were told we couldn't check into our room until 2pm....not what you want to hear after a 13 hour flight. the hotel had been given advance notice of our arrival time so after a bit of an arguement we got our room about an hour later.2) the breakfast buffet is very, very expensive. We chose to eat most mornings at one of the many restaurants in Darling Harbour3) Access to Darling Harbour itself is a 5 minute walk via some very busy roads and bridges. There was extensive building work in the area at the time which may have caused this but I wouldn't have fancied the walk with kids or a disabled person.All in all not a bad hotel but not worth the money we paid in my opinion.

<Content>Not bad for the price if you can get a good deal. The hotel believes in good service and big smiles. I definitely saw a big smile from a check-in staff. Impressive. The room is big and clean. It is rated as 4 star which is accurate. Not as luxury as Hyatt or anything like that but much better than some hotels that have been rated 4 star as the Menzies Sydney. I can't comment much on the hotel as I stayed there for a night only. It would be nice if the hotel has a swimming pool and a sauna.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We stayed at Crowne Plaza on our honeymoon and were very impressed.It was easy to check in and staff were friendly and helpful. We had requested a Harbour View room which gave us a great view of Darling Harbour. The room itself was extremely clean and spacious, with a huge bathroom.We were presented with a complimentary bottle of champagne shortly after our arrival as a honeymoon gift, which was a nice touch.We visited the restaurant for breakfast a couple of times, and found it to be good value for money with an excellent range of dishes to choose from.On leaving, the concierge was very helpful and efficient at booking transportation to the airport for us.All in all, an excellent hotel which I would have no hesitation in recommending to anyone!

<Content>Good location but not right on the harbour We stayed here for 4 days with our 6-year-old daughter. We enjoyed our stay here but were a little disappointed that the hotel was not over-looking the harbour as we had thought. The hotel is a 3 - 5 minute walk to Darling harbour, once you pass over a few very busy roads (or go via the footpaths) and the hotel restaurant over-looks a spaghetti junction of inter-mingled motorways. The hotel was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was luxury - marble floor and walls and separate (huge) shower cubicle. The buffet breakfast was very nice but a little expensive (and my daughter not free as she had been in previous hotels in Australia). The hotel is relatively well located (10 minute walk to the city centre and obviously located near the bars and restaurants on Darling Harbour). We walked to Sydney Harbour one day which took around 30 minutes as we found the taxis were expensive (along with a lot of the attractions). A must see with young family is the Wildlife Centre on Darling Harbour - it was inexpensive and deceptively big inside with many different creatures!If you get this hotel on a good deal then I would recommend it, but I wouldn't pay over the odds for it.

<Content>Excellent Service The best service I have experienced so far in Australia.Very courteous, provided full information when asked anything, helped with luggage.Location is fantastic. Right next to Darling Harbour. Perfect for a holiday in Sydney. Also perfect for a business trip (close to CBD office areas and Pyrmont).The room was very nice. Took me a while to locate the bar-fridge though. Internet was good quality too (not free).Room was a bit dark.

<Content>Fantastic locationa and great for a family! Myself, my Husband and our 2 children of 3 and 7, stayed here 3 times in all when staying in Australia for December 2006. We stayed in an executive suite over looking the harbour, the room was great, it was spacious, clean and had amazing views. The buffet breakfast was also a real winner with the kids as there was so much choice.The location of the hotel was brilliant, within walking distance to the centre and the shops, right next to Darling Harbour which has the most fantastic restaurants with stunning views and close to the train and bus stops. The hotel was so good that when we were meant to stay at Coogee Beach Crowne Plaza for 4 nights we only stayed 1 and transferred back to Darling Harbour for the next 3 nights as we missed it so much!The staff were very friendly and the concierge couldn't do more for us, when we used their babysitting service they even called us to let us know they had checked the sitter and kids and all was ok!!!If I had my way I would live in this hotel, it will definitely be somewhere we go back to. The hotel really helped make our holiday a great holiday as we didn鈥檛 have to worry about our accommodation just which fantastic day trips we should take!

<Content>A good, safe bet...surprisingly decent Stayed here for one night and pleasantly surprised by the spacious room, cleanliness and excellent facilities in the place. Location is great for the city, staff are helpful and the overall ambience is good, albeit there is a distinct business feel (rather than holidaymakers).All in all a safe bet for a few nights.

<Content>Perfect location The hotel was chosen by Kuoni. It was smart and clean. The staff, especially the concierges, were very friendly and helpful.The food was good but dinner finished early and you couldn't even get a coffee in the bar after 10 p.m.It has no pretensions to be a grand or family holiday hotel but you couldn't beat it for ease of access to Darling harbour and the main shopping areas, including Chinatown. It wasn't even too far to walk to the parks and quays and, of course, Sydney Harbour bridge.Note, between midnight and 6 a.m. you need your room card/key to get in and operate the lift.

<Content>Great location - but facilities not for families Fantastic location, if you stay anywhere, stay in Darling Harbour. Definatly ask for a harbour view room (the front of hotel). We failed to ask for this and was given a city view room, although we had a good view of the Sky Tower, we were closly overlooked by other accommodation/apartments.Facilities OK. The hotel could do with a relaxing area ie pool or courtyard. Somewhere outside to sit and just chill.Very much a business/city break hotel.I would not choose this hotel if staying in Sydney for any longer than a few nights.If paying for breakfast seperatly it is very expensive. We found a great cafe called Alto just around the corner from the hotel that serves a great BIG breakfast for a reasonable price

<Content>great hotel We stayed here for 4 nights in January and loved it. We got a great rate of $156aud per night by booking in advance through the hotels own website.We arrived early and as our room was not yet ready we were given complimentary drinks until it was cleaned. We had a corner room and it was very large. It was very modern and spotlessly clean, well done housekeeping! The bathroom was beautiful, imacculately clean and stocked with red earth toiletries.The gym was well equipped. We didn't eat at the hotel but the restaurant always seemed busy. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Nothing seemed too much trouble, especially for the concierge whom I must say were the nicest I have ever come across.Location is fantastastic. Just a short stroll to Darling Harbour, chinatown,CBD, Paddys Market. We will definately be making the Crowne Plaza our preferred hotel when staying in Sydney.

<Content>Fantastic staff and good location Spent 9 days at the Crowne Plaza over Christmas. The concierge were fantastic. We asked him (Kore) to book 3 day trips and 2 restaurants when we left the hotel in the morning. When I returned, he has booked them all on all the days we wanted. We did a Sky Dive, took a trip around Sydney on the back of a Harley Davidson. (Brilliant!) Reception staff were also very attentive. The rooms we clean, modern and spacious. I didnt hear any noise from the outside world. Great location with just a short walk to Darling Harbour. Definately try 'Nicks' in Darling Harbour. We didnt eat at the hotel, not even breakfast so cannot comment. The gym was good and very quiet! You will enjoy your stay here very much.

<Content>Very happy Very nice stay for 4 nights. Nice views of the harbour...at night it is awesome. The workout room is very nice. The staff was friendly and helpful. The price was a bit steep even for this nice hotel. The room was very clean with plenty of room for 3 people. We will stay again if we ever go back to Australia.

<Content>Good location, but pricey I stayed at this hotel in a room on the Club floor. Whilst it was a nice touch having a 'special' place to go, I thought the 'club' room was a bit disappointing for how much extra we paid. The views were nice yes, but not amazing- quite similar to the view from our room. We visited at night for a few drinks, was impressed with the inclusion of Coronas, but after a staff member mentioned they thought cocktails were served, I was disappointed that the only other choice was wine. Canapes were nice but they went very quickly- it would have been nice if they served more. The staff in the room were friendly. It was nice being able to get a bottle of orange juice from there during the day but I don't think that the price is worth staying on that level again.Our hotel room was comfortable, nice thick windows blocking out noise and a view of the harbour. There is however a big road that is blocking most of the view- worth keeping in mind or you might turn up expecting better. The bathroom was a nice size and everything seemed very clean. I would stay there again but I'd consider going to another level.

<Content>Nice Stay Staff very courteous, rooms clean. View terrible. Good location for walking around to Darling Harbor attractions. Be sure to get the buffet breakfast included with your room plan, meals in Sydney are very expensive. Like most Australian hotels, the room temperature can be a bit uncomfortable, but not much you can do about it, they are saving energy.

<Content>Excellent location This is an excellent hotel. The location was right next to Darling Harbor and a 2 minute walk fromt he convention center. We stayed here 9 days and would have stayed longer. The staff was supper friendly, the room was very spacious, and we had a good view of the city. It is 4 blocks from Pitt Street (all the major shopping) and 2 blocks from the Market area. We chose a rate that included breakfast. The buffet was huge with more stuff than anyone needs. They even had a cook (Jai) that made some of the best omlettes or eggs to order. There are two bars in the hotel and we never heard a peep at night. I highly recommend to everyone.

<Content>pleasant stay I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Darling Harbour in late June 2006. It was a nice pleasant visit to Sydney for some R+R after a conference out of town. Check in went very smoothly, with the front desk staff being very helpful and accomodating. I stayed in a 3rd floor city view room, which unfortunately overlooked the motorway. Surprisingly I didn't find it noisy at all. The room was very comfortable, and clean, and I particularly liked the nice bathroom. I found the only negative thing about my stay was the poor food selection on the room service menu. The late-night food was poorly presented and not at all appetising. It was quite disappointing. Overall a good stay. Very close to Darling Harbour which you can access from a foot bridge across the road, and only a short walk for some awesome shopping. I'll stay there again, but will avoid the hotel food at all costs.

<Content>Good hotel, but not enough value for the price. Ok first off, in the middle of winter, you have to have a heater that works in the room. When i called downstairs, i was told they would bring up a blanket. Ok, that is not the answer i expected ...but que sera. PS ..the blanket didnt help. Whats funny, is i stayed in a nother room on the 9th floor on my return trip, and that room had EXCELLENT heating. I guess they only take care of the heaters on the club floor where you pay more to get heating ????? they had 2 excellent Concierge working the say shift, but the guys working at night, needed a serious attitude adjustment. Quite standoffish and when i asked about dinner recommendations they didnt help to make a booking for me. The guy during the day shift did the day before. I wish they would clone guys like Ian from the day shift to work all the time. The guy at night also booked me for the wrong tour. The 2rd day i booked my tours on my own. It was worth the hassle to not be treated like a foreigner. I went up to club lounge and the woman working at night was also very unhelpful. It was like pulling teeth to get just a smile. Location is ok, if you dont mind the long walk to the harbour or Kings harbour for dinner. Hotel was clean, i did get my wake up call on time, and they did accomidate me in the morning to get a late airport shuttle. You need to book 2 hours in advance. i didnt, but still got a shuttle within moments. The receptionists and check in desk were very very helpful. Overall, overpriced for the ammenities and some of the staff need to learn to hide their obvious racist or prejudicial views better from the guests. I won't return unless every other hotel in the area is booked up for the night.

<Content>Nice and Modern Hotel is short walk from Town Hall train station, same line as from domestic/international airport. Was easy to find.Stayed in Crowne Plaza Club Room on the club floor. Great value for a short stay away. It included breakfast in the club lounge which was self serve buffet and this room has a great view of Darling Harbour. Nice decor in room. Nice modern room with good amenities. We secured late check out easily for 1400 with no additional paymentEvening drinks and canapes are also held in the club lounge. Self serve for the alchohol and the canapes are delivered to the tables. Also soft drinks, still  sparkling water and a selfservice espresso machine.Reception and concierge were polite and would stay here again in the club rooms!The Club Room floor concept has been well thought out and developed in this hotel.

<Content>All foyer no comfort About the only thing going for the Crowne Plaza is its location - right at the exit of the cross town tunnel (good for quick taxi from the airport). Its only a short walk across a pedestrian bridge and you are in the heart of all the restaurants on the harbour. Although the foyer is nice and clean, its nothing to rave about. I actually believe that the nicer the foyer, then the worse the room - especially so at the 4 star level.I arrived late night after a flight from perth and was ready to have a bite to eat and turn the heating up. The room itself is ok, very high ceilings. I was on the first floor because I am a smoker. The big thing that annoyed me was that the heating didn't work and the in-room dining menu is poor plus that it stops at 11pm with only a few very basic late menu items that a 5year could make. I get the feeling they got the doorman to do it to be honest as the guy who rocked up smelt of exhaust fumes. Due to the heating problem I changed to another room on the same floor but quickly realised that the whole floor had the single heater. Apparently I was the only one to complain, in other words, ask a question. That night I had to sleep with 2 doonas on me it was so cold. As mentioned, the menu is promoted as being the healthiest, but that doesn't mean the tastiest to all. e.g. tomato and eggplant dip.. lucky darling harbour is across the street, but the thing is, if you are travelling by yourself all the time like I am, you want a good in-room dining menu so you can eat do work and watch tv at the same time! in summary, there are far better hotels in sydney for a better price. It will be a last resort hotel for me, and I will quit smoking for the night to get a higher floor.

<Content>What else can I say!! Wow, my fiance and I just spent a night in a city view room in the Crowne Plaza Darling Harbour and we were blown away, from the minute you arrive to the moment you depart you are looked after all the way. We arrived to a valet officer asking us if we would like to have our car valet parked for the night, it was $27 per night but that is compared to parking in an undercover parking centre about a block down the road for approx $32 for the night, so we thought that was excellent. My fiance was a bit worried about the car, as we have never had it valet parked before and it is a 4WD, but we didn't have to worry at all, the car came back without a mark on it. A porter then came over with his trolley and asked us if there was any luggage we would like taken to our room, we showed him our back seat and he then whisked the luggage out of the car before we could blink. Next step is checkin, well, that was fantastic, very helpful and I recommend everyone to join the prioirity club before booking the reservation, as at check-in we were given 2 free alcoholic beverage vouchers for the bar on ground level, for being Priority Club members, this membership is free of course. They gave me our room keys after asking how many we require, and then we went to our room. Once we opened the door and saw the king size bed I just wanted to lay on it all night. The sheets were ironed, the duvet cover was ironed and fabulously soft, I kept running my hands over it. And also the pillows, more than what we would use which is great. We had bathrobes which we nice and soft and heavy, not the light weight kind. Our view was of the city, as we were in town for a concert so we didn't really need a view, but boy the view we got was really great. We could see the city at day and lit up at night, our view was of the centrepoint tower, the city looks so pretty at night. So we spent most of the afternoon after check-in walking around darling harbour which is just across the road from the hotel. That was great, 5 minutes tops walking distance and all the food you can eat, and all the fun you can have. Definitly great for adults and children alike. The meals were great, just watch the portion sizes on the beef tenderloin, it was a little small but my fiance loved the taste and we got a side salad with it and chips and that filled him, and he is a big eater. I had fish and chips and that was great, 2 pieces of fish, chips and salad and it was a big meal. All meals came in the time or less that they said they would which is great if you were starved like my fiance and I. After the concert we went to, it was 1.00am, and we felt like something to nibble on, so we ordered a cheese platter and a fruit platter to be sent up from room service. This was also very quick, I was in the bath only 10 minutes and it arrived. Check-out is 11am which is great, no having to get up early, and breakfast is served until 10.00am weekdays and 10.30am weekends. We went down to the Day Street Brasserie and had the full buffet breakfast, and wow, there was that much food I couldn't wait to eat it. They had Scrambled eggs, Eggs Benedict, American Bacon, English Bacon, Field Mushrooms, Hashbrowns, Waffles, Chicken Sausages, etc etc. All kinds of Cereal, Fruit, Pancakes, all kinds of toppings for the pancakes from Maple Syrup to Berry Compote, Yogurt, just about everything you can think of including fresh muffins, pastries, toast and Crossants. They even had a juicer, which you can put especially cut fruit into and juice up a juice bar style drink, I had that and I fully recommend it! Once breakfast was over we checked out, we called down to the concierge and he organised for a porter to collect our bags from our room and for our car to be collected from the Valet Officer, and it was right out the front waiting for us when we arrived in the reception. Express Check-in is another thing that impressed us. And also our complimentry newspaper was ourside our door when I awoke. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a great experience in Sydney!!

<Content>Nice hotel, excellent value What a find this was!!! I checked out the Holiday Inn web site and this Crowne Plaza Hotel was the same price as Sydney Travel Lodges, but represented a good 4* hotel.Althougth not much to look at from the outside, inside the hotel was of the usual standard you would expect from Crowne Plaza. Nicely furbished room with all facilities. Staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel was a 20min easy walk from the Opera House or 10mins from the Botanic Gardens. The best thing was the 90second walk across a foot bridge into Darling Harbour, which has wall to wall restaurants and bars - excellent for a night out or lunch, or even breakfast. You can sit alfresco and enjoy the sun shine with your meal, and watch the harbour - fantastic.I would recommend this hotel greatly. I'm sure you can get better hotels and others that are nearer to the harbour, but not for this money - I paid $145 AUD / night for 2 people direct from Holiday Inn - brilliant price.

<Content>Great location and hotel We had 5 nights at the Crowne Plaza in March 2006. We had booked through Trailfinders in the UK and had upgraded to a Club level room. What a smart move that was as we found that the Club level lounge is open all day where you can get complimentary tea, coffee, soft drinks, eats etc all day and then wine, champagne and canapes in the evening. This was well worth the extra money and also we got an excellent breakfast. The hotel is literally 5 minutes stroll from Darling Harbour and you don't have to cross a road. This meant that the harbour ferries were within easy reach and also the hop - on, hop - off bus stop was even nearer the hotel. A great location - we thought is was better to stay here than at Circular Quay or the Rocks. The staff were very helpful and the room good, clean. Unfortunately no guest laundry - something we had got used to in the rest of Australia and New Zealand. But don't let this put you off staying here!! We loved Sydney, both for the place itself and the hotel and also the weather!!

<Content>Good location Stayed here for 4 nights, as part of 3 week hol to Auz.Room was very good, helpful staff , and in a great location, ideal for Darling Harbour and the City.A bit awkward to find especially if you havent driven in the area before, some local direction signs to the Hotel would be really helpful.Internet service was very very slow and consequently relatively expensive, use the corner shop nearby which is good value and a better conection. Will stay again.Booked through Trailfinders (UK)

<Content>very nice hotel The hotel is very clean and well situated in Darling Harbour in Sydney.HOWEVER, the hotel is surrounded on 2 sides by a motorway that is build on stilts. If you are on the lower floors then you are likely to find it noisy. However, if you stay on the club floor at the top of the hotel then you do not hear any noise at all.I stayed on the 9th floor and had no trouble sleeping.

<Content>Efficient and tidy I know people complain about the location, with it not quite being on Darling Harbour, and of course the flyover across the road. However, if you want a trim and efficient city hotel, located in earshot of most attractions, with good service, nice rooms and a very good Sydney price - Crowne Plaza Darling Harbour is the answer.The concierge and reception staff were helpful and kind. The breakfast buffet was a good reprieve for the day ahead. Really, you can't complain when the price for the room was so competitive compared to other Sydney city hotels in that hotel genre. However, some little niggles:-Dinner was about average, service was slightly wanting and the menu needed a greater selection of food. Of course, construction work in the hotel spoiled the ambience slightly, but I suppose I did go in the off-peak season.Fine.

<Content>Perfect for congress centre Stayed 6 nights at the Crowne Plaza whilst attending a medical conference at the congress centre Darling Harbour. Not the most picturesque location but perfectly placed for the fantastic Darling Harbour. The key attribute is a fantastic bar where you can really enjoy Australian hospitality after a hard day. Good breakfast, clean rooms and fantastic beds. Whilst we were there the All Blacks stayed at the hotel so if its good enough for the best rugby team in the world its good enough for me.

<Content>Boring, bland service and noisy A quick stay and my preferred hotel the Novotel DH was fully booked. I like the Darling Harbour area as the city can be pretty quiet at night and I like to explore a bit. Lots to see and do in Darling Harbour and Nicks Seafood Restaurant was great. The hotel is a bit lost and set away from the Harbour although I guess technically it is still in the precinct. Hotel staff were very blas茅 about being of service and lost a fax at one stage. Nothing really bad; rooms were OK but no views and mine smelled a bit on the first day, just not very startling. Access for cabs was difficult as they are just completing construction of new tunnel in front of the hotel. Don鈥檛 remember seeing many smiles.

<Content>Poor location, noisy room The hotel isn't near to Darling Harbour itself, it is surrounded on three sides by raised motorways of which you get an excellent view from the breakfast room. Getting to the amenities of Darling Harbour involves a 10-minute walk past building sites and over motorways. Luckily we had a high room with a view towards the Sydney Tower.The walls of the room were very thin, so we could hear the family on one side and the all-night party on the other side (loud enough to keep us awake until we phoned reception).Our phone didn't ring for incoming calls, even from reception, but flashed a few minutes later for us to pick up the voice-mail that had been left.The breakfast was very good, though the staff there weren't entirely on the ball. Reception staff were friendly and helpful.

<Content>Very poor experience When we arrived at the hotel we were told we had no reservation. I then produced my confirmation number and then was told we still couldn't have a room because a convention had taken up all the rooms. Our experience with Crowne Plaza around the world had been great up until then. We can't tell you much about the service as we ended up staying at the Novotel in Darling Harbour which was much nicer anyway - and we got a Harbour View Room!
