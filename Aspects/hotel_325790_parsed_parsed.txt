<Content>Tepid Charm My wife and I stayed in one of the townhouses. We stayed for a long weekend. The hotel and townhomes are on an N. Rampart street- an extremely busy thoroughfare of a street. While the townhomes were quaint and charming, those qualities were offset by the busy, noisy street in which they reside. Accompanying vehicle traffic was foot traffic. Though we did not encounter any problems, my wife and I felt less than comfortable walking our dogs day and night on and around this street. Louis Armstrong Park was closed so we resorted to walking our dogs on Rampart Street鈥檚 grassy median鈥ess than ideal but it served our purpose.The townhome courtyards and vehicle parking are cordoned off from the street by security gates and are very appropriate and useful for this urban environment. I encountered three staff members and none of them really impressed me. I received the student job/I鈥檓 only doing this until my band/my art/my writing makes it vibe. My wife and I did not like the unit we reserved (its only door opened up to the street) and requested a transfer to a quieter townhome which the staff accommodated last minute although hardly graciously. This hotel serves its purpose but don鈥檛 expect too much. The French quarter is across the street and Bourbon is three or four blocks away so it is close to 鈥渢he middle of it鈥? It is merely a place to stay for pet owners and park your car for a reasonable price in close proximity to the French quarter. If the antiquity, charm, and character experience are what you are looking for in a hotel, a unit in the quarter will likely be the better option.

<Content>VERY Unsanitary Upon check in there was hair in the bed, hair on the floor in the bathroom, stained sheets AND towels, dingy thin towels, arrogant and unhelpful staff, inoperable lamps and ceiling fans, wifi that doesn't work . It shouldn't take 20 minutes to check into any hotel/motel. The hotel, more like a motel or motor inn is so run down. The carpet was in bad shape. It's a flea bag motel disguising itself as upscale. When I stay in a hotel there are certain things I expect are a given...not here. I would never stgay here nor suggest it to my worst enemy...

<Content>Very Comfortable Our stay at the Suites were very comfortable. We stayed there for Essence Fest 2008 and was amazed. When we booked our stay there, we were a little weary because of past reviews. I am here to say that all negative reviews must come from negative people. We stayed at the annex and it was very clean, service was excellent, staff was very friendly and we really enjoyed our stary. I would definetely stay there again.

<Content>Great Experience I just got back from a lovely long weekend in New Orleans and can't say enough about the French Quarter Suites Hotel. A group of seven of us went down to NOLA for a friend's 30th birthday and I was in charge of making the hotel arrangements. I looked at many hotels but had difficulty finding one that could acommodate our large group without splitting us up into several rooms. Many of us had not seen each other in years and wanted to spend as much time together as possible. I am so happy that I stumbled upon this hotel on Trip Advisor! The staff at the hotel was responsive, polite and downright generous. I had initally booked two, two-room suites but after talking to the management switched to the three bedroom executive suite in the annex. With five beds, a comfortable couch and a rollaway bed, we were able to comfortably fit our whole group in one suite. And what a suite it was! If you're looking for luxury acommodations this isn't it - but everything was clean, in working order, spacious and nice. We particularly enjoyed the balcony and courtyard which provided ample space to lounge and visit, in addition to the nicely appointed living room. I have absolutely no complaints about the room or the service.As others have pointed out in their reviews, the neighborhood around the hotel is not exactly posh, but was in easy walking distance to everything we wanted to see in New Orleans and allowed us to come and go throughout the day. The weather was hot and sticky, so coming back during the day to cool off before going out at night was essential. Most importantly though, as a woman, I never felt unsafe walking down North Rampart Street but taking normal precautions (ie: not walking alone at night) is still a good idea, as it would be in any city.Overall, I can't rave enough about my group's experience at the French Quarter Suites. We absolutely got a great value for our money and would certainly come back to the hotel again in the future (especially to visit the cutest dog who lives in the rental office and loves to greet guests). Thanks to the management for making my friend's birthday wonderful and this gathering of friends possible.

<Content>Friendly and Accomodating I really liked this homey hotel only blocks away from the noise and traffic of the main French Quarter. My friend and I were just coming off of a week sleeping in bunk beds and standing in line for showers at Camp Hope (Habitat for Humanity headquarters) so the spacious suite was a great luxury. The big comfy sofa prompted both of us to take a nap on our first afternoon in New Orleans. We had a great experience in our dealings with both the owner Blake Miller and employee John White. A perfect example is when we needed to get our airline boarding passes and they happily looked them up for us. Also, the hotel is dog friendly but we only saw and heard one dog in the hotel and apparently there were actually 6 staying there during our visit. We also got to meet John and Blake's dogs who were hanging out in the office...Great stay in New Orleans, and we would highly recommended this location. Next time I would like to try their townhouse units...

<Content>A Great Jazzfest Experience! My wife and I and another couple had a great stay at the French Quarter Suites for this Jazzfest. After years of spending the week cramped in larger hotels with smaller rooms, it was a true pleasure to have such a spacious and comfortable living area in which to relax after the show. Our suite had two large beds, a living room area with chairs and a sofa, a kitchen, bathroom and porch -- and we enjoyed all of it.The staff and management were accommodating and extremely friendly. And the hotel even threw a Saturday-night crawfish boil for guests. Completely unexpected, and definitely appreciated.Honestly, this kind of friendly, personal service can't be beat. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Easter in NOLA Easter in New Orleans was great. The French Quarter Suites Hotel was really a great discovery. Location is excellent, just 3 blocks from Bourbon St. The room was very spacious with everything you would need like a sitting area with sofabed, kitchen area with dining table, seperate sleeping room and bathroom. I had an accident the first night - I tripped and fell and cut up my face somewhat. They seemed very concerned and made sure I was ok. That is what hospitality is all about. Thanks and I will be back soon!!

<Content>Not somewhere I would recommend We stayed here as a group of 6. The hotel is only a few blocks from the French Quarter...but the area is a place where you do not want to walk alone at night. We stayed in one of the town homes which was supposed to have 3 br + bath. The bedrooms were not rooms...there were no doors, nor any privacy from other roomates. Beds were laid out across open spaces that are connected with no dividers. You literally had to squeeze your way around other beds (if someone was sleeping you would definitely wake them). A majority of the staff was very unfriendly. Upon checkin, one male individual was extremely nice...the other was acting as if we were interupting something important that consumed him at his pc...he vaguely helped or answered our questions. Another time I went to use the wirless connection for my laptop (our room was not in range; you had to literally walk down 100ft to the main office)...I asked the female attendant (who was intentally reading a novel) if I could please get a couple more rolls of toilet paper. She stated that she didn't think she had any ...but would check or call the maintanence staff to get some. I said ok...I would be back after a few minutes working on my laptop.When I came back after 15 minutes she was still reading her novel. I asked her for the tp and she hadn't even looked...she then proceeded to go into a closet and said she didn't have any and she would call someone to get me some. An hour later someone arrived. Very, very lackadasical staff.The pictures online are very misleading. Plus, they do not detail information about the rooms.

<Content>Great Place in the French Quarter We enjoyed our stay here. Our Lucy, a 60 pound lab mix, was welcomed here. The daytime clerk even had a dog in the lobby. It was nice to have a seperate living room, kitchen, and bedroom. There is an elevator, and we took advantage of the locked, gated parking area under the hotel. There was a clean pool, and far enough away from the party streets, that we got a good nights sleep. Just a block and a half away there is also an off leash dog park that our Lucy enjoyed playing with some of the local dogs. We were able to walk everywhere in the french quarter both days we were there. We highly recommend this hotel. The staff was very nice. We have stayed at BB's in the french quarter before, but this was by far the nicest. It's an older place, but that just lends to the charm.

<Content>Great Find! Very nice hotel. It is an older place, but it is very well tended to. Out of the party zone of the quarter, but just a few blocks out when you want to get there. Very secure with onsite parking for a nominal fee. Perfect for the family! We will definitely stay there again.

<Content>New Orleans B We are frequent travelers to New Orleans, and needed to bring the dogs this time. Although we were concerned about the location of the hotel, as we don't usually stay on that side of the Quarter, we found our concerns to be unfounded. The residential areas on the Quarter side of the hotel were beautiful and quiet places to walk the dogs, and the three blocks off Bourbon were just a pleasant walk. We had some initial concerns about our room, and the manager Blake quickly acted to do everything possible to make us happy - and he did!! The room was beautiful and had all the flavor of New Orleans. Like most of the old BB's in New Orleans, there are some things that aren't what we are used to in our own homes - but that is part of the charm of New Orleans' BBs, the combination of old and new. There was safe, covered parking at the main hotel, and a secured gated parking lot next to the annex. The prices were reasonable and they didn't gouge you with none refundable pet fees. We will definitely stay at this hotel again!

<Content>Nice place I was impressed with the French Quater Suites. The suites were confortable and tidy and the staff was superfriendly. The heart of the French Quarter is a mere few blocks away, so the location is great. The suite we stayed in was beautiful with high ceilings, antique furniture, and comfortable beds/couches. I think the bathroom could have used a little work at what was probably flood damage from Katrina (the grout between the tiles on the floor looked dirty), but that is getty pretty nit-picky. The secure parking is a big plus. One thing that was a minor issue is that North Rampart is a busy street. If street noise bothers you, stay away from the rooms that are directly adjacent to the street.

<Content>Highly Recommend this hotel to everyone! We stayed there for 3 nights and was extremely satisfied. It was right on the edge of the French Quarters. Our room had a nice size living room with a sofa bed, full kitchen, nice bathroom and seperate bedroom. The bedroom had a safe to keep your valuables. The breakfast wasn't the best, just the basics: doughnuts, juice, cereal, milk, coffee and cocoa. The price for the room was fairly cheap. We had to pay for the parking which was expected in the French Quarters. Which overall was around $110 per night. We must have went at the right time. When we stepped outside of our door, there was an awesome view of the courtyard. One night when we were there, we watched a movie being filmed right in front of the hotel. Which the 4 of us sat there and watched them filming. The main actress talked to my daughter and asked if she would hold her robe for her. My 12 year daughter was thrilled. Then the crew asked us if we wanted a soda or water, and of course the kids couldn't resist. Just becareful when walking the streets, there were alot of homeless people trying to bum money and cigerettes.

<Content>Never going back We had been here in Oct 2006 and the only room we thought acceptable was the servants cottage at the end of the garage. We liked this place mainly because of the secure garage on the premises with a gate considering New Orleans very high crime rate, This year, we reserved the same room/cottage and called again in the afternoon to reconfirm our reservation as we would be arriving late. When we got there, the room was occupied and we were offered another room on the second floor with no apology. When we refused that room and started to make waves, they offered us the executive suite. As it was very late, we decided to spend the night. The suite is quite large but is dark and not attractive and looks run down. The door to the room would not stay shut unless bolted. When I sat on the couch, I thought I would hit the floor so soft it was. Two lightbulbs were burned in the bedroom ans the living area. Both TV remotes (room and L.R.) did not work. Internet did not reach the room and would only work in the office. We also heard stange noises during the night but I thought more about rodents than ghosts ! No offer was made to reduce the price despite our numerous complaints. The breakfast is not great for a city like New Orleans. Better head for World famous Cafe du Monde. Next time we'll definitely look to stay elsewhere.

<Content>Yucky and really not part of the French Quarter We 6 girls stayed here for a bachelorrette party and it is in a bad neighborhood that isn't really a part of the French Quarter but rather a few blocks down. The room itself was pretty disgusting, we had a two story town house with three bedrooms and the girls were scared to sit on the couch. They said the smell was horrible when they got there and there was a door that was locked and when you looked under it you could see another room where a skylight was apparently leaking and the room was now full of mold. So the whole weekend we all got sick and were congested when we got home. I really am not too picky and I am not exaggerating. The city is still recovering but I do think there must be better places than this. If it had just been me and my boyfriend, I would have left for sure! It is just not a nice place and it is out of the way. The Le Richelieu looked pretty nice when we walked by and it was near or was probably in the French Quarter.

<Content>Haunted Don't stay in room 213!!!!!! It was haunted, I couldn't even sleep. But we were staying one night so we didn't complain. There were noises everywhere in our room - sounds of dresser drawers being open and shut, scratching on the floor, sound of someone walking around, something that sounded like digging through something - i thought some big animal was going through my suitcase. Not to mention both my sister and I heard something fall off the end of our beds (I thought it was my notebook that was on my bed and I looked and it was still there), I felt something touching my foot while I was laying in bed, and we also heard someone walking around the room. SO - don't stay there in 213! I had to get drunk in order to sleep in that room (so I'd just pass out and not hear/ feel anything).

<Content>STAY AWAY unles you like filth and roaches. Where white socks and walk around the rooms for about 10 minutes, you will pack your bags ASAP. Caught two roaches and took them down to the desk with my socks and told her this was unacceptable. Instead of giving us a full refund, they charged us for 1 days stay after our 90 minutes stay. Try the Hotel Monaco or places in the warehouse district and leave this slum to others.Alex

<Content>A great place with a wonderful staff A good friend of ours was on leave from Iraq and we all decided to go to New Orleans for Halloween. We booked two rooms for 3 couples at the French Quarter Suites Hotel. My girlfriend and I arrived several hours before everyone else and the gentleman working at the hotel offered to watch our luggage, for no additional fee so we could wander around the French Quarter. We had a good time but got tired quickly (late night before, early flight) and went back to the hotel. The person working the desk took our card to hold for our room till my buddy got in(he booked the rooms under his card and was paying for everyones rooms, early Christmas present I guess). After we checked in we walked into our room and our jaws dropped. We had a one bedroom suite, which has a full kitchen, a living room. It was awesome for what we wanted. The furnature was all very comfortable, and all the remotes worked (rare at hotels these days). The building felt VERY secure, and the pool was extremely clean, and you didn't get that over chlorine smell that you get from some hotel pools. The staff suggested many great places to eat, as well as fun things to check out. Also they arranged for three taxis to be out front to pick us up when we checked out (all our flights were at different times heading to different locations) with no hassles at all. We had a great trip down there. A few days later we checked our credit card balance and saw that we were charged for the rooms, in one quick phone call they took care of everything for us, as well as apologized several times for the mix up. We were so happy with this hotel and the service we got while we stayed there that we are booking another trip with them this April for Jazzfest, this time though were going to check out one of their townhouses.

<Author>All-OverTraveler
<Content>Great Value...Wonderful Stay Fellow travelers, I am a former native New Orleanian who tries to get back to New Orleans often. I am glad to have found French Quarter Suites Hotel. For me, it is like living in a French Quarter apartment combined with a hotel. I have stayed here several times, and have found all suites to be large, with living room, dining area, kitchen, large bedrooms and full bath. it feels a lot more homey. It is close to everything in the FrenchQuarter, on a main street easily accessed by car, unlike the traffic of the inner French Quarter. It has ample secured parking, which is unusual in this historic part of town. For a small hotel, the staff work exceedingly hard to meet all your needs just like their larger competitors. The pool area is lovely, and the on-site laundry is great if you are planning an extended stay. There is a breakfast room with free breakfast every morning with complimentary newspaper. During the day I can walk or take an inexpensive cab anywhere in the downtown N.O. area, as well as a short walk to French Quarter restaurants, coffee shops, entertainment, bars, stores and historical sites.

<Content>This place is a rip off and the owner is nasty! My experience is much like the one above. My sister had originally reserved a room for her, her boyfriend and his daughter for $79. Supposidly it was a coupon rate but it was posted that price on the web too b/c I looked. Anyhow, me and my daughter decided to go so my sister called back and they told her they could give her a 2 bedroom w/ 2 full size beds for $99. Great! We were excited. When we got there they told us that the people who were staying in our reserved room decided to stay over again and all they had was a 1 bedroom w/ 2 full size beds in the same room or a 2 bedroom with one full size bed and 1 king. Well, we had 3 adults and we didn't want to all sleep in the same room. Besides, we originally had a 2 bedroom reserved for $99. Well, when my sister went to pay the bill, they charged us $20 more a night. What! I was like, why did you pay that??? It was not our fault that they did not have the room available for what we reserved?!? I called back and asked for a manager. The man said he could help me. I told him our whole story and about how I did not agree that we had to pay more for an upgrad b/c they did not have our room available. He preceeded to tell me that we came in at a discount rate and that the room we stayed in was regular $250 (whatever, the website says $129) and all in all basically that he didn't care, he was the owner, we got a good rate, he didn't care what we thought and he would credit us back $40 and hung up on me. My sister was a repeat customer. Not anymore. Don't stay here. They are hateful, greedy, and liars!

<Content>Who spends all their time in their room on vacation anyway? We wanted to stay within walking distance of Bourbon Street, didn't want to rent a car, etc. We wanted to keep the trip reasonable but fun... didn't want any problems. After we booked I read some reviews on this site and I became weary (because of location, etc) I'm from Chicago so I figured things would be fine and they were. This place is within walking distance of the french quarter, a nice walk... wear good shoes if you don't plan on renting a car. We took the Airport Shuttle to and from the airport.We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite and the price was great compared to the price to stay in the middle of the french quarter... not to mention all the noise at night around Bourbon Street. I felt safe walking back and forth (even at night) you just have to be careful and use common sense - don't carry a big purse, keep your money, etc. secure. You can always take a cab back to your hotel at night if you feel unsafe walking but I didn't see a problem walking day or night. The St. Louis cemetery and Armstrong Park are nearby (and free) My opinion is... your hotel is a place to sleep, the rooms were clean - we had no problem. I don't spend my vacations in my hotel room, the majority is spent outside the room so if your looking for something reasonable, this is the place. I rate this place average (compared to other places to stay in NO, it's not the Ritz Carlton so if your expectations are high... look to stay on Bourbon or right in the middle of the French Quarter just remember it's pretty loud at night)

<Content>Great place We stayed here for five nights in late July 2005. We were extremely pleased with the cleanliness of the suite - one bedroom with double beds, full kitchen, large living room and full bath. Just outside on the large balcony were tables and chairs. Great place for groups to meet, eat and chat. Free use of washer/dryer. Within easy walking distance to all the fun in the French Quarter, but far enough away for quite relaxation. Pool extremely clean. Fantastic Staff - We did not meet a single rude person working at this hotel. Parking is a little cramped but they do their best to please everyone.

<Content>Get It In Writing I was planning a trip to NOLA with some friends of mine, after hearing great reviews of this place I decided to give it a shot. I called the first time and spoke to the owner, when I asked what the hotel cost for the times I was going he had quoted me a rate much higher that what was advertised on the website. I played along with it and asked for several rates for different room categories and each one was significantly higher. Finally I mentioned it and asked why he was charging me more, it is low season because no conventions or events were happening and he said this is what was posted on the web too. When I pointed out that it wasnt he apologized and offered me what was on the rate. I made the reservation and asked for a fax. One week later looking around I noticed that on Fri and Sat the rates are higher than Sun, and it should drop. I called back and got someone who's name I forgot, he was very nasty pointing out that I called during check out time, and he couldnt talk to me. To call back on be put on hold. I told him I call back. When I did, I got the owner again. I told him that the rate for Sunday should have been lower than Fri and Sat and he agreed and cut off 50bucks. I was excited and asked for a fax, after days went by and no fax. I called again, the owner wasnt in but got someone else, who gave me a higher rate than what the owner gave me with no lower sunday rate. I was apalled and asked that the owner call me back. When he finally did, he said he never quoted me such rates. And it was back to square one. I was so upset that they never got the rates fixed and played around chargin what ever they pleased. I asked my reservation to be cancelled and they told me they had to charge me a processing fee. For what?? To rip up the index card my reservation was on. This place is such a joke, if it got to this point just being on the phone with them I didnt want to think what it would be once I checked in... I booked me and my guest at Faubourg Guest Suites much lower rate and the owner was so sweet. Ask for the rate in writing if you decide to stay at the French Quarter Suites.

<Content>Friendliest Staff in New Orleans My sister and I were in New Orleans for eight days in July and stayed at this hotel. While the hotel is not a 5-star in looks, the staff made us feel as if we were staying at one. The concierge, Velda, the best resource in the City of New Orleans, was very personable, outgoing and willing to assist with whatever we asked. We stayed in a one-bedroom double with a living room and kitchenette area. There was plenty of room for us to spread out and not get in each other's way, the beds were very comfortable and the room was clean when we arrived. We took advantage of the pool and the continental breakfast offered. We were in walking distance of the French Quarter and we also utilized the buses which stopped 1/2 a block from the hotel and ran frequently during the weekday. It was a wonderful experience and we are planning to return to New Orleans later this year would stay here again. The only thing that we would change would be to add Hi-speed Internet connections in the room. Great job Velda and Peter!!!

<Content>Re: French Quarter Suites I agree with the previous post, this is by no means a 5 star hotel. We just got back from a 3 night stay. First the good. The staff here is extremely nice, and very helpful. They will go out of their way to make sure that you have a nice stay at their hotel. I give them an A+. Another feature that we enjoyed was the pool area, since we were there in the dead of summer it was nice to have a place to cool off. The building is also pretty secure. There are only two ways to enter, either through the lobby (that always has somebody in it) or through the gated parking area that you have to have a key to enter. If you plan on going out during the day to explore and coming back to the hotel before it gets late, then this is the place for you. It's a short walk to everything and the rates are very reasonable. We stayed in a 2 bedroom 1 bath unit w/ a living room and a small area w/ a mini-frig and microwave. There is also a balcony that runs all the way around both floors. The rooms were clean and spacious, but the furnishings were a bit outdated. Also, some of the lamps were not in working order. As other people have already mentioned. the hotel is located right on the outer fringe of the French Quarter in a high crime area. If you plan on going out at nights I strongly suggest that you either find someplace more towards the center of the FQ, travel in large groups, or that you take a taxi back to the hotel. On our last night there my husband and I were walking down Urseline only a block and a half from the hotel and we were assulted by two young men who robbed me of my purse. It was a frightening experience, but it could have been much worse! We plan on coming back to NO sometime in the future, but we definitely won't stay at this hotel again because of the location.

<Content>Just an average and OK hotel in a not to good of an area Well, I have stayed at the French Quarter Suites Hotel when visiting New Orleans earlier this year.Checking out the reviews on this site I must admit that I am a little surprised about the hotels high 5-star rating.Having stayed at this and other hotels throughout the country, I like to state in my opiniated review, and in fair comparisons to any other hotels I have visited in the past, that this hotel does not meet any compatible 5-star hotel standards, and nor does it even come close to any fair other first-class hotel ratings.I do not like to be taken wrong, especially as this hotel is in overall review OK, and deserves a moderate average rating. However, it is fair to state that the hotel has some problems it has to deal with, and that the location, because of the nearby crime area, is being one of the biggest ones.There is no doubt that the hotel, being located on the far N.E. side of the French Quarter, is just a few blocks away from the dangerous, high crime rate bothered East New Orleans neighbourhood, and that especially tourists, as told by local police forces, are being warned of potential night street crimes nearby the hotel when walking home, running the potential risks of being mugged (police words, not mine!).As stated already, the hotel itself is OK, but it certainly does not offer any services and standards of hotels that justify a hotel rating within the 3*star to 5*star brackets.Again, the rooms are of average size and well furnished, but need a little renovation. The hotel services and the staff itself can be considered as average to good, but do not come close to any first-class hotel standards.In conclusion of this review, I honestly have to state that I will stay at another hotel during my next visit to New Orleans, especially as I expect to see a better value in return for my Dollars spend for hotel overnights in New Orleans. Knowing now, there are many nice hotels in the central New Orleans area that are located much better and offer many more services at a much better price per room night!I am sorry, but I can only rate this hotel as a 2-star in this review (i.e. Okay, but some problems - on this site)!

<Content>What a wonderful place!!! After having reservation problems with the French Quarter Courtyard next door, we walked over to the French Quarter Suites. Luckily they had an extra room during Memorial weekend. The deskperson, Velda was very sympathetic to our problem. She provided excellent Customer Service while we were checking out the rooms. She wouldn't even let us book a room without looking at it. We ended up with a wonderful room. It was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. One night we spent in the room and watched cable TV. Our room was #102 and on the street. You can barely hear the traffic though. The swimming pool is also nice and clean. They always had extra towels at the entry gate of the pool. The served a small continental breakfast (coffee, muffins, pastries, and juice) gratis. Velda recommended a few restaurants (Mike Anderson, Petunia's, and Meuxbar) that locals like. On our last day, it rained. My husband and I decided to go to the cemetaries. Believe it or not, they offerred an umbrella to borrow. Talk about service!!! Last of all, there seemed to be a small mix up with the pick up van. She called the company and stayed on the phone with them until everything was fixed. Unbelieveable. Though the walk wasn't as close as we expected to Bourbon, it was doable and worth it. By the way, she told us which street to turn down for a safer walk.

<Content>Excellent Choice I can only echo what everyone else has said about the French Quarter Suites. We chose it because of the recommendations here.It is close enough to the action to walk to Bourbon St but far enough away to be quiet at night.Four of us from the UK shared a two bedroom suite for a week which was comfortable and a great rate. It was properly cleaned and fresh towels were provided every day.A complimentary breakfast was provided and although officially it ended at 10 am there were usually free pastries or muffins and strong coffee around much later for those who had been clubbing until the small hours.It has a nice suntrap swimming pool.We drove in from Memphis to be greeted by the lovely Velda who could not have been more helpful with recommendations for restaurants , clubs and tours. She provided mugs , tea bags and milk so we could have a cup of tea after our seven hours drive.We were also given help and advice by Blake , the owner , and being British, we just loved his two spaniels. This is a pet and people friendly hotel.The area was no more unsafe than any other part of New Orleans and we did notice regular police patrols along North Rampart . The hotel itself was very secure.We walked back a couple of times from Donnas ( a great Jazz Club) about three blocks down and never felt threatened, in fact I had more aggravation along the riverfront.We all loved the hotel and we look forward to returning to New Orleans soon

<Content>A Great Choice Just got back from 3 nights at the FQS and can confirm any of the positive reviews listed here. The location is just far enough from the action in the Quarter that noise and traffic isn't an issue, but close enough that you can walk anywhere in a few minutes (restaurants and music clubs start just down the street). Our group never felt threatened or unsafe when walking in the area, even at night or alone (but did not dare a combination of the two, of course). The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, making great recommendations of places to go. We stayed in a 2-bedroom suite in the main building and the room was clean and nicely appointed and well-attended to by the housekeeping staff during our stay. The room faced North Rampart but we barely heard any street noise. If I've any complaints at all it would be about the half-broken showerhead, but a very minor incovenience that may not affect other rooms than ours. I plan to return and stay there again.

<Content>Home Away From Home We just returned from a three day visit to New Orleans. It was purely by chance that we stayed at French Quarter Suites, and we were pleasantly surprised by what we found. The staff at the hotel was very nice and helpful, especially Scott White. His recommendations were excellent. We will definately stay there again!!

<Content>Practically a steal I just got back from spending my spring break in New Orleans and stayed here at the french quarter suites. It was myself and 7 of my friends from school and we have nothing but praise for this place. The people at the front desk are some of the nicest people that are more than willing to do anything to help you w/ any of your needs. As far as the location, it is fine. I never once felt threatened or scared on my way into the french quarter. The rooms are very nice and i felt kept noice very well. W/ there being 8 guys Im sure we were loud a few times but never had any real complaints so that was nice. All of us loved the place and plan on staying there again next year. I am already in the plans for making arrangments for next year, great place and can not be beat for the price, practically a steal. Thanks again for everything

<Content>Nice Hotel I was a little aprehensive when I saw the reviews concerning the hotel being in a bad neighborhood, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. I asked the lady at the front desk if she had a suggested route for going to/from Bourbon Street (especially at night). The lady was very helpful and even gave us a map showing us what route to take. We had a short, safe walk to/from the heart of the quarter every night. The rooms were nice and clean, but not overly fancy. I would stay there again and I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>nice hotel, great price Stayed here for Jazz fest in 2003. The rrom we had booked was being repaired, so we were upgraded to the one room mini suite. Bedroom with a separate kitchen and living room. The staff was great, and the the place was kept clean. As this is a pet friendly hotel, you need to expect that there is some pet odor that will stay with the place no matter howm uch cleaning they do, so it has a bit of that pet smell to it, but nothing overwhelming. The pool is small, but a nice place to cool off if it is hot out. For Jazz fest, this place is great, as the bus to the festival runs right past the hotel. This is on the edge of the Quarter, and Rampart isn't the safest street in the world, but it is no worse than any other street in New Orleans. Just be careful and don't act like a rich drunken tourist wanting to get mugged and you should have no problems. The Annex next door is nice as well (same owners). There were a few parties thrown at the annex's pool, with Dj's and speaker sets, loud enough to hear in our room, but that didnt bother us since it was Jazz fest and we werent doing a whole lot of sleeping anyway. Several families were there with us. Everyone seemed pleased. Locked covered parking (free) is a huge plus as well.

<Content>Safe and Super Clean Hotel My mom, sisters and I had a lovely stay at the French Qyater Suites Hotel in April of 2004. We felt very safe...as far as that goes we felt safe everywhere we went. The rooms were very clean. One afternoon we just sat on the side of the pool and dipped our feet for a while. The office manager Velda is a jem!!!! She gave us directions and great eating advice. We are planning another trip in the fall and plan on staying again.
