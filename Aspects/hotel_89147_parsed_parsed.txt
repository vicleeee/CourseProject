<Content>Excellent Smaller Hotel Great small southern hotel. Large rooms, friendly staff, great location (in Warehouse District, walking distance to the Frency Quarter and River, St. Charles streetcar stop right in front of hotel). A nice place to stay to be close to everything but avoid the noise and crazziness of the Quarter.

<Content>Check your credit card bill We stayed in the Lafayette for three nights in September, the hotel was lovely and we had a great time we fully intended to go back again next year, on leaving the hotel our bill was settled in full, we were very surprised when two months later two charges were applied to our credit card amounting to almost $600 dollars, we called the hotel on four occasions and were told that the manager G Schumann would get back to us, she never did, we were then told that she would e-mail us but she never did, we finally got most of the money refunded back to our credit card and on the same day another charge of over $400 dollars was added on to the card again finally i got to speak to the manager but she was of no help, i have now had to report the unauthorised charges to the fraud department of my credit card company and they are investigating, the situation is still ongoing and i have not even had an apology for all the inconvienience and stress the situation has caused me. I am really sad that we have been treated in this way and there is no way that i would go back there now i just wouldn't trust them with my credit card again.

<Content>Loved our Stay Here, Staff Very Friendly I'm honestly surprised by some of the bad reviews on here. We had a great time at the Lafayette Hotel, and the staff couldn't have been more helpful, courteous and friendly to us. We stayed with our dog, and they have a very reasonable dog policy and also gave him biscuits at the front desk! Our room was clean and lovely. When we needed duct tape for our Halloween costumes, the front desk brought up a roll very promptly. The hotel is also very convenient to downtown and the riverside park. The staff gave us some great recommendations as to where to spend our time in New Orleans- and not just touristy stuff, either. I truly felt that they treated us as family. We can't wait to return!

<Content>Staff is rude and uncaring about damages to my property Hotel = Lafayette Hotel comments = A report was filed concerning a valet damaging our truck on 6-10-08. Reports and estimates were faxed to Gisela Shumann. She said they would be turned over to your attorney who would contact me. I have not heard from him or her. Water is leaking into my truck as a result of this damage caused by the valet. Please expidite a reimbursement check so I can have my truck repaired.The promised check was never received. My e-mails were never answered. Staff was non-caring.

<Content>Overall, a good experience This is an older facility, so there are a few bumps and warts. That said, the accomodations were clean, with some nice amenities such as the shower robes. Convenient location on the St. Charles trolley line, and a few blocks from Poydras Street and the French Quarter. The staff was very helpful. You do need to know in advance that parking (as with most facilites in this area) will cost extra, and that the hotel does charge extra for communication access ($4.95) and safe charge ($2.95) per day, required. Overall, if you can get a good rate, this is a good value.

<Content>Great hotel, great value The Lafayette Hotel has Old New Orleans charm with modern conveniences. Great location--both convenient and quiet--you can easily hop on the streetcar or walk to the French Quarter. Very friendly staff. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Layfayette staff went the extra mile -- every time!!! My husband and I, and another couple, were down in New Orleans for JazzFest, and the Lafayette Hotel was absolutely top-notch. Very conveniently located along the St. Charles Ave streetcar line, and just blocks from the French Quarter, the hotel provides easy access to all the fun and entertainment that New Orleans has to offer. Previous reviewers have been spot-on about the beds -- some of the most comfortable that I've slept on in a hotel! And the large majority of the hotel staff was really professional, going the extra mile to make sure that our needs were met -- even going so far as to let us use the hotel's laundry dryer on the morning of our departure so that we didn't have to pack our soaking wet clothes into our suitcases on our way home (it was a bit of a soggy JazzFest...). Also, we called a few days in advance to request that our room and our friends' room be placed as near each other as possible, and even though the hotel was fully booked all weekend, they were able to put our rooms across the hall from one another -- and they gave us a balcony and our friends a suite! Wow! That kind of personalized service goes a long way, and is such a rarity in hotels these days. We will definitely be looking to stay at the Lafayette Hotel next time we visit.

<Content>This place sucks.... This hotel was terrible. I booked this through Travelzoo that promised a free upgrade. 1. I didn't get upgraded because they never upgrade. 2. The AC was broken and the room was over 80 degrees. They REFUSED to give me another room or fix the broken AC. Stating that I had to sleep in there and there was nothing I could do.3. The elevator broke on me..twice.4. The nickel and dime you....they charge you $8 a day for phone and safe even if you don't use either. 5. Parking is $20 a day.6. The staff is RUDE and INCOMPETENT. This hotel is horrible...don't go. They say it's Luxury...I stayed in a Travelodge that was more luxurious.....

<Content>Charming and inexpensive The Lafayette Hotel was very charming and comfortable. While it wasn't the swankiest hotel I've ever stayed in, the rooms were cute with nice colored walls and a surprisingly comfortable mattress. The one negative thing I would say is there are no overhead lights so the room is a bit dark. The location is between the Garden District and the French Quarter, and right off Lafayette Square.The front desk staff was super-accommodating and friendly.

<Content>Great location, great hotel This is a great historical hotel. We loved that it was quiet, but close enough to the French Quarter that we were easily able to go back and forth. The front desk staff -- Kerry and Luis -- were really accomodating. My friend and I arrived at 11:00 a.m. (check-in is 3:00 p.m.) and they were able to give us a room right away and even upgraded us to a suite (for our same very good rate of $109 a night). They were also really great about trying to keep our group in the same area of the hotel when the rest of our party arrived. The St. Charles Street streetcar runs right outside the front door, which is great for getting to Uptown (and nope, you don't hear it). I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good rate and a great location in New Orleans.

<Content>Very Disappointed Cons: Upon checking in, I found that the bedspread in my room was extremely frayed and had a cigarette burn in it. The mattress had a deep hole in the middle that was so uncomfortable I asked for a new room. I was moved from a king suite to a double bed suite. The carpet in both rooms was faded and pulling up at the seams. One of the chairs in the living room area was stained. The two TV's were very small and the remote controls did not work properly. The tile in the bathroom was discolored from an old leak and some tiles were missing. The jacuzzi did not function and looked as though it probably stopped working before I was born. The shampoo in the bathroom had been previously opened and used. The coffee pot was missing from the coffee maker. One of the reasons I chose this hotel is because it advertises room service. Unfortunately, the restaurant downstairs has moved and no room service is available. The bakery referenced in other reviews has also closed. I also had a problem with needing to have my room key reset every day, which was rather annoying. Granted this is not an expensive hotel, but I have stayed at the nearby Nola chain hotels with even cheaper room rates and found them to be much nicer in appearance and quality. Pros: The staff was very accomodating and helpful in recommending restaurants and answering questions. The hotel is on the St. Charles trolley line and there is a stop right out front. Since the hotel is in Lafayette Square and not the French Quarter it was very quiet but still within a short distance to get down to the action. Overall: The hotel has a lot of potential asthetically, but is currently run down and there does not seem to be much attention to detail. I would recommend staying at one of the comparably priced chain hotels.

<Content>High Class, Quaint, Hotel This hotel is Ritz Quality! The rooms are huge and comfy with great views in a safe area. We stayed in a deluxe suite for a weekend getaway without kids. The rooms are beautifully furnished. Just a quick walk to the French Quarter--5 blocks! Note these are short blocks. The service is unparralled. Michael, Kerry  Luis were friendly and helpful. They suggested many sites and restaurants to enjoy. Help bring New Orleans back and stay at the Lafayette. We will stay there again when we are back in the big easy!

<Content>Loved our Room We arrived after an all night drive from Kansas City, found a great spot for lunch and proceed to the hotel a little early to try and squeeze in a much needed nap. Kerry was very quick to accomodate our group. One of the gals in our group had multiple conversations with Kerry prior to booking our accomodations; we were not disappointed. Several in our group were provided with a suite and the other room was a front balcony room to enjoy the Mardi Gras parades. Kerry was quick to provide us with helpful information in regards to getting familiar with the area and how things work for the parades. Our rooms were clean and filled with all the ammenities we needed. We were provided with a beautiful suite but found the heat did not work. the staff were quick to respond but unsuccessful in getting the room to warm up ehough. We were provided with a beautiful suite facing St Charles Ave. The Victorian bed was wonderful and so comfortable. Staff were quick to assist us to get back to our rooms with all the treasures we received from the parades. The hotel provided stands in front of the hotel for the parades and were excellent. The stands put you at the same level as the people on the floats. The hotel was walking distance to some great restaurants and a wonderful breakfast spot. The staff gave us great advise in regards to the timing of retriving our car to ensure we were not locked into the area due to the upcoming parades. Our friends also staying at the hotel decided to hop on the trolley the morning of our departure. The trip took longer than anticipated and Kerry was great about directing us to a new parking spot while we waited for their return. Once they returned he was quick to assist with check out and even helped take the luggage around the corner and down the street to the new parking spot.We will be sure to allow more time at The Lafayette the next time we are in town. Kerry, thanks for a great stay.

<Content>20 Minute Waits We got last minute tickets to the BSC National Championship Game, so were limited in our hotel choices. We were impressed with the TripAdvisor rating and that there was availability, so we booked. The room rate was outrageous, but we expected that considering the circumstances. Arriving early for check-in, the front desk did accommodate us with a suite which was not quite clean. There were crumbs on a table which we mentioned to our bellman. He got a housekeeping person to remove them, but after she left I noticed under the crumbs were food stains. I called housekeeping to change the tablecloth, which they did, but why didn't the maid notice that when she brushed off the crumbs? The hotel provided the excuse that she was new, but if that was the case, then a supervisor should have checked her work in my opinion, and at the exorbitant rates they were charging I would think they could afford better help.The next bad I noticed was TP in the toilet when neither of us has used it. A small round facial soap was stashed in the bathmat which was left in the bathtub. When I picked up the mat, the soap fell into the drain and was stuck. It took me a good 20 minutes to finally pry it out. Without my saying anything about that incident, the next day the maid left the correct bath soap. Twice I went down to the front desk to inquire about the non-feather pillows I had requested. I was informed they didn't have any. Unacceptable answer! One of those trips was because no one would answer the phone there when I tried to call. On my second trip there I waited 20 minutes for someone to show up, but alas to no avail. Finally the pillows showed up.The one good thing about this hotel was it's location...about equidistant between the Superdome and the French Quarter.

<Content>Great location, nice find We scrambled for a New Year's hotel near the Quarter and stumbled on the Lafayette based on TripAdvisor ratings. The room was suite-style and comfortable. The staff was friendly. Located on Lafayette square, we were a few blocks from Bourbon St and a short walk to the Superdome for the Sugar Bowl, exactly the location we wanted. The price was much more affordable than a stay in the Quarter. The one negative was the room was FREEZING. The heating system was not user-friendly, but a quick call to maintenance made it much better. It was still a little chilly. Overall a good stay and we would stay here again.

<Content>Disappointed by lack of service We were deeply disappointed by our stay as we had previously dropped by the hotel bar and liked the hotel's appearance. It's physically attractive in an oldfashioned but pleasant way. The Location is a selling point for business men and lawyers as the courthouses and office centers are immediately proximate. The problems are many for tourists and businessmen alike. There is no WIFI contrary to what the front desk asserts. On occasion one can access news online but never send or receive email. There is a legal problem in this regard. The front desk has known about this problem for several weeks but nothing has been done about it. The manager allowed us to use her PC but the day front desk is a real problem. However Andre who is backup on the front desk if pleasant and could be excellent with training. It was very cold in New Orleans and we didn't appreciate the absence of decent heat or a good shower. Mind you there was some heat and hot water, but not enough of either.The restaurant and bar were open on New Year's Eve but not apparently otherwise. The hotel does NOT serve breakfast. The coffee shop they recommend around the block is not good although Luke's restaurant two blocks away is pleasant. There are serious telephone issues - reaching any hotel staff is hit or miss through out the day but almost always a failure at night. On our way out, there was an error on the bill, double bllling for the last night. The manager quickly righted the situation but it compounded an overall negative impression.This could be a very nice hotel but seriously needs new management and attention to service. Housekeeping is the one exception - it is good. Unfortunately the hotel is not and New Orleans has much better to offer for the money.

<Content>The Excellent Lafayette The Lafayette Hotel in New Orleans is excellent from the quality and friendliness of the staff to the atmosphere and location of the hotel.Our companies' marketing people from across Canada were attending a shopping centre convention in New Orleans. For this convention we were free to choose our own hotel instead of the convention hotel. When traveling on business without my family I prefer boutique hotels over the larger national chains because relationships can be formed with staff and the surroundings.I researched hotels on this website before narrowing down our decision on where to stay and am appreciative for past positive comments, so here are mine.Location - our convention was at the Riverwalk - a six block walk. I like walking so this wasn't an issue for me. If you want a cab the front desk can arrange this for you. You will be seven blocks from Canal Street which will leave you one more block to walk up to the start of Bourbon Street. Again walking isn't an issue for me but a cheap cab ride gets you in and out of the French Quarter rather quickly. Though the hotels in the French Quarter looked nice I was glad we didn't stay in the French Quarter - the noise and perceived danger would have been distracting - that short walk and/or cab ride to the Lafayette solved that problem.Building - everything I expected, a charming boutique that fits into the atmosphere of New Orleans.Rooms - larger than I expected, from my room I could hear the air conditioning units blowing all night but that wasn't a problem for me - I appreciated being cooled off.Staff - on the flight down to New Orleans my permanent black ink pen leaked all over my hands - I also smudged some on my cheek. At checking in, the staff worked to solve my problem with whatever cleansers they could find from the kitchen and spent an hour (maybe more) helping me clean my hands. Throughout our stay the positive attitudes of the people working at the Lafayette made the trip more personal and set the tone - they knew why were in New Orleans and were very encouraging and nice to us by doing their jobs but also by showing they cared.Pricing - the internet price went down after we reserved our rooms and on calling them, our price went down too.If I am ever in New Orleans I will stay at the Lafayette again - it is my first choice. It's so good that one of my co-workers (who was at the same convention) is staying there this winter prior to taking a cruise.

<Content>Absolutely wonderful! I was a bit anxious as I had booked online BUT this was one of the best boutique hotels I/we have ever stayed in.Staff (Kerry, Luis, Gabriel) you were the best.Location was awesome.. easy walk to everything. We were single women travelling alone and felt very safe here.Value for $ was amazing and the rooms were spacious and fun.A litle bit darker than I like but you can't have everything.What would I add? A small business area with a computer for guest use.Hope I can return and will definitely recommend to others.

<Content>Our favorite hotel- The Lafayette We try to get to New Orleans once a month. We love all the interesting neighborhoods, shopping, walking and enjoying all the creative energy in the city. We always stay at the Lafayette Hotel. The location is great, I love the staff and I love the rooms. The hotel is always inviting, for us it's become like visiting an old friend's house. From the moment we pull up to the hotel and hear the classical music from the sidewalk, we start to enjoy the relaxed elegance of New Orleans. We love the Lafayette and would not stay anywhere else.

<Content>Wonderful all round Excellent hotel, pleasant staff, room was beautiful and very clean, comfy (huge) beds, great location (quiet and pretty in the business district but within walking distance to the French Quarter).Only complaint would be that if having a phone and safe in the room is mandatory, and there are mandatory charges associated with that, then they should just include them in the cost of the room. Having them as a separate charge when I don't have any choice but to have them is just annoying.But otherwise can't fault the hotel. Very pleased with our stay.

<Content>Hidden gem. Great service, great room. From the first moment, this hotel was great. Hotel and restaurant staff were cheerful and helpful. The room was very clean, very comfortable, and had nice, quiet AC.Wireless Internet access is freely available, though not incredibly reliable.Will definitely stay here again if the opportunity comes up.

<Content>Southern Hospitality at Lafayette Hotel I just returned from an 8 night stay at the Lafayette Hotel and I must say that I was delighted with the room, outstanding service and location.Our room was extremely spacious and included unexpected amenities including plush bathrobes, extra soft sheets, and decent in-room coffee. The hotel was extremely quiet and we never had to wait for the elevator during the entire stay. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and I truly appreciated their attention to detail. For example, on our first morning, the shower/bathtub was clogged and the water wouldn't drain. I called the front desk, and within 5 minutes, the manager and maintenance man were up in the room fixing the problem. That's what I call service!!Location was walking distance to the French Quarter and Convention Center. We did not need a car during the entire stay as we walked everywhere...In the post-Katrina New Orleans, where service is often underwhelming, it was a welcome change to come back at night to the Lafayette Hotel. Thank you to Gisela and the entire staff!

<Content>Worst stay ever Having read Trip Advisor reviews, I had high hopes for at least a 3 star hotel experience. Boy was I disappointed. I arrived relatively late in the evening to a nonsmoking room that reeked of cigarette smoke, had a huge - and very new - stain on the carpet and a stained and soiled bed spread. It looked like the room had been used as a party suite for Mardi Gras and no one bothered to clean up. The concierge responded to my request for a different room with a, What's wrong with the room? He then grudgingly assigned me to a different room, which definitely smelled better and looked more clean until I pulled out a spare blanket. The blanket was torn and heavily stained with what could have been wine, blood or poo and should have been thrown out a long time ago. Lights didn't work because bulbs were burned out. The safe, for which I was charged extra, did not have a key. The concierge could not tell me whether the room had internet cable or dial up access, and informed me that room service was not available from the restaurant just opposite the lobby. (Room service was actually available.) I've travelled a lot in my life and am generally not that fussy, but the Lafayette advertises itself as a luxury hotel. It certainly is not. Aside from the total lack of hospitality and customer service, the level of filth at this hotel was truly shocking. Spend your money elsewhere.

<Content>Love The Lafayette - pet friendly for large dogs We travel everywhere with our Golden Retreiver Lucy so finding a very nice hotel is VERY difficult to say the least. We were walking by The Lafayette hotel which is located right on a park (perfect for dog duties) and I said to my husband, wouldn't it be great if that beautiful hotel was pet friendly! Well, to my wonderful surprise it was, and not just to small pets but large ones too! The hotel is beautifully done, with extremely comfortable rooms and bedding! There is a wonderful bar on one side of the lobby and a fabulous restaurant on the other and the park.....1/8 block and your in the grass!!! We will always stay here on our visits to New Orleans. Oh, and the manger Kerry! is THE BEST! HE LOVES DOGS!

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel The rooms are large and nicely decorated. Staff was extremely helpful, caring and friendly. The hotel is centrally located within easy walking distance to the French quarter. We enjoyed breakfast every morning at the French Boulangerie with pastries as good as in Paris. Herbsaint, one of the better New Orleans restaurants, is also across the street. The hotel does not have a fitness center but you can use a facility nearby. We will definitely recommend the hotel and will stay there again on our next trip. Great value for a posh hotel.

<Content>Mandatory extra charges I stayed at the Lafayette Hotel for 3 nights.For each day, I was charged 4.95 for the safe and 4.95 for communications.I did not appreciate the extra charge of 9.90 a day because I did not use the safe nor did I use the phone - the cell phone coverage was great!These charges are however, mandatory!Other than that, the Hotel is in a great location and the rooms are very spacious.

<Content>Ranking is far more than deserved Let me be clear, this is NOT a BAD hotel, and I had an OK stay there. BUT it in no way deserves the high ranking it has on TripAdvisor. It is a small hotel (perhaps 40 rooms) located next to Lafayette Park, about 6-8 blocks from the French Quarter. The staff was very nice and tried to be as helpful as they could, which was the best feature of the hotel. However, although I booked directly on their own website, they did not have my reservation when I first checked in. I wanted a room with a refrigerator, but they first put me in a room with no refrigerator and the views out the 2nd floor window were of some ductwork and a brick wall about 3 feet away. I was soon switched to a better room on the 5th (top) floor that had a fridge, but it was old and not very cold. The lighting was poor (lamps only) in the room, and it was fairly dark in the shower as well. Housekeeping did not change the sheets every day, which I noticed when I spilled a small amount of juice on the sheet and the stain was still there the next 2 days. I couldn't get any cold water from the taps (sink  tub); it came out fairly warm. There are few amenities - no concierge, no pool, no free newspaper, or other offerings (like the free peanut butter  jelly  fruits each day at Le Pavilion, where my friend stayed), etc. The TV reception was poor, the channel guide in the room was incorrect, and there weren't any premium channels I could find.Overall the room was fine, the bed comfortable, the rate was good ($95 + hefty taxes), staff was nice. But it wasn't a great value given what I saw of Le Pavilion, and other hotels are closer to the French Quarter if that's where you're spening much of your time.

<Content>Fire Alarms ruined stay We stayed at the Lafayette July 12th. The hotel is very nice and service was good. Our room was clean, quite and comfortable. All was well until 1:45 am when the fire alarm sounded. There was no fire, but the alarm went off every hour until 7 am. As you can imagine, no sleeping was done. The next morning on check out, I had to encourage the manager not to bill us for the night. After a few teeth were pulled they agreed to refund our payment. I think we just had bad luck, as the hotel is really pretty nice, but before you book it make sure the fire alarms are functioning correctly.

<Content>Great hotel My 2nd stay at the Lafayette was just as good as my first. I wasn't sure what to expect after Katrina. The hotel is in great shape and as beautiful and comfortable as ever. The rooms are large with wonderful amenities. Love the plush bathrobes. The restaurant and club are currently being renovated. Coming into the Lafayette is like coming home, but better. Once you're in your room, you hear no noise. It's so peaceful and quiet. The service is outstanding. They do whatever is needed to make your stay wonderful. Great friendly staff. It's so much better than the high-rise hotels in the business district. You never have to wait for an elevator or for service. Right on the St. Charles streetcar line, but unfortunately, it's not running yet. I can hardly wait to go back.

<Content>Lafayette is okay My husband and I stayed at the Lafayette over the last weekend of JazzFest and while the hotel was nice, it amazes me that it could be so highly rated. Our room was very nice sized, large in fact. The bathroom was decent and clean. The lighting for any type of reading left much to be desired and the biggest complaint of all is that the noise from St. Charles Avenue kept me awake all night. If the hotel was up and running at full speed, that is if the bar and restaurant were open there might be a reason to give it a better review but all we did was check in and take the elevator to our room. There are really no public spaces to speak of and the lobby is quite small.There apparently is an agreement with a health club in the area but having one on the premises iwould be so much nicer. Parking was easy because the city is so emplty and street parking was readily available. This was nice as the small lot across t he street was always full. And during our stay, there seemed to be a shortage of staff, which is understandable given the chronic shortage of workers in the City.Right now if you are looking for a comfortable place to stay and don't care about the amenties of a restaurant, bar, work out room, room service or lounge, this is a good alternative to the French Quater hotels. In a pinch I would stay there again but I prefer the Windsor Court.

<Content>The Best Hotel in NOLA My fiance and I stayed at the Lafayette during the second weekend of jazzfest. This was our second time staying at the hotel. We are continually impressed by the service and accomodations at the Lafayette. The rooms are comfortable (we recommend staying in one of their suites with a balcony) and the staff (especially Kerry) are always pleasant and willing to please. The rates are very resonable and it's location is perfect. The Lafayette is close enough to enjoy the Quarter yet far enough away to escape it. Thanks Lafayette for a great weekend!! We can't wait to return.

<Content>A cozy, very service oriented historic hotel! We stayed for the first time at the Lafayette Hotel when visiting this years Jazz Festival in New Orleans, and fully enjoyed our stay at this very charming, centrally located hotel on St. Charles Ave.We understood before we arrived in New Orleans that the city and most hotels are not yet fully back again to Pre-Katrina standards, and that everything was still in a slow rebuilding process; scaling down our expectations in what to expect.When we arrived at the hotel, and the bellmen with his white gloves greeted us friendly, helping us with our luggage and check-in, we knew immediately that we made a good pick with this cozy historic hotel, as the attentive staff and the overall servcie was just excellent and made us feel like being at home from day one! Although the hotels restaurant and coffe shop are still closed for renovations, we felt more than compensated by the great service the always helpful staff pampered us with, and of course by our spacious room accomodations (the marble bathroom alone has hotel room-size already) we enjoyed.We certainly will book the Lafayette hotel again when coming back for the Jazz Festival next year, and can highly recommend this hotel to all travellers visiting this beautiful city!

<Content>Comfortable, but #1 on your site??? We also stayed at the Lafayette for 5 nights during the 2nd weekend of Jazzfest. It was comfortable, but nothing special, especially for the inflated Jazzfest prices. I could not understand how it was ranked #1 on your site, unless the quality dropped markedly afterKatrina. Their restaurant/bar and coffee shop had not yet reopened. The nearest coffee shopis a block away. Herbsaint, a favorite restaurant of ours is on the opposite corner. It is on the quiet Lafayette Square surrounded by courthouses and legal associations. If you wanted a quiet place to escape the noise, bustle and commerciialism of the French Quarter and Bourbon St., this might be ideal for you. Parking is free, but in a narrow alley-like parking lot, in which you can't turn around, and must back out. For 2 of the nights the lot was filled and we had to park on the street. It is 5 blocks from Canal St. and the French Quarter, but the walk is a little spooky at night, and I would not want to do it at night alone in view of the rising post-Katrinacrime rate.Since our daughter just completed her freshman year at Tulane University, we are constantlyon the lookout for comfortable and reasonably priced hotels in or near the Garden District.

<Content>Loved Lafayette! I stayed at the Lafayette with my daughter and her little dog. This hotel is exceptional in the center of the city with a superb location and an impecable service and staff, that did their best to try to help us with all of our questions. I would especially like to point out the manager, Kerry Ryals. We are very pleased with our stay at this pet friendly hotel and we would highly recommended.

<Content>Wonderful stay... For our yearly Jazzfest visit, we decicded to stay at the Lafayette this year. We loved it. The room was a spacious suite that had french doors which opened up to a balcony that overlooked St. Charles ave. The location was wonderful, never had to wait long for a cab and the quarter was a very short walk. Awesome restaurant across the street (Herbsaint). What made the visit so special was the personal attention recieved from the staff. Willing to help out in any way. The manager Kerry was always smiling and willing to answer any questions we had. Can't wait to return!

<Content>Marvelous!!!! The Lafayette Hotel was one of the best accomodations I have ever experienced. The staff was so helpful and pleasant, I felt as if we were family. The room decor made me feel like royalty. Their location was perfect. It was a short walk to the French Quarter and the Riverfront. Their rates are very affordable. New Orleans has the best food and entertainment but what really makes it such a great town is the warmth and hopitality of its people. Take a trip to New Orleans and be sure to stay at the Lafayette Hotel and you will know what I'm talking about. Thank you for such a wonderful stay.

<Content>I will return to the Lafayette The staff at the Lafayette made our stay. Great job, everyone went out of their way to make us feel at home. With NOLA still struggling to get off the ground and a hundred thousand or so folks in for the Jazz Fest, it was great service considering. The main part of town barely showed the damage. You didn't have to drive far to see it though. And services are hard to come by. But the first bad meal we had on our trip was in Atlanta on the way home. When I come back to NOLA, I will try to book the Lafayette first.

<Content>Not as Advertised My husband and I went to NOLA to finalize the sale of our Uptown Home, attend Jazz Fest and celebrate our anniversary. We were excited to splurge at the Lafayette since they had a coffee house and a restaurant with a vodka bar and mini bars in their spacious rooms. Oh, and turn down service twice a day...Well, as it turns out, they had none of the above and there was no morning paper outside our door. The hotel hallway was icy cold and the room looked worn and tired. Our TV remote did not work. There was a yappy dog in the room next door.The saving grace was the staff. The manager was very accomodating and pleasant. He offered to upgrade us to a Suite or help us find another place to stay. We opted for a lower rate on the room we were in.Honestly, there are a lot of hotels that are not open because they cannot offer the kind of service they are used to offering. The Lafayette should let their guests know that they have limited services. This was more of a motel experience than a hotel one.

<Content>very nice hotel My husband and I stayed at the Lafayette during French Quarter Festival. The hotel is very nice and the staff was wonderful. Our room was very big, and the television was situated so far away that it was hard to see, although we don't spend much time watching tv while on vacation anyway. Our bathroom was as big as a small bedroom. We were very pleased with the hotel but prefer to have a French Quarter location. We always walked to the Quarter and even at night felt very safe, but it is just more convenient to be right in the Quarter. We got a very good rate for our stay, less than $100 per night even during the festival. We would stay here again, but only if we couldn't find reasonably priced accommodations in the French Quarter.

<Content>Great Hospitality In view of great ostacles (Hurricane Katrina) this hotel made guests for my son's recent wedding so very comfortable. Very accommodating to the many out of town guests. This was our second stay (the first just prior to Katrina). Both times we were very impressed with the personal service and efficiency.

<Content>Bust a Flat at the Lafayette If you find yourself in New Orleans these days (and you SHOULD, on many levels)--plop down at the Lafayette Hotel. My boyfriend and I were in town celebrating the work of the Innocence Project New Orleans (my second plug), who have just recently exonerated someone from his wrongful conviction in a Mississippi prison. He was apologized to, by the judge, on behalf of the state, for losing 12 years of his life. ?!!!?! So wonderful. ANYHOW, we've always wanted to stay here. Even standing outside the doorway, looking onto the street: magnolia trees in bloom and piano music as you enter; hallways glitter, as do your purple and gold keys, chandeliers, gorgeous views of the park and federal buildings, etc. The concierge/owner, new staff, longtime staff, were absolutely kind. They gave us a beautiful suite...with a feather-top bed! If you are interested in supporting a smaller, friendly, indepently-owned hotel in New Orleans, with the class and candor that come with such a thing, you'll love it. I'm definitely coming back!

<Content>Wedding Anniversary We are from Kenner, Louisiana and our house was damaged due to Hurricane Katrina. Our current living quarters is living in FEMA trailer with our 2 daughters (17  12).My 25th wedding anniversary was during Mardi Gras this year and had friends staying at the Lafayette Hotel. I wanted something special with all the distractions and called the Lafayette for a room but they were all booked, I then explained to the General Manager (Geisla)how important this was to us, well the next morning I received a phone call that there was a room available. How joyful.That weekend was exceptional when arriving in the room there was a chilled bottle of Champagne compliments from the hotel, amazing that someone actually cares.Thank you for a wonderful 25th Wedding Anniversary Geisla and the Staff at the Lafayette Hotel.Tim

<Content>Consistently excellent service New Orleans has a gem of a hotel located downtown, and that hotel is called the Lafayette. I have been a guest at the Lafayette twice now, first, during Hurricane Katrina, and second, while preparing for arguments in federal court. The hotel is steps away from the court buildings, and 5-6 blocks from the bustle (and noise) of the French Quarter. So the location is really the best of both worlds to me.But the location is only a minor part of what makes this hotel so special. The staff is outstanding. It is a rare experience these days to find a hotel staff that seeks out ways to make my stay pleasant. But the staff at the Lafayette goes out of its way to help its guests. There is a reason why the Lafayette Hotel was rated as the #1 Hotel in New Orleans in Trip Advisor for 2005.I will be returning to the Lafayette Hotel again, and again. If I have my stay, this is the only hotel I'll visit in New Orleans.

<Content>Great Staff at The Lafayette Hotel My visit at the Lafayette Hotel in New Orleans, La. was the most exciting experience in a Small Luxury Hotel in a very long time....The staff is second to none which you only find in a much larger hotel (Windsor Court, Four Seasons, etc.)And even after Hurricane Katrina my short visit was just as enjoyable.....Highly recommended......Darryl ToyHouston, Texas

<Content>Twelve years of terrific service! My husband and I have been staying at the LaFayette for over twelve years. While dating long distance we often met in N.O. and enjoyed a romantic courtship at the Lafayette. Now, happily married, we live in Pensacola, FL, just a three hour drive away, and the Lafayette is our favorite quick getaway for our anniversary, birthday celebrations or just a fun weekend away. They treat us like a King and Queen. We stayed at the LaFayette just a week before Katrina - we were escaping our own devastated neighborhood wiped out by Ivan a year earlier. (We were living in a new RV while building a new home.) Our last stay at the LaFayette for our anniversary was spectacular. Because they keep track of their frequent guests, the front desk sent up a bottle of bubbly for us with a nice note from the staff. Service was excellent; room was, as usual, delightful. Even a free upgrade to a suite! We enjoyed coffee and a breakfast pastry in the new coffee house next door, we toured the Garden District on the St. Charles St. street car, and we always enjoy the combo plate at the Gumbo Shop with a shared order of bread pudding with whisky sauce. Oh yes, and a trip to the French Market and Cafe Du Monde is a must. The Lafayette has taken good care of us, consistently, over the years. As a business traveler I stay in nearly 150 hotels each year. The Lafayette is my favorite personal time hotel. I always feel well-rested, safe and secure, and like an appreciated guest at the Lafayette.

<Content>Better than the website My husband and I stayed at the Lafayette to celebrate our anniversary this year (June). It was our first time at this hotel and didn't know what to expect. As many may know you don't always get what a website shows and for the price that we paid I was thinking there was no way it could be as nice as described - I was so wrong! It was even better than the website made it out to be. It was elegant and romantic. Not to mention very spacious. The staff was very friendly and helpful with our daily plans. When we left I realized that we had left our pillows (king size feather made by my mom 20 yrs ago) but with a phone call they had them sent to me in a very speedy manner. We loved it so much that we took our teenaged daughter and adult son, daughter-in-law, and grandaughter back in August. We got a queen room and a queen suite which were joined and felt like we had our own apartment. I don't think we would even think of staying anywhere else in New Orleans. It breaks our heart to hear that it sustaned damage in the hurricane but you can count on us to be back as soon as it is receiving guests again.

<Content>Hospitality in the face of a Hurricane I left the Big Easy just before Katrina arrived. The staff of the Lafayette Hotel, especially Matthew Roberts, demonstrated what southern hospitality means, right up to the last second of my visit with them. That is what is felt like, a visit with friends who have a really big, welcoming home. From the friendly smiles and the greetings, by name, you truly felt like a guest in their home. The remarkable thing is, the staff didn't know the condition of their own homes. While the city was being violated by Katrina, these gentle people make sure that each guest was taken care of until they left.For that I am eternially grateful.

<Content>I hope the LaFayette survives I kept telling myself to review the LaFayette after our stay in May 2005...and never got around to it. Now I'm concerned about its future after the hurricane. This is a fantastic hotel - understated elegance, tasteful, quiet. No big noisy lobby - just a warm, personal welcoming lobby. Our room was large, unique, beautiful, with an historic feel that added greatly to our New Orleans experience. It is walking distance to so many of the things we wanted to see, and right on the St. Charles trolley line which took us out to beautiful old homes in the Garden District, the zoo, etc. Highly recommend.

<Content>Beautiful Room I had a beautiful, elegant and large room at the Lafayette Hotel with four French windows on St. Charles Avenue for $79 a night. For some reason the cold water was really shower temperature, but that worked -did not have to mix hot and cold. The street car is handy - just outside. I thought it might be noisy since it runs all night, but it was not a problem. Great place and short walk to the French Quarter.

<Content>Incredible Customer Service My husband was staying at The Lafayette Hotel on business. It happened to be his birthday. I was so sad that he would not have anything special for his special day. I called the hotel and they told me they would leave him a bottle of wine with a Happy Birthday note from me. I offered to pay, but they refused...how nice! It is rare that you come across such customer/wife friendly businesses! Thank you Lafayette Hotel!

<Content>breath taking I am a 66 year old widow, and had planned a trip to New Orleans with two nieces and a grand-daughter. We all vary in age from 20-66. Two flew and two drove. The air arrival was first and grand-daughter and self were last. I had the resveration in my name, so while on the road trip had called and explained nieces would be arriving early, the telephone person was most polite and said would care for them upon arrival. When they arrived they where greeted with nothing but nice and helpful. They got check into their room and called to tell me have happy they where, that was a relief as I had done this all on the internet, not really knowing what we would get. We arrived about one hour after them. The front dest had remember and welcomed us to the Lafayette and New Orleans. He took care of car and gave us keys. Up the elevator we went filled with excitement. Our room was furnished with Kindel furniture, a little old but beautiful. I am a retired designer and know the Kindel name, in fact own some myself, and this pleased me very much. Our room where across the hall from each other, making the stay even nicer. We girls like to roam in our loungers and that we did. The bathrooms where nice and my grand-daughter enjoyed the nice terry robe. We stayed three nights and each evening was good. One evening we had room service and food was excellent and reasonably priced. We did travel the trolly car a lot and front desk explaned the lines and most helpful. Oh yes, my niece loved the coffee shop, she is really into good coffee and said was as good as Starbucks. We, really enjoyed our stay and plan to make this a yearly trip, and we will be staying at the Lafayette. New Orleans and Lafayetter Hotel, you rank at the top.Anna J Baldwin9013 WexfordSan Antonio, Texas 78217

<Content>Much, much more than we ever expected The Lafayette Hotel is the perfect place for a romantic getaway. Close enough to walk or take a tram to all major attractions, the French Quarter, the Warehouse District and the Garden District. You鈥檙e even just 5 minutes walk from the Louisiana Superdome. The hotel provides extremely spacious and elegant accommodation. It oozes charm and romance. The coffee shop has the most delicious range of cakes, pastries and light-bites. To the other side of the lobby is a classy vodka bar, Rasputin鈥檚, a hip place to hang out either at the start or at the end of the night. We would choose to stay here again when next in New Orleans.

<Content>Exceptional hospitality My wife and I throughly enjoyed our stay at the Lafayette Hotel. We felt the management personnel extended us a cordial welcome. Having stayed in various hotels in and out of this country we found the Lafayette extremely satisfying and relaxing. We liked the feel and the amenities around us. Looking forward to our next stay at the Lafayette.

<Content>Loved the LaFayette Hotel I have had numerous stays at the LaFayette Hotel and it is wonderful. The staff is very polite, friendly and most helpful. I have never had a bad experience there. It is in a great location and easy accessibility. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The staff memebers go out of their way to make sure that your stay is the best that it can be. Mr. Williams is the Asst. Manager and has always gone above and beyound to make sure everything is running smoothly for his clients. I would highly recommend anyone to stay at this beautiful hotel.

<Content>stylish, quiet, very comfortable -Service is excellent. view their website for the long list of amentities. their pictures and descriptions are very accurate.-The hotel itself is beautiful and in a quiet area just 5 blocks from the quarter. i enjoyed the privacy of a small hotel. -Our room was tastefully decorated, lit by several very tall windows, and just the right size--big enough to relax and move around w/o bumping into the furniture. -Bed was firm and comfortable. -Marble bathroom was old but nice. water pressure varies--my only complaint. -French bakery across the street, restaurants downstairs and nearby (pan-asian was spicy and friendly).-Wireless internet was very helpful for planning tours and routes.-a mandatory daily charge covers phone, unlimited long distance, and the in-room safe. this has become common practice in N.O., so figure it in when pricing rooms.-Street car runs right in front of the hotel, and circles back on the next street over. a three day bus/streetcar pass makes trips to the quarter and other areas of town cheap and easier on the feet... the hotel can tell you how to get one, and there's a website for new orleans RTA.i've been to new orleans many times. if you don't mind (or you prefer) a little distance from the bustle, i highly recommend the lafayette.special thanks to torino, our night desk man. he is very friendly and very helpful.

And that special touch that we all look forward these days.Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. We will return

<Content>Romantic!!!!! My wife and I love it!!!! It being the customer service, the exceptional friendly welcome like we received from Matthew at the front desk. His smile made our day.We were arriving for our 25th anniversary. Matthew made sure that our stay was out of this world. He actually sent us roses and a bottle of champage with out me asking for them. He did all this out of the kindness of his own heart and that was just extrodinary. You never see that kind of care for anyone anymore. It was truly a rewarding stay. My wife and I will always remember our stay at the Lafayette Hotel and it will always be a pleasureable one!!!

<Content>Wonderful Experience My husband (Donald)  Myself (Carlas Meche) stayed at The Lafayette Hotel June 18th 2005 for our 13th wedding anniversary. Words can not begin to describe how pleased we were with our experience we had. From the moment we drove to the front door until checking out. We felt as if we were the only guest in the entire hotel for that weekend especially with it being a special occasion for us. I have already recommended The Lafayette Hotel to Family and friends that are going to be staying in New orleans. The Service from the Staff was outstanding andvery pleasant. I will continue to always stay at the Lafayette Hotel when I take a trip to New Orleans. The Lafayette Hotel is very classy and relaxing at the same time. Home away from home. Thank you Lafayette Hotel for a wonderful experience.Donald and Carlas Meche

<Content>One of my favorite hotels The Lafayette is a charming hotel, just outside the French quarter and convenient to everything -- the Garden District, the Convention Center, the warehouse district. The rooms are very comfortable and each is different. It is very un Holiday Innish. There is a nice coffee and wine bar that is attached to the hotel. Staff are also friendly and helpful. I highly recommend it.

<Content>Kudos to the Lafayette Hotel My stay at the Lafayette Hotel was very splendid and superb. I thoroughly felt like a Queen, the serene surroundings and the wonderful staff took real good care of me and mine. If I could go and turn back the hands of time, I would choose the Lafayette a million times over. Words can not explain the way I enjoyed my stay at the Lafayette. To all of you out there, you have to experience it, please don't rob yourself of the opportunity.

<Content>Good Experience Here! Just got back from 4 days in NO. This was our 1st trip here. We researched hotels on Trip Advisor before booking a room. After reading numerous reviews, we decided to stay at the Lafayette. This hotel seemed to have good reviews and reasonable prices. We arrived at the hotel and found it to be in a good area. The front desk staff, Pam, was very friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean and cozy. The beds are very comfortable and the hotel is clean. The streetcar runs in front of the hotel, but never bothered us. There is also a good cafe next door to get a quick bite to eat. Needless to say, when we return to NO, we will stay here again.

<Content>a remarkable experience The experience that I had at the Lafayette Hotel was both inticing and rememorable. There was one person who really made my day comfortable, her name was Mary Banks. She made sure I had everything I needed plus all the things I wanted. For instance when I needed some extra supplies she sent for them and when she found out it hadn't been brought to me she went to get them herself. Mary is the type of person who I would like to deal with on a daily routine. She had a wonderful attitude even though that may not have been a part of her job discription. That is all I would like to say about the woman who made my stay at the Lafayette Hotel a remarkable experience.

<Content>Home away from home My stay at the Lafayette Hotel was a home away from home experience. There was one employee whom I was especially pleased with, her name was Mary Banks. No matter what I needed she was always at my service with an excellent attitude. There should be more people like her that work for hospitality industries. My room was extremely hot and no one came to fix it when she called, so she did a follow-up call to see if they took care of me and when she found out it hadn't been taken care of she personnaly came to my to try to fix it herself. After she couldn't fix it Mary explained that the hotel was sold out, but she brought a fan to our room still trying to make our stay the most enjoyable. Whenever I return to New Orleans I will Most deffinatly stay at the Lafayette Hotel and recommend it to all of my family and friends.

<Content>This is the Place to Stay! This is the Place to stay!!!!!! Can't say enough about the outstanding staff, and the unbelieveable customer service. The rooms are very spacious indeed, and the bedding was extremely comfortable. I loved the way that the Front Desk Staff, liike Matthew  Pam, remembered your name it truly felt like they really cared about you. They would stop everything during their busy day and truly listen and explain how to get around the city and what to see and do. That is a rarity these days. Hats off to you all excellant service. I will return!

<Content>Outstanding Hotel A spur of the moment trip plan sent my girlfriend and I to New Orleans. As always the down part of any trip is the service and the hotel room. NOT at the Lafayette! The moment we checked in Matthew was super, and everyone else was so accomendating and friendly. When I needn't another iron, I hadn't hung the phone up when the someone was the door with a new one. Our room was delightful, service and ambience grand, and location with the streetcar out front couldn't be beat. Reservation mess up on Expedia's end, however, Mary at the Lafayette was patience and respectful on the phone. Get the Vistapass at the airport from the bank, and you can ride buses and streetcars all day into the wee hours of the morning for only $5 a day. Music could be heard from the attached club, Rasputin, but New Orleans is not a silent town., it just adds to the ambience. That's what ear plugs were made for. Thanks again Lafayette staff, it was a pleasure!

<Content>A great location and fabulous atmosphere I lived in New Orleans for nearly two years and was back visiting for a baby shower. I wanted something located near Uptown where the shower was being held but also not too far from all the other fun things to do in New Orleans since my husband was with me and needed something to do. The Lafayette was the perfect place. At the Lafayette, my husband could experience what it was like for me when I lived in New Orleans on the street car route. He loved it! Plus, he could walk to the Quarters and ride the street car while I was with my friends at the shower. The staff was helpful and the room was clean and quiet with the occassional sound of the street car passing by. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A true piece of heaven An Angel had to have designed this hotel because this is how I would imagine heaven to be. From the moment we got to the door we were treated like the owners of the hotel. The staff was excellent and their service was superb. We wanted to extend our stay but didn't have the time. You want comfort and luxury this is the place to be. We called it our small piece of heaven.

<Content>The Lafayette The hotel staff was great and the rooms were very clean. The only improvement we found that there were no schedules for the adjoining coffee shop or bar around the Fourth of July. We wanted to get some coffee and we found the place closed; not a real big deal, but it would be nice to know.

<Content>A wonderful place to stay Visiting New Orleans and having stayed at the Lafayette hotel, I feel compelled to write about it and post this short review. The Lafayette hotel in my opinion is a wonderful place to stay and I will return in the future. Having booked a discounted room online, I did not expect getting a suite when checking in. The suite was very spacious and comfortable with attention to every detail and an always very clean oversized marble bathroom. The hotel service is outstanding and can be considered as first class, with an always friendly hotel staff that seems to be very well trained. The hotel itself is centrally located within short walking distances to the French Quarter, the convention center, the casino, the riverwalk and many great restaurants.I will certainly recommend the Lafayette hotel to my associates and friends.

<Content>Our Lafayette Hotel stay was top notch What a nice surprise to walk into a hotel room and get so much more than you anticipated!!! It was a wonderful place, service was top notch, and would stay there again. It was in walking distance to many wonderful places including Bourbon Street. You could even ride the street car right back to the hotel if you were tired of walking. Nice coffee house in the same building and a unique bar as well.

<Content>Our stay here was wonderful and a pleasant surprise Our stay at the Lafayette hotel was a very pleasant surprise. The room given to us was spacious, nicely furnished and very clean. The hotel staff was just great, always friendly and helpful when it came to any questions regarding what to do and where to go in New Orleans. The location of the Lafayette is wonderful, with the trolleystop right across the street, and within an easy walking distance to most tourist attractions and restaurants. We certainly would book this hotel again when coming back to this lovely city, and will recommend it to all our friends.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed at the Lafayette Hotel over Memorial Day weekend. The hotel is a small, quaint hotel located on the famous St. Charles Ave. The streetcar line ran in front of the hotel, which was very convenient. The hotel itself was so nice. The rooms were spacious, clean, and very comfortable. The bathroom even had white rugs on the floor which were changed every day. We booked through hotels and didn't have a clue what we were getting for our money. The information on the Lafayette's website was incorrect. It said that Mike Ditka's restaurant was in the hotel. When we arrived, there was a nightclub called Rasputin's. Our room was right above it. Needless to say when the music started at llpm and didn't stop until 2, we didn't get much sleep. The next evening a private party was held there, and all we heard was this weird instrumental music playing. There is a cafe to the right of the hotel and it was very nice. A great place to get a great cup of coffee and read the paper. I realize that New Orleans is a party town, but the next time I will investigate further to see what clubs are located in the vicinity.

<Content>It felt like Home Lafayette Hotel felt like home! From the day that I arrived I was treated like I was family. From the deligent and very welcoming Front Desk staff such as Matthew  Mary, Management and Housekeeping, my needs were tended to like I was staying at a Grand Resort.I being a Travel Agent, (and no they did not know that I was a Travel Agent when I arrived or when I made my visit), am very into the small details and amenities that a hotel may offer my clients. As well the cleanliness of a Hotel and the details to such are as important to me as the amenities because it shows what goes on behind the curtain, and what we may expect if that curtain is pulled back. May I say that I will continually book this property for my clients, and recommend the Lafayette Hotel to all my friends and business partners for now on!!!! Although I was on business, it felt like a true vacation!

<Content>Simply Amazing It was simply amazing when I arrived into the foyer of the Hotel. I was not expecting such a beautifully elegant entry. There is something to say about staying at a smaller Lux. Property. At first when I arrived I was taken back by the way that I was treated. I felt like a Princess! I was told if there was anything that I wanted or needed at all, all I had to do was ask, on top of all that I was complimentary upgraded into one of their best suites. It was true comfort. Lafayette Hotel is deffinately the place to stay if you want elegance, and then top it off with unbelieveable customer service, to which you will truly have a wonderful memory of New Orleans. I will absolutely tell everyone that I know if they are thinking of going to New Orleans for their next vacation there is absolutely only one place to stay and that is the Lafayette Hotel.

<Content>Experienced New Orleans with style at the Lafayette hotel It was our first visit to New Orleans, and we are still 鈥榳owed鈥?about the many positive experiences we had during our extended anniversary weekend stay. The city and its people were wonderful, and the very charming, historic Lafayette hotel pampered us in any way possible during our stay. Although we booked the hotel online for a discounted rate, the hotel surprised us for our anniversary with a very spacious accommodation, granting us to stay in one of their wonderful, luxury suites at no extra costs.During our stay the hotel staff was always very attentive and helpful in any way possible.Without any hesitations, we would highly recommend a stay at the Lafayette hotel not only to our friends when visiting this exciting city, but also to all other travelers who like to experience New Orleans with style!

<Content>A delightful stay at the Lafayette hotel This was my 5th trip to New Orleans, and my first stay ever at the Lafayette hotel was a real delight. The hotel staff was very welcoming, professional, extremely friendly and always eager to please. The nicely furnished rooms are very spacious, very clean and have a very comfortable bed. As someone who is not from the South, I really felt it was very much worth it to stay at this hotel that has a feel of combining old world flair and history with southern hospitality. On my next travel to New Orleans I certainly will choose the Lafayette hotel again.

<Content>Highly pleased with The Lafayette Hotel My husband and I stayed at The Lafayette in April for a quick (and much needed!) anniversary getaway weekend. I always do a huge amount of research when planning vacations, and chose this hotel based on the many positive Trip Advisor reviews. Once again, my research paid off....this was a wonderful hotel. The location was ideal; close enough to the Quarter that you could walk it, but away from the noise, smell, and litter of Bourbon Street. You could also catch the trolley or take a $6 cab to get there. We had a suite with a king sized bed and a separate sitting room. It was on the fifth floor, and had a lovely view overlooking the park. The decor was tasteful and not hotel-cookie cutter, and the bed was one of the most comfortable that either of us have ever slept on. The water was quite hot and had good pressure in the shower. I don't know if the walls were nice and thick due to the building's age or if everyone on our floor was just very quiet, but we didn't have any noise problems at all. It seems that the hotel is trying to improve it's amenities, as they did offer limited room service and are building a coffee bar/internet cafe down in the lobby. We didn't spend any time in Rasputin's, the martini bar/restaurant in the lobby, but I did buy a few beers and take them upstairs to have later, and it was very nice. It would be a good place to have drinks and enjoy conversation with your date/friends or other travelers. The physical accomodations were lovely, but the staff really made the place stand out. Pam, who took care of the front desk, was very patient and sweet in all her interactions with me, and this was especially helpful when we first arrived and I was operating on nothing more than a nap the night before and was a bit neurotic, I'm sure. She also worked really hard to get us a room that was perfect for us. Gilbert, the doorman/bellboy/jack-of-all-trades was very helpful and is just a very nice person.Usually, the next time we return to a city, we'll try another hotel, but that won't be the case in New Orleans. The Lafayette Hotel exceeded all of our expections, and will be where we stay and the hotel we recommend to friends planning a trip there.

<Content>Historic Charm and Elegance If you would like to combine historic charm coupled with a spacious and nicely decorated rooms, this is an excellent choice. Upon our arrival we were , to our very pleasant surprise, greeted by a very attentitive and friendly hotel staff. We were there the second week of Mardi Gras and were treated as if we were the Mardi Gras king and queen. My expectations are generally high and are in most cases , not met, not with the Lafayette. We had a wonderful time from the excellent service to the atmosphere and charm of the hotel. The General Manager Mrs. Schumann went out of her way to see that our stay exceeded our expectations, and they did. Thank you for a wonderful stay.

<Content>Not very impressed Quite disappointed in my abbreviated (I switched hotels after 1 night) stay here. I arrived late and there was no one to help me with my bags. When I got to the room, hoping for a good movie and a meal after a long flight, I found out there was no room service, despite what their website claims or pay-per view movies, which should be standard for this category hotel. The walls must be incredibly thin because the sound of my amorous next door neighbors repeatedly awakened me. Then a jackhammer across the street woke me at 7 AM.There were also partially used amenities in my bathroom, which the maid didn't bother clearing away from the last guest.The morning manager seemed quite uninterested in the fact that I wanted to cut short my stay and move to another hotel (at least they didn't charge me for the unused nights.)I moved to the JW Marriott - they had fabulous rooms that were $70 less than the Lafayette.

<Content>Some good, some bad I was looking for a room on a very busy conference weekend, and was able to find room here when all the major chains were booked. (Late March 2005) The last review is very accurate. it is a nice location, but the rooms are a little dated and some of the service lacked. My room had curtains that didn't quite close, and I had issues with the temp, too. There is a very small TV, shower pressure was poor, and the sofa in my room was kind of stained and dirty. Plusses: Comfy bed, nice sized room, quiet (very little outside or hall noise), wireless internetBiggest frustration: the restuarant is under going rennovation and so there was no place to get breakfast or a bottle of water. (I was there for business and did not have the time to search out a quaint spot for every meal.)If you like quaint old small hotels, this is not a bad choice, but the place does need some sprucing up.

<Content>All in all a good choice for the price We stayed around the Easter weekend, 2005. Let me make clear that I would return to the Lafayette because of its offerings for the price, but there are a lot of problems that the management would do well to resolve in order to run a more successful hotel. Its strengths are its location (away from but in walking distance to the French Quarter in an area of NO that is interesting in itself and on the St. Charles streetcar line); large, suite-like rooms; good beds, pillows, appointments; good price ($79/night rack rate); charm; among other things. Its weaknesses are that it is a bit tired and suffering from deferred maintenance. Just a few examples: sofa was ripped, bathroom ceiling coming down, toilet misfunctioned, refrigerator broke, mirror fell off the wall, all but one window was painted shut, controller on the new climate control system was way off, bringing the temperature of the room to 59 degrees when set at 72 (bur-r-r). Most bothersome was that the functional problems were not fixed despite our having reported them to the front desk. Staff were particularly unhelpful and unable to answer any questions asked, claiming lack of knowledge about the area. Our reservation experience was odd, too. We called 3 different times and got 3 different rates (from $ 79 to $ 229 per night for the same 5-day period). To the daily rate is tacked on a mandatory appx. $ 8/day internet (we didn't use it) and telephone access charge. Parking rate (across the street in an unlocked lot) comes to about $ 20/night. With better management (and cleaning crew) this could be a very nice place.

<Content>Loved the Lafayette I remember trying to decide on a hotel and reading these reviews -- so I'll return the favor. Stay here! It's a cool place, even if they don't have room service. We were very happy to find our room had a sitting area separate from the bedroom. It was so comfy. The staff could be a little laissez-faire in the evenings, but we rolled with it. There's a sports bar off the lobby where you can get something to eat, and a red Russian place too -- but I don't recommend the stroganoff. The location is convenient, yet away from the swirl. The room was the best part but, let's face it, we had a great time in New Orleans and fond memories of the whole trip!

<Content>Will definitely stay here again! I have stayed at several hotels in the French Quarter and a few in the business district. While it is convenient to stay in the Quarter, I feel most of the decent rooms are priced out of my range. Anyway, Stayed at the Lafayette and not only was it affordable, the rooms where nice, clean, and spacious with antique furniture. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel which is convenient if you don't have time to explore New Orleans. Please beaware that the hotel charges for parking, safe use (even if you don't use it) and phone usage (again, even if you don't use it). This last charge is not so bad as it is for unlimited use and is good if you need to call family, friends, etc. All in all, this way a great hotel and I will only stay here!

<Content>A great place to stay in New Orleans I attended a financial industry convention in New Orleans during the 1st week of Mardi Gras, and was booked with some of my peers at the Lafayette Hotel.When arriving at the hotel I was greeted by a very attentitive and friendly hotel staff, and was given a wonderful oversized hotel room that looked more like a suite (I learned that all of the hotels rooms are very large and offer a suites like impression!).The hotel itself provides not only a great guest service, but also offers many nice, detailed amenities, as well as a great overall environment for business and leisure travelers. The hotel is perfectly located within a few blocks of walking distances to the French Quarter, the Convention Center, and well known restaurants such as Emeril's etc. On a side note, having visited this hotel during the 1st week of Mardi Gras, I can state with high confidence that this hotel is the best location for visitors who like to come to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, as the Lafayette Hotel is not only located on the premier Mardi Gras parade route (the St. Charles Ave.), but has also its own balcony's, and its own large grand stands to watch the intriguing several, exciting parades that take place over a period of 2 weeks!

<Content>A Class Establishment My wife and I throughly enjoyed our stay at the Lafayette Hotel. When we entered our suite our first remark was that this is really nice place. The hotel is located in a quiet area in the business district only a short walk or ride from the French Quarter. The hotel was built in the early 1900's and has been brought totally up to date without losing its classic elegant look. The suite was very large and comfortable and beautifully decorated. The employees were very friendly and available to help all the time. Parking was not a problem as they have a small parking area right across the street and they get your car on a moments notice. The hotel has a restaurant that had great food at suprisingly affordable prices. There is also a bar in the hotel. The trolley runs right past the front of the hotel. The Lafayette Hotel will be one of the high points you remember on your visit to New Orleans.

<Content>Experienced the finest Hospitality Services at The Lafayette Hotel' My wife and I are world travelers and have stayed at many fine hotels throughout the world. ... Before going on a cruise that departed from New Orleans, we decided to spend a few days in this wonderful city, and choosed The Lafayette Hotel as one of only a very few hotels recommended by the distinguished travel website Conde Nast - Johansens. ... Being recommended by Conde Nast Johansens, and re-checking the hotel with Trip Advisor and Expedia, we had no doubts at all that we could expect a wonderful and historic hotel that is also very service oriented. .... To our very pleasant surprise, our high expectations even exceeded what we ever expected, as the historic and beautiful Lafayette Hotel has not only very spacious and nicely decorated rooms, but also has a wonderful service oriented, always friendly staff that gave its best to pamper us in every way! ... We can in all honesty state, that our stay at The Lafayette Hotel' proved to be one of the ultimate hospitality experiences my wife and I ever have seen in the past 10 plus years traveling the globe, as everything was excellent, from the service we received, the atmosphere of the hotel, the very spacious room, to the value of the room rate. ... It shall be very hard, if even at all possible to find the hospitality services and the heartwarming enjoyment provided by the excellent General Manager Mrs. Giselle Schumann and her very well trained staff. ... It will be our sincere pleasure to recommend this unique, very distinctive historic hotel very highly to all travelers who will visit New Orleans in the future! ... We certainly will be returning hotel guests whenever we will travel to New Orleans!

<Content>A great stay at the Lafayette My husband and I needed a hotel at the last minute for a wedding we were attending in New Orleans. We chose the hotel based on its proximity to the church where the wedding was being held (about a block away). We got a very good rate for the room, and we were able to park on the street at a meter. (It was the weekend, so no feeding the meter!)We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Troy, the valet, was especially kind. We loved our room (on the 5th floor) and its unique furnishings. We also appreciated the range of television channels available and the comfy mattress and bedding. The hotel is right across the street from a superb restaurant (HerbSaint) and just around the corner from a little coffee shop. We really enjoyed our stay, and we'd stay there again!

<Content>A good bargain, nice hotel We stayed here two nights during New Year's week and enjoyed our stay. No complaints with the room, it was large and we wouldn't have needed an upgrade. It is a good bargain for the money and you are right on the streetcar line (yes, we heard it running all night, but it didn't bother me).My only complaint was that they charged us for having a room safe (which we didn't use at all) AND $4.95/day for having a telephone in the room (also didn't use). They told us it was standard in New Orleans, but the other property we stayed at did not charge us for this. When we went to check out, the bellman (not the desk clerk) checked us out, and he charged us twice for the room (which was prepaid) and it took a little doing to get our final billing correct

<Content>Good hotel, but a bit dissapointing After reading the reviews of this hotel, I was expecting more than was delivered. It is a nice hotel, with decent size rooms, and a great bed, but the service left something to be desired. I didn't find the staff particularly helpful, and we didn't receive the wake-up call we requested as we were catching a flight the next day.It is within reasonable walking distance to the Quarter, and the fact that it is right on the streetcar line is a definate bonus. The Rasputin bar on the main floor is good, and a nice change from the bars in the Quarter.Our room on the second floor was located directly beside the building's HVAC system, so terrible view, and loud.All in all, nice hotel, but not great.

<Content>Superb experience While filming the moviePool Hall Prophets from November 15th thru December 29th. The company Paid for my Hotel expenses thru the end of filming. The experience I enjoyed while a guest of the Lafayette was so outstanding, I wisely decided to fly my son into New Orleans to enjoy the historical and friendly surrondings of this city. The Management of the hotel with their superb staff gave me an opportunity to enjoy my next weeks' stay (at my own expense) and have my son enjoy that same warm southern hospitality that I formerly thought to be mythical commercial propoganda. The time spent at the Lafayette prved to be the ultimate experience that my son  i have had together. He is looking forward to similar experiences to be shared with me. It shall be hard if even possible to find the service provided and the heartwarming enjoyment provided by Mr. George Matthews and his staff.

<Content>Worst Experience I've ever had.... I was travelling here for business with my co worker and we booked our rooms about a week in advance. My AMEX was charged at the time of booking so naturally I assumed our rooms were being held. Not so. We arrived at about 6:00 PM after picking up our luggage and riding the shuttle to the hotel. My room was available but they didn't have a room for my coworker. We were told that we ran the risk of losing our room because of our late check in. I've never heard of 6 pm being a late check in. Then the front desk worker said Can't she just stay in your room? I thought that was totally inappropriate for him to even suggest that. What if she had been a male coworker? We were late for a meeting so they told us to go to the meeting and they would have it figured out by the time we got back. When we returned the bellman laughed and said bad news, she was going to have to stay 4 blocks away at another hotel, but that they had made a reservation for her. When they called to check the reservation, the hotel had no such reservation. They couldn't find the hotel that they supposedly had her put in. No one seemed to know what to do, apparently this had never happened before. After a lot of hemming and hawing, they finally said they had a room for my coworker. This was about 11:00 PM. When she got in the room, it looked ok, but when she walked in the bathroom there was a ladder set up with shards of broken ceiling tiles all over the floor. The bathroom was obviously under construction. So, my coworker stayed in my room and the next day we lugged our luggage through the rain 3 blocks up to the Marriott where we should have been to begin with. Bottom line, I have never received such poor service in my life. The entire staff made us feel like it was our fault that we were having such a poor experience and didn't seem to care at all that my coworker was completely roomless on the streets of New Orleans. On top of that, none of the staff had any training on what to do in a situation like this. I can deal with people losing reservations or having a full house, but there needs to be some sort of protocol. On top of all this, they charged us for the room that we had to share that one night. I will never stay at this hotel again and will try to prevent as many people as I can from having this same kind of experience.

<Content>Wonderful room, great welcome I was delighted by my wonderful room and warm welcome especially as, luggage lost, I arrived very late at night in September. That classic room in an attractive 'boutique' hotel, good bed, graceful furniture and quiet atmosphere (no sound from the cheerful sports bar below) was enormously pleasing. I also appreciate the amenities inc an umbrella (tho luckily I had sunshine every day). I liked it too that I could walk easily to the French Quarter and, when I rented a car and drove out of town for a day, that I could get myself back without difficulty. I would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Where was that great service??? I picked the Lafayette based on the stellar reviews I read here. It wasn't a bad hotel, but the staff was not the friendly, helpful group I'd been expecting.Things I didn't like:1. Staff didn't offer any assistance for 1st time visitors. One even sent us the wrong way to catch the St. Charles street car heading for Canal St. They had no maps, and were overall duds when it came to suggesting places to eat at or see.2. Couldn't get ice sent to your room to save your life. Both times I called down, the phone at the front desk just rang and rang (at 8 pm). I had to go down to the bar to get my own ice.3. Front desk couldn't cash a $50 travellers check for more than 3 days.4. Couldn't get a broken shower or in-room refrigerator fixed.5. Wireless internet did not work at all. I tried both their ethernet bridge and my card, but could never connect to their network. 6. One front desk clerk actually started making a personal phone call while I was waiting to get information.Things I liked:1. The rooms were nice, albeit a bit run down. The cleaning staff was great and the room looked nice and fresh everytime we returned.2. The location was okay. A bit of a walk to the French Quarter - especially after walking all day - but the street car is convenient.3. Rooms can be made nice and dark with thick, heavy drapes. They were also pretty quiet.4. Unique decor in the rooms differs greatly from the cookie cutter rooms of the Hyatt or such hotels. Makes you feel like you're staying in a historic place.5. Suites were very roomy. The one basic room I saw seemed a bit small after being in the suite.Overall, the Lafayette was an okay experience. I wouldn't stay there again, but I would have liked to see some of the great customer service I'd read about on here. Most of the staff was pleasant, but I didn't meet anyone who went out of their way to assist us. Actually, the staff at the Holiday Inn on Convention Street (where I cashed my traveller's check) was more willing to assist me than the staff at my own hotel. Who'd have guessed!

<Content>Loved the Lafayette My sister and I stayed at the Lafayette hotel in May for three days. We received a warm greeting and we were shown to a beautiful room, with french windows as requested. The hotel is in a superb location, a pleasant stroll from The French Quarter and it is right on the streetcar line. Room service was prompt and delicious. Housekeeping was fine, no problems and the front desk staff were warm and welcoming. We loved New Orleans and when we come back for a much longer stay, we will do so at the Lafayette.

<Content>Very nice first impression The Lafayette Hotel is a very nice place to stay. The hotel is beautiful, and the decor reflects the time period from which it was built. The staff is attentive, and tried to meet all requests. They allowed early check in, late check out, extra towels, etc. The only thing I would complain about is the lack of housekeeping. My room was only cleaned once during my stay. Otherwise I would say this hotel left a great first impression of New Orleans. It is in a great location. It is close to the French Quarter and the Garden District without being so close that you are surrounded by drunken tourists. Transportation is easy. Everything is within walking distance and for the less ambitious, taxicabs are readily available. The St. Charles streetcar also stops right in front of the hotel, which is a cheap and unique way to get to and from the French Quarter.

<Content>Had a Beautiful and Romantic Time! We stayed at the Lafayette Hotel for our honeymoon August 14 - 17, 2004. This is an absolutely beautiful hotel and we would recommend it to anyone. We recieved a free upgrade to a suite at check-in, and from reading the reviews this seems pretty standard. The rooms are beautiful and romantic and really provide a nice boutique feel away from the noise of the French Quarter. The Quarter is still within a comfortable walking distance though. We didn't use our car once during the entire trip. Yes there are the phone charges, but it's definitely worth it to be able to make unlimited phone calls all over the country. Especially when your cell phone dies and you forgot to bring a charger. Our one complaint would be the fact that we signed up for the Romantic Rendezvous package and were supposed to recieve a complimentary bottle of champagne. The hotel was out of champagne, but did provide us with some wine, which was okay, but we aren't big wine drinkers. No big deal though. The hotel was still great and we would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Good by old friend, you used to be a great hotel. I was a long time fan of the Lafayette, and stayed there many times, but no longer. I am seeking out other regular New Orleans accomadations. The Lafayette has recently installed the kind of thermostats that will not allow a air conditioning to work unless a person is present in the room. The Hotel's grand old rooms do not cool quickly with the current air condioning system, and A/C in New Orleans is manditory.  This means, in New Orleans in the summer (May - October), you will be returning to a HOT room. If you come back at 5 it will be to a hot room. Even if it is somewhat cooled when you leave for dinner, upon your return , it will be hot again. In three nights recently, it took a minimum of 2 hours for my room to cool enough to sleep, and that was with no cover used, That took another 45 minutes. I discussed this problem daily with the manager and he claimed to have the A/C . contractor look at the problem, but it never improved. After 3 nights of poor sleep in a room much warmer than I am used to sleeping in I had to go to another hotel, forfiting pre-paid nights as a result of booking through Expedia.When winter comes, I will revisit my querky old friend, but unfortunatly, my need for rest has me sleeping around.

<Content>Will Book It Again! Absolutely loved this beautiful hotel. It is a bit of a walk to the French Quarter, but it is a nice stroll if the weather is nice. The hotel itself is outstanding. the service is great, anemities fabulous, and the location is actually not bad. It's quiet at night so you can actually get some sleep as opposed staying in the quarter where noise can keep you up all hours of the night. I definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again.

<Content>Loved the Lafayette! This was our first trip to New Orleans, and I have to say that we were treated like gold at the Lafayette. Kerry was so nice to us! He upgraded us to a suite when we told him we were there for our one year anniversary, gave us directions to various places and even sent up a bottle of wine. The entire staff couldn't be nicer! The room was gorgeous, and the bed, complete with feather pillows, was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in while travelling in my lifetime. It's close enough to the French Quarter to walk, yet far enough away that you can get some sleep without the pulsating beat of music in your ears all night. I have to say that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone! It's romantic, beautiful, and the staff's attention to detail is impeccable.

<Content>Lots of hidden cost!! Stay elsewhere Very Disappoint. Booked a double for a convention and thought I was getting a great rate at $115. I was traveling with two employees so I booked a double room. I received conformation for a double room. This hotel does not have double rooms!! NONE!! Charged 25.00 a night a rollaway bed , 19.95 + taxes for parking. The lot on the next block was charging only 12.95, but I did not see that until we were leavening. Charged a fee for safe and telephone, supposedly for the state my fellow conventioneers did not seem to have this charge at their hotel. Perhaps the hotels built it into the rate, not sure. To make a long story short, cost $215 a night to stay at a mediocre hotel at best. RIP OFF -

<Content>booked, but no room! regina was great Booked through Expedia about a month in advance with The Lafayette Hotel. Arrived to find that the hotel was full and we had no room. I imagine our stay would have been great, if we had stayed there. Regina at the front desk was very sympathetic about the oversight. We were sent to their sister hotel down the road Le Cirque, where the staff was just as nice ... and our first night was free! Le Cirque was very modern, which I like ... but it seemed very much like an old car with new paint on it. It was also farther than I would have liked from the French Quarter.

<Content>first time in NO, wonderful place to stay! This was my first time in New Orleans and this hotel was great. The location was convenient to many restaurants and shopping. The trolley rolls right in front of the hotel and adds to the charm. The rooms are appointed with wonderful furniture and other ammenities which add to your comfort. The staff is very helpful. Kerry Ryals was very helpful at helping me choose restaurants and helping me with the maps. On my next visit I will certainly stay here. The personal service is a must. Thank you, Lafayette, for making my stay memorable.

<Content>A reservation here isn't really a reservation I really wouldn't know what this hotel was like. Despite the fact that I booked a room a month before my trip to New Orleans, and had a confirmation number, the manager of this hotel called less than a week before my arrival to say they wouldn't honor the reservation. She said there was some mixup with their central booking system and so some group of 30 that had paid in advance were going to get the rooms. She offered to transfer our reservation to one of their sister hotels, the St. James, and said that since she had formerly managed there she could vouch for the fact that it was a good hotel. Well, I checked the St. James on TripAdvisor only to discover that of the first nine reviews, four of them gave it only one bullet. Complaints ranged from a wet bed, to a moldy room, to holes and blood on the sheets. I called back and told the manager of the Lafayette that the sister hotel was totally unacceptable, particularly since this trip was a 60th birthday present for my partner. We agreed that I would try to find my own hotel room. As a final note, I would add that since the reservation cancellation was entirely the hotel's fault, it wouldn't have killed the hotel manager to offer a small goodwill gesture like a free drink at their bar while we were in town. A classy place would have at least offered a meal in their retaurant or a credit for a future stay. So the bottom line is, if you book here, don't expect your reservation to be guaranteed, don't expect any goodwill on their part, but do expect to be fobbed off on one of their clearly inferior sister properties.

<Content>best place I've stayed in NO I stayed at the Lafayette for four nights while in town for a conference and recommend it wholeheartedly. I was able to check in early and was upgraded to a suite (beautiful!) with six windows and a tiny balcony overlooking Lafayette Square. There was very little street noise at night -- the hotel's in the business district, so traffic's not bad. There's a good bakery across the street for breakfast and a fine, fine restaurant called Herbsaint half a block away. Finally, I'm a sucker for hotel bathrobes and having the NYTimes delivered to my door. The only remotely negative thing I can say is that the air handling equipment was exceptionally loud one night -- why that should be true one night out of four I don't know. Other than that, it was a lovely experience.

<Content>Been There, Done That, Loved It The Lafayette is a great place to stay. We were surprised to find a suite instead of just a room on check-in. The bathtub was not marble, and some of the furniture and fixtures were a little worn, but so what? Comfy robes, nice big bed, accommodating maid service (we like to sleep in), a bakery right across the street for take-out coffee and pastry, as quiet as it gets - we were very happy. The only quibble is that the night staff is a little spotty. They weren't sure if there was room service (there isn't), and if you leave your key when you go out and need it back quickly when you come in, you're taking your chances. But stay there, have a drink at the sports bar when there's live jazz, go with the flow and laissez les bon temps roulez!

<Content>Stay here! This was a terrific hotel in all respects--great location, fabulous service, and well appointed rooms (we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely, very quiet and spacious). Everything from our arrival to departure went smoothly. I was surprised to see that the AAA rating on this hotel, along with many others in New Orleans, was only 3 stars. I would have rated it higher and I'm very picky about hotel accomodations. I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and stay again when I return to New Orleans.

<Content>A Special Place to Stay We were in New Orleans in March for a conference and had a fabulous stay at the Lafayette. Not only were the rooms spacious, clean and well appointed but the staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. Kerry manned the desk most of the time we were there and offered us valuable tips on things to do and restaurants to visit. He was always accomodating and polite. The hotel is a great location, out of the hustle and bustle of the French Quarter but close enough to walk and right on the trolley route. I have recommended this to many friends and would definitely stay at this hotel the next time we visit New Orleans.

<Content>***** A winner in every way! We can't say enough good things about this hotel. Located about 6 blocks from the French Quarter, its a bit of a walk, but well worth it. The Lafayette has all the charm you'd expect to find in New Orleans, complete with a ghost or two :-). The rooms are clean and well appointed. The water pressure in our room wasn't very strong, but we were on the top floor. It was a small price to pay since the overall was better than we could have hoped. The king size four poster bed and down filled pillows were a slice of heaven after all the walking we did. Kerry and Vicki give new meaning to the words customer service. It's not often you stay in a hotel where the staff cares that your comfortable and enjoying your stay. They truly are wonderful and helped make our trip memorable. We were sorry to leave and will definitely be back!

<Content>Fabulous Time at the Lafayette Had a fabulous time in New Orleans while staying in The Lafayette Hotel. The entire staff could not have been more helpful in trying to make our stay in New Orleans an unforgettable one. The Hotel, built in 1916, has large rooms and suites decorated in charming styles from an earlier period. Recently, a large wooden paneled bar was opened which has high ceilings and an extremely comfotable atmosphere. Located by the Federal Courts in the business district the Hotel is only a short walk to the Frtench Quarter if partying is what you have in mind.

<Content>Wonderful experience! One of my most pleasant hotel experiences. I was actually greeted with a hug! The staff couldn't do enough for us, the rooms were nicely appointed and immaculate and the location was terrific. Very reasonably priced too. Highly recommended

<Content>Best Hotel Experience I did not know what to expect from The Lafayette since I did not book the hotel. However, from the moment we arrived and met with Vicky and Kerry at the front desk, I knew this was going to be special. Kerry, one of the managers, personally took my party to our rooms and made us feel right at home. Our rooms overlooked St. Charles Avenue, the principal parade route during Mardi Gras season, and were beautifully decorated with interesting prints on a freshly painted wall, a four poster bed with four down filled pillow on a king size bed. I had brought my lap top computer and I was able to access the internet through the wireless network in the hotel. My room had 3 French doors, all leading to a balcony, which was great to watch the parade that night. Champagne was on ice in the room, courtesy of the management. This was perhaps the best hotel experience of my 50 years and I have been in hotels all over the world. If you are in New Orleans, there is no other hotel you want to book.

<Content>Loved the Lafayette Stayed at the Layayette during Mardi Gras 2004. It is right on the Parade route just a couple blocks outside of the French Quarter, easily within walking distance and right on Lafayette park.Vicki, the general manager was extremely accomodating, very friendly and perfectly professional. She welcomed us with open arms and personally located us and bid us farewell upon departure. The rest of the staff were equally pleasant. The rooms were large and clean and the restaurant and bar off the lobby was very nice.The rates were very fair and I will stay there again when I return.

<Content>Super Stay Our Lafayette experience was wonderful. Kerry and the entire staff were so helpful and accomodating. Every request was quickly met. Kerry gave us an upgrade to a beautiful and spacious suite since the hotel was not fully occupied. Hopefully we can return next year - we have found our New Orleans home at the Lafayette! We highly recommend it !Thanks, Grady and Francine Elmore

<Content>great time at the Lafayette A great old restored hotel with attentive management. Valet parking $20/day across the street, rather than offsite in a suspect neighborhood as is often the rule in New Orleans. Excellent authentic French pastry shop/cafe across the street. Check in late, maybe they've overbooked and you'll get upgraded free to a suite like we did. Communications fee includes unlimited local and long distance but broadband internet access not included in all rooms, $6 or $7 a day, in-room safe is $3 or $4 per day, they'll sometimes waive these if you wish but discuss it at check-in time. Some of the walls might be a little thin between rooms, but overall we had a really great 3 nights and definitely will stay here again.
