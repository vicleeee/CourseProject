<Content>Excellent service and great value for money We thought this hotel was a cut above what you'd normally get at the price we paid. We stayed for three nights for 125 GBP (180 USD). The (small-ish) rooms were stylishly fitted and came with intelligent air con systems. Reception couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. The location was also pretty good; not quite at the centre of things, but only 15 minutes walk from the French Quarter. Recommended.

<Content>The Worst Honeymoon of My Life First off it was $28.00 for the valet parking and they took $100 out of my checking account which is unavailable to me for 7-10 days instead of taking $28.00. The room was extremely small while the bathroom was large. Almost as large as the small room. Any tv or cable had to be ordered and deducted from your check, At 5 A.M. my new husband and I were jolted out of our sleep by the hotel guest across the hall beating on her door for 5 minutes straight and it sounded as though she were directly in our room. The walls must be paper thin. Then at 7 am I am jolted out of sleep again by the emergency alarm but we all thought it was a false alarm. It took 10 minutes for the hotel to announce that there was a real emergency and we all needed to evacuate. There really was a fire on my floor and no one made sure we were out of our hotel room or showed where to go to exit. I think this was the worst experience that I have had and to have paid over $100 for the room this experience was extremely ridiculous. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone so don't let the pretty lights fool you. This hotel is not worth the expense. Plus you would be better off staying in one of the hotels closer to Canal St. instead of having to walk all that way and being bothered for your change or if you have any cigarettes the local homeless could have.

<Content>A really unique and great hotel! My mom, daughter, and I traveled by train to Atlanta, and had layovers in New Orleans on 2 separate nights; we stayed at Le Cirque both nights. We originally chose it due to its proximity to the Amtrak station (less than 1/2 a mile) and the reasonable rate. It turned out to be even better than we expected: we loved the modern decor and the staff was extremely helpful and courteous. The staff was able to assist us in finding a restaurant that delivered to our hotel when we came in late the first night, and to find a great breakfast location within walking distance the morning of our second stay. We would definitely stay at Le Cirque again when in New Orleans.

<Content>Hotel LeSuck First off, parking was a fiasco. The lot in the back was really shady so we had no other choice but to valet which was $25/night not including tip. The website and the girl at the counter (as well as the valet guy) will tell you that there is a rehabilitation pool and sauna- completely not true. We walked 6 blocks and across a highway to get to the tiny gym just to find out that they don't have a pool or a sauna- the man who worked there states, your hotel should have known that.After complaining, they called the Holiday Inn Express so we could use theirs and gave them a heads up upon our arrival- well when we got there, the pool was under maintenance. Not happy. The water pressure for the toilet was 50x stronger than the pressure of the shower. The walls are also paper thin. We had a wall pounding fest with the drunken neighbors next door at around 3:30am. Other than that, the place looks nice on the outside and the AC works wonders.

<Content>Hotel Le JERK! Don't let the pretty lights lure you in... You have to double park and risk getting a ticket upon checking in. Then you struggle to find their alloted parking area if you choose to save some money. We stayed in room 208 and upon opening the door to our room we were greeted with a room that would resemble that of an interrogation room. Once the door was opened you had a direct view of the bed, no hallway. The room was painted a muddy brown which gave the room the appearance of a dungeon. Going on the opposite side of the door was a seating area and after opening the curtain we had the dismal view of a brick wall. So close that if you could open the window you could literally stick your arm outside and touch the other building. The bathroom door was covered in a frosted glass, meaning when you turned the light on in the middle of the night it shown through and annoyed your traveling companion who was trying to sleep. The bathroom sink was a faux marble, but when you sat on the toilet you could see under it was dirty two by four pieces of wood holding it up and a piece of pipe to prop up the wood from the floor. The toilet and sink had better water pressure than the shower, although when you flushed the toilet it sounded as if a woman was screaming. You could hear the other surrounding guests using the restroom as well as showering, flushing their toilets and moving about their rooms. There were hidden charges, rude hotel staff of which when expressing my upset (which was not done loudly or disorderly) was told by a staff member Oh Well!. I will never ever stay there again, will tell everyone I know and ask them to share my horror story about this what should be in the next feature film by Stephen King. There are more things to say, as well as I took pictures. I have sent them to friends to back up the hysteria brought on by an overrated, over priced misleading Hotel Le Crap!

<Content>Le Cirque is good but not great. The Good: I liked the hotel overall. The staff was overly accomodating and the light display on the front of the hotel is nearly awe inspiring. If you see the pic on the front page of this review of the hotel - that's exactly what it looks like. The lights change also - and honestly, it's very cool to watch as you drift off to sleep. Plus - there's a nice pastry selection in the morning/early afternoon. And - if you need something you don't have - there is a convienent store just outside the property. The parking is valet and only $25 per day with unlimited use. Incase you're wondering - a lot of garages will charge you that just to park. Plus - the trolley line runs right by the hotel. Very handy.The Bad: the room was small. The wallpaper was peeling off the wall in several spots and the room was a little dirty. We changed our hotel to this one because we found Le Cirque for the same price as another one - the other was a 2 star and (I won't name it) but all of the reviews were 'little more than a bed and a roof' etc on the other place... Priceline had this (Le Cirque) listed as a 3 star. Yeah - not so much. Close. If you go by the hotel, the outside, the lobby and the staff - 4 star. The rooms however were one and half star. There was little room for more than the two beds and TV. It was cramped and the closet was smaller than any closet I'd ever seen. We did have an in room iron and ironing board and hair dryer but neither the hairdryer nor the iron worked. If pressed, I'd stay again - it wasn't a bad experience by any means and the staff goes way above and beyond and the light display itself is worth staying for - but don't go expecting a 4 or 5 star expereince.

<Content>Artsy European Feel This is a very interesting hotel. It has a distincly European feel about it. All of the decor and art are contemporary. It almost has a cold feel to the lobby as you enter with Scandinavian styling to the furniture. Check in and check out went smoothly. The location is great for New Orleans being at Lee Circle which is just off of downtown and the French Quarter. Parking is somewhat of an issue in that it's almost required to valet park your vehicle for $25. You can self park, but you don't get the security or insurance features that Valet parking receives. My experience is that both are a good idea in New Orleans. The valet attendants were promt and courteous and eager to help out with directions and info. There are several good restaurants within walking distance, but when in New Orleans - never go alone. Nothing about this hotel is traditional. The art work, furniture, showers, even the carpeting are unusual. The rooms are a bit small, but very clean , comfortable and tastefully decorated. The shower, again something different, is only a shower with no tub with a very unique design. You have to see it to appreciate it. The only complaint that I have is that the caulking around the base of the shower was poorly applied. It wasn't a problem, but just a bit unsightly for a hotel that seemed to be up on their maintenance. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel and use it again when I'm in New Orleans

<Content>You don't get what you pay for. Was not pleased with my stay at Hotel Le Cirque. My room was extremely small with just enough space for a bed, table and tv. The room was very cramped for two persons and I haven't seen a hotel room this small since I was in Canada. The bathroom was quite large, almost as large as the room, but it only held a shower, toilet and small sink. Lots of unused space in the bathroom. There were no basic perks-no microwave, no minifridge. Only two towels in the bathroom, four would have been nice. Hidden (mandatory) charges were not mentioned on Hotwire. I had to pay $2.95 for a safe that I didn't use and $4.00 for local calls that I didn't make. I was told I could not refuse these charges even though I didn't know about them when I booked. Also, valet parking was posted at $24 but I was charged $28. When I asked why the sign said $24 I was told that it hadn't been changed yet to reflect the new price. Also with the valet, was told to call 15 minutes ahead of when I needed my car. When I went downstairs after 30 minutes, my car still hadn't been brought around. Later that night when I returned my car to the hotel, I was told the valet was at their other property and would be by later to park my car. I left my car in their loading zone. The next morning at checkout my car was still in the loading zone where I left it, the valet had never moved it to their secure lot. I requested a 7:45 wakeup call that never happened. The phone never rang and had I not set my alarm on my cell phone I could have overslept and missed my flight. The downstairs front desk said that they didn't know why the phone didn't ring with my wakeup call, that perhaps the volume was turned down on my phone. It wasn't, that was the first thing I checked. Their response was that they didn't know what happened to my wakeup call. Overall the hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. I just didn't like the hidden charges, the valet service, and the size of my room. I would not stay here again and would not recommend it to friends. Hotwire should mention the potential for mandatory charges in addition to what I had already paid.

<Content>One of the best hotels in New Orleans! I was very excited for the rate that we had received, $60 per night, especially since I booked last minute. The hotel was in a great location, only a 15 minute walk from the French Quarter, the decor was very sleek and modern, and the staff were extremely friendly! Their beds knocked me out in 2 minutes! This was my third time coming to New Orleans and I really wish I would have discovered this hotel earlier. Third time's a charm I guess!

<Content>Nice Little Gem of a Hotel!!! We stayed here for one night during Mardi Gras 2008. The hotel staff were very nice, had a few problems with billing but they took care of it in a quick and friendly fashion. The staff was very helpful, especially Michael (one of the bellboys). Suggested places to see, eat, etc. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. We only needed a room for one night pre-cruise and most of the other hotels had a 2 night minimum during Mardi Gras, so that was a bonus. It is right on the parade route, so we just walked right outside the hotel to watch the parade, it is on the corner of St. Charles Ave on Lee Circle. Has a bar/restaraunt but we didn't eat there. We had a group of 6 and were treated very nicely. Would stay here again!

<Content>Great staff, quirky hotel Choosing a hotel in New Orleans is never easy -- prices fluctuate wildly depending on what events are going on. We settled on Le Cirque when a large convention and the BCS championships put hotel rooms at a premium in the city. I can't say enough about how nice the staff at this hotel is. They are extremely pleasant and will do whatever they can to help. That said, NEVER book without knowing what room you are going to get! Our first room was the size of a walk-in closet. The next one we were offered had one tiny window covered by a locked, pull down steel shutter. It made you feel like making a parole application. Finally, the staff came up with a very nice room but the entire process took hours. The hotel is not in the best repair -- internet access was balky, the room safe was broken. In sum, I would say it's okay to stay there, but be aware of the problems and make sure you feel compensated for them by a moderately priced room.

<Content>Advice When Booking A Room We were cautiously optimistic after reading mixed reviews. While the staff was courteous and friendly--the Valet staff win the award. They were prompt, helpful, and quite pleasant. Post-Katrina does not have the hotel with a driver or free continental breakfast (PJ's Coffee is 1/2 block away though). We checked into the hotel during a very busy weekend (BCS Championship Game). The hotel was sold out. We did not consider our room rate a great deal even though we booked 2 months in advance of the BCS Game ($219 per nite). Add-Ons includedthe $26/day valet parking charge, taxes, etc. For that money, we expected more. The hotel room was tired, run down, and not so clean. Our first room was a Smoking room after we had requested a NON smoking room. The room was not overly clean and had toothpaste stains all over the counters and faucet. We were moved to a nonsmoking room where we immediately called maintenance to fix the leaking toilet and the broken safe. The Manager did send a complimentary bottle of wine for the room mix up. Be Aware: the Queen rooms do not have Queen beds...they have a Full bed. The room size was adequate. All the hotel pictures show a pretty 10 story building. They do not show the smaller 3 story attached building in the back---that you enter by going outside in a breezeway. Both rooms we were assigned were in the smaller building. You could tell some items were updated in each room, but the walls showed their wear and tear as this is a very good location and sees alot of traffic. Again, bathroom stains, dirty curtains, etc. We think the main hotel has all rooms renovated because ours certainly was not that updated and others seem to have been; peeling wallpaper in the bathroom, no door on the closet, broken blackout shade. Not a bargain for the money but adequate for a short stay. Walk to the Quarter and SuperDome was easy; you are right on the Streetcar line, too.

<Content>Nice, Comfortable Little Hotel My wife and I spent three nights at this hotel for the Sugar Bowl. Our room was small, but comfortable. The hotel is very trendy looking, with a lot of contemporary furnishings. The area was very quiet and we were able to get a good night's rest. The staff, top to bottom, were very friendly and accomodating.

<Content>Highly Recommend This Hotel It's incredibly important to support this precious city, so recently close to devastation. Prior to Katrina, I had been to New Orleans 5 times over the years to visit a dear friend, so had never stayed in a hotel. My friend was displaced by the hurricane, and has not been able to return. So I went to see for myself how the Crescent City is faring.Having come in by Amtrak, I chose Hotel Le Cirque because it was close enough to walk to from the train station. I'm thrilled that criteria took me to this lovely hotel. Having no transportation, it was the perfect location to catch the streetcar or bus to anywhere I wanted to go, or walk to the art district, which it abuts. The room was nicely appointed and had a great view of Lee Circle and the larger city. But the best part of my stay was the staff. They were extremely helpful, quickly responsive and knowledgeable about their city. I think that holds far more importance than missing soap dishes or paid continental breakfast service. Ultimately, this city that is culturally critical to our nation needs to be supported and born witness to by our visiting and spending money. It has always been largely supported by the tourist trade, and now, more than ever, it's time to visit New Orleans. And if you need a place to stay, Hotel Le Cirque has my vote!

<Content>Nice Hotel The staff here was supremely friendly and helpful. Or room was very clean, and the hotel itself was in nice condition. It looks like they are in the process of remodeling the upper floors. We were on the third floor, and our room was spacious and just fine, except it was missing a soap dish in the shower. I would probably stay closer to the French Quarter next time we visit New Orleans, but on this, out first trip to the city, we left several times to visit other areas, and since this hotel was right by the interstate, it was a good location for us. It was also a great value. The parking was directly behind the hotel, and we never had a problem with finding a space and we were there over Labor Day weekend. A nice hotel and a great value.

<Content>comfortable and friendly The staff was very friendly when I was checking in and out and I'm not sure about a previous review which states they charge $5 to use the telephone because as I was checking in I was informed that all local AND long distance calls were free, including service numbers such as information (1411) - no 900 #s though (maybe that's how he got charged ;)).The beds were more comfortable than my bed at home, and that's really saying something since I'm very particular about what I sleep on full-time. And the A/C/heating was easily adjustable.Not to mention, it's a great location if you know your way around New Orleans (or, at least if you have a map). Le Cirque is located directly between the French Quarter and the historic Uptown district. It is very quite and on the streetcar line which takes you up St. Charles and back to Canal St.

<Content>Tucked away but well worth it. I was worried at first, but it all turned out well. I was delayed with business so I was not able to check in before 5p.m. When I tried ringing the hotel the number did not work and after about 40 minutes of trying to find an alternate number I left my meeting and searched out the hotel. It was open and it looked as inviting as it is portrayed. The gentleman could not find my reservation (I believe it was a glitch with the Government Travel Program we have to use) but they fixed everything and even put me in the front of the hotel as I had asked. They where able to give me some information on a few spots I wanted to go check out.  The room was clean and in excellent condition. I liked having a large bathroom with plenty of space to move around and a large shower instead of having a tub to step over. There was a complimentary coffee pot and supplies but I didn鈥檛 use them since I don鈥檛 drink the stuff. The only thing I wish the room had was a mini-fridge. There was a vending machine not to far from my room but the selection was scarce and the one thing I did purchase was old. It only cost me a buck so it wasn鈥檛 a great loss when I threw it away. Check out was easy. I was surprised to find that I was going to be charged for a room safe ($2.95), and communication access ($ 4.95) when I was told that the hotel had free wireless service. I did use the wireless service and it was excellent, always had a strong signal and was able to leave my laptop connect throughout my stay. I have noticed that others have mentioned the parking situation and yes the hotel does not own a parking structure but then a lot of hotels in the city don鈥檛. The $20 fee was kind of high but I didn鈥檛 mind paying it since I was allowed to come and go, as I wanted. The parking area had good lightening and was monitored by security cameras so I felt safe even when I left at 2 a.m. for a quick run up to the local CVS. The other thing is that they had no problem price matching my room fee. The government rate was $148, but when I told them I had found it on here for a cheaper rate they adjusted it with no questions asked.The Le Cirque is a charming hotel in a great location in the Arts District. I wound up walking from the hotel all over the Quarter and back with no problems. I plan on returning again soon, this time for leisure instead of business and will stay once again at this great little place.

<Content>Friendly staff My husband and I stayed at Hotel Le Cirque last weekend, if you like trendy style, you love this place. The lobby is beautiful, the bar was fun and we enjoyed the Spa services. Everything is new and fresh. Jennifer at the Front Desk was very attentive to our needs. Those old reviews don't give this place the credit it deserves. I highly recommend it and will be back for Jazz Fest.

<Content>Don't be scared by the older reviews We enjoyed our stay at the hotel Le Cirque. The older reviews scared us a little bit. Nice lobby, boutique hotel. Not in the French quarter but close enough for us. Our room was small, but the ceiling was high. Great Climate control, great shower, good bed, renovated room, and we got a great rate. Thats all we were looking for. There is a safe fee and a internet fee (they waived the internet fee, we didnt have a computer) $20 dollars a day to park, that was a bummer.I would recommend it to people.

<Author>PlanningContractor
<Content>Hated it Chose hotel for rate. All other hotels higher due to college football game in town.Restaurant closed for Thanksgiving weekend. No warning of this on website. Desk staff only able to give vague information on other restaurants in area.Website claims to have valet parking. Parking lot is NOT valet parking, just an open lot claiming to have video surveillance. Instructions to locate the lot poorly written. Paying for parking (which was more expensive than given on my reservation confirmation) was through an automated system that wouldn't accept bills (although it has a slot for them) and has poorly organized buttons and instructions. Once you give it your credit card you are locked in to paying; there is no method for clearing entries or backing up. I got charged for 2 night instead of one. Hotel staff says the website is incorrect due to Hurricane Katrina. Katrina might explain some building degradation and repairs, but not delays in updating web information. The staff also says the parking lot is not under their control, but is contracted out, so no satisfaction on overcharges available through the hotel.Recommendation; come to New Orleans for the sites, go out of town for a place to stay.

<Content>Not what it looked like from their website... I was excited to stay at this hotel as I was going with a large group for a family reunion (we all split up and stayed at different hotels in New Orleans) and I scored the lowest per night cost for a hotel. And from the website, it seemed very modern, clean, and had amenities that I was looking for (a restaurant in the lobby and an exercise room and pool).WELL... After staying there I understood why out of my group, I paid the lowest amount. When we got there we discovered that the restaurant is just the lobby, where at night they turn the lights down and play music and serve drinks (we never bothered to stop there... and no one seemed to ever be there). Also, when I asked the person at the front desk where the pool was (like they talked about on the website), they said well... it's not here, actually... it's a few blocks down the street... our guests are allowed to use an athletic club near here. I was shocked! Why not just say that on the website, instead of lying and saying you have a pool and exercise room?! So I was very disappointed in being lied to.Also, the clean, modern look of the lobby faded as soon as you when up the elevator to your find your room. The hotel is 2 buildings that are connected by some weird outdoor breezeway, and the hallways were poorly lit and seemed like they were in dire need of new carpeting and a paint job. When we got to our room, I felt like crying to discover our room's bathroom was painted BLACK. What a horrible color to paint a small room! I felt like I was in a hole, when I was in there. I definitely felt like I had been duped to see our room after looking at the hotel from the website. It seemed like it was a completely different hotel, with the exception for the lobby.BUT, it was quiet (which is good for New Orleans, as I had been told unless I didn't want to sleep, not to stay in the French Quarter), our room was clean, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. So it wasn't a complete disaster. I also didn't like how far away the hotel was from everything, and it was very creepy to walk back late at night down through the streets to our hotel (but we just walked very very fast). I definitely agree with another reviewer... if you were a woman staying alone, don't stay here, because the location does not seem safe to walk to at night (or just always take a cab).I liked that I paid less than everyone else in my group for the hotel, but I certainly didn't like being lied to from the website. I felt at the end of my stay I would've rather stayed at another hotel for an extra $20-40 a night.

<Content>Cockroach problem I called the hotel directly to book this stay and reserved a room with two double beds. We were flying in from San Diego for our daughter's college graduation and I wanted to make sure they were up and running post hurricane Katrina. I knew our flight was going to be arriving late and was told there would be no problem holding our room because they had our credit card.When we got up to our room, we had been given one double bed and one futon. I immediately called the front desk and they were able to find us another room that had 2 king size beds. That was much better and there was no additional charge.However, the first night, we notice a few cockroaches. We figured ok, this is Louisiana (although we had stayed at other NOLA establishments and had never seen any roaches) and the city is stll rebuilding. So we were willing to cut them a little slack.We contiuned to see them and called the front desk. An exterminator was immediately sent up and he sprayed but that didn't seem to take care of the problem because we continued to see them throughout our entire stay. On the dresser drawers the tv was on, running across the floor, in the bathroom on the vanity and crawling on the wall around the mirror. Even on the closet floor where I had seen the exterminator spray.They adjusted our bill and were apologetic. There were two other rooms with our party and thankfully they saw no roaches in their rooms at all.The hotel is going through some renovations and the carpets in the hallways are worn and dirty looking. The lobby was very nicely laid out with the setup for a restaurant/bar, although we were coming and going at all hours of the day and night and it was never open.I am a woman and if I was traveling alone, I wouldn't feel comfortable in that area alone at night. There is limited parking in front of the hotel, but if you want to park in the hotel lot, it'll cost you $19.00 an night and again, the lot is around the block in the dark with a small breezeway leading from the hotel to the lot.Our room was a good size room and even with the two king sized beds, we had plenty of room. Nice wood floors. The fixtures were missing there sconces. The bathroom door is interesting. It was a wooden frame with glass panes all the way down. Very annoying when you're trying to sleep and someone needs to use the restroom. The opaque panes let all the light come through into the bedroom, waking you up. The one window in our room had a shade over it, but it was a thin one. For this being New Orleans and party city, you'd think the management would've put a heavy shade up so that the rising sun doesn't wake you up and the crack of dawn.The only way I would stay here again is if I absolutely had to go to New Orleans and there was absolutely no other place to stay.

<Content>A Decent Hotel with Helpful Staff Given the situation of the city (damage from Katrina), this hotel experience wasn鈥檛 that bad, overall. The rooms were okay and the staff was very helpful and friendly. The hotel was within walking distance from the New Orleans Arena (and Superdome), which is where the Tulane graduation ceremony was held (the reason for my visit). It鈥檚 also very close to the museum district and equidistant from Magazine street (cute boutiques) and the French Quarter. The lobby was quirky and nice to hang but the bar was unfortunately not ready for business. Their interpretation of the W, boutique hotel thing was average; not memorable, but not horrible.There were drawbacks, though. The two elevators for the entire hotel was slow. The rooms had wall d茅cor that was breaking off which gave it a shabby look. The room didn't have a mini-fridge. The tiny bathroom were a major drawback for me. The facets were coming loose, the shower was disgusting and shallow (therefore I showered in a pool of water), and the bathroom door was sort of transparent so people in the room could see your silhouette. As for parking, there was no lot that connected to the hotel. You had to park in a lot on the other side of the block and then walk around to get to the hotel (which felt a little unsafe because the streets felt abandoned. And I live in Brooklyn, NY. A safer part of Brooklyn, yes. But I do quite a bit of walking pretty late at night and still got an eerie vibe from the New Orleans streets in this area, a given to a certain degree with the current situation of things). I think the city is very charming, even with the extreme condition it鈥檚 slowly pulling itself out of. I would come back to the city but stay at a different hotel. I'm not supremely high-maintenance, but I did expect more from a hotel than Hotel Le Cirque. Unless this hotel offered a really good deal, I would not stay here again.

<Content>Wonderful hotel We stayed at this hotel for a week in the December of 2005, and I could not fault it. I was shocked to hear how awful it had gotten since my visit! The staff were wonderfull, and the manager even got us some candles we liked from the local store! The breakfast was basic but still ok. I am devastates about the hurricane, and wish every day that it could all be fixed - i had the time of my life in New Orleans.GOD BLESS YOU ALLXXX

<Content>Worst Hotel Experience Ever I am a native of new orleans and lost everything in the hurricane. I decided to return for a christmas party with a friend. Not having a place to stay, I payed 200 dollars for a night at LeCirque hotel. It was 40 degrees outside last night and at least that cold in my room. The bed had only a sheet, no blankets. Plus, the room had NO HEAT. I wore my blazer and overcoat all night and was unable to sleep. The worst part was when i spoke to the front desk about this, their only response was that this was a disaster area. I am also a victim of Katrina, but I would have rather slept on a street bench last night and saved 200 dollars. I probably would have been warmer too. I am a student and this is a lot of money for me. I think for this hotel to advertise or be open is dishonest and unloyal to the city of New Orleans. I feel that if a hotel cannot provide the bare essentials, such as heat in the middle of winter, it should not be open for business. Plus, this hotel charged me 200 dollars and did not budge on its price. I am a student and payed a lot of money for the worst hotel experience in my life. This place should not be open for business until it can provide basic services worthy of its 200 dollar pricetag.

<Content>Supportive Familiy-like Staff My friends and I were some of the many evacuees who waited until the last minute to get out of town before hurricane Katrina. During such a scarey time, the hotel staff became like family in that they did EVERYTHING in their power to make our stay there as comfortable as possible....not easy with the limited resources that were available after the storm hit. Our safety was their highest priority, however they did their best to keep everyone as comfortable as possible during those very unforgetable days. I do plan to stay at the Hotel Le Cirque again...if only just to thank the staff for being there for us.

<Content>Worst Hotel Stay this year $67.70 in extra charges.Two nights at $88 equals $176, not $243.70. I expected some hidden charges, but not close to $70. (and no, we didn't request anything extra)Rooms were not very hot: no fridge, no microwave, no balcony, no parking, no pool, no best restaurant that the website bragged on. We couldn't even use the Door le Cirque because the building was under construction which we were not warned about. (the lady at the desk said it would be for a while )I have stayed in two much cheaper hotels this year, and I was fully expecting the Hotel Le Cirque to be a step up. I was not expecting such a long step down.The other two hotels included all items listed above except for the restaurant - but then they didn't brag about having one either.The only positive note was that it is walking distance to the French Quarter, and the people next door are very nice.

<Content>Great vacation I just came from the Essence Festival at New Orleans, La and I had a great time. The hotel is very comfortable, in particular the beds and pillows, they are great!!! The staff treats you like friends, I remember the manager Magda, who was very helpful, she even guided us where to go.I really recommend the hotel, I'm looking forward to go back again.

<Content>Not Good No bar or restaurant as advertise at booking(the owner filed for bankruptcy according to the front desk clerk). There is a $2.95 per night safe fee and a $4.95 per night communication fee even if you don't use these services. The wall paper in the hall way was torn. The maid didn't change the sheets (we saw the same pizza stains from the night before). The hotel is close to the french quarter and the superdome.

<Content>perfect no-nonsenses hotel 13th June till 15th June I have been staying in this hotel. Easy to find and perfectly located nearby the French Quarter. The price is also very good. I made my reservation through their own website. Smooth booking! At entering the hotel you can see that they did a major haul over on the whole hotel. They are still applying for licence to open an hotel bar. Check in was friendly and fast, but be aware siginging off any extra charges upfront (for instance a charge for using Internet, no sense if you are not bringing any laptop computer). Room was clean. The bed was excellent. Continental breakfast was nothing special at all. The check out was also going quick. The only thing I discoverd when I was comming back in Europe was that they billed me twice for my stay. So I had to make a phone call to correct this double charge. But in general I will recommend this hotel for everybody who is planning to stay in New Orleans.

<Content>Great business trip Last week, I stayed in the Hotel Le Cirque in New Orleans because I had an event over there. It surprised me with the great service and kindness of the staff. There is one guy who helped us, Mike, he is very nice. They tell you how to get to places, and also the hotel is so clean, which is what I look for in a hotel. I definetely recommend it.

<Content>Perfectlly acceptable I stayed here for a conference in mid-May. I booked through one of the online hotel websites because of price after looking at their website.I was a little concerned about my choice after reading some of the reviews here. I had no real problems with the place, but since as I traveler a hotel to me is just someplace to sleep and shower. As long as it's clean, I'm okay. I don't need all the amenities. If that's what you are looking for, stay somewhere else. For what you pay, this place was really not bad at all.I stayed in a single room. It was small, but more than adequate. It was clean and I had no problems with the room. I was happy to have access to wifi in the room. Since I read about the charges here I wasn't taken by surprise. Normally I end up at an internet cafe to check e-mail, I liked being able to use my laptop in my room. I had no problems with access on the 6th floor. Another review said it only worked in the lobby area.The location was the only issue for me. Didn't see much to chose in the way of restaurtants etc. nearby. Most of my time was spent in the French Quarter which is walkable and a cheap cab ride away. It's also convient to the streetcars.I go to New Orleans every year and I'd stay here again.

<Content>Your staff deserves some applause I just want to let you know how great and pleasant my stay was at your wonderful hotel. I do travel often, and it is always nice to have staff make you feel at home. There was one gentleman in particular who made every attempt to accomodate my needs, his name is Ben (unfortunately I do not know his last name). Please pat yourself in the back, as you have trained your staff well.Sincerely,Stefanie Lambert

<Content>Great Service!!!! I went to the JazzFest in New Orleans last week, I had a wonderful time. The staff from the hotel is excellent. The rooms are nice, just the paperwall needs renovation but it's not a big deal, in fact the frontdesk told me they will do it on the fall. What I loved was that if you need something they really help you. It is a very neat hotel. I will recommend it.

<Content>great staff makes up for the rooms.. after reading the other reviews on tripadvisor i was a little iffy on staying here but i'll tell you, the staff makes up for what the hotel lacks. i do admit the rooms need a little bit of work but when i talked to them about it the front desk agent Kris told me that they were under renovations at the moment and even brought me to one of the new rooms. from what i seen its going to be really nice and i cant wait to stay there again. the front desk was so helpful on EVERYTHING i needed and was the best. dont give up on this hotel just yet because they are fixing the rooms.... loved it...

<Content>Would Stay Again Just got back from a 3 night stay at the Le Cirque. I was there on business and had booked the room online at a good rate. I was nervous after reading some of the reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were clean, bath rooms had marble and the maid added creative touches with the towels each day. The view wasn't bad, our room looked out over Lee Circle. The room was very comfortable and a nice size - I wouldn't call it plush, but nice. King bed, desk and chair, floor lamp and arm chair, wet bar/stand, TV console. Our room looked like the website. Although, I will admit some of the carpet in the hallway is beginning to show wear. The breakfast consisted of assorted cereals, muffins, danish, yogurt, fresh fruit, milk, juice, and coffee. It wasn't a hot breakfast, but it was more than enough for me. And the staff was very helpful - they called after check-in to see if the room was fine and to check and see if we needed anything. They were always very helpful - with transportion and etc. I needed to mail some heavy materials, so they found a large box and tape and were eager to assist me. The location is in a safe area for walking at night and has easy access to the $1.25 street car. I would stay again.

<Content>watch out This hotel was a rip off. The rooms are very small. They charge you 18.95 plus tax per day to park your car in some parking lot. They say they served breakfast, but for the last hour it was supposedly offered you couldn't get anything to eat, it was all gone. You also get charged $3 for a safe you don't use and $5 for a phone you don't use. Just be aware. Its not worth it.

<Content>False advertisment This hotel is really a joke. I strongly would advise anyone to rethink their stay at this hotel. I would have rather paid more somewhere else than stay here ever again. The parking that they say they have for five dollars, be expected to pay 18.95+tax a day. Our parking cost a hundred dollars for the five days we stayed there. Also, there were four of us and for the first two nights two of us slept on a twin size rollaway bed. Also, they told me that I should never book a room through the internet because you don't get what you asked for. When I told travelworm this they said they were supposed to accomodate whatever you put down. So, if you book with this hotel you more than likely want get what you asked for. They said in order to get what you want you need to book with us personally, which means you need to pay more. We left a day early.

<Content>Don't do it i booked this room over the internet. As this hotel is a relatively new hotel, i thought it would be a great experience. It was terrible. The hotel lobby and rooms were in a state of great neglect: walls were damaged, including chipped paint, some signage had been stripped off the walls and not replaced; furniture in the hall was severly damaged; carpet in the halls and rooms had large stains; mold was in the rooms; hair was everywhere, bed, furniture, and the bathroom. After i complained to management about the first room, they gave me another one which was slightly better. However, the condition of the carpet in the hall and room was not worth the move. This place is a little better than a hostel. Definitely it is not worth the money i paid or you will pay if you disregard this review.

<Content>Nice location, hotel conditions questionable This hotel calls itself a fine hotel. It's a small hotel located near some nice museums, but a distance from Bourbon Street although it is on a streetcar line. This hotel is a refurbished YMCA--and it shows in the tiny rooms with showers only. There were a lot of ants on one wall of our room, a substance that looked like blood on the carpet, and a cockroach on the sofa in the lobby. The continental breakfast was minimal. The staff were friendly but I had issues: one was that I had to go to Kinko's to print my boarding pass because the manager was the only one with access to the room with the computer after midnight. Also, my credit card was charged FOUR times for my stay. I'm still trying to get this issue resolved.

<Content>Hotel Website Misleading... I went to NO for a conference. After it ended, my friend and I decided to switch hotels. Reading about all the area hotels I decided that hotel Le cirque would be a nice trendy location with quality that was equal to where we had been staying (A W hotel). Unfortunately I did not check the reviews of prior guests. The lobby was beautiful and trendy, it got us excited about staying at Le Cirque. Once we got off the elevator it was a different story. This hotel is deeply in need of some TLC, the carpets are wornout and stained. Our doors in our room were gouged and one night someone walked into our locked room as we prepared for bed. The hotel charges $3/night for the safe (3 deep and 12 tall) and $5/ night for wireless internet and free unlimited local and long distance calls. Unfortunately, the only place the wireless internet connection appeared to work was in the lobby. There are some misleading amenities shown on the hotel website, but in short: Within the hotel there is no paper delivery, no complimentary car/shuttle, no restaurant, no bar, no gym, no pool, no basketball court, no robes, no limo or driver. It appears that some of these things did once exist, but I was told by the staff that some are gone and some of them are only offered during peak times of the year.

<Content>Not unbearable, but a lot to be desired This hotel is below normal standards. The carpets are dirty. The furniture is worn out. The continental breakfast barely deserves to be called a meal. Smoking is rampant. We had a room with a view into the gaping window of a vacant building across the parking lot. The service was friendly. It is well located between the French Quarter and the Garden District with easy access to the streetcar. I would not give this hotel a three star rating.

<Content>Beware!! We stayed at Le Cirque for Mardi Gras 2005. Before arriving at Le Cirque, we were looking forward to the hotel because of the rave reviews on their website. However, we were thoroughly disappointed with the stay. The closest ice machine was broken during our entire 4 night stay, room attendants would knock on doors to clean the room before the official check-out time, smoking in the hallways of non-smoking floors occurred, the 1 bedroom set-ups are small with alot of wasted room in the bathroom, the 2 bedroom set-up has no bath tub and the shower curtain is too short on the bottom (water leaks everywhere), ect. These were some of the smaller problems encountered. The one large problem involved my girlfriends purse, which we had to check-in to the front desk because of our broken in-room safe. Somehow the purse was lost or stolen in the 24 hours the the front desk held the purse for us. Cash, credit cards, ect. were all gone. While management moved us to a parade view room immediately (as had been requested when the original reservation was made in Sep 04), management did not know what happened to the purse, and promised reimbursement within a few days. It is now 4 weeks later and reimbursement still has not occured. In those 4 weeks, managment has been difficult to reach, and claims that their hands are tied by the investigation. A refund of approx 10% of the room cost has been made, however the carelessness of managment in handling an item such as a purse, the lack (and slow pace) of reimbursement for the contents in the purse, and the smaller problems suggests that staying at Le Cirque is quit a circus in itself - Good Luck!

<Content>It was fine! Before going to the hotel, I was a bit worried because of all the bad reviews but when we stayed it all seemed fine. So maybe the hotel website makes you expect a little more than what is offered but once being there it doesnt make me not want to come back. The staff are very nice and helpful. For the price it was great. And when it comes to being far from everywhere--maybe, if your not willing to walk a few blocks. I did it 2 nights in a row, in heals and it was fine. So if your expecting the Omni, this isnt it, but if you want a nice hotel at a good price stay here.

<Content>Stay closer to the French Quarter The front desk staff in very helpfull but the rooms need some tender loving care. They look uncare for and are small in size, like someone else had said the wallpaper is pealing in different places, but afer all they are clean and the bathrooms have a good size. The drawback for the hotel is the location, you are in the middle of nowhere, the hotel does not have room service or a restaraunt and there is not a place in sight to have breakfast or dinner. We always had to take a taxi to anyplace we went. If I have to come back to New Orleans I would stay closer to the French Quarter.

<Content>Excellent Staff I had the opportunity to visit New Orleans for the first time in the middle of January for a Leadership Convention. The accomadations were made through one of my co-workers assistants. We had scheduled 10 rooms to be occupied for the entire week. Unfortunately, due to the renovation of the hotel some of my co-worker decided to move hotels. Stacey was Amazing with her warm smile and wonderful hospitality. She did everything in her power to make the stay for the remainder of us excellent. She was extremely professional. THe Staff of Le Cirque also needs to be complimented for their friendliness and helpfulness. The front desk staff was fantastic with directions, food accomidations and special requests. I truly believe that people are what create our memories and Stacey and her staff gave us a wonderful view and opinion of New Orleans. Thanks.

<Content>Do Not Valet your vehicle The location is in a nice area and the accomodations are average. However, please BEWARE that your vehicle will be taken to an uncovered parking lot (contracted out by U-Park) which is located behind the hotel and is not monitored or fenced in at this time. My brand new vehicle was checked in at 5:00 pm and was not checked out by our party until 12:00 PM the next afternoon. It was returned to me in unacceptable condition. This vehicle was filthy from someone taking it out for a joy ride (around 50 miles). The radio station was changed, the heater was tampered with, boot  shoe prints were all over the floor and finally evidence of fireworks in the trunk (New Year's Eve). The hotel was very nice by crediting the room for parking, but since it is a seperate contract company nothing further can be done through the hotel. The police will issue a report if I drive 80 miles back to the police station, but do not fingerprint in situations like this. If this happened to me, it could happen to someone else.

<Content>Be aware of hidden fees! I booked the hotel online at a seemed reasonable price; the final payment include taxes and fees except for incidental. I travel a lot in Texas and frequently reserve hotel online, I never pay the hotel seperately any extra tax or fee unless I choose to use a certain service. However, when I checked in, I was told that I had to pay mandatory incidentals, which included Safety Tax $2.95, Communication Access $4.95 and Ocupancy Tax $1.00; worse, the communication access, which was internet service charge, didn't cover the fee for using the internet facility (internet handle), it's $10 extra. When I showed my online confirmation, showing taxes and fees are included, the hotel staff simply told me the so called mandatory incidentals were not included in my online reservation. Valet was expensive too! It's $18.95 plus $2.27 parking tax per day! All these ridiculous hidden taxes and fees made my hotel deal not reasonable any longer.

<Content>I have stayed there for four years I understand what many people are compaining about, but I have been in a very different situation. There are several teachers and students I travel with to New Orleans every year for a debate tournament. This coming weekend will be the fourth year we have stayed here. The staff has been wonderful to our teenage students. In return, the students love to stay here. The students are respectful and we have never had a complaint although we have students in about 19 rooms. I have been going to New Orleans twice a year or more for about 30+ years. My husband and I have picked Le Cirque for the past four years since we discovered it. I well remember when it was a Y. It is not the most fancy place to stay, but it has a great staff, great location and history. I have probably stayed in about 25 hotels, bed and breakfast, etc. in New Orleans since 1958. For the price, location and kind people I would rate Le Cirque in the top 25%.

<Content>Nasty Room but Excellent Customer Service Okay where do I begin.....This trip was my first to N.O. so I didn't have a clue on where to stay or where to go. I've read some reviews about this hotel and heard some negatives and positive so I decided to take a chance. When I arrived I was very pleased on how the crew took care of us. The lobby, like you read, is almost perfect....so nice and clean, very trendy sorta say. We checked in and the staff was awesome. They help us in every way possible as you will read about later. When we went in the elevator I already had a bad feeling about our room because the elevator was DIRTY. When we got to our room the maid was still cleaning but it was more like cleaning what? The carpet was stained the window looking out was busted looking it was like I paid 140 to sleep in a project house. The wallpaper was peeling off and the room just felt so damp. We decided to make the best of it but as we sat there starring at each other I got pissed. I didn't want my weekend getaway to be spoiled by some crappy hotel room that was over exaggerated by pictures on the internet. To make the long story short. Bar - was none ( there was a bar though but no drinks and bartender )Room service - was noneRoom - ugly and very upsetting and not finishedCustomer service - excellent ( Stacy hooked us up at their sister hotel. (Lafayette Hotel) We had the King size suite for the same price as the Le Cirque. Thanks Stacy.This hotel will be awesome when the get done remodeling.

<Content>pleasant stay I stayed here during November of 2002. The lobby and room is very chic and contemporary. The room is not big, but very comfortable and clean. Good internet price. The only problem is that it's about a 20 minute walk to the French Quarter.

<Content>It all depends on the room you get I spent 5 nights here (everywhere else was booked up), and the first 2 were truly awful, until I was able to change rooms.The first room they gave me (room 1004 )had mildew on the ceiling, which made the room smell awful. Not very romantic! The carpet was stained (yikes), the shower curtain was too short (so the bathroom got flooded every time we took a shower), and the light above the shower was broken (it remained broken despite asking for a new bulb).The lobby is clean and welcoming (quite stylish) but the elevator floors were filthy, really filthy. The restaurant, bar, and gym are all shut down. The whole building feels rather sad, and very rough around the edges.When I moved room, things got better. It was clean, with no stains or mildew.All in all, you should not stay here unless you can guarantee a mildew-free, stain-free room. Oh, and ask them to vacuum the elevator floors and change the carpets in the hallways!

<Content>Fair warning!!! I had read about the Hotel Le Cirque on this site after I booked it, unfortunately, so I went with forewarning, I suppose. Let's go from the outside in. It is in a decent location- you are literally across the street from a streetcar stop. You can walk to the convention center (I would not do so at night, though). The lobby and overall decor is rather pleasant, though it is obvious that it is an old hotel with major renovations. Now, the room itself was OK. The extra guests, however, were not. I am referring to the ants. On the first night it was raining pretty badly so I figured a few ants near my nightstand were understandable. Plus, they were so tiny they were really harmless, I didn't want to be a bother. The second night I noticed a slew of them in my garbage can, literally swarming over a discarded candy wrapper. Being in a rush, I assumed the maid would have enough common sense to call up an exterminator when she came in to make the beds later that morning. No, by the third night they were everywhere. I finally had had enough and called to have my room changed because they literally were biting me!!! The overall take on the hotel is go ahead with caution. It isn't a bad hotel per se. The desk staff was actually quite helpful, polite, and attentive to my needs. The accomodations were, aside from the ants, clean and actually above your average Holiday Inn. Still, I would think twice about staying there again.

<Content>Thieves in the Night On the advice of employees, we stored our bicycles in the courtyard, they told us, They will be safe here. They were not safe, and one of them was stolen. The management has been non-responsive to our requests for information and/or compensation.The room was small but adequate.

<Content>If you like the smell of mildew you'll love this place Dirty lobby, internet pictures make this place look modern and classy. SO WRONG. I hated my stay here.My floor had water damage and was dirty. Room service trays in hallway never picked up the entire 4 days I stayed there. Room had peeling wall paper, stained carpet and cheap beds to sleep on. Not kidding, this was the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Staff ok, but not very accomodating. DON'T STAY HERE!!!

<Content>Great Prices The employess were fantastic great attitude and funny. would like to say good luck to Amber and congrats on that one year. I was down there during hurrican Ivan and the employees were helpful in getting me a rental car and getting me to the airport so I could pick up the car and get out of town. The price for the hotel was fantastic with the 20 dollar coupon for food at six different restaurants. I recommend anyone visiting New Orleans to look into booking a room at this hotel. I would look to say thank you to all the employees for making my stay at their hotel a wonerful experience. Thanks Bob from Chicago

<Content>I'll be staying here again My friends and I spent four nights (Aug. 5-9) at this hotel and we were rather satisfied with our stay. The service was more than adequate and the room was well appointed if somewhat small. The shower was great, no plastic little box here. The location was also exceptional, right around the corner from the D-Day Museum and literally steps from the St. Charles Line. There were a few negative comments that we had; the parking lot is currently in the middle of a construction site so expect a dirty car and there were no trash cans in the room...not really sure what was up with that. I don't really know where the people who had negative reviews stayed but I'm no too certain it was in this hotel. It could be that they were there at the peak of a busy week. New Orleans can definitely be crazy on certain weeks.

<Content>Much better than expected from previous reviews. We stayed here the night before leaving on a cruise. Location was great for our need. While a little worn, we usually stay in Motel 6 so this was a nice change. Staff were great! They told us where to park for free, and when I asked for some creamer for in-room coffee, they gave me a glass of real cream, not just the powdered stuff. We will definitely stay here again.

<Content>I enjoyed my stay..staff was great....close to convention center!! I was very pleasantly surprised after reading all the bad reviews on this hotel. I was very well taken care of and the room was clean. The staff was absolutely wonderful..I dealt with Thomas at the front desk mostly...and he was exceptional!!!!! It was within walking distance (1/2 mile) to the convention center and I felt safe.

<Content>like an old car with new paint on it Booked through Expedia about a month in advance with The Lafayette Hotel. Arrived to find that the hotel was full and we had no room. I imagine our stay would have been great, if we had stayed there. Regina at the front desk was very sympathetic about the oversight. We were sent to their sister hotel down the road Le Cirque, where the staff was just as nice (Amber and Magda)... and a complimentary first night ... hopefully, we were told to contact Expedia for a refund. Le Cirque was very modern, which I like ... but it seemed very much like an old car with new paint on it. The toilet would run until you rattled the handle. It was also farther than I would have liked from the French Quarter. Beware of the $20 - $25 per day valet parking! Not only does it take a bit to get your vehicle, they park your car in a lot behind the hotel that would cost you only $5 to park yourself. All in all, a hotel I didn't choose and wouldn't choose in the future.

<Content>It's not Le Suck, but could improve I booked a room at Hotel Le Cirque via an internet booking system which reveals the hotel after you accept the price. After I found out it was Hotel Le Cirque, I read reviews and became a little leery of the property.When I checked in, the staff was quite friendly and helpful. I inquired about alternatives to the valet parking and was told parking under the bridge is free, but also, since I arrived on Friday, street parking is also free. I parked around the corner on the street for free, saving the $20.00/day valet.The staff did disclose the hotel safe fee, and the phone/internet fee, but with those fees, all domestic-U.S. long distance calls and local calls are free. Not a bad deal if you need to be on the phone any.The room was clean, although small, and the hotel was noisy - not much or any sound-dampening insulation. I heard other guests, the elevator, and sirens during the night. The room was clean, about average for New Orleans, where nothing is ever truly clean. They could have scrubbed the bathroom walls and floor a bit more (some mildew) and the paint job in the room was uneven. Perhaps there was water damage as other guests have suggested. The location isn't bad, right on the St Charles Street Car line, between downtown and uptown.The staff was helpful and pleasant, I would stay here again, but make sure you're getting a deal.

<Content>the WORST hotel in New Orleans, including road side motels At best this is a 1 star hotel. At check in, despite calling earlier in the day, they only had one of our rooms (at 2 AM) so we had to cram into a room (which was also not a non-smoking one).Again the next day, they didn't have our second room, and even at 3, they only had a second one with 1 bed, despite having told us that they were cleaning one up especially for us.When we finally got a second room, that one, as well as the others they subsequently showed us, all had stains on the floor (some the looked VERY much like blood, peeling wallpaper, cigarette stains (even in the non smoking rooms) on the tables, magazines with coffee stains, windows and mirrors with fingers smudges, and at least one EVEN HAD AN OPENED SOAPED BOX, WITH A BAR THAT HAD A HAIR ON IT. The beds were small, the room smelled, and when they changed our bags between rooms, a zip-lock bag with toothpaste, shaving blades, and PRESCRIPTION DRUGS somehow disappeared. The staff had non-professional and slovenly dressed, and one in particular we saw talking on the cell-phone for OVER 20 minutes, on his way to deliver a roll-a-way bed.This used to be a Y, but I can only imagine it was better back then, if for no other reason because it was newer; as they have obviously done no renovations since then.There was no water pressure, and the temperature changed every 5 seconds.ALSO, after calling and already over paying for each room, we were charged 7 per room per day for a safe and internet which we never used, but were told are AUTOMATICALLY ALWAYS PUT on every room after the room price has already been paid!In one room, the walls were so thin, that a baby which was crying in the night could easily be heard.AGAIN, by far, definitely not even a 3 star hotel.

<Content>Hotel Le Suck I agree with the rest of the poor reviews this hotel has received. First I was told that they had a shuttle from the airport to the hotel. They don't. The staff are young and not knowlegable. The room was small, dirty and smelled of smoke. Even the nonsmoking rooms have ashtrays. The carpets, mattress, and sheets are old and stained. The sheet weren't fitted so you end up sleeping on a dirty mattress. The hotel is basically worn out and smells of mold and mildew. They were having water leaks from the recent rain. I changed rooms after the first night and it seemed that the rooms on the east side of the building were a bit cleaner. The overall value was poor. All the hotels in New Orleans know when the large conventions are going to be in town. They receive a print out of the number of rooms needed so they can really soak you when there is a shortage of rooms.WARNING!!! Watch for hidden charges for internet hookup and safe use. This is the last kick in the ass when your checking out and pressed for time you receive a bill for an extra 7 dollars a day. In fairness they do have a small sign in the corner which mentions these extra charges.I will not stay there again. Buyer Beware!!!

<Content>Not worth it at ALL We stayed at this hotel over the weekend and the pictures on the internet definitely are not representative of the hotel. Everything was dirty from the elevator and the hallways to our room. The furtniture was stacked in our room and when I called to ask if the room had been cleaned they said it had and that the carpets were cleaned as well. The carpets were not cleaned, nor was our room. They may have made the beds but never vacuumed or dusted. I will not stay there again. I have stayed in Best Westerns that are nicer than this place. And, I get my room cleaned each day there. I DO NOT recommend staying here.

<Content>Staff with an attitude When I checked in, the staff switched my room to avoid charging me for an extra special event armband. When I checked out, the charge was on my bill. When I explained what the front desk staff had done at arrival by changing rooms to avoid that charge, the clerks said, 脗 No, they wouldn脗 t have done that, and we can脗 t take the charge off.脗 Were they were calling me a liar or an idiot? Small rooms, cheap bedding, dirty common areas, close to two homeless shelters. Reservation system complicated and ideal setup for identity theft.

<Content>Don't pay more than $59/night! You get what you pay for! We paid $59/night, which is what this place is worth. We had to be moved three times - the first 2 rooms smelled of mold! Small rooms. Dirty. However, the staff was very nice and the hotel is convenient to the D Day Museum as well as the street car. Cool bar.

<Content>Unbelievably bad I've stayed here twice - the first time was great so I refused to believe the reviews. This time - had to be moved three different times - either room was not clean, or the toilet didn't flush, smoking when I said non-smoking. Then....my bag was stolen from the bellman's locked room (hmmm...inside job?) When confronted with the theft, staff acted as if I inconvenienced them. Ruined my weekend to have to spend it filing police reports, walking around in filthy clothes, shopping and spending money for new things (money I don't have) and try to convince staff that this was something serious. It will be months before they can reiumburse me the costs of this loss. UNBELIEVABLE. NEVER STAY HERE. TRY THE RENAISSANCE AROUND THE CORNER!!!!

<Content>Very nice, close to everything My husband and I needed a few days away and found this little hotel. Are we glad we did. It was great. The rooms are small but cozy. The street car is right outside the hotel and all the great NO attractions are nearby. The staff was friendly and helpful. We would recommend this hotel to our friends as a getaway.

<Content>Worst hotel I have ever stayed at!!! The people were rude and they place us in a single bed room when we reserved a double. There were ANTS on our bed and when we told them about it, they just sprayed some chemical over it and didn't even change our sheets! I will never ever go there again. Not even if they pay me!!!!

<Content>LeCirque not worth $400 per night! $400 per night at LeCirque???What a shame!!A group of friends and I spent 4 days at LeCirque in November and the I choked on paying $100 per night. Of course, advertised at $59.99 through Hotels website. It's a quirky kind of place, friendly staff, no real standards, lots of party noise. But there was no other rooms to be had for that time. My husband requested 4 times to have our moldy shower curtain replaced and was told of course no problem, but guess what? Everyone smiles but nothing really gets done. On the fourth day it was still the same moldy shower curtain. The room was tiny. It's a little out of the way but there are some nice cafes for breakfast if you walk down the street.But I have to say say one thing. I was there to celebrate my birthday and had a blast. New Orleans lived up to all of my expectations and more. We didn' t let the lack of standards upset us, it kind of became part of the whole story. LeCirque was part and parcel of the big picture. Would I stay there again...no way. But do I regret staying there...not really. But I would never pay too much to do so. It really is a $59.99 kind of place.

<Content>For $400 per night it was the worst place I've ever seen! TERRIBLE! For nearly $400 per night (sugar bowl) I expected MUCH more! First, I reserved a room for myself and 28-year-old son, requesting 2 beds; I called a few days before making the trip to confirm the reservation of a room for 2 beds, 2 nights, non-smoking. When we arrived we were told the room type was not guaranteed! It was smoky smelling, causing great sinus problems. My son and I had to share the bed both nights, though we were told we would get a rollaway the 1st thing the second day (the room was so small, however, I don't know where they would put it! The second day we got 2 fresh bath towels and washcloths, but no hand towlels or bath mat. No tub, just shower with low threshold and floor got soaked. Walpaper was peeling; mold in the bathroom. Like I said, for nearly $400 per night....!!!! We've stayed in beautiful condos at South Padre Island for much less! The restaurant was crowded and noisy, with a curtain for walls. No gift shop or sundry shop, and vending machines were several floors away. The Ice machine on our floor was disconnected. The only good thing was it was in walking distance to the Superdome. No busboys, we handled our own luggage; nowhere to eat nearby, no room service, no service of any kind. Could not even check out or see our account on the television, and no receipt appeared under the door as it does in other hotels for much less money. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT AND NOT RECOMMENDED!

<Content>Cleaned our own room! The hotel is nicely decorated, but they seem to have forgotten about maintenance. Our room had 2 of 3 lights burned out at check in, which maintenance replaced right away. Paint was peeling off the ceiling of the bathroom, the bed spread had visible stains, there was a brown, goobery stain dripping down the far wall that was never cleaned the 7 days we were there. Each day we had to leave detailed notes to the housekeeper about what we expected; empty trash, change sheets, 3 sets of towels, or it didn't get done. 2 of the 7 days, the room wasn't cleaned by 7PM at night, and one of the nights we actually had to make the room up ourselves with sheets that were too small and no pillowcases. This IS NOT A DESIGN HOTELS PROPERTY - they have been removed from their corporate website. When I complained and wanted a refund for the 2 days the room wasn't cleaned, I was told that since hotels.com had handled my reservation, there was nothing they could do. The manager would not even come and speak with me, leaving her desk clerk to field my complaints. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!

<Content>Mixed feelings Upon arrival, the hotel and the lobby looked very similar as it did on its website. Like a couple of the other reviewers, I was at first disappointed about the flat daily fee for the safe and the phone. The phone fee, however, worked out since I decided to make a number of long distance and local calls that I would ordinarily not have and it wasn't a bad deal for about $4.00 a day. The bell hop service was great, especially Mr. Lewis, who I believe works during the days. He answered all of my questions about the area, the transportation, amenities, and was very curteous and helpful. The room was not bad since I was there alone. However, if someone else was staying with me, it would have been a tight squeeze. It was very dark in the day and night time since the room faced a building about a foot away in an alleyway. The bed was fine except I thought it was a bit odd that my sheet had the size handwritten in marker on the top of the bedsheet near the pillows. The shower was pretty weak, but was hot. I thought the New York Times was a nice touch, but I only received it one out the three nights I was there. The housekeeping was pretty good. The only major problem that I had was with the Lee Circle Restaurant in the lobby. I went down for breakfast at around 9:30 am and there was only one other diner in the restaurant. I waited a good 10 minutes before anyone from the restaurant was visible on the floor and then asked about seating for breakfast. I was told that they were too busy with room service orders and couldn't help me. I've never heard of such a thing in a restaurant before. I thought that was outrageous that they had turned me away and gave me the impression that I could only get served if I went back to my room to order room service! I spoke with one of the other hotel guests and she told me that she had ordered room service only consisting of a bagel and orange juice and it took an hour and a half because they lost her order. I also told someone at the front desk and was told that I was not the only one who had complained, and that someone else had to wait about a half an hour before someone even came out of the kitchen to seat him/her. I did like that the hotel was removed from the hecticness of the french quarter and was in a more quiet area. It seemed relatively safe although somewhat abandoned during the weekend. It was fairly easy to get around New Orleans from the hotel. The only thing is that I thought the public transportation in New Orleans was not too good in comparison to to other major cities in which it usually runs more frequently.

<Content>excellent value this is a great hotel, if you get the right room... my friends and i booked 4 rooms through hotels during the halloween weekend and got a great price of $85 per night, but no room type guarantee... when we checked in, the only rooms left were queen beds. The staff was very friendly and offered to move us to a two bed room the next day, which they did. The first room we had with the queen bed was #609, it was tiny, including an abnormally small bathroom/shower, but nevertheless cozy for a couple. My friends in #605 had a larger room, more comfortable. The sheets, pillows and linens were adequate for a 3-4 star hotel, the bed spread was a little scary, but overall the room was clean and neat with nice designer touches like marble tile bathroom and faux designer chairs. The second room we had with two twin beds was 902 and it was excellent, twice the size of the first with an oversized shower. This room also had a view of downtown, though the windows were small and covered with chicken-type wire. The staff was always very friendly and courteous but be sure to discuss the room safe charges. We were billed without consent. The location near the garden district is a good 10 block hike or $10 cab ride from the french quarter, but worth it for the peace and quiet. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Bad Deal There may be decent rooms at Le Cirque, but we were given a tiny, windowless (except for a translucent contraption that we could not open) chamber on a smoking allowed floor that we did not request. For the money this was the worst hotel room we have had. We booked it through a web site, at a reasonable, though certainly not a bargain rate. Had we known that this was the room that we were to be in for our stay, we would have gladly paid more. If this is the block of rooms that one gets through that web site, I do not think I will use them again. To make matters worse, when I spoke to the front dest guest services professional about changing rooms because of the smoking floor, she said that we assume that our quests are competent enough to request non-smoking when they book. So on top of being in this horrible room, we were insulted by the personnel. For the record, there is no indication on the web site that we used that one can request a non-smoking room.

<Content>Ugh. I don't know where everyone else has been staying, but it couldn't have been at Le Cirque. Talk about grim. I took a chance and, encouraged by the positive reviews posted on Trip Advisor, spent one night there last weekend. BIG mistake. I think it's interesting that no one has mentioned the hotel's audacity in charging an additional $8 in non-negotiable bogus charges at check-in. (This is not common procedure at reputable hotels, people!) Not only are you charged for the phone in your room (even if you have no intention of using it), but also rental of the room safe (ditto) and an occupancy tax. The most offensive aspect about this underhanded tactic is that the management knows most travellers are exhausted upon arrival and will pony up the extra money as opposed to walking out. Additionally, the hotel is only two years old but already needs renovating. Or, at the very least, a serious steam-cleaning. The carpeting is worn, the walls are dingy, and the room I ended up with literally reeked of mildew. It was beyond disgusting. There are very few amenities. (Pen and notepad? Forget it.) The sheets, blankets, and towels are of poor quality. I got the strong impression the hotel is tanking, and consequently the management has cut major corners to save money. It's unfortunate, really, because Le Cirque has the potential to be a very hip boutique hotel. Avoid this place like the plague.

<Content>We had a wonderful time! I had read some of the comments posted here before going and was kind of dreading what I might find. I must say that I was very impressed with the service at the hotel. Everyone we encountered was extremely courteous and friendly.The hotel decor is very tasteful and trendy, and while the wallpaper may need a tiny bit of work here and there, as has been mentioned before, its really not a big deal. Nor is the hotel filthy or a wreck as some of the reviewers have stated. Its not in a great neighborhood, but hey, most of New Orleans isn't a great neighborhood and the bums are everywhere.The hotel is small and so are the rooms, but everything is comfortable. I found that the photos posted on their site are pretty accurate.We had the front desk call a cab for us on our way out to dinner and were offered the hotel car and driver for our return. After a brief chat with the people at the front desk about our anniversary / birthday celebration we left for dinner. When we came back to our room we found a bottle of chilled champagne and a bag of goodies for us to eat. It was such a wonderful surprise we went back down to thank them.We would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends. We had a great time.

<Content>Worst Deal for your Money I recently graduated from Tulane and my parents and I booked this hotel through an online service. While the rate was reasonable, I sincerely believe you should take your hard earned dollars elsewhere. The hotel failed me in several instances: 1) mold growing in the shower 2) broken toilet paper dispenser 3) no towel rack-it had been ripped out of the wall 4) peeling paint and scratch marks on the walls in the hall passage ways 5) apparently the worst maid service in the city: they did not clear drink glasses from the lobby for a full 24 hours ( I passed them several times coming and going) 6) no room service- we left at 9 am and came back at 5pm, The maid then called to say we should leave so they could come clean! Upon refusal, she assured me they would come in about one hour. This of course never happened, so we had to contend with no clean towels and unmade beds. 7) Waiting 45 and 30 minutes for the 'valet' car service to deliver our car I will NEVER stay with this hotel again and plan on telling everyone I know. I have no idea where all the other rosy recommendations come from, but IMHO this place is the pits.

<Content>Not for me Unfortunately, I cannot agree with the mopre favorable reviews given and am curious why they were good. Anyway, the hotel was very small. It did not even have a stand with brochures in it. Although, I have stayed in smaller, our room was like a shoebox. IGNORE the PIC on their web site. In my opinion, it is deceiving. However, the modern furnishings are a somewhat accurate portrayal, but not as nice and fresh looking as the pic.Apparently, I should not have had the assumption that it would have a bathtub because it did not. Further, in my days there, the showers were some of the worst I have ever had! The water pressure was so weak, I felt as if I was getting drooled on by the shower. Prior to heading back home today, I actually thought about not taking a shower because of that. It kind of felt gross. Additionally, the water made my skin feel tight. So, the shower would be my biggest complaint. Next, housekeeping made the bed, but did not change the sheets. Grant it, we were not out of the room as early as they did their rounds, but it still would have been nice to get a clean set.Last, aside from the lady at the front desk upon arrival, I did not find any other staff (I encountered about 5 during my stay) to be particularly helpful or friendly. Oh and concierge???? Where? Who? Never met him or her.In sum, we got an outstanding rate through travel worm (online) and I am thankful for that. If it were not for the shower, I would grade it a C. I would never go back to this hotel and feel it is worth it to spend a few extra bucks on a nicer place. The thing is, one often does not know what the nicer places are unless he/she relies on something other than a picture.

<Content>Best bar in town Stayed 8 nights at hotel Le Cirque and felt at home at once. Perfect location if you - like me - don't care too much for the Bourbon street mayhem.Excellent restaurant and a superb bar - the dry martinis are out of this world. Hats off to the friendly bartenders mastering their trade.

<Content>Great fun at Hotel Le Cirque The Krewe of Muses selected Hotel Le Cirque as the place to stay post 2003 parade and we had an absolute ball! On the night Muses rolled, Le Cirque's restaurant was packed with fabulously interesting people. Of course, we fit right in sporting hot pink wigs, blinky head wreaths and purple satin togas. The manager couldn't have been more accommodating--- and we had many unusual requests involving large quantities of beads and other throws which required being moved about. Our group loved the hotel so much that we've recommended it to many others. I personally recommended it to a large group of out-of-town family members who just completed a New Orleans visit. They had wonderful things to say about Le Cirque. It is great to have such a hip hotel in town!

<Content>Best location in the city My friends and I had a wonderful weekend at Le Cirque. The location couldn't be better...easy access to Uptown or Downtown. We walked to the D Day museum, art galleries and coffee shops and enjoyed staying on the outskirts of the French Quarter. Our rooms were clean and comfortable and the hotel staff were amazingly friendly. The hotel's restaurant, Lee Circle, is EXCELLENT, and it was great being only steps away from our beds after enjoying a wonderful meal. For all this, you can't beat the hotel's rates. I highly recommend Le Cirque to locals as well as folks from out of town.

<Content>Decadence at the LeCirque As a hospitality professional I have the oportunity to stay at many types of Hotels. I recently had the oportunity to visit New Orleans and stay at the LeCirque. This is truly a delightful boutique property in a lovely part of town. The rooms are comfortable and the food is fantastic. What made my experience truly memorable was the General Manager and her staff. They want above and beyond to see that I was not only comfortable in my room but also getting maximum enjoyment of my time in New Orleans. For the price the Le Cirque cant be beat, Ill be back.

<Content>A Wonderful Hotel This is an excellent hotel. I had a really nice stay and the best sleep that I have ever had in a hotel bed. The bath rooms were really nice and the lighting excellent. Could see really well to put on make up and contacts. The shower is nice and roomy. The staff was very nice, especially the manager, Madga Chapetta! The valet guys were the best. The restaurant is excellent. Very good food and the service there was wonderful also. I highly recommend the Hotel Le Cirque to all of my friends and relatives. All in all, I had a wonderful stay.

<Content>It was jsut fine My fiance and I stayed here during the Final Four recently. The hotel itself is very different - very art deco. We arrived two hours prior to check in time and were shown right to our room. The rooms were small, but not uncomfortable. I guess we were lucky. We had a room that faced St. Charles Square and the statue in the middle. I thought it was a nice view. Our room was very clean. The hotel is a ways from the French Quarter. It is definitely a walkable distance, but sometimes if it was late when we were coming home, we would take a cab, moreso because our feet hurt! We walked down to the Riverwalk one day which was also not a terrible walk. My only complaint is that our room always smelled really smokey and neither of us smoke. We thought the cleaning person may have been smoking while they cleaned our room! Anyhow, this is not a bad place to stay. Its got character. And, the people at the front desk were always very helpful to us, especially giving directions.

<Content>Great time at Le Cirque I had the opportunity to stay at Le Cirque Hotel for an entire week. The rooms were clean at all times and the staff members were extremely helpful and courteous. The restaraunt was where I spent at least 4 days out of my 5 day week. I had an excellent chicken dish and the salads were all great!! The food was terriffic! Being from the city, I get tired of the local food, Le Cirque was a needed change of pace. The atmosphere at Le Cirque was quite modern, reminding me of Manhattan, without the chaotic hustle and bustle. The location of Le Cirque is directly on the street car line which provides safe (and historic/touristy) public transportation from uptown to downtown.I would recommend a stay and/or dining at Le Cirque to anyone, anytime!!Jennifer M.

<Content>Home away from home! I work for a major computer company in Washington D.C. Over the past year and a half my colleagues and I travel two or three days a week to New Orleans. We've stayed at many hotels in the big easy, but have settle on Hotel LeCirque as our hub. The entire staff treats us like we're their family. LeCirque has become our home away from home, they all know our names and needs. LeCirque is like staying at a stylish NY hotel for a fraction of the price. And finally the added bonus is they have a boni-fide 4 star restaurant.

<Content>Could be nice but isn't We stayed for four days over Thanksgiving in 2002. For New Orleans the price is great however if you pay in advance you will be ambushed by additional rip-off charges for phone  safe whether you use them or not. Why not elevator, water, toilet, etc? If they had just bumped the rate $15 I would have stayed anyway  been happy. However almost all customers felt they were leaving a den of thieves. The front desk people were pleasant however they would endlessly promise to fix any problem in a few minutes but nothing would ever be fixed. The neighborhood appears to be one you would not want to walk around in after dark. All in all probably a good deal but the owners make you feel that you have been mugged.

<Content>Le Cirque was horrid My room was lousy. I arrived late and was too exausted to notice that the bed had a filthy (with vomit from the previous week's Mardi Gras festivities) blanket on it. Housekeeping had to bring up linens for the pull out sofa, but didn't bring a blanket or extra pillow, just two sheets. I had reserved a non-smoking room with two beds, but my only choices were a smoking room or a room with one bed and a sofabed. The hotel appeared to be deserted, so I suspect I got one of the crappy rooms they reserve for people who booked the discount rate over the internet. The next day housekeeping made the room up with my dirty blanket on the bed and the bedspread on the sofa bed...no extra blanket. When I asked for clean blankets, they brought up a blanket that fit a twin bed which didn't work too well on the king size bed. The internet makes this place look exceptional, but the fact is that it's just okay and in a lousy part of town. It's right on the St. Charles street car line, but at night, it feels unsafe just to walk the short block from the stop to the hotel door. It's scummy. And I got the impression that there was at least a hot tub on the premises. What a joke. You have to go to the YMCA next door. I wouldn't be caught dead in there. The Y doesn't have one window that isn't broken. God knows what it looks like inside. I'll never stay at the Le Cirque again.
