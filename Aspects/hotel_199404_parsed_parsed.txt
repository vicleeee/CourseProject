<Content>Central location, functional accommodation Basic hotel, but functional and central location. Small bar, clean rooms. Fine for a business trip or holiday when you're not looking for a unique hotel. Central location, 5-10mins walk from Zoo/big shopping area, 3 mins to Wittenbergplatz tube. You can take one tube line direct to ICC if you're at a conference there. Steak restaurant just over the crossroads that the hotel is beside is good. About 25euros by taxi from Tegel airport, or take bus to Zoo and then walk.

<Content>Comfortable hotel I stayed at this hotel for a weekend and paid a very good rate on a prepaid basis (73 EUR per night) through Booking.com. I just used the hotel to sleep, so I cannot tell anything about breakfast and gym. My room was not so big but very comfortable, with LCD television, spacious desk, free internet access, well unsonorised windows; the bathroom has no bathtub, just a shower compartment, nothing special. Quite clean everywhere.It can't be said that location is in a beautiful area, but it is safe, quiet, just 250m from the Wittenbergplatz underground station and several bus lines stop in the nearby.For the gay traveler who goes for action, Berlin's main gay scene is not father than five minutes' walk. For shoppers, there is the huge KaDeWe department store at Wittenbergplatz as well as the Kurf眉rstendamm at walking distance.Staff is nothing special though correct, except for the fact that I asked the receptionist to wake me up at 4am and he didn't (forgot?)- I did not miss my flight because my partner phoned me (unasked - just in case) from Buenos Aires at 3.30 to wake me up. Lucky me!

<Content>Everything you need... Stayed in the Presidential Club rooms and given it was a Best Western, it was definitely above standard. After having a very bad experience with Best Western as a corporation after problems with a hotel in Toronto, I never use this chain. However, a work function required me to stay here so I gave it another chance. The room was not large (so would not necessarily want to imagine the rooms that are not the upgraded version) but as could be expected in this part of EU, very effectively and efficiently designed! North American designers could learn a few things here about the size of our footprints! The room had everything you would expect in a 4 star room--free wireless, a comfortable reading area, nice desk/workspace, flatscreen, separate bar area, very clean and updated bathroom, nice bedding, and little make up table/extra mirror area in a much smaller space than North American hotel rooms that somehow did not feel crowded at all! Breakfast was great and made life easier than finding a place nearby before work meetings (especially since it rained the whole time). Location was super convenient to U-bahn--although there were more interesting areas of Berlin, this area had everything you needed in terms of cafes, shops, etc without the hard core night club scene and noise. We were here during Euro Cup so crowds at night were fun and spirited all over the city--but not obnoxious or worrisome! People often try to judge based on the star rating--I have found from travelling all over the world, that this system is too diffcult to ever be useful. A four star in Mexico is completely different than the lap of luxury you find in a four star in Thailand or a four star in Jordan. This is by no means a hip boutique hotel, but it is better than a standard hotel (especially given that it is a chain!) Staff were efficient and friendly, but it wasn't the type of higher-end service you find in many other places (eg. no one offers to help with luggage or order you a taxi without you standing in line to ask them, etc, which are fairly standard courtesies in many other hotels....but are hardly an issue or problem). There was nothing significant that I would change here and I would recommend this to family or friends.

<Content>We liked this hotel My wife and I stayed here for three nights and found the hotel to be practical, efficient, comfortable and the staff helpful when asked. The hotel was well situated for us. Would I go back? Yes, but there may be better deals on the day that might tempt me away. This hotel knows how to charge.

<Content>Great... But Only if You Upgrade This hotel was lovely. I first saw the normal rate room, which was small and awful. I then was shown the Presidential Club room, with a private elevator, for only 20 euro/night more. WORTH IT!! The room was larger and much more luxurious for the small extra fee. So in conclusion, I recommend this hotel only if you upgrade. Regarding the staff, there are a few rude staff members when we arrived, but in the evening they are very kind and act as a concierge.

<Content>Lovely Surprise When we arrived at the Hotel 2 hours before check in time, we got a lovely greeting, saying the room was ready and they had upgraded us as we were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. (I had written to them) We had a lovely room with Red Roses and rose petals, roses and candles also in the bathroom. Coffee could be ordered at any time at no charge, but I would still prefer the coffee maker in the room. A charming girl turned down the bed each night and left little sweets. The Hotel was very convenient to the underground and very near the famous store Ka De We. We were there for a week and spent the first 3 days on walking tours which were excellent. On the Saturday we went up the main shopping street near the hotel, there was a great buzz.  The tour group Berlin Original Walking Tours were very informative, they also run a Pub Crawl and nothing would do but for my husband to go on it. So off we went with all the young backpackers including a young lad from our home town in Ireland. (Could you go anywhere without meeting someone from home?) Now when I tell you my husband has just retired and it was our 43rd wedding anniversary we were celebrating, you might wonder how we got on. It was FANTASTIC great fun lovely people and the night club at the end of the night!!!! The next day (3o鈥檆lock) all we were able for was the long promised visit to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. That is something not to be missed and you need a good few hours to take it all in. It really gives you food for thought. All in all we had a wonderful visit to Berlin.

<Content>Good Location Stayed at this hotel for a weekend break. Excellent location, 5 minutes walk from the Wittenbergplatz tube station, and right on the corner of the Kurfurstendammstrasse (the main shopping area, with the huge department store KaDeWe on it).As it was a weekend, the hotel dining room was very busy on Sat/Sun morning, and too small for the number of guests trying to get around the buffest tables, but it was fine on the Monday. The breakfast selection was excellent, with a wide choice to suit all tastes and appetites. The staff were very friendly, though rushed.The Germans haven't embraced our hatred of smoking yet, so the very nice (though small) bar was a smoking area, with no alternative no-smoking facility. Also, as usual in an hotel, the drinks were not exactly cheap, so we bought wine from the nearby supermarket after the 1st night, and kept it in the room fridge.The room was small but had everything we needed, cleaned each day, comfy beds, but awful pillows, we had 2 each, and they were useless - far too thin.Upon arrival at Schonefeld Airport, don't pay E30 for a taxi, take the S9 train to Warschauerstrasse (big station), then the tube to your own tube station. This costs E2.10, lasts 2 hours, but we bought a 3 day ticket for E19.90 each, for travel on all Berlin public transport, which was very good value. However, everything is a lot closer than it appears on the map, and we did a lot of walking, with plenty of watering holes to keep us refreshed.The city bus tour, costing about E20, was very informative, and helped you get your bearings, and work out what you wanted to see. You can get on and off whenever you want, to save on the shoe leather.Lots to see and do in this city, loads of museums, the Checkpoint Charlie one is a must. Be aware that there are large queues for the most popular attractions, such as the Reichstag, the Television Tower, so go early.The street food stalls and bakeries are plentiful and good value, and the food is of a very high standard, the Germans all ate at them, so we did too.Overall, a good hotel, if you don't mind smoking, and a very good weekend break.

<Content>Better than current Western presidents! Excellent. Slightly away from the tourist centre (which can be walked to within 30 mins), but close to the park. Also close to the zoo area, which is quite lively. Found the hotel staff to be friendly. Not sure about the other negative comments on here - think standards may be a bit too high? Was a bit worried about the low price we paid, but was pleasantly surprised. Only bad point being on a main road, but when you are a few floors up it does not really matter. Compared to the hotel we stayed at in Munich three days later (which was twice the price), this was far far better.

<Content>Good value and location At check-in, I was upgraded without additional charge to a better room than I had booked. It was a completely renovated room with a view of Europa Center, and without doubt it was the nicest and most comfortable room I've had in Europe in the price range. The staff were pleasant, efficient, and helpful. The location is very good, a couple blocks from KaDeWe and the Wittenbergplatz U-Bahn station. Now that I've spent some time in Berlin, I might choose a livelier neighborhood, but I would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Would definitely return to President I have just returned staying at the Hotel President for three nights travelling with three friends, one of whom was German and knew Berlin well. I find the negative reviews of this hotel surprising. The four of us found the President a perfectly suitable hotel from which to visit the greater Berlin area, it is very close to the U-Bahn and the area did not at all feel unsafe at night. The rooms (we stayed on the 7th floor and had a good view towards east Berlin) were reasonably sized, cleaned every day and the en-suite bathrooms were also clean, with plenty of towels and plenty of high pressure hot water. The TV was adequate. The free coffee machine just down from our room was excellent, particularly when we discovered the close proximity of the hotel to the local supermarkets. There were also some good restaurants nearby. The hotel staff were v friendly and most obliging and spoke English. The buffet breakfast was a bit expensive at 鈧?4.00 per person, but there was plenty of it. The fitness centre was a bit shoddy, but everything worked. The hotel does have an '80s feel to it, but it is clean, safe and welcoming. All four of us agreed it was worth staying at again. The President is not a greatly luxurious hotel, it is probably nearer to a high three star than a four star rating, but it is suitable base from which to tour around Berlin. It was certainly better than I expected and much better than the worst reviews on this site suggest.

<Content>Very good value I was worried after reading the reviews of the hotel. I booked the hotel through Venere.com at a very good price. Didn't go for the breakfast as there was plenty of places to eat near by. The Hotel looks a bit dated and is on a main road but I found it very central. The east is the place to be but we found it easy to get around from where we are.. Hotel was very clean and fresh towels and room service at your beck and call. Staff were a little muddled at first but incredibly helpful in the end, esp the conseige. The hotel is 200 metres from the metro and they offer a free shuttle bus and 24hr tea, coffee or hot chocolate, which we took advantage. Its a 4 star mainly because amenities such as a sauna etc. I think it all depends on what you pay..but I was pleasantly surprised and will stay here again. Janinne. London

<Content>it really maybe presidential but only on ONE floor Hi everyone,Just spent 2 nights at the President with my wife. Just an average hotel in a poor location. We got assigned a very little room at first and after complaining at the desk we got upgraded to a nicer floor in a somewhat renovated room. I think the fact that I speak German helped a great deal. Same really small bathroom though. Cable TV wasn't working properly. Breakfast is good but otherwise nothing really nice to write about this hotel.

<Content>You deserve better, believe me... The only good thing about this hotel is the breakfast. But it actually takes a little more to get a good rating from the guests! Here鈥檚 what I will remember:- Depressing location (didn鈥檛 feel very safe at night) - Small rooms (totally outdated, bad satellite reception)- Unhelpful staff (unable to speak English)- The 鈥淕eorge Bush鈥?business center simply doesn鈥檛 make sense (unless you are in Houston, TX)In conclusion, I would stay away room this hotel. 2 nights there and you feel more depressed than after 2 weeks on the road.Will do a better job next time before booking, or simply read the reviews on this website!

<Content>Not a good review. But then I m not an alcoholic... I found it highly suspicious that the only great comment about the hotel was that the bar was reopened for guests (see below).The access to alcohol is NOT what should determine a 5 starhotel rating. Unfortunately for me, I stayed for 2 nights at the President Hotel, only to find outthat the negative reviews posted on your site were accurate and true! The location is bad, unlessyou like to rely heavily on taxis (I don't). The staff should take classes in English andadopt the smile at least once a day formula. On their website, the President is ratedas a 4 star hotel, it is NOT. Rooms need to be refurbished soon.My last night in Berlin was spent at the SAS Radisson. It is an amazing place, which is totallyworth the 30 additional dollars (free internet, great gym and sauna, incredible mattresses,classy decoration). Stay away from the Hotel President. That's really your best bet.

<Content>4 stars? Got to be kidding! Stayed 4 nights at this hotel and it is like traveling back in time. Welcome to the 80鈥檚! Well you sort of know which year it is when you find out that their business center (second floor) is called 鈥he George Bush room. That should make Democrats feel at home right away. Don鈥檛 expect anything other than rooms with basic comfort and very small bathrooms. The view at least from my room: the express way but you have the choice of dark alleys on all other sides of the building. It is basically away from everything: nothing to do at night in this area which has a terrifying past. Less than one block away was the Judenreferat (department of Jewish Affairs) which under the supervision of Adolph Eichmann was in charge of the extermination of 6 million Jews in Europe. The building no longer exists and no ghost will wake you up at night, just your neighbors鈥?activities as the walls are very thin. Luckily enough I had an old couple next door who snored big time. Staff is helpful most time but not all of them speak English. Reading this comment you may think the management is able to compensate with great rates and/or an extraordinary package. Forget it! There is obviously no need for it as this hotel lives on the reputation of the Best Western chain. Only foreigners booking from their distant home country -just like me-get stuck here (No such a thing as free internet connection. It is available at an outrageous rate of 鈥?4 euros for 10 hours!). Still hard to believe, this hotel is supposed to be four stars barely making it to 3 according to my standards (I am a seasoned traveler). You will easily make a better choice by staying elsewhere.

<Content>Great Location near KaDeWe Great hotel, very friendly staff, located just steps away from the U Bahn and the most amazing mall in Europe KaDeWe. Great breakfast and they have special packages that include a special evening meal in the restaurant which is part of the hotel (very nice for the price). I'll stay there next time I'm in Berlin.

<Content>Not especially inexpensive, but excellent location The Hotel President is located about three minutes on foot from the Wittenbergplatz station on the U2 line from Berlin Zoologischer Station (one stop). Its location on the U2 line (direction: Pankow) makes it very easy to get to the Unter den Linden station (Brandenburger Tor, Reichstag) via Potsdamer Platz, Friedrichstrasse, and connecting service to museums and facilities on the Eastern part of Berlin. + Right behind the Wittenbergplatz station is the fabulous KaDeWe department store but just beyond there are numeruos shops and bookstores and restaurants along the Kurfuerstendamm leading up towards the Zoologischer train station. + The hotel itself has a full-service restaurant and a bar on the ground floor. Rooms are small -- single bed, shower -- but the ceilings are high and, with the help of a torchiere lamp, are quite brightly lit. The standard rate is about 120 EURO for a single, but if you look around (on the Best Western home page, for example) you may be able to track down a rate in the high 70s or 80s. A full range of amenities is offered (toothbrush, comb, hair tonic, cotton buds) but the water pressure in the shower could have been a little stronger.
