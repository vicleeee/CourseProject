<Content>Nice location on clarke quay Hotel rooms were clean. Was given a room that could accommodate 2 adults and 3 children which was 2 double beds and a rollaway which was great. The children enjoyed the pool area which was well maintained. The location is great as the MRT is close and lots of restaurants. Restaurants at the hotel are a little pricey but that is normal for Singapore.Stayed 3 nights and had no problems.

<Content>Our Singaporean Favourite We have stayed at the Merchant Court for many a stopover. For families it is a wonderful choice. Excellent resort style pool area with separate kids pool and a slide into the main pool that is very much a favourite. Even though the children have a wonderful time the area still seems to remain peaceful as I am not sure too many families know about this hotel. When we were there last the rooms were undergoing refurbishment. I am not sure whether that will include seperate showers (currently the showers are in the bath), but who cares, it is very clean, has spacious rooms and very quiet.The breakfast buffet is excellent and service is very attentative. There is a nice pool bar with reasonably priced lunches and all days snacks (and cocktails).The location has just got better over the years with the new additions to Clarke Quay, this time we noticed a whole new strip of bars and restaurants which are easily reached by a walk across the bridge outside the hotel.All in all a great place to stopover and relax after a long plane flight. We will return time and time again!!!

<Content>Great staff I really appreciated the great service from the staff I received in my stay at the hotel. They were obviuosly well-trained but I loved the fact that our interaction was sincere and not just hotel procedures. I stayed at the hotel as a stop-over from Siem Reap. I had requested for a big bed and when they didn't have available for the category I booked for, they upgraded me and gave me a nice room overlooking the pool and clarke quay. I expressed that it was sad I couldn't sample their buffet breakfast as my flight was early the next day, but they suggested that they will bring in an early breakfast for me instead. I appreciate the fact that they listen and offer suggestions instead of the usual procedures in checking-in guests without even bothering to know what the guest wants or what his concerns are.All the staff I encountered from the check-in staff, to the bellman to the waiter and to the guy who brought up my bags, I had the same experience of sincerity in their service. As for the room, I don't have complaints either. It's a rather small room but bed is soft and comfortable, pillows are soft. Bathroom is of considerable size but it doesn't have a separate shower. It is expectedly clean.While I have most of the time stayed in the bugis/bencoolen area, this hotel is still well-located being close to clarke quay and an MRT station. taxis are easy to get and there's a 7-11 store down the hotel at riverside complex.

<Content>Great location. Surly service. Business travel from 12/19 to 12/21. Absolutely fantastic location! Chinatown is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Great mall right across the street from the hotel with a food court that offers a variety of food across all price ranges. Hotel room was perfectly adequate with the most comfortable bed in which I have ever slept! Thank you for this! Staff at check-in and concierge are neither friendly nor unfriendly. They just seem rather...robotic. Though I'm sure they're competent in their jobs, maybe having more warm, friendy people manning the front desk, or any station in which guest interaction is required, would be a better idea? They just didn't seem like they were happy doing their job, which in turn made me feel unwelcome and did not create a great first impression.If you can get past this, I highly recommend staying at this hotel because of its location. If you're a runner, there's great running paths in the neighborhood.Would definitely stay here again and just grin and bear the surly service I received from the staff.

<Content>Nice hotel, convenient location Visiting Singapore in December can be a scary option at times. Room rates are outrageous. So i was a bit surprised to see that I got a rate of SGD 175 for this hotel on the website. It is a good 4*+ hotel and to get this rate around Christmas was a surprise. This can be attributed to the global recession. The hotel is pretty nice. It is situation on Clarke Quay, which is the action and is packed with bars, clubs and restaurants. We had paid for a Swiss Business Advantage room which is level 2 in their room category. They had a club room but that was 110 SGD more. As we were staying for a week we did not want to pay the extra money. The room itself was largish for Singapore standards. Bed was decently comfortable although I found the pillows not much comfortable. The room has a flat screen TV but no DVD player and a very very poor selection of TV channels. The hotel has a 24 hour gym and a pretty good pool. The rate was including breakfast which was identical for the entire week that we stayed at the hotel. So it can get boring at times. Opposite the hotel there is the central shopping center. The shops there are nothing much but they have some good eating options. And of course there is Clarke Quay. Lots of night life over there. Taxis are plentiful and the hotel is also adjacent to the Clarke Quay MRT station. So there are lots of commute options. Overall a good stay at the hotel. Nothing much to complain about. And price was pretty good considering the time of the year.

<Content>Convenient We stayed here for two nights and it was a convenient location.On check in we discovered they had given us 3 singles instead of a queen/king ... which we found odd as we stated we were a couple on reservation and giving someone 3 singles for 2 ppl is kind of a waste.The locaiton is handy - Clarke Quay is nearby ... good food and bars. In Singapore everything is relatively close so getting around is easy and cabs are very cheap relative to Melbourne prices.The pool was a nice oasis in a really sticky climate - and the breakfast was a good free touch.Tend to agree with other reviews - there's nothing wrong with the place, just nothing really that great. For us it was a good cheap stopover hotel with a good location and comfort.

<Content>Mediocre Beyond location there is not much to recommend the Swissotel Merchant Court. There is just nothing special or exceptional about the place.Staff are friendly but frequently unhelpful, such as the concierge who suggested that a print shop might be that way, while pointing vaguely. At another point they told me that no rooms in the hotel had wireless internet- although this turned out not to be true. Regardless, you pay a fee for wired or wireless connection.Breakfast (often included) is standard fare prepared with little zest. The ground level bar is sparsely attended and uninspiring.While the rooms are clean, mine was done in brown and orange and could have been a budget hotel almost anywhere in the world. In the end, you can do much better in Singapore and would encourage you to do a bit more looking than I did before staying here.

<Content>We enjoyed the Merchant Court We stayed at The Swissotel Merchant Court in October for four nights on route to Australia. We booked a Swiss Business Advantage room which had been recently renovated. It was a spacious and modern room which we had a very comfortable stay in. The only thing we thought was a bit strange was why they hadn't chosen to upgrade the bathroom as it didn't quite marry up with the newly renovated bedroom. It was totally functional though so not a problem. The location of the Merchant Court is just fabulous, in between Clarke Quay and Boat Quay. We found it very easy to get around and had hundreds of restaurants to chose from. Will be more than happy to stay there again.

<Content>Good value for money, but overrated In terms of 'bang for the buck', this is a decent hotel. I'm not sure it deserves its #19 ranking in Singapore, though.Pros: --Location. Right on Clarke Quay, and just minutes on foot to the MRT station. Taxis almost always waiting nearby. A medium-sized mall is across the street.--Cleanliness/security. The room, like most in Singapore, was clean and secure.--Cost. $112/night, taxes and service charges included, is a bargain for this location.Cons:--Size. This room is tiny...and I received an upgraded room (can't fathom how small the basic room is). It had a smaller-sized King bed and basic furniture, but there really wasn't anywhere to put your suitcases without having to step over/around them. The bathroom was also small.--Service (housekeeping): Most of the toiletries were gone when we checked in; apparently whoever stayed before us left after the daily cleaning and took them with, and housekeeping didn't go by the room again.--Service (check-in): They didn't have a non-smoking room available (sorry, wife is pregnant and we're picky) despite requesting this at the time we booked the room several weeks ago, and they were very hesitant to upgrade us...it took us nearly 15 minutes to check in as a result. No apology, no friendliness--it was as if we were an inconvenience to them. --Service (concierge): I asked for a map with our location on it, and the concierge points to the maps nearby. I asked him for the location, and he hesitantly pulls out a map from under the counter, draws a ridiculously giant star on our location, and an even bigger, less-useful circle around it. As above, it was as if I was asking him to bend over backwards with a basic request. Very much unappreciated.Because the service issues were one-time incidents (each) and the rest of the stay was generally pleasant, I give this 3 stars. Great value for the money, but with a little more positive attitude it could have been 4, which is where a hotel with an upgraded room of this size belongs.

<Content>Great Stopover on your way to Australia This was the first hotel we stayed in during our 3 week trip to Singapore, Australia (where we were getting married) and Hong Kong. We found it clean, welcoming and the bed was comfortable all important after that 12 hour flight. The location was great on Clarke Quay close to a shopping mall, plenty of bars and the MRT station, everything you need on a stopover to Oz. We most enjoyed eating in the Food Courts within the shopping malls which were fantastic value for money and much nicer than eating in either the hotels, bars or restaurants, which tended to be on the expensive side with much the same food! If you are on a budget or would just rather be a bit more adventurous, instead of the 30 dollar breakfast in the hotel (which to be fair may be nice but we didnt try it) go to the market downstairs in the shopping mall where you can get coffee and a variety of eggs and toasties etc for a few pence. While in Singapore must do's are The Flyer, A singapore sling in Raffles and Sentosa Island and travelling around on the MRT is an absolute joy after the trials of travelling on public transport in the UK for years !!

<Content>This is the place to stay We had a lovely stay. Searched for a long time to find the best price, and eventually found that was on their own website (and they price-matched anyway). If you are flying Singapore Airlines be aware they have special offers with Swissotel if you show your boarding pass - problem is you have to know this before you book (which we didn't). With an economy ticket it means you get a free upgrade and includes breakfast so well worth it. We stayed in a business executive suite which was great. Quiet and clean. You're not expected to tip which is good to know when you have room service and bell-boy services. The pool was fantastic and open to late. The gym is 24hr access which is great if you are jet-lagged. Didn't eat in the hotel as it was pretty expensive and there were some *fantastic* authentic restaurants down the road in chinatown where it was 3 singapore dollars a meal. Did get room service once though which was good but it should have been for the amount we paid!Would definitely go back again, especially if flying Singapore Air. Perfect location and pretty much faultless stay.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Myself and my son stayed at the Swiss Merchant Court in Oct for stopover. The hotel is both impressive and excellent value for money.The position could not get much better, out the doors and accross the bridge into Clarke Quay, fantastic.The double room we booked had plenty of space and was moden and clean. The pool is great and the staff were very helpful.We will be staying at this hotel again without a doubt.

<Content>Good Value Good location. A few subway stops to Orchard Road or China Town or Harbourfront. There is free shuttle bus to Raffles Place and City Hall . Room with high ceiling is well maintained. Bathroom is of good size. Both check-in and check-out is quick.What we dont like is can hear the sound of flusing the toilet in the neighbouring room, which is very annoying particularly duringearly mornings. TV channel selection is also quite limited. NoCNBC or BloombergBasically it is a pleasant stay in this hotel

<Content>Loved the Merchant Court Stayed for 8 nights  were upgraded to a Business Advantage room with a balcony.Excellent room, included tea  coffee  a very handy ironing board  iron. The bathroom was larger than average  had a powerful stand-alone shower. The only comment is the poor sound insulation of the patio doors. This wasn't a big problem but would have been if the room had been any closer to the river.The pool was also excellent, unexpectedly large when compared to other city centre hotels. There are no dedicated pool staff which means children can sometimes dominate the area. The sunbeds are close together in one corner  there are no sun shades/umbrellas.Superb location, slap bang in the middle of Robertson  Clarke Quays. It's a picturesque10 minute walk down the river to Boat Quay  on to the Esplanade. A 2 minute undercover walk to the nearest Mall  MTR station, very handy when it's raining as you can access the Malls of City Hall, Suntec  Orchard Road.Couldn't fault the staff in any part of the hotel. Special mention to Sharon at Reception, she really looked after us during our stay, many, many thanks. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

<Content>Location, Location, Location I have stayed 3 times at this hotel and absolutely love it. The location is perfect, on Clarke Quay, walking distance to Chinatown and being next door to the MTR means nowhere is too far away.The new shopping mall next door is perfect for those quick snacks and bits and pieces needed.Breakfast is one of the better buffets I've had in a hotel, a huge variety to please everyone.

<Content>friendly hotel and warm welcome!!! I stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is lovely and all the reception staff is friendly and helpful. Since I travelled with my mum who is physically challenged, we got the assistance from the staff by providing my mum a wheelchair and the hotel's staff are really well-trained and polite.I would like to thank to the bell man who I could not remember his name and a lovely and friendly reception staff, Zan or Yan ( if I am not wrong), she assist us to the elevator and gave us the warm welcome to the hotel.I would like to recommend this hotel to my family and my friends. Warm welcoming and friendly environment

<Content>Declining standards I have stayed here many times over the past ten years. This time was probably the last. Standards have been eroded and value is now significantly lower. I always stayed on the Executive floors and these have received a superficial make-over accompanied by a marked reduction in service. The breakfast has been reduced in range, the chef disappeared a couple of years ago, so an egg the way you like it is no longer offered, and the fruit selection is tiny, bread and pastry ranges have been trimmed and cost cutting is on blatant display. The rooms have been refurbished, but the sub standard air conditioning and showers without thermostat remain, ensuring a sweaty night and a too hot / too cold shower in the morning - in 2008, on the Executive rooms ? The free laundry went last year, and now the free broadband accompanies it ...... so just what is an 'executive' with no broadband ? The service quality costs reduction is now so obvious that the hotel management looks rather out-of-touch with their target customers' needs. It would have been much better to raise prices and maintain quality, but the route chosen - raising prices and reducing quality has made the value proposition significantly poorer. I'm afraid I shall be at The Fullerton for future trips. Sad, really, I wrote a good review of this hotel some time ago, but my latest experience was very poor when compared to what was offered previously.Dr Bob Vass

<Content>Great Hotel - Great Service - Great Location We stayed at Swissotel Merchant Court for the F1 night race, and are happy to have chosen this hotel - will certainly return!From arrival to departure - everything was very efficient and we received very warm services throughout. The rooms are well designed - the pool area is very relaxing, and the gym is open 24 hours, which was accommodating our jetlag. There was aso a pillow menu and my wife chose her favourite cusion, just like at home. We also booked the airport transfer, which is a bit more expensive, but better than the cheap taxis if arriving after a long flight. Swissotel will remain in our memories when thinking back to the first F1 night race ever - and we will return, latest next year!

<Content>Location Location Recommended by Trailfinders. The location was excellent by the Singapore River close to Clarke Quay (good nightlife)Also it was away from Orchard Road which is very hectic.Lovely pool - room was good.Food was good too with a wide range of local and European choice. Arrived on an early morning flight. The hotel let us have our room at 8.00am without extra charge, which was great after a 13 hour flight.

<Content>Fantastic location Will definitely stay here again. Fantastic location 鈥?possibly a tad too close to Brewerkz :-). It鈥檚 only about 15 minutes walk to Chijmes and Raffles City, 5 minutes walk to Chinatown, and Clarke Quay MRT station is literally just 2 minutes walk away. We booked directly through the hotel鈥檚 website and was given the room we requested for 鈥?non-smoker room, high floor, and quiet room. Very pleased with our first Swissotel experience.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location Not the most impressive enterance. However once inside things look fine.Booked in late at night and was given a room with a twin bed having asked for a king size. Complained to reception who siad they could do nothing till tomorrow. Next morning when down and showed the booking slip and appears they had made a mistake. Problem was sorted within minutes and correct room was allocated and correct room was great. Nice view over the Singapore River. Good size very clean.Hotel is in a great location directly opposite Clarke Quay and a ten minute walk to Boat Quay. (Both expensive to eat at, set up for tourist not locals.) All city attraction are less then a $10.00 cab ride. Hotel staff will tell u to take the bus or MRT but the taxi is cheap air conditioned uncrowded and its quicker. Zoo is $25 but again worth the moneyHotel has a great pool, gym is fine and breakfast is good. Although for a 4 star hotel not the cheapest. Staff are very friendly and always willing to help. Problem are fixed or looking into very quickly.Overall a great hotel and I will happily stay there again.

<Content>Dishonest It's a nice hotel in a great location. However, a girl in the front desk lied to me when I requested a late checkout. They told me they were fully-booked the next day, but all room types from the very basic to the expensive ones are all available when I tried booking for that same day on their Web site. Most hotels I have stayed rarely had problems to give me like 2pm or even later checkout upon request. Let alone when they have plenty rooms available. I am just disgusted how they had trained their people to lie to customers like this.

<Content>Prime location Pros: convenient to MRT stations all ranging between 500m to 1 km away and will link to the other lines within 1-3 stops. We upgraded to an advanced room and well worth it for the space, though we did not have a view which was just fine. Convenient access to Boat and Clarke Quay entertainment and restaurants - the latter of which is an absolute gastronomic fantasy - you name the cuisine, it's there. Close to Chinatown and numerous food courts for local Singaporean cuisine. For runners, Fort Canning Park and Clarke Quay make great routes in the morning because it's not crowded. The gym is open 24 hrs a day and stocked with enough to keep you fit on the road. The spa treatments are pricey but well worth it - can't miss the Auyrvedic treatments!Senior and managerial staff are professional and were very responsive to our booking situation despite its complexities - even when there was a wedding event!Cons: A bit far from Little India. The pool atmosphere is a bit crowded during the day - night hours should be extended. Internet access is not free in the rooms and rather pricey, but one can access wifi throughout Singapore. Business customers may find that the internet access is not convenient and expensive. Regular check-in staff needs a lesson in professionalism from Senior and Management.Overall, this was a great hotel that really added a lot of value to our Singapore experience. We would definitely stay with them again on a future visit!

<Content>Is promising, but... Had a 2-day stay in this location couple weeks earlier. The location of this hotel is great - near the bar/clubs/restaurants opposite, easy access to MRT, and close to the city center. In the morning you can have a fresh walk to the Chinatown which is just around 10 minutes.Service-wise the reception desk is alright and getting the key was no difficulty. But later when I checked in I realized the room was a 2-bed room instead of a 1-bed room, the one I requested. I understand that in busy days these requests might not be met, but can you tell me while I get my key? Later I phoned down they said well all the king rooms are booked and there's no guarantee that I could get one next day. I've been to many hotels in my lifetime this is one of the few world-class hotels that you cannot specify which bed you want. Yes the reservation did tell me the room is subject to availability, but I do think many want to know in advance whether the room requested is available (whether it's the bed type, or smoking/non-smoking). The next day I did get to switch to a king-bed room, which I had to phone and re-ask for it. Everything else in this hotel is good: service, cleanliness, bathroom etc. But I don't think I'll stay again at a hotel where I cannot guarantee I'll have a good sleep in a large bed.

<Content>Relaxation at its best The wonderful service and relaxed atmosphere made this a lovely hotel in which to spend the last 3 nights of our 5 week holiday (mainly in Australia). Our superior room was large and very comfortable even though the view was uninspiring. The whole hotel is immaculately clean, and the staff were all wonderful. Buffet breakfast was the best we had all holiday and pretty good value at about 拢12 each. The gym and pool are lovely; location, just opposite Clarke Quay, is excellent. We hope to return soon.

<Content>Certainly not a luxury hotel as promised Early August I stayed here four nights. The room was booked directly on the hotel chain鈥檚 website and I took the 'Swiss Business Advantage' offer that was being promoted with amenities such as internet access and I believed that I would have free internet access. When I checked-in I was first surprised and then annoyed to find that I had to pay a considerable amount of money to obtain daily internet access in my room. I complained the following day and the hotel agreed to compensated me in full.Swiss么tel Singapore is sold as a luxury hotel ideally located close to entertainment and dining hotspots such as Clarke Quay, Boat Quay and Chinatown. Well, it is not much of a luxury hotel; rooms are rather boring, the restaurants uninspiring and much of the staff are workers from China that barely speaks English. The most relaxing spot is sadly a dark lobby bar next to a busy lift corridor but the air-conditioning in this area wasn鈥檛 working properly so it was very hot and stuffy. Afternoons and evenings this area was filled with tourists that had checked out and were killing time before going to the airport. The location of the hotel is good and close proximity of the MRT to the hotel makes Orchard Road and the financial hub at Raffles Place, within easy reach.The 24-hour gym is a great feature and the gym is large and well equipped.

<Content>Looking a little tired, but a good place to stay My wife and I recently stayed at the Swissotel Merchant Court for two nights as a stop off on our return trip to Australia from Europe. Check in was painless with the front desk staff friendly. All the staff in the hotel were extremely friendly and courteous. Our room wa situated on one of the extreme corners of the hotel, which seemed like a mile from the lifts and needing to go up and down some stairs to get there. That aside, our room was very comfortable and spacious with a good view over the nearby river and outdoor restaurants on either side of the waterway. Why do these hotels charge such exorbitant prices for the stuff in the mini bar? The buffet breakfast was very good. The restaurant and other public areas are showing their age but this does not necessarily detract from the hotel itself.Overall we had a very enjoyable stopover in a pleasant hotel, close to China town, shops and restaurants. If you want to go to Orchard Road, you will need to get a taxi..but they are cheap.

<Content>Great location This is a great hotel. Superb location if you're on holiday and want to get to lots of places quickly and easily. For instance, the riverfront areas are right there, China town is 10 minutes walk, Clarke Quay is right next door and Little India is 30 minutes walk.Other good points: The rooms are very comfortable and the interior of the hotel is nice. The pool is great, especailly for kids and the view over Clarke Quay is nice as well.Only negative is price of breakfast which seemed disproportionately high compared to other aspects of the hotel. Taxis are very cheap in Singapore so the fact that the nearest MRT is not a 'hub' is not a deterrent to staying here at all.

<Content>above average international blah hotel This is a big, beige international hotel. That said, it's quite good at it. It's in a really terrific location, right on the river and a very short walk to heaps of dining, entertainment and the metro. The rooms are like rooms are, but pristine and with most facilities.It's got a great pool and a gym I didn't try, and breakfast is included in the tariff I believe.

<Content>Loved this hotel Hotel is an oasis of calm. Lovely pool area overlooking Clarke Quay and really clean and tidy rooms and public areas.Staff were very helpful, breakfast was huge and hotel is within walking distance of lots of bars and restaurants on both Clarke and Boat Quay. Easily able to walk to Fullerton and Merlion from the hotel.Would really recommend. Perfect for 3 day break with my husband. Spent a couple of days touring the city and one chilling by the pool.Excellent!

<Content>Short and Sweet Stayed here for one night and wish we had more. Great location and right across the road from a massive shopping centre and the quay where there are loads of restaurants and funky little bars. The rooms were very nice with all the mod cons, including coffee machine and flat screen TV, alarm clock that wakes you to your own ipod!!would stay here again

<Content>Absolute luxury My daughter recommended this hotel and what a great choice. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to return. We booked not realising that it was Singapores 43rd birthday on the day we arrived and the concierge arranged for us to watch the fire works from the executive lounge. The staff were so helpful and the rooms were absolutely perfect. The pool area was excellent and everything you could ask for. Right on the doorstep was Clarke quay, plenty to do and covered from any unexpected rain with huge umbrellas. we visited the Singapore flier (well worth it at 29 Singapore dollars each. Half an hour in the air and fabulous views). We also went to Sentosa and filled a couple of hours seeing the sights there. Then to the zoo. and the next morning to Jurong Bird Park. you can save money by getting tickets for two or three of the parks together. Taxis were easy to get and relatively cheap. Nowhere was very far away and we made the most of our 3 days in singapore. what a great place. That was our first visit but definitely noe our last and the swissotel at merchant court will be where we are staying. Thank you to hotel staff for making it a memorable stay!!!

<Content>Loved This Hotel We (myself and my 7 year old daughter) stayed here for 1 night on the way home from Europe. I was very impressed - fantastic location with everything on your doorstep, amazing pool area (which my daughter did not want to leave), wonderful rooms, lovely buffet breakfast and great service. The Concierge staff were particularly helpful with any queries and local knowledge. Would highly recommend and will be back on my next visit to Singapore. We also visited the Zoo, which was well worth the effort on a very hot humid Singapore day (cost about $20 Singapore dollars each way by taxi).

<Content>excellent This hotel is simply great, staff is extremely kind and charming, rooms are beautiful and extra clean, the spa is great maybe a little bit overpriced and the swimming pool area is unbeliavle. I go often in Singapore and I can truly say that is the best hotel I've stayed in.

<Content>Would stay there again - its fine We stayed at Merchant Court Swissotel, after a week in London. And found the place just fine. Staff at checkin were great, room was a little smaller than expected, but the bathroom made up for it compared to what we had in London.Location is next door to Clark Quay MRT and easy walking distance to China Town, and both Clark Quay  Riverside shops and restruants. We had no problems getting around from here. And enjoyed our stay.Would stay here again. Check out time is noon - but we paid extra to leave at 4pm.

<Content>Others could be better In stead of Swissotel the Stamford, I mistakenly booked this hotel.Even I paid for executive room, the rooms seemed small compared to others similar standard hotel, anyway it is still comfortable to overnight for single person.The location is not bad, as it is located on Clarke Quay, and walking distance to Clarke Quay MRT station. However, it is not perfect when u want to go others place. As Clarke Quay Station is not a main interchange, you will have to go to next station to change MRT line, that is very time consuming.In summary, it is good for totally relaxing trip, where u just lay in the hotel for most of the time. However, if you are on biz or on the move to visit whole singapore, you have something to pay. I will prefer Swissotel the stamford in stead.

<Content>Service worst than McDonald in the US Service is very poor. When I arrived at the counter at about 1:30pm, the room was not ready despite requesting for early check-in during reservation on the website. I was told that it will be about a 2 hours wait. OK when to get a bite and came back 2 hours later. Approach the front desk again and was rudely informed to go sit down while the room is being made. OK so I went to the sit down at the lobby. During this time, they knew that I was waiting and a huge crowd shows up to check-in. When the crowd was gone and about 1/2 hour later, I approach the front desk again and this time the key was ready. I was so mad as they knew that I have been waiting. They did not bother to call me up to finish the paper work. In the US, when you order the food at MaDonald's, when they could only fill portion of your order, they will bring the rest of the food to you at the table. This hotel don't even bother to inform me when they are ready, despite knowing that the customer is waiting. That is the least a paying customer can expect. What a lousy service!!!Also, the room is tremendously small compared to Fairmount Plaza at City Hall (which has very good service), where I was fortunate to stay after this bad experience at Merchant Court.DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL!!!

<Content>5 star facilities/ smaller hotel feel We arrived in Singapore from Europe. No hotel booked. Found this in the Tripadvisor bible and booked it at last minute rates. Stayed 4 nights and were sad to leave. Not too ritzy; just relaxing. Great position in the heart of everything. It's big and has all the 5 star facilities but the clever horseshoe shape and low rise give it a protected intimate feel. Floating in the pool with it's endless edge overlooking the Singapore skyline was magnificent. Didn't have our kids with us this time but it would be excellent for that. As you'd expect, food and bev at poolside is a killer but nice for something special....certainly better than Jumbo Seafood on the river (avoid at all costs!)

<Content>stop over break We stayed at the Swissotel Merchant Court in Singapore, on route to Australia at the end of March, having decided to have a two night stay. It was a super hotel, very stylish, nothing was too much trouble, we ate in the hotel restaurant on our first night which was excellent. The staff and ambience were superb, we would definately stay at this hotel again

<Content>Excellent hotel! This was my second stay at the Swisshotel in Singapore and I would definitely return! The staff are extremely professional and make you feel welcome from the moment you exit the taxi. We got upgraded to one of the executive rooms on the 10th floor upon our arrival, but we asked to be moved on the 3rd night as we were directly under the lounge and the early morning noise wasn't pleasant! We were moved immediately to another room and the receptionist sent the concierge up to help us move. This did not upset our stay!The rooms are very tastefully decorated. The hotel is in a great location and all the restaurants can be reached within walking distance. The AMRITA spa is wonderful. I would recommend the Top to Toe package. I would go back just for the spa!They have recently opened a shopping mall directly across the road - if you love shopping, spend a few hours exploring the dainty little shops in this mall! It's called CENTRAL. If you love shoes and bags (like me), you are in the right place! They also have lots of mini-spas or beauty salons in the mall, I haven't tried any of them, but they are there if you decide against using the hotel spa (not advisable :-)). There is a fantastic Chinese restaurant in the basement of the mall across the road. It's called DA PAI DANG, they have great food at really good prices. Lovely staff also. We had breakfast in the hotel two mornings. You can get an all you can eat buffet for 39 Singaporean dollars. Get there early and fill up on the great food that they have to offer. If you are a lover of dim sum and local food, definitely pay a visit to the food hall in the basement of the Paragon mall. The restaurant is called TASTER FOOD PTE LTD. It is an experience that you will not forget. The Paragon mall is also great for shopping - you can take a taxi from the Swissotel. Taxis are extremely cheap in Singapore and are all air conditioned.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Singapore - it is always a pleasure to stay there!

<Content>4 Day Getaway Clean and comfortable room at a nice hotel with a great location across from Clark Quay and a short walk to Boat Quay. No complaints. The sevice was excellent. My only comment for perfection is that the hallway carpets need updating. The location really made the stay perfect for my girlfriend and me. I'd definitely recommend the Swisshotel Merchant to a friend as a **** alternative in Singapore.

<Content>Very Good Option For Business and Relaxation This was my first stay at Swissotel Merchant Court, and certainly not the last. Check in was very good, pleasant arrival - reception employees were very helpful and attentive - room designed with good workspace, and fast internet connection. Large outside pool, very natural and relaxing area. The fitness area was great - many choices of machines and one can use it for 24 hours. Breakfast offered many choices - will certainly try to return to this hotel when am back in Singapore.

<Content>Excellent Service and Great Location Really enjoyed our stay at Swissotel Merchant Court!The location is great, next to Clarke Quay, with all the bars and restaurants, and the pool area is wonderfull for relaxation. My wife had a massage, and found it to be the best ever.All employees were friendly and nice - the hotel does some kind of refurbishment during the day, but we were mostly out during the day.

<Author>AussieReviewer
<Content>Not Up To Expectations I recently had a family (2 adults, 2 kids) holiday in Singapore and decided that Swissotel Merchant Court would be a great place to spend the final night. The agent I had booked through told me that a deluxe room would be suitable for a family.I found the staff a little unfriendly and uninterested during the long check in. As soon as I saw the room I noticed that it only had two double sized beds. The staff assured me that they were queen sized (they were not) but even two queens would not have been suitable for a comfortable night. When I requested a folding bed I was told that this would cost an additional $80. I then spoke with the hotel duty manager and requested our money back so that we could go to another hotel. He mentioned that we could only do this by speaking with our agent (not possible on a Sunday!). We were therefore unable to change hotels even though I asked to leave before we settled in the room. As compensation, he offered a 10% discount on the cost of the folding bed (a total of $8). I would rather have spent this discount on a cab fare to another hotel.This was our 2nd holiday in Singapore within a year and the 3rd hotel that we have tried there. I have nothing but praise for the other 2 hotels but Swissotel, given the price and reputation, was disappointing. Great location, large room, average service, long check in/out, slightly shabby corridors and renovations were taking place during our stay. $12 for 2 bottles of water. Had to ask 3 times for enough towels.This is the first time I have ever been motivated enough to write a hotel review. Could be a nice place but the management fell well below our expectations.

<Content>Paradise Had a 3 night stopover and must say the hotel was brilliant.For some reason we were given the honeymoon treatment with fresh fruit etc. a lovely surprise. The room had just been renovated and we were one of the first to stay in it. Beautiful decor and great views from the 3 windows in the room!!Staff were helpful but the breakfasts were a bit expensive. Location is brilliant, right next to the bustling Clarke Quay with its many bars and restaurants. I would thoroughly recommend the hotel.

<Content>Good Location We stayed a week and had booked a Dble room, but were given a twin, when asked for a Dble we were told maybe could be available the next day, so didn't bother. We had room 488, carpet was very badly stained and a musty smell in room our entire stay. Ice Machines leaked onto carpet and had towels moping them up. The room itself was quite good, although didn't have views over the pool or Clarke Quay. Location was very good, taxi's always available. Breakfast was excellent. Staff very good. As we arrived off a Cruise about 10a in the morning our room wasn't available until after 1p, so that was a bit of a pain. Probably would not stay there next year as felt it was a bit below standard.

<Content>It's worth asking for a specific room! En route from Sydney to London, we decided to break our trip with a 24-hour stopover in Singapore. We were scheduled to arrive into Singapore quite late at night, so we knew we wanted a hotel where we could count on good service whatever the time of day.The Swissotel Merchant Court exceeded all our expectations -- we were in room 589, which is literally a stone's throw from Clarke Quay. Along with its neighbour, 590, it has a small balcony with table and chairs, and you really feel as if you're in the heart of the city.The staff are excellent -- courteous, obliging and well-informed -- and the quality of the furnishings in both the public areas and the rooms is very high.The outdoor pool, which is in the middle of the U-shaped building, is a real jewel -- floating on your back looking up at the Singapore skyline is an experience not to be missed. We'll be back to the Merchant Court next time we're in Singapore -- and we'll be asking for either 589 or 590!

<Content>Disappointing We stayed here in February initial impression on arrival was very good, but it went down hill when we got to our room, we had a view of a building complex approx 20ft away, single beds and the overall standard of the room was poor, not very clean and a strong musty smell, after complaining to a less than helpful receptionist we were moved a few doors down to another room (passed a water leak that was just covered in bath towels that did not seem to be getting sorted just more towels added to try and soak up the water) this second room was a little better but well below the standard of a 4 star hotel, On the positive side the breakfast was first class but this alone would not be enough to make me return, sorry Swissotel Merchant Court but you need to get that refurb rushed along!

<Content>Reliable - good 4 star option This was my second stay within 12 months at this hotel. Admittedly I booked it because it was the one of the cheapest and best options available to me. The Singapore Airshow was on - which means that hotels are running at 95%+ full - so the rates relect that. I paid $350++ SGD which converted to $411 AUD. this is not cheap and you could normally stay at the best hotel intown for this price - but rooms were really at a premium. I guess what I am saying is BOOK AHEAD!The hotel is very well located - on a MRT station (cheap and so easy to use this transport), and is also on the river at Clarke Quay - so there are plenty of dining and touristy options for you. There is also a shopping centre next door - great for quick lunch, or some retail therapy - I can also recommend the pedicure at the Anthony hair salon.The room was a bit daggy - but very clean, with all that you need, and a large bathroom.There was a note saying that the hotel was doing a refurb - which I guess it needs decor wise - but I didn't hear any noise. One bonus was that I was able to check in at 10am and sleep off some jet lag. Check out was 12noon - but extended to 1pm.Staff were very friendly and helpful.Pool and spa were both very good.I would recommend this hotel to all - the rooms aren't super flash - but the room size, staff, location etc all make this a really great option - cheaper than orchard area too.

<Content>Adequate and Well Located This is a good hotel in a very nice and upmarket area near Clarke Quay and Raffles Place. You can walk from the hotel to those places, and it is, unless you are in the city for the shopping, a much more attractive area than Orchard Rd.This is a 4 star property. It fits well in this category. The rooms are sufficiently spacious. Bathroom is good. Breakfast more than well provided, and the service good and without too much fuss. I would recommend it to a business traveller and for a short stopover.Internet access is good but expensive. $30 SGD per day is becoming excessive. If they don't charge to use the televsion why internet. If there is a charge made to the hotel, it should be absorbed in the room charge, or else passed on at cost. This of course applies to most hotels in Singapore and elsewhere. Ultimately, there is no extra cost for a hotel to charge for wi fi use on an unsecured network because there is no extra cost for the hotel in providing the service. As an experienced traveller, this is getting out of hand, and a hidden cost not disclosed to the traveller. Hotels should start being upfront about this because it is misleading advertising. 80% of business travellers need to use their laptops, and there is a difference if a hotel makes internet use complimentary (there are some) and those hotels which charge up to $30 for the privilege. Having made that general point, the Swisshotel Merchant is highly recommended in the 4 star category. Very adequate.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location, but service a little disappointing I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and had a standard room with an adjoining kids room. The kids room is reason enough to recommend the hotel to families with small children. My boys were delighted with the little touches like the kids bed linen, kid size table and kid towels. The water slides at the pool were also popular with the children, The hotel is conveniently located at Clarke Quay, a vibrant and bustling area by the Singapore River and we enjoyed sitting on the steps by the river every evening watching the boats. It is also located next to an MRT (subway) station and across from a large shopping mall. If, like me, your package does not include breakfast, don't fall into the trap of having breakfast at the hotel as it costs a LOT. I had breakfast there the first day, before I got my bearings, as I was discinclined to drag my young children around looking for breakfast at 8.30 in the morning. The shopping mall across the street (Central) has various coffee and breakfast outlets (Starbucks, etc.) and you can also pick up essentials at the supermarket at Liang Court, across the river. The most offputting thing about the hotel was the concierge, who were invariably cold, unhelpful and couldn't manage a smile between the lot of them. I suspect that it may have been because I was perceived as a local (I am a Malaysian living abroad) and thus not deemed worthy of their attention. Basic information about the surrounding area and some tourist attractions had to be prised from them. Having said that, housekeeping was outstanding, and a very pleasant babysitter was available for 2 of the 3 nights that I was there. If you're looking for a hotel located outside the madness of the Orchard Road area, and have young children I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Swissotel Merchant Court - Comfort, Convenience and Value We spent a very pleasant weekend at the Swissotel Merchant court. I booked the room through the swissotel.com website, which was extremely convenient as unlike other hotels, booking with them directly truly does guarantee the best rate possible, and they show the cost in it's entirety, service charges and taxes included. Always remember to check the promotions/tie-up link from the site - I booked the promo rate for Premium Mastercard holders, which was an excellent, excellent value - a room upgrade, late checkout up to 4 pm, breakfast included. Be sure though to printout the hotel's confirmation of your rate and amenities and present it when you check in. The people manning Reception were unaware of the promotional rate and the inclusions, and they tried to initially place us in a non-upgraded room. I paid for a Swiss Business room, so according to the promo we should be placed in the next category, which was on the Executive Floor.When I pointed out the upgrade indicated on my printout, they said okay, we'll put you in a Swiss Business room with two double beds, and I had to insist that their website indicated that the next category was actually an Executive floor room. The only other kink in an otherwise excellent stay was that it turned out the Executive Lounge was closed for renovation - NOT mentioned on the website, but there was a letter of explanation from the GM in the room. The Lounge amenities (buffet breakfast served there, evening cocktails as well) had been a major selling point for me as I did not want to battle the crowd at the coffee shop in the mornings. Thankfully the hotel was not too busy during our stay, so breakfast at the coffee shop was still comfortable with an area set aside just for Executive floor guests, and cocktails were still served in the lobby / cafe area. ROOM- We stayed on the top floor of the hotel, the 12th floor, which is one of their Executive Floors. It was very spacious and newly renovated, very, very clean. Tasteful Western decor. Windows along an entire wall, with heavy floor-to-ceiling blackout drapes. It had a foyer, desk, king-sized bed, bathroom with tub and rainfall shower head, spacious closet with an iron and ironing board, Lavazza coffee machine, waffle cotton robes, hairdryer, weighing scale, safe, slippers, in addition to all the usual amenities. The mattress was excellent, and the pillows! Fabulous. They even offer a choice of the pillow-type - if I recall correctly, memory foam, feather, hypoallergenic fill. Nice, good quality linens with a duvet. A generous four pillows were provided, with an extra one tucked away in the closet. I did find the Welcome Fruit Plate a little amusing as it was composed of two green apples. I suppose I'd expected a little more exotic than apples. They did tell us there was ongoing construction on the floor below us but we never heard any noise. Very minor quibbles - room was obviously new but the contractor for the refurbishing may messed up a little - grouting in the shower area was not done neatly, and the ceramic wall tiles were wavy and probably not the highest quality. Even with the glass enclosure shut, the entire bathroom floor gets wet when showering. Also because of the way the sliding doors on the closet were configured, the drawer could not be opened fully. BREAKFAST/ FOOD - A generous spread with everything you could possibly want : hot and cold cereals, bread variety, fruit juice station, fresh fruit, egg station, pancakes and french toast, sauteed vegetables, congee, noodles, sausages, bacon, coldcuts, cheeses, yogurt.... so much of it you couldn't possibly try it all. Our rate also offered an a la carte breakfast up to 2 pm for late-risers.Complimentary evening cocktails and canapes if you stay on an Executive floor.LOCATION- Has an MRT station right next to the hotel, taxis always available out front. This hotel is in the Clarke Quay /riverside locale, which is a nice area to walk around in at night. Just across the street is the Central shopping mall, a mid-sized center with many food and retail outlets. Cab from the airport on a Saturday morning was 18 Singapore dollars, to the airport on Monday afternoon was 14.40.SERVICE - Always extremely courteous and pleasant staff, despite the little bit of confusion when we checked in. And as already mentioned, being able to book directly with the hotel's website with a price-matching guarantee is a huge convenience. Kudos in particular to the wonderful coffee shop wait staff! I would definitely stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Quite shabby for a four star hotel Stayed for two nights in January 2008 on the way back to London from Sydney. The bottom line is that the hotel is passed its sell by date. There is a distinctly 1980s feel to the whole place. My room (387) was small and cramped with two single beds. Would not stay here again.

<Content>Lovely Hotel Great Location We Stayed at this hotel on our way back from a trip to Australia and were pleasantly surprised. Ok the rooms are a little tired and the hallways on the room flooors are in need of refurbishment but that is exactly what the hotel is addressing.Refurbishments and uprgrading are underway with - as we experienced - no disturbance to guests at all.The location of the hotel is superb and over looks Clark Quay which has great restaurants, bars and has a real buzz about it. Close to Chinatown and lots of new shopping areas. The staff at the hotel were friendly and very helpful at all times. Great buffet breakfast, lovely spa and a nice restaurant poolside which served great food. Definately recommend this hotel and will stay there again next time we hit Singapore.

<Content>A good base and great value We stayed here in December and January either side of our trip to Australia. The location is good and the addition of the new central shopping centre opposite is very handy. We had received a letter to say there was a rolling refurbishment going on but we were not aware of any noise from this. Both the rooms we had were spacious, clean andcomfortable and although a little tired it was not an issue. The staffwere very efficient and helpful. We had room service breakfast which was excellent and the same price as the restaurant downstairs so no need to shower, dress and rush down. As nothing gets going until mid morning it was nice to relax and ease ourselves in to the day.The location is so convenient for all that Clarke Quay has to offer for an evening out. We didn't feel the need to look elsewhere for restaurants as there is such a variety there. Taxis are very reasonable and availabe from outside the door. We went to the botanic gardens, orchard road, raffles, sentosa (by monorail) over both stays.All in all a good base at a very reasonable price and once the rooms are updated it will be even better.

<Content>Pleasantly Surprised Had chosen this hotel from previous comments, photos and having once visited while on business. Since this was my honeymoon, was constantly checking the comments on trip advisor and so was very aprehensive. What a lovely surprise! I cannot find fault anywhere, we had a great stay. The room was spacious and well maintained by house staff, even for those of us who have a penchant for pillows. Such a great bathroom, with a most welcoming showerhead, a heated mirror that doesn't fog up and a great angled magnified mirror for shaving and makeup. Breakfast was busy, but always plenty of food. Staff were always friendly, no matter from which department. My one only fault would be that they need further product knowledge as far as tours are concerned. Buy hey, that is not their forte so at least they knew something. MRT on the door stop, shuttle bus always on time, shopping centre and Clarke Quay just around the corner, what more could you want?

<Content>okay but what out with the renovation Second stay at the merchant court, stayed for three days around New years eve. The hotel is basically okay but the room decor a little tired, as a result the hotel is undergoing renovation. WQe booked the hotel well in advanced requesting a double room and a single, first problem, no double room near the single. So they suggested a room on the 9th floor. Room fine initially, but the fumes from the renovation on floor 11 strated to drift down later in the afternoon, making a terrible smell. So requested a change a room, Third room not quite so good, but at least no smell. Staff friendkly and helpful, but would advise checking where the rennovation is happening when you get your room. Breakfast akthough pricey is good and we al generally enjoyed our stay

<Content>Good Experience Stayed here for 3 nights. Initially after I read some of the reviews posted here, I was a bit skeptical. But I had a good experience. Although in Singapore, my stay at Marina Mandrain and Pan Pacific were a much better experience. I have a weekness for hotels with atriums and hotels that have a lot of people in the lobby. This hotel was very quite....not too many people in the lobby. They could do better with the guys who stand at the door. They just point you to the reception but don't even offer to carry your bags. The hotel is old but clean. The furnishing and the room colour scheme is a bit out dated. But the rooms are spacious. The bathroom was big and clean. The cleaning guy was excellant. Can't say much about the food. Ordered fish  chips but it was too oily. All in all, I had a good stay and it was a value for money deal.

<Content>Greatbreakfast. Quiet. Close to MRT Wow. I was traveling for work and the travel agent booked this. The hotel was clean, very close to Clarks Quay for food and 30 secs from an MRT station. Staff pleasant and courteous.My room was a good size and very clean. Lovely big bed. Plenty of towels and nice smelling stuff to wash the travel stains away. I was warned there might be construction noise when it was booked but there were no porblems and it was very peaceful.Breakfast was included and very good food. I ate a lot and went back for thirds. Lots of fresh fruit as well as all the usual.It irks me that internet is not free in places like this. Goodness it doesn't really cost anything to provide and it is nice to check email.One weird thing was that they tried to charge me for some pringles from the minibar only 3 mins aftre I had left the room. I didn't even open the minibar and I wondered how they could possibly know anyone had taken anything that quickly.If I was running a hotel like this in Singapore I reckon a useful add on would be access to showers for guests who have checked out but are not leaving till later in the day. I had a late afternoon flight and by the time I went back to get my bags I was dripping with sweat. A quick shower before jumping on the plane for 12 hours would have made me feel better.I don't think I could afford to stay if I was paying but it was nice to have some luxury.

<Content>Rude deskstaff, sub-standard rooms The lobby might have rated four stars, but the rest of the hotel was poky and run-down. Stains on the walls, broken furniture, dirty windows. The desk staff were unfriendly and there was lots of noise. The location is good.

<Content>Unsmiling front desk staff,room safe did'nt work Ok overall I guess.Two problems 1.My room safe was not working and it took them several hours to repair it. 2.Unsmiling front desk staff particularly on checkout at 6 am on 17th Nov.They do not smile at you.In fact they looked like guards at a Soviet facility.And were quite slow.The concierge on 16th night was very sweet and helpful.Some of the bellboys just looked coldly at you like cops if you approched them.Some were friendly.Also the electric kettle in the room didn't work properly-it had a very loose power socket and the cord was too short.One of the phones in the room didn't work.Front desk does not pick up the phone for ages when called but the operator is kind enough to take a note and pass on the message to them.Location is great.The staff need to be taught to smile-it is the least I expect in a 4 star hotel and more care is needed in maintaining the room fittings.I would probably stay here again if the price is right but the hotel doesn't give me that warm friendly feeling.

<Content>Noise Problems Our stay at the Merchant was spoilt by excessive noise particularly on a Saturday night. We had booked a (Business Executive) with small balcony overlooking the river. Rooms were miniscule compared to Exec Rooms at other Hotels we have stayed in, so I would class as just adequate. Certainly no frills for the extra dollars.We were there for 10 days and hit the Oktoberfest which was noisy but not a problem as they seemed to wind up each night about midnight and with curtains drawn was not a concern even on their last night so no complaints about that, it was fun to listen to. The problem was the many many nightclubs and bars which are growing at a rapid pace along the Quay area.I think this is going to be a major problem for the Hotel as after a couple of TOTALLY sleepless nights both Friday and Saturday, I was ringing around by 7 am on the Sunday morning trying to find alternative accomodation. I had actually given up trying to sleep by 4 am. and went down to do washing/drying and ironing to get away from all the yahooing and screaming, from the young people (the bungee was still operating at 4 am. plus the live bands and constant thump of music from the nightclubs was unbearable. There were young people actually passed out on the walls of the bridge and others running up and down them until well after 5 am. shouting and yelling. In fact I can honestly say that after 8 trips over the last 20 odd years this was the first time we have witnessed drunken, rowdy and unruly behaviour. We have stayed 3 times at the Merchant and although only a *** star hotel I have mentioned on the list before that it has been worth it for the location/pool area and we have never had a problem with staff, but sadly this will be our last stay.Let me be clear that I am not blaming the Hotel in anyway for the noise problem, after all they can't do much about it. After talking to reception people, and advising them that we were going to be moving hotels, they did everything they could and managed to change us to another room on the 12th floor and whilst not nearly as nice a view at least we managed to get good sleep for the rest of our stay. There were several people complaining so we were not alone.The staff were all fine and we have no complaints about how we were looked after.I agree with other reviews on the list, the Hotel is now well past its use by date and the only thing going for it was the location. Yes the CENTRAL shopping centre is just across the road and yes has heaps of Japanese Restaurants if you happen to like Japanese food, however some sections of the CENTRAL S/Centre are just about an arms length of some of the hotel rooms. Wonderful view facing white glass and concrete walls if you are allocated one of those rooms!!!With everything changing now around the Clarke Quay area this has now become a Mini Teenage Yuppie Disneyland, all the old ambience of the river is now gone as the upmarket cafes, bars, restaurants have taken over. Mups

<Content>Central location and comfortable This hotel is located is close to everything and reasonably priced. Breakfast is great if not a little expensive but worth the effort. We were travelling with 3 school aged children who also enjoyed their stay at this hotel. The pool is very pleasant in the hot humid weather of Singapore and was used by our children. They have guestroom to refresh yourself if you arrive very early (as we did at 6.30am) if your room is not available. We had showers, stored our luggage and off we went to explore Singapore. Our rooms were ready upon our return. Highly recommended

<Content>Time for a facelift! My last visit to the Swissotel Merchant Court was about 2 years ago and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. This time, sad to say, the rooms are in need of refurbishment. It's still a lovely hotel overall but the rooms look a little worn down and it's a tad evident that it's gone past its prime. Just a fresh coat of paint and a quick change of the linens and carpets might suffice, honestly.But the service is still warm and friendly. The breakfast buffet still great. And the location is FANTASTIC - right on the main stretch of Clarke Quay with its multitude of bars and restaurants. A new Japanese-esque mall called Central just opened next door and the Jap food can't be beat!

<Content>Perfect First trip to the far east so did not know what to expect, all I can say is it was great, great room  beds, easy walking distance to shops, bars  dining. If anyone moans about this hotel then they must be sad people. One drawback is, in Singapore wine is very expensive.

<Content>Not too bad, but... Stayed at the Merchant Court in September for 8 nights. Staff were friendly and efficient; rooms were ok (I changed from a single to a queen bed room) - but I have stayed in much better for the cost. Rooms were clean-enough; but as others have commented, need refurbishing. The one thing that I could not tolerate, though, was the lack of noise-proofing - the hotel must have been built on the cheap, I figure. You could easily hear people next door (talking at the top of their voices and 'carrying on') and people banging their doors all hours of the day/night. 'Hello' (dont people know how to open and close doors properly, so as not to cause a disturbance to others??).And as everyone else has said, good location, with shopping centre/MRT very handy opposite the hotel.

<Content>Very nice stay / good service Just returned from a very nice stay at Swissotel Merchant Court. It was the first time for us to stay in Singapore, and especially the service of concierge, reception, and the team overall was remarkable. One can even overlook Clarke Quay from the pool area, and it is a very relaxing atmosphere. They also offer a free shuttle bus during the day. We will certainly return to them the next. time.

<Content>Definitely won't stay there again Stayed at the Merchant Court for a business trip and haven't got many good things to say about the hotel I am afraid... The room was dark with a view on a wall, there was a stain on my bed cover, the bathroom sink was blocked and because the wardrobe door didn't close properly, they had to use slippers to block it, which meant some slippers were hanging out from the top of the wardrobe - you either had to put up with this ugly sight or put up with the wardrobe light being on all night because the door wouldn't close!When reporting the problems, the staff was courteous and tried to help, but really for the price paid you can get a much better hotel in Singapore - so unfortunately I will not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great value, great location! Just don't expect a view... Got a pretty good deal for a five-night stay here via an Expedia special rate. I was half-expecting some unforeseen hitches because of some of the traveler reviews here on Tripadvisor, but there were no problems at all. Check-in was pretty quick, but that may be because we arrived around midnight. Our room was not large but by no means cramped; the layout is very sensible and the ceilings high enough that claustrophobia wasn't an issue. As expected (I had asked reservations about this during booking) we had no view whatsoever -- our room was facing construction. This is perhaps why we got a good rate. The bathroom was very nice, quite spacious. Room A/C, lighting, and cable TV were good as well. Internet connectivity was availiable but I didn't use it on this trip. Staff were very friendly and helpful, in all areas. Housekeeping was very responsive to our requests, and the concierge lent us a couple of Swissotel umbrellas to help us brave the tropical downpour that came one day.Room service was prompt, the food very good and the prices not too exorbitant (I had an *excellent* cheeseburger here -- I know, I know, I should be sticking to great Singaporean food, but for a midnight snack it was terrific.)Location is EXCELLENT, especially if you're in Singapore to party and eat. Great places nearby (Clarke Quay is right behind the hotel!) and two convenience stores are just seconds away from the hotel in case you need some supplies in a jiff. Transportation is no problem. The hotel is directly at Clarke Quay MRT station, and taxis are plentiful and relatively affordable. Overall, I had a great experience here. The next time we return to Singapore, Swissotel Merchant Court will definitely be at the top of my hotel list.

<Content>Great Hotel, shame about the noise The location of the hotel is perfect, sat on top of the local MRT station which always runs on time and is so cheap. The concierge staff are friendly and efficient and took our bags to our room. The room itself was fine, we had a view over Clarkes quay and the swimming pool. Quite enormous infact with one large queen size bed. the bathroom was large too and very clean. The problem aside from building work across the street was the vicinity of the club scene which finishes at 4 am. We chose Singapore to break the flight to Australia but due to the eternal thumping of the music we never slept before 4am each night!I would stay in Singapore again but would not chose this hotel due to the music.

<Content>Great location, but thats it. If you want a great location - this is the place to stay. Right on top of Clark quay MRT and right next to Clark Quay and all ammenities. Thats about all I can say was good about our exprerience.We booked a double double room as we had our 10  11 yo with us. Now, this may be misscommunication with our travel agent, but I also did contact hotel prior who advised this room would be sufficient - it wasnt.Upon arriving at check in ( we had booked and paid 6 months prior) they got our reservation wrong. Had us in a room with 2 singles - despite it clearly being wrtitten on all our documentation. They then claimed to 'upgrade' us. HA HA two double beds in a single room - with 2 towels, two cups etc etc. Had to get extras sent up. Guess what - bought 1 towel and one cup.... yes had to get another of each. We contacted the staff and requested an addtional room/space. We made it quite clear we were willing to pay extra. My jusband said Now I'm not goping to have to chase you up every day about this? Not a peep out of them in the 4 days we were there. No call to say they were trying.The rooms themselves are quite dated and smelt musty - it's time to replace the daggy bedspreads guys. Although the bathrooms are very nice. With two double beds, we got the joy of 1 bedside table.The pool area is good for kids. Breakfast OK, althought poorly set up and constantly running into others. The service was average, particularly at checkin and check out. with the exception of the brilliant doorman who always went out of his way to help.I am generally very easy going about hotels (see our recent Movenpick review) and generally roll with the punches on minor problems. I can honestly say our experience at this hotel really put a dampner on the end of our otherwise great holiday.I will not stay at a Swissotel again

<Content>Decent The Merchant Court hotel, Singaporesounds better than it really is. When travelling around the world with some friends (all with children, some quality required) we chose this place because the pictures looked good; but it is like a Holiday Inn, very basic. Dont pay too much.At first we were given a hotel-room right next to a huge disaster - some extra water had risen to the rooms - and the noise was terrible. The others decided to stay there, but we told the staff that we just need a room with more space and no drying-process-machine next to your beds. And we were given a better room. BUT you just have to do all this by yourself.Nice pool, decent hotel. But only average, so do not pay too much. You shall get decent quality, though.

<Content>Average business hotel, poor Internet The Swissotel Merchant Road is a hotel pretty centrally located in Singapore, near the riverside and Clarke Quay and Riverside Point. The MRT (subway system of Singapore) is underneath the hotel, so it is a great place to start your day in Singapore.Checking in was fast and easy, reception is helpful in all questions you might have, although during my stay, they neglected some of the requests we made. The hotel room is convenient, with all the amenities you will probably need during your stay. Some rooms in the hotel are being renovated, which might create some noise, but with a letter in the room, it was announced. Nothing fancy though.Our rate didn't include breakfast, so I can't really comment on that. The outside pool on the second level isn't big, but with a nice view of the city. There is also a fitness room and a spa. The fitness room is well equipped for all your workout needs.There is wired internet available in the room, and if you opt to pay for this, you will also have wireless access in the main areas of the hotel. Internet access for 24 hours is quite expensive (30 S$) and performance is rather poor, the connection regularly resets and during peak times, the delay in response time is quite noticeable. This doesn't make a good experience. Concierge services are good, and helped us in booking restaurants. Late check-out is possible, but that comes with a charge. Checking out itself was fast and respectful (they give you time to actually read the bill), although they didn't make clear to me you'd had to check out at the Cashier's desk instead of reception, so I waited a mere 15 minutes in line at the reception to figure that out myself.All in all, an average hotel, I have had better experiences in Asia with regards to service, but besides the poor Internet connection a good hotel to stay at.

<Content>Great stopover hotel with children, late checkout was free ! We stayed at Swiss hotel merchant court on our way out and our return from Australia. Our party was 2 adults and 2 boys age 7 and 4. Our stopovers were only for 24hrs , but each time the hotel let us check out late with no extra charge. Usual checkout was 12noon, and we stayed till 6pm going out, and 4pm on our return. They also opened the business centre especially for us on the Sunday when it is usually shut so I could check into my British Airways flight online.The food is very reasonably priced and the breakfasts the largest variety I have ever seen.As a family, I would reccomend the executive limosine service from the airport to your hotel. $35.00 flat rate in an air conditioned mini bus. Just pick one up as you arrive much cheaper than booking a transfer over here. Also a hint we took the kids booster cushions with us so they could use them on any public transport.The staff were very friendly at the hotel, and the service excellant, our room was large on both occasions with two 4ft six doubles. We just put the boys in together.Would definately use this hotel again, we booked through Trailfinders.

<Content>not 5 star My husband and I spent 3 nights at this hotel which is supposed to be 5 star but in reality i would say 3 - 4 star, the rooms smell musty and feel a bit damp. while we were there we were given a bill for using the inroom bar which we never used but were given no apology for their mistake, I agree the location is very good and this is why we chose to stay here,

<Content>Good Location and Service Room was excellent - very spacious. Staff were polite. Breakfast buffet amazing - but pricey and check out the view from the bar. The hotel is situated over a shopping centre - just across the road from Raffles Hotel - about 10 mins walk from Boat Quay or the MRT station is under the hotel.Decor and room amenities are excellent. Location is good also - although as I was on business - I didn't do much exploring. All in all a very good chain hotel. Chain hotels are good - in that you know what to expect - but they do lack character.

<Content>Very nice I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and amenities in a standard room. Travelling for business, the reservations are rarely in my control and this is an issue often, especially in a foriegn country. Swissotel was lo-key but the service was excellent, the staff was very kind and helpful. I had a great view of Clarke Quay. My favorite thing about the room was the drapes, they closed entirely, were thick and eliminated every ounce of light.

<Content>Excellent location We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Swissotel Merchant Court and would recommend the hotel to others. The location is fantastic at Clarke Quay and the MRT station is next door.We found the hotel staff to be very helpful and they were very accommodating when we asked if we could have two inter-connecting rooms. The rooms were very spacious and kept very clean.We would definitely stay at the hotel on our next visit to Singapore.

<Content>Top Stay at Merchant Court Great hotel, really enjoyed it. Booked a Club Room (this particular room had a balcony) on the 12th Floor overlooking Clarke Quay. Room rate included b/fast and pre-dinner drinks and cannapes. Room was excellent, clean and very comfortable. Hotel location is excellent....close to all the attractions and the CBD. Definately stay there again.

<Content>Lovely Hotel We stayed here as part of our honeymoon on the home home from Australia. On arrival we were greeted by a friendly recepionist who upgraded our room when told it was our honeymoon. We used the facilities at the hotel. The pool was lovely and my husband had a massage which was great.The clean your room every day and then turn the beds down at night. The room was spotless and the staff in the bar were extreamly friendly with us every night. Would stay here agian if iwas in the country.

<Content>A good place to stay in Singapore My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights in early July 2007. This is a good hotel, and we would stay there again and recommend it to others. Its location is excellent 鈥?probably the hotel鈥檚 best quality overall. It is immediately adjacent to the Clarke Quay MRT station, although it is initially somewhat difficult to find the hotel entrance when coming out of the station (a sign would help this). Convenient access to all of the restaurants and clubs in the Clarke Quay area, as well as Boat Quay and Chinatown.Staff very friendly, helpful and efficient. Rooms clean and comfortable - we stayed in a 鈥淪wiss Business Advantage Room鈥? which was quite spacious (although the carpets were very stained). The onsite self-service laundrette is also very convenient. The hotel has a 鈥渞esort鈥?feel to it and was almost entirely populated by vacationing families while we were there 鈥?not a negative thing, but business travellers and others might consider this, esp. as it has implications for noise and the level of activity at the pool area, etc Overall, however, a very good place to stay and good value, and we would certainly recommend it and stay there again.

<Content>There are many better hotels in Singapore! We stayed at the Merchant Court with two friends for 10 nights in June 2007. Fortunately the large building site directly opposite of the hotel entrance was close to be finished. There is a new shopping center, yes they are still building the upper floors of the adjacent skyscraper, but that does not cause too many trouble.Our rooms were small, not very elegant but clean, bathroom was okay. The Hotel has an official four-star rating, the rooms are more three-star, after my opinion. You always get the impression, that the hotel owner wants to save money, if it is in the bathroom, where the faucet has a water-saver or the hair-dryer has a power-save-button which you have to keep pressed all the time during hair-drying. This is not the style of a four-star-hotel. But the owners are swiss, these guys always knew how to save money and to leave their customers with the feeling of being cheated.Breakfast service was extremely poor on our first morning, table was not cleaned, we got coffee instead of tea, there was no refill and so on. After we complained about that at the reception, service became much better the next days. Breakfast itself was okay but nothing more than you would expect in a four-star hotel.You have to pay for the internet-access, which is also quite poor for a four-star hotel, but you should remember that this is a Swiss么tel, as I explained before.The only real positive thing about this hotel is the location directly opposite of newly renovated, stylish Clarke Quay. Chinatown can be reached by foot, also Boat Quay.To make it short: I would not recommend to stay at this hotel, for there are much better hotels in Singapore, even the other Swiss么tel The Stamford is better, our friends stood there for additional five nights. For a high-class experience I would recommend the hotels at Marina Bay - The Oriental, The Pan Pacific and the Marina Mandarin.

<Content>Looked good but shame about the rest! Arriving after an 18 hour flight at 10pm with bookings not only made but paid for many months previous and then treated as if we had just walked in off the street! We were asked if we wanted smoking or non-smoking when all this was pre-booked. We were then told there was only a twin room available when we had booked a double. I got out my papers and pointed out that we had a Superior room booked and was immediately told that Superior meant their STANDARD room. I think it was more the attitude that she had and she was definitely in the wrong job! She then proceeded and in our tired state we presumed she had indeed given us a double room. We arrived at the room to find it was a twin room. So my husband immediately rang asked for the duty Manager and told them to get it sorted out and hung up. Within 5 minutes they were back with a keycard to a double room, I wonder where they found that seeing as they didn't have any! So our stay started off badly and continued like that for 4 nights. The hotel is built around the pool and all day there is noise from children in the pool and at night from the bar and restaurant out there. We were woken up 3 times one night by wrong number telephone calls put through up until 2.15am. Breakfast was a disaster as it's all so badly arranged it seems crowded and you bump into people even when it's not. Chairs are far too low (and we are tall) for the tables. Food is very ordinary, bacon burnt to a crisp, not much choice of cereals or fruit. Tables are laid with not complete cutlery or serviettes missing and clean cutlery not available unless you get it off another table. Wait staff more interested in talking to each other than serving anyone. Went to look at the buffet one night and it was terrible so we didn't bother. Our actual room was OK (but noisy) and clean and bathroom was reasonable too. Long corridors to lifts. When we left we had a late flight and found the hospitality room was also the laundry and nowhere comfortable to sit! So we sat in the lounge in the foyer and found staff using this all the time to sit in and 2 of them were actually asleep in there! Management seems very slack to let standards reach these levels. Although it was convenient to Clarke Quay the food places there were overpriced and I think Orchard Road would have been better. The only saving grace of the hotel was the Concierge Department they were without fail very efficient and helpful. The hotel had a shuttle bus to Orchard Road and also another to Suntec and Raffles City but taxis are cheap anyway.

<Content>The best location in Singapore We stayed at the Merchant Court last week and it lived up to all of our expectations. The location is unbeatable and we found it so convenient to the MRT and great restaurants of Clarke and Boat Quays.We had a premier room with a balcony and if was really worth the extra. The hotel is due to undergo renovations this October to early next year and after that I think this hotel will be unbeatable.

<Content>Pretty good hotel depending on the room you get I stayed in this hotel about three years ago and thought it was excellent. This time I was initially disappointed, however they did resolve my issues, and I would recommend the hotel overall. When we arrived, the welcome was poor - nobody offered to help with bags, and the check-in was slow. The room we were given was supposedly an upgrade to the executive floor but it was like a shoe box with no view at all (the bed pretty much filled the room). The hotel was full that night, so we couldn't move then. However the next day we were moved to a much better, larger room with a great view over the pool and the city. The manager also apologised and we got complimentary breakfast and laundry service - a totally satisfactory response. Overall the hotel is pretty good, in a good central location near Clarke Quay (good for bars and restarants etc), and there is a really good outdoor pool area - excellent for refreshing after working or sightseeing in sticky Singapore.

<Content>Just above average (as usual) Just returned from yet another stay at the Merchant Court and I agree with all the people on here who writes that this hotel is ALL about location. The restaurants are average, the staff is average, the rooms are small (but comfy).... however it's still good value for money and that's why I keep coming back! Go there if you're after THE location!

<Content>Loved the location For a Singapore stopover this hotel has a great location. Set directly on the Singapore river at Clarke Quay you can step rightout into one of the main riverside dining areas of the city with a great choice of food and places to eat. Very close to bus routes and virtually on top uf the metro system, getting around could not be easier. As a hotel it is ok. but a bit dull. The pool too is ok but not exceptional. Staff fine. I have stayed here previously, so you may ask if it's not that good why go back. Simply the location. to sum up.Ok to sleep in, but eat out.

<Content>Great Stay at Swissotel Merchant Court We stayed at the hotel over Easter 2007. The level of service we received in our stay of 5 nights was excellent. We stayed in a standard room and found it to be well appointed. We had no noise from either other rooms or outside the hotel. Breakfast was great with a wide range of food available. We found the pool area and bar to be a real bonus. We would spend the middle of the day relaxing by the pool and had lunch at the pool bar/restaurant, which is an excellent escape away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. With Clarke Quay just across the river the hotel could not be better located. Also the large shopping centre next to the hotel has now opened so you can shop without having to travel to far (open until 10pm). We used the free hotel shuttle to Suntec  Raffles City. I would highly recommend this hotel to both couples and families (the pool has slides that will keep the kids happy!!).

<Content>Great Location Rooms are a bit small unless you take one on the corner with a balcony. It's a wee bit run down but is due (apparently) for a refurb in 2007. Excellent location however adjacent to Clarke Quay. Otherwise clean, and efficient.

<Content>Adequate Stay at Swissotel Merchant Court Singapore Recently stayed with husband and 2 children at the Swissotel Merchant Court Singapore for 3 nights. Hotel well located right next to Clarke Quay and the RMT station and just down the river from the busier more touristy Boat Quay. The rooms were adequate for a city centre hotel but a bit dated. Pool was smallish but fine for this kind of hotel and it had 2 slides which thoroughly entertained our kids. Sadly internet access not free which I think is terrible in a major hotel chain in a city. Baby sitting available but I thought a little on the expensive side. Beware though if sharing a room with your kids - we had booked a room with 2 beds and they were only doubles ie 4ft 6 inches. Having just stayed in Langkawi where we had Queen beds they felt very small and we didn't sleep nearly as well. A double is really too small for 2 grown adults to sleep comfortably. It's a pity as the room was plenty big enough to have Queen or even King beds. Overall adequate hotel well located but nothing to write home about.

<Content>Great location I stayed in this hotel for 4 days before Christmas 2005 with my daughters. We chose it for the excellent location because it is walking distance to the river and all the restaurants, easy walking distance to City Mall, Raffles Plaza etc. The rooms are a good size, if three people share a room you have to use existing bedding usually, which means two large queen size beds. The hotel is the only resort style hotel in Singapore with a large swimming pool and is ideal for families. The breakfast buffet is excellent. Service at the reception is mediocre but they are helpful if asked. There is a spa in this hotel. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a large, resort style hotel in a brilliant location. It is a 4 star hotel and well worth paying the extra. Stay away from Orchard Road where it is noisy and dirty.

<Content>Going Downhill We first stayed at the Merchant Court in Aug. 2003 at a very good price (just after Sars, business was bad!)  loved it, esp. the pool  the breakfast buffet. Not sure when SwissHotel took over, but it was some time thereafter.We've been back a couple of times since, but...BUT! We took my mother in law, in her 70s, there, Sept. '05, figuring we'd treat her to a nice place - oh dear... she and my husband arrived first, around 12.30pm and were told the room would be ready soon  were asked to wait in the not very well air conditioned lobby... they waited.. and waited.. and were finally shown to a room around 3pm - we had asked for connecting rooms for the 4 of us, but were only given neighbouring rooms- the whole point had been that our 4 year old could go to bed  the grown ups could retire to granny's room to chat, but still be able to keep an eye/ear out.Back to the lobby for another couple of hours while they cleaned connecting rooms! Day 1 in Singapore almost gone...After breakfast fast the next morning, back to the rooms - the key cards don't work! Housekeeping guy down the hall tries master key- no good - gets another guy.. and another... we retire to the lobby (again) - no one updates us, we keep going up to check, maintenance guy is there. Nothing happening. 4 year old is getting bored, granny needs to get to her pills - and what if we had a plane to catch?? So I finally spoke to the duty manager  no one had told the front desk, we'd been left sitting there like a bunch of lemons- he was very helpful- well, couldn't break the door down but at least he was nice  apologetic. Anyway. we got in the room after the whole key card system was reprogrammed, at 1230- THREE HOURS after b'fast! By this time the rain had started so the pool was no use. Half of day two wasted. (we only had 3 days!)We were offered a free buffet dinner in recompense but it was way too local fare for our older  younger members, so had to pass.Next morning breakfast was very crowded and although there were a couple of empty tables maybe they were very short staffed because we were asked to WAIT! We rather blew up and said That's all we've done since we got here! - they found us a table... (this place is very crowded on weekends... locals? Malaysian weekend trippers?)After getting back to the USA, granny wrote a very strong letter of complaint  the manager called her personally to apologise  sent flowers. We were also refunded a portion of our stay through the credit card  assured that we would be looked after next time- well, we wanted to give them a chance  contacted the manger the next time we went - our room was upgraded - just was well, as it poured the whole time so we spent a lot of time in that room! And there was a (false) fire alarm just as our daughter was falling asleep - bells ringing for about 20 minutes. Scary, while they checked to see if we needed to run like hell!But it is looking tired  needs some TLC- but the pool really is nice, location is great and the baby cribs are huge - at 4 our daughter still fit in comfortably. Not sure if we'll be back next month when we pass through again- looking at other options...

<Content>Good Location to anywhere Although there is a MRT (Clarke Quay) near this Hotel, you need to take NE line to Outram Park or Dhoby Ghaut first, and then you can take another MRT line. It will take a few minutes.However, this hotel still have a good locatioin because you can take a walk along the river and relax your mind. At night, you can see a beautiful night view.

<Content>Perfect Location I couldn't fault this hotel at all.! It offers the perfect location - MRT, around the corner, walking distance to Chinatown, convenient free shuttle to Suntec and Raffle City, and across the bridge from the Hippo Topless tour bus stop and bumboat cruise. In addition you have one of the main food streets overlooking the river. You would seldom need to use a taxi.I lived and worked in Singapore for 12 years in the late '80's and came back this time for a holiday. With so many hotels difficult to choose, but this one was a standout for location and service.Resort style pool., good size lobby lounge and good size standard rooms with A1 service.On call valet who always addressed you by name when answering the phone. That personal touch and the pleasant manner of the staff mad eour stay a very happy one despite the weather - heaviest rainfall in 75 years. I'm so pleased I've found a hotel to which I can return again and again without hesitation on subsequent visits to Singapore

<Content>Loved the Swissotel Merchant Court We booked our double SuperSaver room $180 SD per night for two nights about nine months ago from the hotel web site. After reading the reviews on TA written Oct/Nov, I became worried that the noise and shabby rooms experienced by some would be a problem, but because of other arrangements for tours made, we kept the reservation. I'm so glad we did. We had nothing but EXCELLENT service by staff from the moment we entered the hotel around noon December 21. We were greeted by the doorman and bellmen as we stepped out of the cab, went straight to check-in and asked the clerk nicely if we could have a very nice room (no extra charge) as it was our anniversary, non-smoking, and she gave us 806 (on the 8th floor of 12 total in the hotel). I immediately walked to concierge desk to ask for help--we needed a video camcorder cleaning tape and to have our city tour confirmed. The concierge within 10 minutes had name, address, walking directions and personal contact of a camera shop, and had our city tour confirmed. He couldn't have been nicer.The room was on the end, and as we walked in, there was a long, curving hallway with windows looking directly onto the construction site; the troom itself faced Clarke Quay, and the view was just wonderful because it wrapped more than 180 degrees. It had been completely refurbished; the huge shower was separate from the tub, all tile and marble; the bedroom was equipped with coffee maker, desk, great views. We had no problem with the noise, and we were in there during the day. The location is excellent to walk from to the Quay to eat, take a Singapore River cruise, catch the MRT or even walk easily to Raffles and its shopping center.The large restaurant had excellent breakfast and lunch buffets, including a wide variety of delicious choices, at $24 US for breakfast and $28 US for lunch, as I recall. The service was outstanding, and it was packed with visitors and office workers having their holiday parties there. We had 2-3 people waiting on us all the time--and it was a buffet!After all the negative comments I'd read, I was really surprised and delighted by the quality of the hotel, its appearance, our room was great and the staff was just wonderful. Maybe the hotel management is reading TA!

<Content>Very Good Hotel in Central location Very central Hotel with an excellent pool area - great to get up early and go for a swim. Superb facilities for late travellers with a separate room and shower for guest to use in the evening prior to flight having checked out earleir in the day. Rooms could be a little noisy as previously suggested but did not really bother us. Very helpful and friendly - would definitely stay there again - had 2 nights - no complaints at all - would recommend.

<Content>Excellent all round In September 2006 we stopped off at Singapore for four nights before continuing our journey from the UK to Darwin.In Singapore you really are spoilt for choice when it comes to hotels so why did we choose the Swissotel? The location by the Singapore River at Clarke Quay is excellent. The Colonial Core core area (including the excellent Battlebox at Fort Canning Park), Raffles landing site, Raffles Hotel, Raffles City (plus numerous other shopping centres), and the Padang area are all within easy walking distance for any reasonably able person. It is all too easy to underestimate just how hot and sticky you may get when walking in Singapore and we're very glad that we didn't go for a less central hotel along Orchard Road. There was seldom any need to take the MRT.If you don't want to eat in the hotel then numerous cafes and restaurants line the riverside a few steps away at Clarke Quay. We only ate at the hotel on one occasion and we found the Blue Potato restaurant (located by the large pool) to be excellent.Breakfast was a very good buffet affair with a wide choice of food. You can sit inside or outside by the river.We also wanted to someone to stay that was comfortable but good value. The photo's of the rooms we'd seen ahead of time looked very nice and the deluxe room we were given didn't disappoint at all. It was tastefully decorated, plush, large, clean and very quiet (well soundproofed). The corridors were immaculate and the large lobby and lounge area gave a somewhat grand feel to the place. No complaints.Building work was taking place at the front of the hotel but this didn't cause any problems.During the stay the staff in the corridors always said hello and smiled as they passed by and when we departed the door staff were only to happy to help with our bags.On our previous trip to Singpore we had stayed at the more expensive, and higher class rated, Marina Mandarin. However, this time round, we never felt that we had somehow settled for seocnd best.On this particular trip we stayed at numerous hotels, as we were touring around, and the Swissotel was right there at the top of the list in terms of the overall quality of stay.

<Content>Won't be returning We stayed at the Merchant Court from 3rd Jan for 3 nights. I was ready to check out by the following morning and return to the Pan Pacific where we stayed in late December. I am a travel agent and this trip we stayed at 4 different hotels throughout Asia. Upon arrival there was no one to greet us or take out luggage, we just strolled across the lobby to check in with suitcases in tow. No security to be seen anywhere. I personally had made the booking through one of our wholesalers in Sydney. Upon check in they told me that our requests for smoking/interconnecting rooms had only been forwarded to the hotel the day before. I produced confirmation from the wholesaler that the request had been submitted on the 11th of November but they didn't seem interested. They put us in smoking rooms that didn't connect so the kids had to sleep by themselves for the first night. The room was clean though alot of the bathroom tiles were cracked and as the previous posted said, in need of major refurbishment. Everything was old, wallpaper peeling and quilt cover had stains. The next day we were moved to interconnecting but non smoking, they just couldn't get it right! This room was away from the construction, near the bridge that crosses to Clarke Quay. Unfortunately it's a hangout for young guys and girls drinking and playing around with their motor cycles, the noise didn't stop till about 6.30am.Breakfast was great with a large selection, and buffet dinner was exceptional.The position is great, central to everything but the staff were the most disinterested people i have every encountered.Security was non existent. The main lifts are the type that you have to put your room key into to go up. But there is another lift leading from the carpark and lobby up to the second floor (where our second room was) That anyone could access, once up you were able to access all floors via the stairs. Not a good feeling knowing anyone could just walk in.

<Content>Good Location, Average Service We stayed from December 24th until January 1st. We have previosuly stayed at the Swissotel Stamford at Raffles City (oustanding hotel) and were looking for a different location and cheaper, so thought the Swissotel brand would mean similar service.The lobby area is ok, check in was prompt without being friendly - no explanations of anything in the hotel, but we were told where to go for breakfast which we had included. I had emailed them to request a king size bed and away from the construction (had read about that from other reviews) and was happy that this was accommodated. The room we thought was a little on the small size but was clean and no stains or smells as other reviews had written? We stayed on the 5th floor overlooking Merchant Road.The room had kingsize bed, tv, in room safe, desk, chair, mini bar, tea/coffee making facilities, iron/ironing board, robes and slippers, bathroom had all the toiletries - bath gel, sewing kits, emery boards, cotton buds, haridryer etc so pretty well appointed for a 4 star hotel.What we were disppointed in was the breakfast at the Ellenborough Market Cafe and the low level of service. Xmas Day was a nightmare - it was busy but there is no excuse for running out of cups etc. Every day thereafter the serive didnt improve. We always had to wait for a cup of tea, then it might come without a teaspoon, or there was no cutlery on the table. We thought the quality and variety of food was lacking and levels were not monitored so there was a constant supply. The staff were ok but not friendly at all and when walking around the restaurant to get food etc instead of stepping back and letting guests through, ot waiting just bowled through expecting us to walk around. We tried it one night for dinner and it was very average.We did get room service once - it was ok, typical hotel prices and servings.They do provide a free shuttle bus to Suntec City and Raffles City which we did use a couple of times.The pool area is quite nice but it rained nearly every day of our trip and we did not think it was hot at all (had come from 37 degrees at home!) so we didnt use it. Checked out the spa, looked lovely but prices were absolutely ridiculous!Crossroads bar was ok to chill out and have a drink. Drinks of any nature, alcoholic or not are very expensive all over.The best thing about the hotel is the location at Clarke Quay. Also only 150 metres from the MRT which we found very handy. There are so many restaurants in Clarke Quay, mostly expensive (Hooters is good for a cheap meal) but it comes alive at night and there was a free nightly Mardi Gras every night we where there so that was great.Overall it has a great location but we felt the service was just average and indeed poor in the restaurant, but the rooms are fine so if you are not worried about the serive too much you would probably enjoy staying here.

<Content>Great Hotel and Location!! Stayed for three nights on the way back from Australia.Hotel is really nice, Staff are welcoming and always have a smile on their face.Room was excellent, premier room overlooking the pool.Buffet breakfast was great value for money.$50 dollars for two people and our child (3 year old)ate for free.Most of the work on the new shopping centre facing the entrance is now confined to the inside of the building so there is no problem with noise etc.Would stay there again, excellent for Clarke Quay at night!!

<Content>Good value with some style There are so many hotels to choose from in Singapore, but for the price 拢60 per night, this fairly smart hotel is a good 4 star. Unpretentious with a hint of style and with excellent service. It does a great breakfast which you can eat outside overlooking Clarke Quay. For my two best restaurants - check out Indochine Waterfront Restaurant, not cheap but superb and The Essence of India, both along Clarke Quay.

<Content>Great location, snooty staff we stayed here on a special promotion rate voucher. i don't know whether it was because of this or that we simply looked too low class for the hotel staff but we had the feeling that we were kind of looked down upon by them. it started during the check-in when i wanted to pay using my debit card. the guy and the reception asked me in a loud voice excuse me sir, but is this a DEBIT card? are you aware that the amount will be charged from your account IMMEDIATELY? .. implying that if i don't have a real credit card then i shouldn't be staying here. umm, in my opinion having a debit card means i have enough money to pay everything immediately and i don't have to pay in terms like credit card holders, but then who am i anyways.later that evening we had the 'chocolate buffet' in the lobby, which was quite nice actually. when i asked for the bill, the waiter asked me cash or credit card sir? as a matter of fact i wanted to charge it to the room, but no pen in sight. when he noticed i was looking for a pen, he looked a bit embarrassed and fished out a pen from somewhere and mumbled sorry. apparently we don't look like hotel guests for some reason. even though the location is great, the room was nice, it's next to the mrt station (good for slum dwellers like us) and right in the middle of clarke quay, i don't think i'll be staying here again unless the staff does something about their attitude. actually, no, after this experience i'm not going to risk it again. even the people at the immigration office here treat me with less contempt than the staff at merchant court. never again for us.

<Content>Lovely Hotel Situated near Clarke Quay a lovely building with well appointed rooms,great pool,very close to MRT.Very friendly and very clean.There is major construction work adjacent to the hotel ,building yet another shopping mall.However,on requesting a quiet room we found no problem with this.The nightly buffet is fantastic at about 拢14 a head.The pool buffet on some evenings is not as good.Plenty of resteraunts around Clarke Quay but cannot recommend the food,much better and cheaper places to eat in China Town and Orchid Rd.For a cheap interesting 1hr bus ride take the No.2 to the terminus or Changi War Museum using an MRT ticket,then get the MRT train back from one of the stations seen from the bus.It was lovely to stay in a safe city,but it sure is hot.

<Content>Disappointed second time around Having stayed at this hotel before and enjoyed it and had a nice room, this second stay was a disappointment.The ceiling in the entry of our room was mouldy and smelt. Can't believe that this wouldn't have been painted.We were woken up at 7am one morning by the room immediately next to ours being cleaned. The amount of noise coming from the bathroom being cleaned was enormous. Very inconsiderate. What a time to clean a room!!!!Also we requested and paid for a Deluxe room but we don't think this is what we were given.The room looked tired and the carpet on the third floor pretty old.Not so on the second floor leading to the Spa and pool. I guess this is kept nice because of the number of people using this area.Would think twice before staying here again, judging by our room, I would say if the rest of the hotel was the same, it needs a refurbishment.Not the hotels fault, but the massive construction site next door unfortunately spoils the outlook. We asked for a quite room and got one.

<Content>Clinical Not great, not bad...just like any other decent standard hotel. No character, very busy, quite large, not intimate. But one must however compliment the staff of the hotel who are extremely polite  well mannered. Prior to arrival at the hotel, I requested a room with a king size bed. I was presented with a room with 2 singles, but since we were part of a tour which was subject to group rates, they could not move us without paying an upgrade..which we did. The new room was OK...nothing great and aircon was not very effective. They said they would fix it..they didn't...but we didn't make a noise about it as we were only there for 2 nights and it was unbearably hot. Theres not much to Singapore except shop...so here's a few tipsHotel is well located in that it is withn walking distance from of Stanley Quay which is full of restaurants and pubs and clubs. Avoid the Italian Restaurant ..Amalfi...food took over an hr to arrive. Hotel is also close to China Town where one can buy all the touristty-take home to kids cheapies. Ten minutes walk from Hotel is also Boat Quay with another sampling of restuarants. Never mind that you are not on the famous Orchard Rd strip. It's only a short trip away via the MRT underground which works excellently. Truth is that if you can afford to buy at the great names such as Cartier, Bugari, Channel etc which are found on Orchard Street you wouldn't be staying at this 3* hotel. Shopping on Orchard St is in any event overated. Most of the items on offer can be bought at home in most countries and as far as electronics go, you are pretty much gauranteed to get ripped off at the famous Lucky Plaza which has become seedier in recent years in this regard. If you wanna shop, then take thye MRT and head for new Vivo Centre (last stop on the Harbour Line). It's got every concievable brand name store and had over 1m visitors in it's 1st week. We have already been to Singapore and if we were travelling independently of a group we would not have chosen to stop here at all. It's a clean city that works. Thats all. Like the hotel....it works...thats all.

<Content>Warning of major construction across the street I stayed at this hotel for two nights. There is major construction going on right next door and it is 24/7. Very annoying and difficult to get in and out of the hotel. Also, the TV remote did not work properly. The concierge had a major attitude.Good location once construction is finished.

<Content>Would stay here again We had a lovely time at this hotel and would definitely stay there again. It is in a great location for dining out with Clake Quay and Riverside Point about two minutes away and Boat Quay about a 15 minute walk. To get to a shopping mall it was a $5-6 taxi ride. However, initial impressions weren't great! When we pulled up in the taxi the road outside was a construction site with lots of noise and dust everywhere. Once inside the hotel the noise wasn't bad but more fun was to come!We had booked an extra night at the hotel as our flight from NZ arrived in at 6.45am and we wanted to check in straight away. At reception we were told that because we hadn't turned up the night before they had sold our room and we would have to wait. They claimed they didn't know we were arriving in the morning despite it being in black and white on our reservation forms. They eventually found us a room which was on the third floor near the lifts. Not a bad room but the noise from people talking at the lifts was annoying. Luckily we weren't in that room for very long as my husband worked his magic and we were moved to another room. This room was lovely, it was nice and big and had a balcony that overlooked Clarke Quay with two chairs and a table. The room was serviced every day and was kept very clean. Each night we had a small bar of Toblerone and a bottle of water by the bed (a great touch given the heat in Singapore). We could hear the construction from this room but it wasn't that annoying (when we arrived they were working on getting the road outside the hotel finished which accounted for most of the noise, by the time we left this was finished) and there was noise from a nightclub across the river but again not that invasive that we couldn't sleep. The bed was a true king size, not two twin beds pushed together and was extremely comfortable. The pillows were great too.We had dinner in the Blue Potato one night - the bbq buffet. Which was great, there was loads of food and they cooked your meat/seafood in front of you. The staff were very attentive.Highly recommended is the buffet breakfast in the Ellenborough Cafe. The selection was great and they cooked your eggs on demand to your specification.We also had room service our first night and it was good, hot and arrived quickly.They also do a high tea in the Crossroads bar, a booking is recommended as they seem to fill it every day.We found the price of alcohol very high at the hotel and at the restaurants on Clarke Quay and in the nearby supermarket. If you like a glass of wine or a beer at the end of the day, take your own from your home country. Currently you can take 1 litre of spirits and 1 litre of wine or beer into Singapore.There is a supermarket over at Liang Court Mall. It is in the basement and opens about 10am.

<Content>Mozzies! I must confess, I'm a Singaporean and have never stayed in the hotel, but I'm a traveller who has benefitted a lot from reviews of hotels so feel obliged to share pertinent information about hotels. (not sure whether this would be allowed)I was at this hotel's lounge recently and everything was nice, it was quiet and service was good. BUT it was really mosquito infested. And I really mean infested. I've never been attacked by so many mosquitoes even in the swampy or foresty areas. I was wearing a long sleeve shirt and long pants but still suffered not less than 10 mosquito bites on each foot, and a couple on my fingers and face. It was so bad that when i lean back to rest I could see a mob of mosquitoes flying right in front of me.As local, I would say that the location of the hotel is fairly good, being near to clarke quay, which others have already given their comments on. The MRT station next to the hotel is on the north east line, which brings you some other tourist attractions like chinatown and little india. I personally think a hotel near the city hall MRT station would be more convenient if you're planning to rely on the train but it could just be because the north east line is fairly new and I'm not used to taking it yet.

<Content>Some good bits, but let down by room This hotel was booked for us by the travel agent as a 48 hour stopover on the way back from Australia to the UK. Initial impressions were excellent - an attractive lobby and a friendly and efficient receptionist. We were slightly disappointed with our room. Although it was very clean, it can best be described as tired. It must be close to the top of the list of rooms for refurbishment. The carpet was quite badly stained, the bedside lights had obviously been broken and repaired , but were still missing covers over the on/off switches (but not dangerously). The bathroom showed signs of repairs to tiles and grouting, the shower pipe leaked and the shower head was slightly damaged meaning the jet was suboptimal. It was not of great enough concern for us to have wanted to change rooms, but the overall quality was far below that of the public areas of the hotel. The beds were comfortable, and the airconditioning worked well.On the plus side, the breakfast was very good, with a wide selection of both western and eastern dishes. The staff were always efficient and welcoming. As stated in other reviews, the location is excellent. Overall I can rate it no more than average because of the room itself.

<Content>Very Good Hotel in a very good location I stayed 4 nights in september.The hotel is a very good one. My superior room was facing Merchant Road (opposite side of the river), quiet and large enough for 3 persons.The bed was very confortable, the air-con makes very little sound (unlike many other hotels I tried).Breakfast was great: large choice of western and asian meals.The hotel location is very good:- Clarke Quay MRT Station is just right next to hotel- Walk across the bridge and your are at Clarke Quay where you will find many (expensive) restaurants  bars- Fort Canning Park is also at a walking distance on the other side of the riverBut in the other hand no food court in the close vicinity to enjoy local foods. The nearest one is at Chinatown (Chinatown MRT Station or 10 min walk) but it was not the best food court I prefer.PS: a building next to the hotel is under intensive work. So depending on the location of your room you may be disturb by the noise (right side of the hotel).

<Content>Good location ( maybe too good ) I stayed at this hotel for three nights whilst passing thru to Australia and my overall impression is good. The hotel is located just across the footbridge from clarke quay which is the best place in Singapore for great bars and restaurants, as your so close there is a slight problem with noise if ur facing the wrong direction as u get the usual low level bass noise in ur room till about 3am...it was only just noticeable but a little annoying...the room itself is very modern with nice decor and cable TV, there was a few funny things with the rooms control panel, when u were going to sleep and u turned off the aircon the bathroom light came on which gave me a laugh....The pool / spa complex was the best thing about the hotel with great facilities, nice waterfall features and loads of places to sunbathe.I didnt try the restaurant as my rate didnt include it, the hotel is a bit expensive compared to other similar class hotels in Singapore, although I guess your paying for the location.Overall, a nice well run hotel in a great location...

<Content>Good city centre hotel This is the second year running that we've stayed in this hotel. It's main feature is its location - right next to MTR station, walking distance of Chinatown, Clarke Quay etc. It's clean and comfortable and the staff are friendly and helpful. Only objection is to breakfast. If you arrive within the last 20 minutes of the time allocation, you are made to feel like a criminal and find everything being whipped away around you. They've just introduced afternoon tea in the lobby bar, which is not quite Raffles standard, but good value for money.

<Content>The Premier Room was worth the money After having flown in from the UK I landed up in the lobby at about 10am. Very efficient check in clerk, who was very apologetic, told us that the room wasn't ready but we could use their 'Hospitality Room' (not a great first impression - the room was very dark, lacked a decent table and chairs, no complimentary water and no aircon...I was a bit worried). We adjourned back to the lounge area at reception, which had comfy leather sofas and was cool as well. An hour later we were able to get into the room. In the interim I had a chat with the very helpful concierge about MRT routes and tickets for Sentosa, and had a coffee in the restaurant (service was atrocious but we found out later it was still breakfast time and we weren't billed for the coffee so...hey ho!)So, the room. Got a great price on Asiarooms for a Premier room, and 'premier' it lived up to. Two kingsize beds (I was travelling with my mum) and a huge bathroom - lots of space to move. Very unlike many hotel rooms in Singapore I must say! Armchair, desk space....and all of this with a balcony overlooking the pool. Luggage arrived promptly and was delivered in a very low-key manner.So, a lovely room, clean, sparkling basin and bath, immaculate bed linen and extremely comfy beds with great airconditioning. Exactly what you want from a hotel, in fact. Coupled with the wonderful location (try out Brewerkz just over the river; go before 8pm when the beer prices get expensive though!) and convenient MRT. Even the downstairs lounge is nice AND there are a number of fast lifts.Breakfast was good. Didn't find it too boring (but as a Brit I'm happy with tropical fruit all day and every day and I was only there one night after all). There was certainly a good range of choices.I would certainly recommend it on location alone.

<Content>You want to know...read on We stayed as part of trip to Oz - I read loads of reviews (I am Mrs Cautious) and went with this one, despite the negative stuff I read. THE LOCATION IS FANTASTIC - SO CLOSE TO THE BARS AND RESTAURANTS OF CLARKE QUAY - LIKE ONE MINUTE WALK. The standard of accomodation is really clean, the rooms are not massive, think motel in the USA but that is OK because I didn't go to Singapore for the hotel - I went for the shopping!! The pool area is fantastic, really nice and the spa after a hard day on Orchard Road shopping is just what a gal needs - don't be put off, just book it!!

<Content>Great Hotel Before I left for Singapore, I went through this review about this hotel. All the fuss is about the construction site next door.After much consideration  a previous visit to the hotel to attend a wedding function, I decided to give it a try for 3 nights.Overall, the stay is pleasant  everything is excellent. Just a bit disapointed with the breakfast. Should have more varieties. I am tired of it on the 3rd morning.

<Content>Singapore's Worst Hotel Stayed here on business for 4 nights. My room was very dated, stains everywhere on the carpet, curtains and seats etc. Loads of hairs on the carpet. Disgusting! Glad I only stayed 4 nights, I complained about it but was told there was no other room available. They say this a 5 star - don't make me laugh!!!

<Content>Swissotel very good We had a stopover in Singapore on our way to Turkey and stayed at the Swissotel. We found it clean, comfortable and friendly.Our room was on the 58th floor with a fantastic view over the city and was handy to all the things that we wanted to look at.Staff were friendly and the late check out (4.00pm) was handy as our flight was not until 11.30pm. To fill in the time, the hotel has a room allocated with lounge, television and coffee/tea facilities. This was a lifesaver for us to park our feet after a long day of shopping and sightseeing.Would definitey recommend.

<Content>Ideal for a short stay! Stayed here pre cruise from 1st - 3rd April, and really couldn't fault it. This hotel provided us with everything we wanted - fantastic location (we felt we had made a great choice for first time visitors), clean comfortable room and bathroom, and a great pool area to chill out at when we had walked around enough (with sun loungers always available and a plentiful supply of clean towels). We didn't eat here as we were out and about so much, but the buffet for breakfast looked good. Staff were efficient and friendly and we were offered a late check out without even asking - which suited us perfectly.Our room overlooked the pool and river as we had asked, and although you do have to pass the construction site to enter the hotel, it didn't really impact on our stay; we were not disturbed at all. The adjacent MRT station was a bonus - although we only used it a couple of times and walked everywhere else, since so many places were within easy access.Yes the corridors on the accommodation floors look a little tired, but I believe this hotel will get the tlc it requires soon, and will be a fantastic place to stay. We would definitely return here - and would recommend others to give it a try!

<Content>My favourite hotel I have stayed at this hotel whilst in Singapore many times and have absolute loved it. The only reason I haven't stayed there every time is because although Clark Quay is a great area with restaurants all around the area and China Town close by, it is a 5 - 10 minute taxi ride from Orchard Road. I don't not understand how other people can diss this hotel as it is fairly new, has great interior decorations, the staff are friendly, the rooms are huge and have fantastic views, the beds are all king size. Also, the gym is really big (has three seperate rooms of equipment) and is free, and the pool area is great with a bar next to the pool and you can even have dinner out there. I thoroughly enjoy my stay every time at the Merchant Court and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Expected more This hotel is rated as a ***** premises, which isn't justified at all. Checkin was easy and fast, and I got a room not facing the construction site. Unfortunately my room was at the end of the one wing, what meant, that I had to walk a lot in the hotel's corridors to reach the pool floor or the lobby. The room itself was rather outdated than new being equipped with the standard amenties. That's the first problem. A five star hotel only having ordinary amenties...? Beds were comfortable enough, working desk was fine, TV had some reception problems and only a few Western entertainment channels had been available. The control unit next to the beds had some malefunctions - when you pushed the master button to turn off all lights in the room, one light, the one of the bathroom, remained on or was even turned on. Additionally, if you attempted to reactivate the aircondition, the light in the bathroom was turned on either. I got a little bit angry about that. The bathroom wasn't that exciting having a bath tube and an outdated sink/mirror area.Outside the rooms the Swissotel has more to explore and relax, what finally compensates the deficits in the rooms (my room). The lobby is breathtaking and fancy, in the evening a piano player entertains the guests. The Swissotel is perfectly located adjacent to the Singapore river, the next MRT station is only a few steps away, which makes it easy to roam around in Singapore.The pool area is nicely designed with enough sun beds and towels. There is a slide for the children and a seperate pool for babies and toddlers. From there you have a great view at the river and its banks, where the entertainment takes place daily (and nightly).Unfortunately there wasn't even one ashtray available, smoking is fully prohibited at the pool level. I basically agree with that, but they could have defined a zone around a trash bin, where smokers could act out their addiction. The gym was equipped properly, the SPA (sauna and steam bath) were acceptable, but disappointing for an European being used to these SPA facilities. Final conclusion: For my taste, the premises does not fulfill the promises made on their website. I was charged SGD 130 (excl. taxes)/night, which has been a discounted rate. I would accomodate myself there again if not more expansive than the remarked S$130.There are three star hotels in Singapore offering the same or slightly less for an essentially lower price.

<Content>It was a great hotel room I stayed in Singapore from April 5-8, 2006 and stayed at the merchant court. I was quite satisfied of the room that I was given. It was big and clean. Though my view is the construction site, I never had a hard time sleeping (maybe I just felt so tired...) The hotel is always cleaned. Buffet breakfast was great! An MRT station just around the corner so it's very convenient to go around Singapore. Very near to Clark Quay and Chinatown.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We just came back from Singapore and stayed at Swissotel Merchant Court. We had a fantastic stay, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful as well the location is absolutely top. If you like good food and fancy Restaurants, just opposite the Swissotel we went to Clarke Quay and had a fantastic meal. We only can recommend this hotel, it is really good.

<Content>Not sure..... We stayed here for 2 nights before we cruised on the 25/3 and it was a bit of a let down. We booked for a King room and ended up with 2 single beds and they had nothing else??? Room was very small, not even enough room for 2 suitcases on the floor!! The kettle took a bit of working out as well. If we stood out onto the balcony and looked to our right we had a great view of the river area and resturants. The rooms weren't noice proof either, not that we expected to have no noise, but we may as well of had the door wide open. Also couldn't work out how to lock one half of the door either (both doors slided one way or the other).The buffet breakfast was pretty good. We had a buffet dinner but it was all Asian food and very spicy. The pool area was lovely but the pool bar was on the opposite side so to order a drink you had to walk right around the pool. If you were swimming you needed to get out and walk over to order it. Not the best pool bar I've seen.This hotel has great access to Clarke Quay and an easy walk to Chinatown. It's a long walk to Orchard Rd but great exercise!!Singapore is so on top of keeping their streets clean with no rubbish to be seen anywhere, it's a shame it doesn't do the same for the river. It was very grubby. I'm still trying to work out if I liked the area or not. It had me wishing we'd spent 2 nights at Sentosa instead.

<Content>Please, please don't stay here Passed through Singapore again while on business in the Far East. Had been booked into this hotel. Briefly: All l can say is that this is the worst hotel l have ever seen or stayed in on numerous visits to Singapore. It is shabby and dated. To say it needs total refurbishment is an understatement - it needs demolishing. The whole hotel is terribly drab and dated. Dirty rooms. Breakfast buffet inedible. Building site next door. Staff totally useless and unhelpful. This hotel is an embarassment to Singapore. Please, don't ruin your stay in Singapore - stay elsewhere.

<Content>Awful stay My fiance and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights from Mar 25. They put us up on the 9th floor, and guess what the room was facing the construction site. For the money we paid for this hotel, it was totally not worth it. It was a very small room and the bathroom had a damp smell. In addition to that the noise from the construction site was unbearable. We were very annoyed with the constant drilling noise and trucks moving in and out of the site.I was also rudely awaken at 10 am on Sunday morning, with a knock on the door by a hotel staff asking whether we had consumed any items from the minibar. Couldn't they wait until we actually check out from our room??We will definately not stay here again.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Great Location We stayed at the Swissotel Merchant for 3 nights a week or so ago. It was fabulous. The room we had was lovely, spotless  very nicely decorated. We were near the pool on the second floor. The hotel is approximately 1 1/2 blocks from China town and a lot of malls and shopping spots. We could walk to many restaurants also.The staff was very nice, very helpful and attentive.It is a great value for the price which included a nice buffet breakfast.The nearby construction is an eye soar, but we only saw it on our way in and out of the driveway. We weren't disturbed by any noise as the workers were there only during daylight hours. We weren't in our room a lot.We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Construction site hotel We stayed for 4 days commencing 24th Feb. After some delay we were given a smoking 2 single bedded room overlooking the river so we could not see the construction site but it seemed to work all night with lots of noise. I cannot imagine how anyone could sleep on that side of the hotel which must contain half of the rooms. The works are just a few yards from the hotel and you have to go through the works to get to reception! The room was damp and the air con noisy. The situation of the hotel on the river is ideal but there are other hotels on the river which have to be a better option. I would not stay there again.

<Content>Not coming back here !! OK, this hotel first of all seriously needs a refurb. The rooms are about 10 years old and very, very tired. Also not very clean. Secondly, it is next to a 24/7 building site and as such, very noisy. They are building a mall and offices right next door to the hotel and the noise is pretty dreadful. It was way too expensive for what I got. The spa is small, but OK, the pool is nice.

<Content>avoid this hotel! From the moment you arrive at the merchant court you get the feeling that the swisshotel group have compeletly ignored this place! It almost feels like they've decided to put all their time and money into their other singapore hotel - the stamford.I feel bad critising this hotel because the staff were very friendly and helpful (and tried their best even though you could see they knew the place is falling apart!)Upon arrival the foyer seemed dull and lifeless...it then took about 15 minutes for them to check us in ! We were given a room that had ' two kingsize beds '. When we got to our room these so called beds were a joke - slightly wider than a single and pillows that were wafer thin ! We complained but were told that this was a standard king size bed!The room itself was damp and smelt terrible...there was a big damp patch on the ceiling and no towels or toiletries of any description in the bathroom (not good for a so called 4 star!)...while we were on the phone complaining about this a janitor turned up to fix our sink that was coming away from the walll !Needless to say we didn't stay long and managed to get a last minute room at the 4 seasons. We paid approx 600SGD per night for a suite at the 4 seasons that was excellent, and the swisshotel wanted about 450SGD per night....what a joke !When we told them we were leaving they said they could show us another room but the damage was done - why didn't they put us in this other room from the beginning !There are many more hotels in singapore (in this price range) to choose from...avoid the merchant court!. we only chose it because there was an aerospace convention on in the city and everywhere else was booked - guess that speaks volumes !

<Content>STILL AN EXCELLENT BASE My wife and I have just returned from a three week vacation during which we stayed at Swissotel Merchant Court twice 鈥?3 days each side of a cruise from Singapore.Just before we left the UK our travel agent informed us that they had just received notice that construction work which had started a year ago was going on close by! I complained about being informed after we had been issued with our tickets and hotel vouchers. We got was a verbal apology but I was not impressed. We had stayed at the Merchant Court a few years ago and its location on the river is so convenient that we decided to stick to our arrangements.  Reading recent reviews about the hotel in my opinion they were a bit harsh. Yes the hotel is not now the best in Town and could do with a bit of a spruce up. I am sure the new owners will do something about this. It is an ideal touring base being sited on Clark Quay with restaurants, night life nearby, river walks and boat trips on hand. Yes there is a big construction site close by, but the work did not disturb us at all. Below the construction site is a fairly new MRT station. An MRT Tourist Card gives you very cheap train and bus travel all over the island. Our room was on the 12th floor. It was clean and comfortable but a bit plain. Rooms on the 11th, 12th (and maybe 10th) floors have use of the Executive club. The Club has its own Reception facility and Club room where you take breakfast and complimentary afternoon drinks or tea and nibbles. You also get two items of laundry done free each day, plus a few other perks as well. We found the staff throughout the hotel was friendly and efficient. But Eddie in the Executive Club deserves a special mention. He really went out of his way to see that guests were looked after.All in all, I feel that the staff and location make this a hotel that I will happily use again.

<Content>Nice location in a building site Went to Swissotel, Merchant Court for 4 nights as the 2nd stage of our honeymoon. We had been looking forward to Singapore but imagine our disappointment when we arrived at the hotel to discover it was in the middle of a building site. Construction was in it's 571st day but our travel company had no knowledge of this?? At reception we were told we had a standard room and no breakfast despite our booking details showing we had a superior room with breakfast. The room decor was tired. The walls needed the bubbly wallpaper stripping and then painting in a light colour. Fortunately our room faced the inner court and swimming pool and we couldn't hear the building. I think they may have been working 24 hours as we never saw the site vacant.We found the breakfast fine with a varied selection. The location of the hotel is good being next to Clarke Quay and the MTR station.It didn't spoil our visit as we loved Singapore and were out from 10am to mid night most days so only saw the hotel at night. Just a shame we didn't know about the construction work when we booked in August, we would have chosen somewhere else.

<Content>Great location, but disappointing! This was our second stay in Singapore in little over a week during a trip to the region. For our previous stay we had stopped at a cheaper, lower grade hotel, further up the quayside. This hotel overshadowed the Swissotel Merchant Court which was very disappointing considering its brand, its stars and its location. The location is excellent, being right at the centre of the quays where all the restaurants and bars come to life at night. The hotel also put on a free minibus during the day to transport you to some of the main tourist areas in the city. So in that way, it is great. However, the hotel is dated, lacklustre and musty! The corridors around our room smelt damp - although this may have been down to some kind of cleaning exercise. The room was dull, with poor standard of fittings and filthy windows through which we could barely admire the view over some office block. We only ate breakfast in the hotel which was adequate, although the staff seemed a little harrassed and there was no level of personal service on that occasion. The concierge were most helpful when we asked for some assistance during our brief visit. Considering the price, I expected better, especially in Singapore.

<Content>GREAT LOCATION This is a good clean hotel with friendly staff. All rooms overlook the pool area. There is currently building works going on next to this hotel but you cannot hear them inside the hotel. They do provide late check outs and the only problem we had whilst staying there was fixed imediately. The restuarants are used by local Singaporians when they want to impress business associates I have been told by local friends. Bonus being that it is Adjacent to an MRT station so you can get just about anywhere on the island.

<Content>Christmas in the Tropics We spent six nights here in November 2005 and had a very pleasant stay. The room was reasonably large, well kept and very clean. The en suite bathroom was a good size with a big bath and fantastic shower - very important when the heat and humidity are as high as they are in Singapore. Room service was very good and delivered promptly. The breakfast buffet had a good selection everything from Continental breafast, traditional English style cooked breakfast to local delicacies such as noodles and durian fruit. As in most of Singapore there is a large consruction site just over the road and although it was operational for quite long hours there was no noise or disturbance while in the hotel. Don't let it put you off. We arrived at 10.00am and they were very accomodating in getting us into a room as soon as possible. Singapore is a great place and there is lots to see and do. You must do the Night Safari. The concierge can book that for you and they pick you up at the hotel. There are lots of bars and restaurants nearby on the waterfront and it is in easy walking distance to Chinatown and Esplanades. Gluttons Bay is a must visit if you go to Esplanades - outdoor fast food that is just the best you've ever tasted and incredibly cheap. One of the best holidays we've had.

<Content>Fabulous hotel I can only agree with the recent reviews, this hotel is excellent! We stayed here on the first leg of our round the world trip and loved every minute of it. The staff are very friendly and very helpful. Our room was beautiful, overlooking Clarke Quay and pool, slippers, robes, fresh fruit. Breakfast is just something else - there was just about everything you could think of. I even had chinese food for breakfast! Hotel is in an excellent location right next to MRT station. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Excellent Location Stayed 3 nights in this hotel at the end of Sep 2005, good location just next to the MRT station. We booked a Premier Twin room with balcony and requested to have a pool view.However, when we checked-in, the hotel staff told us that there is only double-bed room with balcony in this room category. That means Premier room with balcony is only 1 bed inside?!Anyway, we accepted to stay in a twin room without balcony. The room is nice and face to the swimming pool and overlook the Clark Quay and Boat Quay as well, the bath room is also big enough.

<Content>Brilliant location, friendly service, clean I've just returned from a 6week trip with my boyfriend (South East Asia, and New Zealand mainly- yes i know that I really needed longer!) and we both agree that this was the best hotel we have stayed in. Checked into the hotel as Executive Club Members (which we didn't know we were, but naturally went along with it! something to do with the deal we got when we booked it i think.) We had a fantastic, spacious, quiet, clean, airy, modern looking room on the 11th floor overlooking the Quay and the pool. Went out to the fantastic selection of restaurants and bars, western and eastern food for dinner. We found The Iguana Cafe. A great place to have a drink. It has an amazing endless choice of spirits/ alcohol to the ceiling. Literally. Shelf upon shelf! Our first night there we went to bed hoping to get a good nights sleep and a lie in after the flight, we were unfortunately awoken at 8am the next morning by a holiday rep- we didn't know we had!!! (not the hotels fault- we should have said no to being disturned) A tad annoyed at this but knowing that our time in Singapore was limited (only a 3 day stopover) we were up and booking trips within the hour. (The Night Safari is a must and the City Tour is fantastic if you want to know more about Singapore culture and history. Both excellent. Tour guides had excellent spoken English, friendly jokey nature and of course a wealth of information. I would also suggest Sentosa Island by cable car- it is a fantastic adventure which you can do without a tour guide and explore at your own leisure. Also girls there's 24hour shopping Malls out here!!!! Come with an empty suitcase! And for guys there's technology shopping malls for you- yep purely dedicated to cameras, computers and other electronic gadgets.) We had breakfast in the hotel, up on the 11th floor club lounge. A good selection of bread (to toast), pastries, croissants and jams to accompany (the coconut jam is scrummy), fried Singapore style breakfast cooked to order in front of you. Also in the same lounge area from 5pm until about 7pm there was complimentary drinks served, alcoholic and non alcoholic. Overall this hotel offered polite, caring, friendly chatty staff, especially Eddie in the executive club. He made our holiday ... I think the word is easy and trouble free. The staff were genuinely there to help and interested in YOU. Not like some of the hotels i've stayed in where the staff half heartedly help you! We were given FREE extended check out time (until 5pm) as our flight wasn't until later afternoon. The pool was clean and the service above excellent.(Also Spa treatments available, I didn't try them but relaxing aromatherapy oils were on the list. excellent idea if you've been on a plane for 14hours.) Chocolates were left on our bed every night and fresh fruit was in a bowl in the room everyday. The bathroom was clean, new towels and toiletries (shampoo, shower gel ect) everyday too. And a cheap 5minute call to the UK too!This was the first stop on our trip and I think that the hotel made our holiday start with the 'WOW' factor. I would definitely go back to Singapore and will definitely look into trying out other Swissotel owned accommodation.

<Content>Excellent hotel We stayed at Swissotel Merchant Court for 5 nights and would say that is possiblyone of the best and cheapest 4 * city hotels i have stayed in. We were upgraded on arrival to a deluxe room which although not huge was adequate, the bathroom being larger than a lot of other 4 *hotels. We had a view of the swimming pool which itself overlooks the Singapore river. A very good relaxing pool. Probably the best feature of the hotel is its location, right next door to the MTR and on the river, a lovely walk in itself, next to excellent restaurants bars and clubs. We didnt eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the food. The staff were very friendly and the atrium is large airy and nicely decorated without being too fussy. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone and wouldnt look at any others certainly not for those rates.

<Content>great location I stayed in this hotel in August. I can recommend this hotel to anyone who values a great location (right in the center nearby fantastic diner places at the river) good service and a pleasant calm atmosphere. The swimming pool is unique and enjoyable. Yes, a big construction site is located right next to the hotel but didn't bother/irritate me at all. The hotel offers very good value for money.

<Content>Living with construction I stayed at this hotel July 30 - August 1, 2005. The service personnel were friendly and helpful. The interior of the rooms is nice. The breakfast is good. But the fact is the major construction project immediatley in front of the hotel completely spoils the atmosphere. The view of the harbor is to the front, which now provides a view of construction. There are some nice rooms facing an entertainment area: noise! The best rooms now are those on the pool side or with a city view. Neither location is particularly attractive. I also did not find the rates as attractive as other reviewers indicate. I just don't think you should use this hotel until the construction is completed. I don't know to what extent the new building will permanentlyspoil the harbor view.

<Content>Excellent hotel I would go back tomorrow! We stayed for four nights and what an excellent hotel. The pool area is lovely make sure you try the pool bar food its excellent! The pool area is so relaxing we had to drag ourselves away to do some tours and shopping! Breakfast is excellent too anything you can think of is on offer. Our room was excellent too very clean. Staff are very friendly and are ready to offer help at any time of the day. Also the metro station is just across the road and it's really easy to use. If I return to Singpore I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else.

<Content>brilliant - best pool in the city!! stayed here in october 03 and didnt want to leave. The staff were so attentive and helpful and nothing was too much trouble, the room was great, although their bathrooms could do with some modernisation as they looked older than the room. The bellboy who bought our luggage up spent a few minutes showing us how/where the lights/tv turned on off etc. The pool was just amazing, it even had a small waterslide and waterfall feature plus a seperate pool for the kiddies, a poolside diner with exquisite food and drinks, on our last night a huge group of japanese guests invaded the pool and were trying to play volleyball..most hilarious thing ever..until the ball landed in my dinner!

<Content>wonderful hotel I stayed here with my two friends in March 2005.We loved the location of the hotel, the fantastic buffet breakfast, but most of all the outstanding pool. It was resort like and you didnt feel like you were in the middle of a city...This hotel is very handy to the MRT, restaurants etc etc.. I am a Travel Agent and I was very impressed with this hotel.. I will be highly recommending it to my clients

<Content>Excellent - will definitely stay again. I stayed at this hotel in January 2005 from 7th through 12th. I found everything exceed my expectations about the ambeince of the hotel starting from the entrance to the lobby to the reception, breakfast lounge, and of course the room. I was allowed an early check-in and a late check-out. The staff was extremely helpful with any questions including tourist related information and even lent me an umbrella free of charge on 2 days when it was raining heavily. Of course, they did make me sign something saying that I would pay them IF I lost the umbrella which I think is very fair!The most valuable thing for this hotel is its location - near the Clarke Quay - the night-life is excellent alongside the riverside - live music, lovlely restaurants with indoor and outdoor seatings, bar with live bands, great iNdian restaurant and overall not lonely at all - whatever time of the day you step out.2 mins away from the Clark Quay train station and 5 mins away from China Town. By taxi this hotel is about 30 mins away from Changi airport.I will definitely stay here again - the room service was also excellent - and the beddings, sheets, furniture was all in great shape. I like the fact that the bathroom had marble flooring and white ceramic fixtures - well lit and very spacious and clean. Also, there was free tea, coffee in the room with an electric kettle provided to make tea by yourself. There was an in-room referigerator stocked with beverages and drinks - also a safe. The beverages were for a charge.I would definitely recommend this hotel to other visitors - they also have a free shuttle to Raffles city - so if you don't want to stay in the more expensive hotel over the mall - you can live here and go over to Raffles city mall without any expense.FYI - I had an non-smoking room.I hope this review helps. Thanks.

<Content>Great Location Great facilities, room, bars and pool etc.Located very centrally for all the bars and restaurants at Clarke Key.Right next to the metro, but then taxi's are cheap, so we prefered the ease of them instead.Chinatown is a short walk away and one of the better one's of any of the many capitol cities I have visited.Highly recommended.
