<Content>Location Location Location Booked this hotel with Asiarooms. Having stayed in Ubud before in the magnificent Tegal Sari, we wanted somewhere with paddy field views but in a better central location. Cendana fulfilled these requirements. The hotel is on Monkey Forest Road, north of the football field. The sign's really hard to miss, so look for the sign for Lamak restaurant, it's just down an alleyway and behind this place. Check in was quick and went without problems. The hotel is divided into about 4 blocks of rooms, each block 2 stories high and 4 rooms across (8 rooms per block). We were on the first floor, overlooking the swimming pool next to reception. The room was a little dark (great for having a sleep on a morning) and a little dated, but okay with a nice big 4-poster bed. The bathroom contained a big bath, shower and toilet, and the bathroom sink was in the bedroom which was a little odd. There was one wardrobe with a handful of hangers. The room didn't have a safe, but you could leave valuables at the safety deposit boxes at reception. The balcony was large, but quite dark, with a nice view of the pool and rice fields. Breakfast was served near the second swimming pool and was a buffet breakfast; fried eggs, scrambled eggs, bacon, noodles, rice, jaffles (toasted sandwiches), banana pancakes, and fruit - all very nice a replenished regularly. The location was excellent, right on Monkey Forest road, about a 10 min walk to Ubud Market. Overall, a good hotel in a great location.

<Content>Rustic and Restful My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our four-night stay at Cendana. The property is very centrally located, but the property itself is set back far enough from Monkey Forest Road that you don't hear any of the traffic at all. The rice paddy is very restful, as are the fountains. We were in 602, which I highly recommend. Our block was only our upper room and the lower room, tucked into a nice nook with a fountain below the balcony. The staff decorate the property daily with fresh flowers on all the statuary, and the breakfast was always yummy and interesting.Almost every evening, you could hear the gamelan being played, but some nights, you also had to deal with the reggae band at the bar nearby (they ended the show at 11:30). The hotel is close to lots of yummy restaurants and great shopping, and it's a short little hike to the Monkey Forest or up to the tourist info booth.The only complaint we have is the management and staff. You sort of have to track them down...like if you want a drink or you need to turn in your key. BUT, if you want to book a tour, they are FRONT AND CENTER....we just booked our own through a tout on the street (which ended up wonderful, and we used him for the whole of our trip).We left to go to Sanur, but I wish we could have stayed our whole trip at Cendana. It's one of those resorts where you are just happy to sit on the balcony and do nothing!

<Content>Better choices are available This was our second trip to Ubud, we did not get Tepi Sawaha this time so Cendana was the second choice. The hotel and service is ok but not really up there. The car to pick us up was late but the hotel really apologised for it and did not charge us for it. The rooms are quite dark which is a shame on a sunny day and really depressing on a cloudy day. The location is right on Monkey forest road which is a big plus. The cars for local transfer and not always available and drivers can get grumpy at times. Breakfast is a generous buffet but cold toast and eggs are really not my thing so ate out most of the days. Property is a little dates and bathrooms can do with a makeoverAll in all, nothing bad about it but not fantastic either

<Content>A disappointing experience Have to say that this hotel was a great disappointment, as it was more expensive than any of the 3 other Ubud hotels we stayed in, and our room was dingy, dirty and in a sad state considering what it cost us. Don't know if we were unlucky with our basic room, but the hotel was full so we coud not swap. Breakfast was a good selection but all left out and nothing freshly made. The location, views and pools are great but for the price you can do much better a bit further out of town. We did.

<Content>Pretty good, shame about the service Talk about bad first impressions!It started off when i approached the front desk for check-in. The person the desk was extremely rude and condescending!! He treated me like a vagrant who was likely to trash the room, even though I was on my honeymoon!Apart from that though, the rest of my stay there was fabulous. This has got to be one of the most beautiful hotels i've ever stayed in! From the infinity pools to the lush padi fields off to the side, this is one gorgeous looking hotel. But, the exterior was nothing when compared with the room!With a 4 poters bed the main centre of attraction in a room with a high, carved ceiling, i felt like i was trespassing in a bedchamber fit for a king! Though small, it was well lit and plush.The breakfast was also to die for. Banana pancakes. For breakfast. Nuff said.Overall, if you avoid the service staff, you'll definitely enjoy your stay here.

<Content>Relaxing Oasis As I sit at my computer after returning from a week in Bali, I find myself wishing I were still at Cendana Resort in Ubud. I can't say enough about how wonderful my experience was from start to finish. Check-in was very simple. It happened to be raining when I arrived so the staff was ready with umbrellas to walk me to my room. The rooms are very charming. The wooden, decorated entrance to the rooms was simply amazing. Each room had a balcony with a small table and a few chairs to enjoy the breeze - day or night. I stayed in a standard room with no frills, but at I really didn't need any frills at Cendana. The staff at Cendana was incredibly helpful. They were always willing to help in any way they could from helping book getaways to the free shuttle to wherever I needed to go whether to the market or to a local restaurant. All help was delivered with smiles! The hotel is a quite peaceful retreat in a central location. Cendana nestled next to a rice paddy. It was fun watching the ducks as they waded through the rice paddies as I lounged in the pool. The area is so quiet it was hard to believe that we were actually right on Monkey Forest Road. The spa was a little on the expensive side for the Ubud area. I found another spa right next door that offered the same services for a better price. I can't wait for my next chance to go to Ubud and Cendana Resort!

<Content>Loved this hotel We loved this hotel! We were picked up at the airport without incident - yes. The hotel has beautiful sculptures at the entrance with colorful plants and greenery, beautiful interior details, and lots of marble. We upgraded the room upon arrival, opting for a coffee maker, refrig, and HBO. After a visiting Jakarta, we were eager to start a long, relaxing visit in Bali. It was everything we had hoped for!The hotel is on a quiet street, off the main road, with lots of restaurants nearby. The staff are friendly and eager to answer questions, even drop you at a beach upon request. No charge. The beaches and the snorkeling are amazing! The complimentary breakfast is substantial: eggs, bread, sliced tomatoes, fresh fruit, coffee and tea.At any beach, the sand and clear blue water, or those sunsets - it's like nothing we had seen before. The hills above, the magnificent palms, the rice paddies, the colors. I would sit on the veranda and take in the scenery and the sounds. Falling asleep at night was the best. Occasionally, we saw something crawling around, and ushered it out to the veranda. And the deet mosquito repellant we brought did the trick! In the mornings, it was hard to decide whether to sit at the hotel pool and read for the day, take a trek into the mountains, visit one of the beaches to dive or snorkel, get into a boat and follow the coast, stop over at another island, or walk along the black beaches and watch the fishermen. Bali was intoxicating. This hotel was the perfect place, located in a great location on the island.

<Content>So near yet so far from the Madding crowd We stayed in Cendana this January (2008). It was what our travel agent recommended after our first choice - Tegal Sari, fell through as it was fully booked. In retrospect, it was for the best, as Cendana had all the atmosphere we wanted, plus a great big factor going for it...its location. Right on the main Monkey Forest road, but at the same time so well secluded that you felt you are in the midst of nature,,,what with the beautiful view of paddy fields outside your doorstep and the nightly orchestra of crickets and frogs. We were travelling with our 2 girls, one of them just 5 months, so the fact that we could leave them with the baby sitter (you can negotiate baby sitting rates)and do some shopping knowing that incase of any emergency we could reach the hotel within minutes was a great sense of relief. Infact most of what we wanted to see and do within Ubud town- the temple, the Balinese dance, the puppet show, the boutiques and the wonderful eating joints were all within stone's throw distance of the resort. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. Bathrooms were basic, but clean and bug free. It met all our needs and whatever extras we needed were provided for by the efficient staff of the resort. I loved the flower offerings left in front of the deities flanking the entrance to the rooms. Only a couple of downsides....the mattress could have been more comfortable, and you couldnt dream of leaving or entering the room without waking up the little one- opening and closing the wooden door led to one hell of a racket.The spa was pretty good as well and we even got some treatments done for our 5 year old , who had got nicley baked in the Sanur sun.All in all, for the price that you are paying, you cant ask for more. I have paid much more and stayed in less satisfacory properties. A very relaxing place with very good levels of service. I dont mind going back again and yet again.

<Content>I certainly will return to this wonderful place - what a find! Where to start?We had booked an amazingly overpriced villa at Kamandalu which is so far away from Ubud Centre ... We had some dinner in Monkey Forest Road and decided to look at a few places so we could move the next day. My first try was Komaneka Resort as I knew it was a good smart place to stay. Alas, fully booked the next two nights.We walked a few metres North and saw a sign pointing down a well paved  well lit Gng. (laneway) with manicured gardens/trees. You walk down the Gng. past a restaurant (apparently fantastic but we did not have time to try it out this stay)The staff showed usa Deluxe room and it wasn't being used that night so we arranged for the staff to collect us from Kamandalu the next morning.Nyoman, Cendanas embassador, was waiting for us at 10:00am in a lovely fresh clean vehicle and whisked us away from our nightmare stay at Kamandalu to a welcome relief that is Cendana.Cendana rooms are quite basic. The standard type rooms dont have fridge/TV - the Deluxe rooms do. But in staying to days we did not really need these two luxuries anyway!The bathroom was massive. The bed comfortable and the room clean.The staff are all very very nice and polite.The buffet breakfast that is included in the tariff is a good standard buffet.The spa centre located in a very tranquil position at the rear of the proprty was wonderful. There are all female practitioners, with one excpetion, Made. I had a very good massage and treatment with Made.The wonderful thing with Cendana is they will (subject to availabiltiy) ferry you ar9ound Ubud for no charge, we of course tipped generously during and at the end of our stay as we WANTED to!!! They will also negotiate the price with airport transfers etc and I thinkits only fair to at least cover the price of the petrol and make sure the driver has water/food!!!Enough of me -book Cendana - for a moderate price you will not be unhappy - you cannot get closer to the Temples, Palace, shops and market then this little property!

<Content>Accessible and nice My fiancee and I enjoyed the resort. Bargained a deluxe suite for USD70, plus complimentary transfer to airport on our departure day. Suite had a nice front porch facing the pool with two ample balcony seats, a small tablet with candles (for a romantic dinner just outside your own room). Compared to what other hotels in Ubud and Seminayk offerer, this was very good. Clean, no foul smell, spacious, roomy. It was centrally located which is a plus if you like to explore all the shops and Puras in Ubud.

<Content>2 Pools, Rice Paddy Views Good value for money at this mid-size (for Ubud) resort.Two good size pools, two areas of accomodation, and guests freely use each. Large amount of rice terraces, considering this is so centrally located. Excellent location in heart of Ubud, but nestled away from the street. Very restful atmosphere. Landscaped for sense of privacy, but room was a bit dark. Cockroach count: 1 big guy in otherwise spiffy  clean all-marble bathroom. Bathroom not the outdoor type that you see so much of in Bali. Nothing spectacular, but it is the most posh place in Ubud for the budget minded. Decor very Balinese, including Balinese carved doors.
