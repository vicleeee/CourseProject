<Content>Good Hotel for Business Downtown, stays at Swedish Hospital I stay at the Silver Cloud Hotel on Broadway 10 times per year or so. It is a good hotel for downtown business in Seattle, as it is fairly close, and not ridiculously overpriced like so many of the downtown hotels are. In addition the rooms are nice, especially for what you pay.The lobby is spacious, and has a nice fireplace that you can sit next to while waiting for friends/cabs/coworkers etc. The attached Cayenne Restaurant has competent fare for reasonable prices. The wait staff is rather impersonal though. The free breakfast that is available in the restaurant is self serve and includes cereals, waffles, yogurt, fruits etc. There is not a cook to order breakfast, but the selection is more than adequate for most tastes, and is better than the free breakfasts at most hotels that I stay at. Of course, being in the downtown/captiol hill area, there are innumerable great restaurants to choose from close to the hotel.The fitness room is nice, although a bit small. That's okay, however, because I have never encountered anyone else in the fitness center. The pool and hot tub are great. They are both indoors in the basement area, although you do have to walk through the parking garage (albeit a short distance) to access both the pool and fitness area.The rooms themselves are spacious, with the exception of a few per floor which are much smaller for some reason. The rooms have all been recently updated with new bedding and flat screen TV's which are very large and nice. There is complimentary wi-fi throughout the hotel. All rooms come with a microwave and refrigerator, although you would have to bring your own food as their pantry type store is very limited in it's content. The parking is located below the hotel for a fee. It is a bit tight, and I have heard several stories of people having problems parking larger vehicles there. All in all, based on what you get for the price, I would say that this hotel is a best kept secret for the area, which should be considered when looking for downtown lodging.

<Content>lovely hotel Choose this hotel for it's location to Seattle University. A lovely safe hotel, nicely appointed with Aveda products. Really fluffy towels and comfy bed and pillows. Only drawback is front facing rooms on Broadway have siren noise from hospital down the block. Ask for a room off of Broadway if you want quiet. Breakfast was good with premium coffees/teas/hot choc. they offer hard boiled eggs for those that want protein and not just carbs. Always lots of apples at front desk to grab on way in and out of hotel. Security was great with room key needed to access floors/garage during late hours. Front desk staff very friendly, extremely clean rooms  common areas. Easy to get to  from Fwy. Charge for parking garage ($16) but secured lot  lots of parking. I felt it was a fair charge. Did not use shuttle service but saw others utilizing it. Would definitely stay at this location or chain again!

<Content>Pleasant place where the price is right The Silver Cloud Broadway was a great place to stay during our 2-day visit to Seattle. The staff was friendly and provided good directions and tips on things to do around town. There is a good free breakfast at the restaurant next door and fresh fruit is available at the front desk for free all day.Our room was spacious, with a view of the community outside. There was a little fridge and the bathroom was large. The rooms were very clean and well-maintained.Though, there is not much going on in the neighborhood, the hotel is a short walk from some restaurants. Nearby is a friendly gay area of town with some cute shops and cafes that were occupied by gay and straight clients.If you don't mind walking for 15-20 minutes, the city center is a pleasant walk. We really enjoyed walking around Seattle. But, if you are not inclined to walk, the hotel has a free shuttle service which we did not use.The hotel has parking, a pool and hot tub. No complaints on this hotel. I would probably stay here again.

<Content>Had a great week at the Silver Cloud - loved the breakfast Silver Cloud Broadway is a very nice hotel! The rooms were great, beds comfortable, bathroom very clean. The little fridge, sink and microwave in the room were a nice convenience. A grocery store is just down the block. The breakfast was delicious every morning -so many choices!! I was stuffed each day. The location is pretty good, about a 10 minute walk to the convention center. Buses in Seattle are pretty easy to figure out also. The fitness center is small, but good for a quick AM workout. The pool was a bit chilly, but also good. I would definitely come back here again and recommend to all!

<Content>A perfect weekend My husband, 12 year old son and I went to Seattle for the weekend to have fun. We stayed three nights at the S.C. on Broadway. It is a bit out of walking distance of the downtown attractions but the complimentary shuttle is easy to use. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the decor was upscale from the box hotels. The rates were the same as the Holiday Inn or Travelodge but the feel was more elegant. The breakfast buffet is pretty basic; cereal, bagels, waffles; that type of stuff. We paid for parking in the underground garage but that's standard in the downtown area.The room was your basic two queens room with a comfy reading chair and ottoman and a well appointed desk. We were able to use wireless internet with our laptop for no additional fee. There is a large flat screen tv which is much nicer than a typical unit that takes a lot of space. The small things were nice; the hangers come off the rod. The towels are softer than your usual box hotel. There is a complimentary laundry room on each floor. The beds were super comfy. We didn't use the pool and spa but the area was clean. I used the small gym; it was unremarkable but does have a tv.We ordered dinner from room service (from the Cayenne Grille downstairs) and it was prompt and yummy. My Captain and Coke was just right and a at good price.We'll definitely stay again. I'm not sure what it is about the S.C.; it's not a remarkable hotel in any one area but the atmosphere and staff make you feel comfortable and just a bit pampered.Our son loved the hotel and highly recommends it, also.

<Content>Silver Cloud Hotel - Broadway WHAT A GREAT HOTEL! We have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel and we found it excellent! We booked it after reading other good reviews on TripAdvisor and we wanted to confirm what a great hotel it is. The staff were so friendly, knowledgeable about how to get to places - they even printed out info sheets detailing which bus to catch and which bus to transfer to when we asked for places to visit outside of their free shuttle service. We used their FREE shuttle quite a bit as we did not rent a vehicle during our stay. Our bedroom was a good size - especially for 4 of us living out of suitcases. It was close to a convenient grocery store for stocking your fridge (room has mini fridge and microwave). FREE breakfast in their restaurant was really good (waffles, boiled eggs that you could microwave, muffins, cereal and bagels, etc). I agree with many others here - the combination of free breakfast, free internet and a free shuttle service to key places in town make this hotel PERFECT.

<Content>Great Stay, Great Location We had a great stay at the Silver Cloud Hotel on Broadway at Madison. Having lived in the neighborhood before moving away, we didn't know what to expect from this hotel in a neighborhood underserved by hotels. We were very pleased with our stay. Our room, located on the top of six floors was of decent size with a king size bed. The wall-mounted flat screen TV was great. Although we didn't use it, the hotel has a pool and fitness center in the basement. Also included with the rate is a continental breakfast which we never saw as we had morning meetings during the entire stay.

<Content>Very good value for the price We found this an excellent base for a few days of touring. Hotel staff were great, room was large and comfortable, with a large bar area for arranging refreshments. (Also a convenient grocery store about two blocks away for stocking your fridge.) Breakfast in adjacent restaurant was fine, we were directed to an excellent restaurant a few blocks away for dinner, and there are casual college-neighborhood eating places nearby on Broadway. What was unbeatable, however, was the combination of free breakfast, free internet, free parking in the garage, and a free shuttle service to take you to and from the most popular tourist points in town.

<Content>silver cloud with gold service Great stay in Seattle. This was the first hotel room we ever booked on Hotwire.com. To our surprise the room and service exceeded our expectations. The room was huge with two large beds, wet bar, refrigerator and a 42 flat screen t.v. What surprised us the most however was the personal service. The front desk staff was great. They recommended restaurants and took time to ask how our day was when we returned to the hotel. Little things like the free shuttle, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and fresh apples in the lobby were nice.

<Content>Loved this hotel! I loved this hotel! We only stayed one night because we were headed up to Canada but the one night was VERY comfortable. The night we arrived the french door in our room had gotten off its track so the room was pretty chilly. We called the front desk about it and they came up and showed us to a new room immediately. The continental breakfast was also very tasty with lots of variety. My boyfriend and I noticed a lot of younger folks staying there- maybe it's because it has a sort of hip feel to it. This hotel was also very close to downtown seattle- we walked downtown in 10 minutes. We would definately stay here again!

<Content>Fantastic hotel - great free breakfast We stayed here on our way back to Vancouver from Portland before flying back to the UK. We had previously stayed at the Seattle Sheraton the week before which was really nice but almost twice the price of the Silver Cloud and very corporate.The room was very nice - quite contemporary in style, parking was easy and inexpensive, it has a pool and very friendly staff. The room was very comfortable with great beds and linens. Only problem with the bed is that it was so comfortable we nearly missed the complimentary breakfast! This would have been a disaster as this was exceptionally good!! Not a single other hotel we stayed at over the two week trip had a complimentary breakfast.The neighbourhood is pretty interesting. There's some cool stores and restaurants very nearby and we walked downtown in less than 10 minutes.

<Content>Ideal for the budget-concious We booked this hotel via an auction site and while it was represented as a 3.5 star (out of possible 4 stars for Seattle), I feel that is being overly generous. While the place is very clean and the front desk staff are lovely and helpful, it really is geared to the very budget-concious traveller and I would barely give it 3 stars. The location is the most remote of all downtown hotels on the city map (it's on the other side of the highway where most other hotels are situated between I-5 and the waterfront) and there was really nothing of interest to us in the vicinity of the hotel since we don't hang out at hospitals. This really brings down the value of the hotel, to my mind.The included breakfast was headache-inducing as there are not nearly enough staff to service the area. We, and many other people, ended up spending the majority of our time in the restaurant standing around waiting for things like cutlery, coffee, etc.The rooms are clean and our room was relatively quiet and the huge flatscreen tvs are great. We also appreciated the shuttle service to the actual downtown area. We would not stay here again (or ever use an auction site to book a room again to avoid this situation) but I would definitely recommend this to budget concious travellers.

<Content>Great stay! This hotel is a great value in Seattle. My husband and I were there for a wedding in June of 2007. We had original plans to stay at the Warwick. We were meeting my in laws and they had already checked into the Warwick and hated it. They found the Silver Cloud in Capital Hill. The public transportation (bus stop) is right at the corner of the hotel so it was really easy to get to shopping and Pike Place. When we checked in, the hotel did not have a standard room with a king bed so they upgraded us at no charge to the corner suite. It had a jacuzzi tub with a fireplace! Wonderful! The staff was very nice and helpful. They even called to place our dinner reservations. There is a complimentary breakfast every morning in the restaurant- delicious! Highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again in the future.

<Content>A budget, mini-W! A GREAT bang for the buck! We paid $159/nt. [I say mini-W because the lobby was pretty cool like the W's - complete w/a dark wood bowl of granny smiths to munch on, and mod-decor (albeit lighter than the W).] We were in town for my sister's wedding a whopping 1/2 mi. away - very convenient for us. Also close to Trader Joe's - a must-visit novelty for us when we come to Seattle - we're not blessed w/one where we live. FAB front desk staff - I mean ON it! CLEAN (!!) rooms w/comfy beds/bedding! Rooms were a bit small, but sufficient. Breakfast was tasty and just right - not to mention a wise use of their night-time restaurant/bar, which looked like it would be fun in the evening. Pool was clean, lovely and secluded (no gawking, or feeling like you were on display - I swim to exercise) - NICE! Parking was convenient, safe and well-concealed (not an eyesore).A little bit o' bad: Stayed in room on 5th floor facing front door / main entrance / street / courtyard. All I'm going to say is that the builder pulled a fast one on these folks when they purchased those super-duper cool slider/window things. They look double-paned and noise-proof-esque, but holy cow.... I could hear (literally) a man's whistling as he was walking down the sidewalk in front of the hotel... on the other side of the street! Suffice to say, you could hear everything else too. Got woken up often during the nights that we stayed.Would definitely stay here again, but will request room in different location to see if the noise situation would be improved. I hope so, because everything else was great!!

<Content>Decent Stay in a Great City Silver Cloud had a fantastic front desk staff - very welcoming, friendlly, and humorous. The hotel itself is what you'd expect from a 3 star hotel -- no incredible amenities, but everything was clean and in working order. It was fairly accessible to most Settle sites and provided a good central location for walking points around the city.

<Content>My stay at the Silver Cloud Broadway in Seattle I just came back from a week in Seattle and I stayed at the Silver Cloud. I feel my stay at the hotel was the best ever!! The front desk staff was very helpful in arranging my Seattle and Mt. Rainer Tours. They called in my request and made sure the pick up times were accurate. My room was very clean and quiet. Overall the stay was very pleasant. It was nice to use the free washer and dryer the last day of vacation. The location of the hotel was great as there is a major grocery store about two blocks away and a Walgreens a block further. The complimentary breakfast was a nice feature!! I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel and had no problems or complaints. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Nice Hotel on Capitol hill My fiance and I have stayed at this hotel every time we visit Seattle. It is close to our favorite shops and restaurants on Broadway. Not to mention hip bars up and down the cross streets. The hotel itself is clean, comfy and the staff is always pleasant. I would recommend this hotel to just about anyone looking for a decent hotel in a fun area. Downtown is a short walk or bus ride down the hill.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed here after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor and also after doing some research on the area. The hotel is cheaper to stay in if you book through a hotel site. Value for money though, a 3 star hotel that is succeeding in being a 4 star hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are a good size and clean. The breakfasts are really good, good choice. Great location for local bars and restaurants (check out Kingfish Cafeat 19th and Mercer, Fantastic southern food!). Good local and student area full of real people and not tourists. Can e noisy at times with the Hospital but thats a small thing to put up with. Would definately stay here again. Stayed an extra 3 nights. Check out Victrola Coffee on Pike St as well.

<Content>Great place to stay We arrived quite late at night from the east coast and were greeted warmly by the front desk. The room was large and very comfortable and the bathroom was huge.There was free internet access beside the lobby. The complimentary breakfast was good. The indoor pool was also nice.The courtesy shuttle bus was a useful addition.All in all, a very pleasant stay, and we would definitely go back.

<Content>Sleepless in Seattle 2: Avoid room 233! The positives:Most of the front desk staff were incredibly nice and helpful. Free breakfast with waffles, muffins, breads, danish, bagels, fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, assorted cereals, and juices. Great coffee in the lobby and at the restaurant.Aveda toiletriesThe negatives:I had a room that directly overlooked the alley between the hotel and IHOP next door. This alley housed the dumpsters which were emptied at 3am and 5am. I was on the 2nd floor (room 233) directly over where the trucks were parked so got the sounds of breaking glass loud and clear. No sleep at all after having arrived from the east coast well after midnight.After the 5am garbage truck wake-up call, I gave up on sleep, took a shower, and went downstairs to speak to the front desk clerks. They were sympathetic but said oh yes, the garbage trucks. I asked to be moved, but the hotel was booked. They said I could come back around at 10 or 11am to check but they were booked solid again that night. Meanwhile I had to go to business meetings in Bellevue on no sleep.I called my corporate travel agency and asked to be moved to a sister hotel in Bellevue. The agent arranged it but told me that the front desk manager (Tammy) was upset that I had not given the hotel a chance to rectify the situation!!!! Apparently she had not been notified of my 6am conversation with her staff. Tammy then told the agent that she would refund my remaining 2 night prepaid stay if I got there by 2pm; it was 1:20pm at this point so I had to rush to Seattle from Bellevue, and surprise! there was heavy traffic in Seattle. Anyway I made it there and happily checked out.My stay at the Silver Cloud Eastgate was far more pleasant and restful. The Silver Cloud Broadway needs to reconsider subjecting guests to the ridiculous racket that seems to be a regular occurrence given the nonchalance of the staff to my complaint. Otherwise guests beware of the 2nd floor alley rooms.

<Content>Wonderful! The Hotel is in a great neighbourhood. There are coffee shops  other stores down the street. It feels safe at night. You could walk to all the attractions and sights and shops downtown in a few minutes downhill. They also had a free shuttle service that would take you downhill  pick you up. The hotel itself was very nice and new. The rooms were quite large and nicely decorated  clean. The staff were extremely nice as well! The continental breakfast was great, they had lots of options, even oatmeal and boiled eggs. They also had apples in the front lobby and very nice areas to relax. Some of the more expensive hotels we passed downtown seemed to be in areas that weren't so safe at night. I would stay at this hotel again next time.

<Content>GREAT, best choice I looked at the other hotels near the hospital, and some are pretty nice, but asked at the hospital and one staffer recommend this one above the others - and she was so right!It was closest to the maternity area of the hospital, they had free laundry machines, VERY Clean and Comfortable rooms. The bed was great, the decor was wonderful, very spacious, and quiet. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and that same restaurant is great all day long.They were less expensive than the other hotels in the area, but I don't think I could have enjoyed any place more, and I usually enjoy the posh hotels. This one even had a nice bar area in the room for heating up leftovers, nice sized fridge, sink and granite counter top. The gym could have been nicer - I prefer the equipment with built in TV screens and a room with more color. The fitness room had some cardio machines and that was all that I noticed, along with the pool -they were separated by glass walls. All this is an underground extension of the basement parking, so not much charm or color -a little attention to add color to the walls, or something to make it more inviting would be a huge improvement for little effort. But the basic necessities were there and had promise.

<Content>OK for business This is a great hotel for business but not for a romantic get away. My partner and I booked through hotwire so we took the risk. The hotel itself is perfectly fine - the location isn't great through. It is quite far from downtown BUT there is a shuttle service...although it's not as regular as it claims to be. Cabs are about $10 to town as long as there isn't any traffic. The hotel was clean and the rooms were big - there is a pool and smallish gym. I will mention though, the continental breakfast was pretty good- scones, pastries, cereal, fruit and they had a make your own waffle station!

<Content>Great place! My husband and I stayed at the Silver Cloud Broadway for 4 days in mid-October. We thought it was great! Our room had a king size bed with a microwave oven and frig. We had our laptop and the internet connection worked great. We thought the pressure in the shower was awesome and the curtains kept the light from coming in so it was super dark in the morning, which we like. It's little things like that that make a big difference. We didn't hear any of our neighbors (we later traveled to 2 other locations and stayed in cheaper hotels where we could hear everything.) The breakfast was fine. The first day there weren't any eggs but everytime afterwards, there were hard boiled eggs. The coffee was delicious and the waffle maker was fun. They had the other usual things, bagels, danishes, yogurt, fruit and juice. We didn't rent a car and had to rely on the buses. The front desk couldn't provide too much assistance on the buses. The shuttle van is good for downtown locations only and the driver was very friendly. I would recommend this place to all my friends.

<Content>Great Hotel with many conviences! This Hotel is located about 1 mile from downtown Seattle. My daughter is attending Seattle University and the hotel is right across the street. It is 2 years old, very clean, and spacious. They include a deluxe continental breakfast with make your own waffles. No breakfast meats or eggs, but enough to fill you up. IHOP is right next door if you want a heavy breakfast.This hotel offers so many conviences that I would stay here again over being in downtown like I normally stay. They have a large shuttle bus that holds 14 passengers that leaves the hotel every 30 minutes to drop you off to places like the wharf, Pike's market, downtown, and even to Qwest field for the Seahawks game. They will also pick you up when you call them up to at least 10pm.They have a complimentary laundry area, business center with printer (very convenient for Web check-ins), coffee in the lobby and a big screen TV in the lobby and lounge area to relax. The staff and drivers are very friendly and helpful. They offer discounts to Seattle U parents. Parking is $14 a day.I was very happy staying here!

<Content>We loved our stay at Silver Cloud Great place to stay in Seattle. The rooms were very comfortable and larger than we are used to in San Diego. A fridge and microwave was a real plus. The beds were the most comfortable! The continental breakfast was great! The lobby was nice and had coffee and tea at all times of the day. The hotel is not in the downtown area which was fine with me as it was quiet for sleeping. Very convenient to catch a cab or a shuttle to the Pikes Place, Needle, Aquarium, etc.. I usually have a problem sleeping in a hotel the first night but not here. I was delighted. I only wish our stay was longer here. I will most certainly stay here again. The price was very reasonable for all the amenities.

<Content>Great Place We were in Seattle for a wedding. In addition to my family of four, my extended family took up at least 6 more rooms. We had a room with two queen beds and there was plenty of space for us and our children (ages 11  3). The room was clean and having a microwave and refrigerator in our room was great for the kids. It was also very easy to get around in the hotel. I didn't have to worry about my 11 year old getting lost trying to run back up to our room to get something. The staff was terrific and friendly. The shuttle service was a great way to get around to the fun places without a car and the shuttle drivers were super friendly (particularly Monica). We were able to get everywhere we had wanted to go using the shuttle. It was also nice to have free internet access down in the lobby.The breakfast was convenient and my kids loved making their own waffles! The food at Cayenne was fine and the people who worked there were really friendly. The only complaint I have for our entire trip was Cayenne's inability to divide checks at least by table (I understand not wanting to manage 20 single person checks). However, making us do the work of working out payment from 20 people was more frustrating to us than it would have been for them to divide the group in to the four tables we took up. This was the only not-customer oriented experience we had on our trip. I would suggest they change that policy and I'm also guessing that their tips would be better broken out in to smaller checks.Other than that, it was our first trip to Seattle and we had a wonderful time. We will definately stay at the Silver Cloud Hotel again. Thanks.

<Content>Looks nice; not all there A number of small problems:1) We originally booked a standard room with two queen beds. We read on their Web site that they had suites with a kitchenette so we called to ask about getting a room with a kitchenette. They upgraded us to a suite. Come to find out after upgrading that the standard 2-bed rooms have the same kitchenette (actually a fridge and microwave). Seems like they took advantage of our lack of knowledge of their facilities.2) Pool was COLD. What is it with hotels that makes them think their pool should be 75 degrees? The manager should be forced to jump in the pool every morning to test the temperature. That renders the pool unusable.3) The TV in the living area of our suite would work for a while, then quit responding to commands from the remote control. Maintenance guy couldn't make it work either.4) The free shuttle doesn't go to the tourist areas, just to business destiniations. This isn't clear on their Web site, which seemed to indicate they'd take you anywhere downtown. Apparently the EMP/Space Needle area isn't downtown. Looks downtown to me. They say they MIGHT take you there but it's up to the driver. We didn't want to get there in the morning and not be able to get back inthe afternoon because the driver decided he didn't want to do it.5) Information about local restaurants was out of date. One restaurant we walked to turned out to be closed. The neighborhood is very questionable. I wouldn't want to be out after dark.Some positives:1) Free washer/dryers on each floor.2) Breakfast buffet.3) Contrary to one other reviewer's experience, they have two parking areas. One is especially made for tall vehicles like our 9-passenger van. It was funny because all the SUV owners parked in the big car lot even though their SUVs would fit fine in the regular parking area. My experience is that SUV owners like to think of themselves as bigger than they really are, and this supported my hypothesis. :-)I don't know that I'd come back here. I don't like the neighborhood and the staff seems unable to fix the problems with the facilities and service.

<Content>Loved my stay I was in Seattle on a lovely trip with my two kids. We had never heard of SIlver Cloud Hotels before this stay, I have to say that I will stay with them again. The front desk was so great and helpful that I felt as if I knew them by the second night of my stay there. The Indoor Pool and Spa was such a great way to have the kids end their day. The earth tones that are found throughout the hotel was wonderful and made us all feel right at home. This hotel only being 2 years old is a wonderful place for anyone to stay. I would recommend it to anyone that is coming to the Seattle Area. I want to thank all staff for making my and my childrens stay wonderful in Seattle.

<Content>Very comfortable stay! Myself, my husband and 2 of our friends stayed overnight on May 27th at the Silver Cloud on Broadway the night before our cruise ship sailed. We stayed on June 4th for an extra day in Seattle on the back end of the cruise too.The staff was very helpful and let us put all our luggage out in the back after checking out on May 28th so we could do some sightseeing in the morning before boarding our ship. Then on Sunday the 4th, we disembarked pretty early from our ship but were able to check right in as they had a room available. The beds were VERY comfortable and linens were soft and smooth. We took advantage of the shuttle to various downtown areas to do some sightseeing both times. The staff was very helpful with recommendations and calling various transportation to get us to the port.We really enjoyed the fire that was lit in the fireplace as it was a bit cool outside. The glass slider doors could use some weather sealing or something in both the rooms we used, since there were significant air leaks. The door came right off the track when trying to open it in one room! I'd still stay there again though as it was very clean and the breakfast was great! They even had a protein choice - lots of hard boiled eggs! Not to mention Tully's coffee. VERY good!

<Content>O.K. But Short on Class Stayed there a week. It looks like a nicer hotel than it is. On the plus side, the room are of good size, well appointed, and nice. The indoor pool is nice. The continental breakfast is more than just a few danish selections and coffee. The lobby is very nice. Now, as to the issues that annoyed me:1. There is no bell captain to help you on arrival. It looks like a hotel that would have this service, so one is disappointed when you have to lug the luggage yourself.2. There is a lady who sits at a desk that looks like she may be a concierge, but I'm not sure as she also looks like a secretary that has been misplaced from the office suite. She is not very friendly, not very helpful, and not worth tipping.3. The restaurant Cyanne has an ecletic menu and a nice setting, but the staff is wholly untrained and just a mess. Horrible!!! They are nice, but incompetent.l. The food is average at best, and if you're just too tired to move outside to Broadway and get a decent meal, it will pass. Reminds me of Denny's food...that's where you settle.4. The garage is tiny, and do not rent or take a big car like I did. The turns are extremely tight, and the parking places are made for mini-coopers. At $14 a night, it seems that they should pay you hazard pay to drive there. Also, there is no valet to park your car. Again, the hotel is set up to have a valet but no valet.5. I had a rate of $124 a night, and though this is a good rate, along with added taxes and parking it was not outlandish, but I would have paid a little more for a little more class. It looks like you are going to get a great hotel, and then it just doesn't show up.6. I will probably stay there again, but this time I will come in with lower expectations and be more comfortable.

<Content>Great Place! I stayed at the Silver Cloud on Broadway for a 2 night business trip just this past week. It was great! The bed was very comfortable, great food in the Cayenne Restaurant/Bar and the shuttle runs approximately every 30 minutes and takes you downtown or to the waterfront. The room was very nice and it had a small microwave and small fridge, desk with internet access, TV, king sized bed, chaise lounge chair and separate bar area with small fridge. There is a 24 hour tea and coffee (Tulley's coffee) bar in the hotel lobby. The hotel had several places to eat with easy walking distance and a Starbuck's, Tulley's coffee, QFC grocery store all near by. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!

<Content>Staff makes this a Great stay Forget about the rooms do not have wireless internet service. All of the front desk staff are truly professional. Rooms were very clean and well appointed. The garage had plenty of parking on a Saturday night. The continental breakfast at Cayenne Restaurant was adequate. I will return again.

<Content>Great Hotel Silver Cloud on Broadway is a great location for Gay Visitors and very close to Downtown. Though their community isn't compairable to The Castro in SF, so don't get your hopes up. The attached Cayenne Restaurant is wonderful. Great staff with great service. I had the NY Steak one night, it was absoulutely wonderful. Compliments to the Chef.I travel to Seattle at least once a month on business. The staff has always been courteous and helpful. The Concierge has gone out of his way twice to get me information. The General Manager and Director of Sales met me in the lobby. Very courteous and helpful as well. The rooms are a good size, very comfortable. They are very clean and have a great scent to them.I will continue to make my reservations at this Hotel for each visit.

<Content>A gem of a hotel Silver Cloud Inns has several hotels in Washington and Oregon; but I have not see any others.This one was recommended to me since it was nearest to my relative's house. It is also close to several hospitals and Seattle University. I would consider it a midtown location, very convienient to most of Seattle. The hotel offers shuttle service to several touirst areas, none of which I was going to this trip. $12 for parking in their lot though was stiff. However, in times of bad weather and at night, it's nice to be in a covered, and secure parking lot just under the hotel. This is a new hotel and as such is very clean. It has a comfortable, contemporary style in the lobby and the rooms, nothing looked overdone or pretentious. However, nothing appeared to be very environmental except for the energy saving light bulbs and the request to not waste water by asking for fresh linens daily. The shower heads do not appear to be water saver. Nor were any of the fabrics very earth friendly. Even the pillows on the bed were foam.The staff were all very helpful, courteous, and intelligent.As for the bar and restaurant, I can't say much. I had a drink at the bar that was very expensive, even for a top shelf vodak. The barteneder - Seth was a good guy though and the bar company was pleasant enough.The breakfast buffet was vast. But I felt there were far too many unhealthy pastries and not enough protein choices. There is an International House of Pancackes (IHOP) next door to the hotel, and many other, much better places to eat very close by. The things I found most unpleasant were the cold draft near the elevators coming from the parking garages below, and getting to the pool/spa/workout room. There are what appear to be closed wind block areas in front of each elevator in the garage but, there are large gaps under the doors, allowing the cold to easily seep in. To get to the pool/spa and excercise rooms, you have tomake a short walk across the 1st level parking garage. It was freezing cold so, not the best solution. It would be better to have a connection from inside the hotel. Also,a warmer changing area would be nice too.

<Content>Silver Cloud was Great! We stayed at the Silver Cloud from Nov 11-13th...we traveled to Seattle to watch a Seahawks game.Staff for front desk, maid service, shuttle service were all exceptional and very helpful.Rooms were clean (although freezing cold upon our arrival...quickly warmed up). Good location...not far from downtown and Pike's place. The shuttle was EXTREMELY convenient. They also do pick-ups...we only had to call a cab one time the whole weekend. The shuttle also took us to the stadium and picked us up.We walked to a little Italian restuarant a block away (La Spiga) that was wonderful...very quaint and authentic.Overall a great stay!

<Content>A nice place at a great price A short to cover things not covered before. I believe everyone gets a free breakfast buffet which is a good continentel, coffee juice toasters, cereals, hard boiled eggs, etc. I also ahve eaten in the Cayenne and the food is good and reasonably priced. Get a room away from the main streets and it has little noice. the rooms are cookie cutter but they are clean and free internet and a great location. With the free parking and breakfast you save about $30-40 a day over other hotels in this mid range price. Nice people very helpful and they make the hotel work.

<Content>Great Value and friendly staff!!! I stayed at the Silver Cloud during Labor Day weekend for 3 nights. What a great place to stay! Excellent location and only a few blocks to some great shopping and eateries. If you are concerned about not being right downtown, no problem! The hotel offers regular shuttle service to most areas in the city and they will even pick you up when you are done. One thing I find with Seattle is that the city layout can be quite confusing, so we opted to use the shuttle service! The hotel is very clean, the rooms were large and even though we had 4 adults in the room, we had more than enough space and did not feel crammed at all. My only concern would have to be that the bed sheets and pillows seemed kind of old and were not very soft. But that was the least of our concerns when we got such an amazing rate and location. Very close to the gay district, just a few blocks to some good bars! The restaurant attached has some great happy hour specials and the staff are friendly and efficient. The room service menu was very small which wasn鈥檛 fun but we ended up having a great time in the restaurant anyway. I was very impressed with the reservationists as well. Upon check-in we were greeted by the lovely and very CUTE front desk clerk 鈥淩oss鈥?who was very professional and polite. (Needless to say we requested him when we needed room service!). They also had a HUGE pool and fitness centre that is open 24/7!! Over-all, if you are looking to save money and stay at a great 3 star property with 4 star quality and service, stay at the Silver Cloud Hotel on Broadway! We will be back!

<Content>Nice rooms Good location if you are a gay visitor looking to be close to nightlife. Rooms are not the largest, but the king jacuzzi suites are well-appointed. Very good value.

<Content>Very Comfortable Hotel Me and my girls were guests at the Silver Cloud a few days ago. We liked the hotel, and would stay there again. I loved the neighborhood! It's lively and has a lot of good restaurants within walking distance. Our room was clean and comfortable, and the front desk staff was very nice and helpful. We would stay there again. Oh, and they serve a continental breakfast with a waffle station, which my girls really appreciated.

<Content>Two Stays -- Good access to Conference Center / Paramount I stayed for a conference at the Seattle Conference Center (over the freeway) and for a Bob Dylan concert at Paramount. The hotel location on Broadway is very walkable to these locations (10 blocks or so) or use the free shuttle. Great hospital, Seattle Univ. access and an interesting part of town being on Broadway. Walk a block or two to Pine or Pike for some of the more interesting bars in Seattle. The hotel has a restaurant, but for most other choices you'll need the shuttle, car, or taxi. While not being right downtown, you are very close--and save on parking costs ($12 vs. $20+)--easy access to I-90 (east/west) on city streets as well as I-5 (north/south). Silver Cloud does offer a rewards program for frequent guests.

<Content>We'd stay there again The Silver Cloud was chosen blind from the Internet. It turned out to be a good choice.Despite not being exactly downtown (it's near the university and major hospitals), the hotel was convenient because ... ta-daaa ... it has a complimentary shuttle service which runs you virtually anywhere within a 5-mile radius -- and that includes all the good tourist bits like Pike Market, waterfront, Pioneer Square, downtown shopping and so on.The hotel is unpretentious from the outside, but very clean and well maintained inside. It's only a couple of years old and it shows. The rooms still have an almost new feel to them. Furniture and fittings are good, solid pieces and the rooms are larger rather than smaller. Air-conditioning was easy to use and effective. There was a complimentary Continental-plus breakfast each morning, which included fresh fruit salad, cereals, yoghurt, waffles, toast and preserves, juice, coffee, hardboiled eggs and a personal favourite -- cream cheese and fresh bagels.Despite being on a relatively busy intersection, we were never bothered by the traffic, apart from one or two ambulances, but hey ...'Cayenne', the attached bar/restaurant was a nice place for an evening drink and meal, though some would find it a little sterile in its furnishings and once or twice, the noise was a bit much as it reflected off the hard surfaces. That said, the food was freshly cooked, plentiful and reasonably priced.We enjoyed our stay and, with one slight exception, found the staff to be ultra-helpful and pleasant. There is a very comprehensive spa and exercise room available for guests to use, complimentary and open until late at night.My wife and I would both stay there again in a flash.

<Content>A Northwest Hotel Chain that gives good value I stayed at this brand new hotel on business and booked at the last minute. The chain is a Northwest chain with hotels around Puget Sound. It shows. This hotel understood the Northwest Traveler.When I arrived late on a Friday evening, I entered an immaculate lobby complete with fresh coffee as you enterred (the latter is a MUST for the Northwest coffee hound. It was a good local brand).The staff did their best to get me a quiet room on the top most floor. I was not greeted with the disdain and condescension I usually get for booking on Expedia, arriving late and asking for a quiet room. The clerk assured me that I could change my room if it was not quiet enough.When I opened the door to my room, I saw a room much larger than I usually get for a standard room, complete with coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator. The room was extremely quiet. It had tasteful and elegant new furniture and an lovely view of a courtyard and treelined street. The refrigerator was away from the bed which is helpful when I am trying to fall asleep.The hotel is right across the street from Seattle University. It is a very convenient walk to any event there. It is also very close to the hospitals located on First Hill. This hotel had the right blend of responsiveness and inobtrusiveness. The staff was very responsive and quick to meet all of the requests I made later that evening.However, I was not interrupted by staff while trying to work. Having visited several hotels I know that I cannot always assume that I will be left alone, especially at a luxury hotel which may interrupt me to offer things that I don't want.I was also quite pleased that parking is by keycard in a garage below the hotel, accessible by elevator. I could easily access my car if I forgot something or wanted to pack up before checking out, without the inconvenience of checking luggage at the desk or valet service if I am leaving later that day.In addition, for no additional fee, the staff let me keep my car at the hotel after checking out.Another charming feature is their wake up service. The clerk called to wake me up. A few minutes later the housekeeper appeared at my door to make sure that I was awake on time. She greeted me with a smile and handed me a free copy of the Seattle Times.I had the freedom to access my car, make a quick meal with a microwave or make my own coffee day or night at my own convenience. However, they do provide room service. When I needed something, the staff was prompt and friendly. I felt very safe. The other visitors must have been happy too. They were very friendly and helpful, probably because they were pleased with the hotel.The only changes I would suggest are a Seattle brand of coffee in the rooms and a trash barrel inside the garage at each level right outside the glass door/ key card access area for the elevator. The latter will keep the garage areas clean.This hotel is well worth its reasonable cost.You can do a virtual web tour of this hotel which is an accurate reflection of its decor.
