<Content>Very average hotel I actually spent a day at this hotel , visiting my ex-husband when he was in town...I cannot believe people who reviewed this hotel expected so much! The price for most nights is average $165 and it is , after all, a 3.5 star hotel! given that Sydney is not that cheap (to stay in or near the city centre) I am not sure why people would expect so much. It used to be a TRAVELODGE for goodness sake! Travelodge = AVERAGE in my extensive travel experience of the world. Why anybody coming to Sydney would particularly want to stay in this area I dont know, I wouldnt .... but then I am a local Sydneysider...Look there are lots of alternatives to staying next to what locals know as drug park  i.e. Rushcutters Bay Park. This park is known by locals to be full of syringes from addicts hitting up after wandering down from drug  hooker central (Kings Cross) which is a mere 5 minute walk from this hotel. Yes, it's not far to get to the city centre, Opera House, shops, QVB etc but if you research a bit more and be realistic about what price buys you in hotels then disappointed you won't be next time... when you DONT book VIBE Hotel Rushcutters Bay. I would never recommend this hotel to out of town clients or friends of mine. My ex-husband was only staying at this hotel as his (Mean) company put him up there on business. He wouldnt have chosen it himself in a fit!There are so many great places to stay in Sydney... if you went up the road to Woollahra, a much nicer suburb and looked at The Hughenden Hotel (boutique hotel) for a similar price as VIBE then you would have a much better experience!

<Content>got a view of the drain next door... and ALOT of rubbish I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend as we attended the annual CLEO swimsuit launch party.It was very easy to find and were booked with a king size bed.Upon arriving, reception seemed dull and not very happy to be at work. But were ok to us.Our room was on the 1st floor and upon opening the door could smell cigarette smoke coming from the airconditioning vents.I was also woken up in the middle of the night as the smell was YUK!Upon opening our blinds to see the view outside... all we saw was AWFUL rubbish and the drain...Our 'king' size bed, was actually 2 single beds joined together. We found this out by the zipper sticking into my boyfriends back. But to our surprise, the beds were comfy, which i was very relieved.We ordered room service. That was actually nice. I had a caesar salad which was good. The price for that was ok too.Bathroom was ok. a few marks, but at least it was a toilet and shower, which was all we needed.Ckeck out was quick and easy and car was parked in a secure park under the hotel. But beware, It SMELLS of the drain next to the hotel.I wouldnt stay here again, but at least we could sleep somewhere for the night, that wasnt in the middle of the city.

<Content>Waste of Money Stayed here and was thoroughly dissapointed. Staff were rude, marks all over the walls, very cheap furniture and flimsy beds. The pool up top is nice, but it wasn't heated as it was supposed to be. Don't be fooled by your view of the park room, my park view' also included a view of bayswater road.. this place is trying to be like a W but has a long way to go. Plus it's out of the way from everything. Book a BB in Potts Point instead.

<Content>reasonable hotel and price for Sydney I stayed here for business and it was a perfectly good hotel with a reasonable price and reasonable location. I felt that I paid a bit too much for the hotel quality and location - but was pretty reasonable.the room was great - decent size, really new fixtures and fittings - nice bathroom, usual range of toiletries, decent towels (although the size of postage stamps). I stayed on the side of the hotel with a view of the park - well really a giant fig tree which kinda blocked out the park - but was nice. spotlessly clean,. the only complaint was that they didn't have sheets. they had a light doona encased in sheeting material - and for summer it was just too hot. I t seemed silly to run the a/c to make the room cold enough to sleep. Breakfast buffet in the morning was OK - a very large range - including to suit chinese diners - again at $22.50 was a just a tad extra than it was worth. Quality was marginal. Parking cost $16 per night. we walked up the street to a restaurant which was fine and reasonably priced.

<Content>Great loved the place Stayed for a couple of nights and loved the place. Just out of the hustle bustle of the city so great for anyone driving  not wanting to go right into the city or people who don't mind travelling a couple of stops on the train to get into the city. The staff were friendly and efficient, the rooms were clean and bright modern design. Had dinner in the restaurant and it was lovely! The breakfast was fabulous and so worth getting. Smoked salmon was my favourite along with everything else you could imagine - this was my favourite part of the stay!!Lovely leafy, quiet spot, you can walk to the yacht club and its a great little morning walk, very pretty that you wouldn't think you are in the city. The restaurant area is in a nice spot and you can in or outside. The pool area is excellent too.I would reccommend this property to any travellers. Thanks Lisa.

<Content>What a disappointment I was really looking forward to staying at this hotel but the whole experience was extraordinarily disapointing. Rooms were okay and the service was so so....but for a hotel of that standard, the feel was really poor. And the rates? Give me a break. I got to pay over $50 dollars a day for the internet which turned out to be 1/3 of the cost of the room! Not to mention that it did not work in every room and I was made to change rooms 3 times in order to get a room where it worked. In this day and age, all rooms should have internet and frankly, it really ought to be free...I stayed there for 4 days and must have financed the internet consumption of a small village in the bush! Would not recommend it.

<Content>good value This hotel was a good price which is why we stayed there. For the price theres not too much to complain about, however it did feel like some corners were cut. e.g bathroom door didnt go all the way to the floor.the room itself was also pretty small. There was no where to sit apart from the bed.if you want a place to crash for one or two nights max, and dont plan on spending any othe time in your room, this hotel would be ok.

<Content>Loved The Vibe Stayed at the Vibe Hotel for a week in March 2007 and thought what a comfortable nice place it was to stay. Location adjacent to Rushcutters Bay, park and waterfront very pleasant - of course if you want to be right in Circular Quay this won't be the hotel for you. But taxis and buses are cheap and plentiful so no problem in getting around.Positives: good modern rooms, nicely presented, clean, good bar and restaurant, internet access, friendly staff. I cannot believe how some people complain about hotel staff, if you are polite and friendly and smile, normally they will reciprocate. Negatives: the number of tour groups - Japanese mainly but some English and Chinese - may be offputting to the independent traveller and do clutter up the reception at times, but this happens in most city hotels. As mentioned, the hotel may not be central enough for some.Depending on what rate you pay, I thought the Vibe was a good option for staying in Sydney which is a fabulous city and deserves 5-7 days at least for sightseeing. Besides the Opera House, Harbour Bridge, harbour trips, beaches, Darling Harbour - Aquarium etc, Botanical Gardens, Hyde Park Barracks Museum - fascinating account of convict life in Sydney  immigration, Art Museum, Zoo, the list goes on and on, - there is also the Blue Mountains, Hunter Valley wine area, wildlife parks and lots of other stuff to see around Sydney. Recommended.

<Content>Rude Hotel Workers I would not recommend this hotel to anyone if you are looking for a place that deals with their customers in a professional way. The staff here are very rude, made no attempt to compensate me for my disastrous nights stay and would not point me in the direction of another hotel in the area after my complaint. I was basicaly told well, we have your money now, this hotel has a no cancellation policy, see-ya. As a frequent hotel stayer, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>The Vibe is a Bit Vapid Reviewer: Christina  UddyDate: February 5th We stayed here one night when our preferred choice, The Altamont, was fully booked. The Vibe wasn't all that. While the location was fine-next to a beautiful park and marina, the staff were not that friendly and the internet service was quite expensive. At one point, the lobby and elevator area was starting to look like a grocery store parking lot with all of the luggage carts shamefully hanging around. The room was clean and the bathroom spacious, but overall, the Vibe seemed to be striving too hard to be hip and yet missed the mark still.

<Content>Great value! This is a great value, 4 star hotel.I paid $110 for a night, and for this price got a great king bed room, with a large bathroom.It is not luxury, but for $110 a night, the hotel is very comfortable and clean. The beds are great, with nice linen.Room service and mini bar are also very reasonably priced.I would happily return at the price I paid, it was a great deal!

<Content>Average Hotel in a great location I stayed 3 nights at this hotel. I wanted peace and quiet and easy access to the sailing marinas, yet to be in walking distance to Darlinghurst.Although I had booked a superior Parkview room, I opted, on inspection, to downgrade to a standard room. The standard room (though without view of the Park or the marina) was slightly larger than the Parkview room! And quieter because there were late night parties (with blaring music) going on directly below the Parkview rooms. Anyway I got my peace and quiet and easy walking to the Marina.I was a bit taken aback at the rooms and the general feel of the Hotel. The rooms and bathrooms were small / medium sized. Likewise, the bathroom. It was a no-fuss, no-frills room. The general feel of the hotel, reception, lounge etc did not seem to me to be a 4 star hotel. It reminded me of the 3 star european chain hotels - a bit plasticky.The check in and staff were helpful in shuffling me about and handling my whims and fancies. They were also very helpful and knowledgeable about restaurants and places to go shopping. I needed a traveller's multiplug and sicssors, and newspapers. No problems - immediate with a smile.The hotel is next door to a provision store and a pub. So drinks and snacks were cheap - no need to spend huge sums of money on these at the hotel.A 10 minute walk to / from Kings Cross / Darlinghurst. Great for entertainment/nice meals/drinks A short 10 minute taxi ride to St George, Town Hall, etc for great shopping. Overall, not a bad but not a wonderful place to stay.

<Content>Comfortable but has no vibe We stayed at the Vibe after a very long flight from Singapore. Beds were very comfortable and facilities were excellent particularly the pool. But the hotel just seemed to be poorly managed. Though staff at reception were friendly. Breakfast staff just didn't seem interested in serving you breakfast.We thought it was overpriced and lacked character so we checked out and stayed at a smaller but in the middle of it all hotel in Darlinghurst road.This is a decent hotel but I'm sure you can get better for the money.

<Content>go somewhere else This place could be called FAULTY TOWERS. We spent several days here, and the only reason we did not leave was becasue this was the only hotel situated near to the place we had to be. And, after two weeks of fabulous travel in NZ, we did not want to pack up yet again.The staff is poorly trained, though try to accomodate. Wake up calls never came, mesages were not delivered, the sheets were not changed on daily basis, the in room interent did not work. We changed rooms 4 times in 7 days. The in room safe did not work in any of the rooms. One day, they forgot to make up the room--and when we returned in late afternoon, the maid staff had left.This place caters to large Asian groups who come in for a day or 2 and spend little time in rooms---although I heard a few screamimg at the staff in their native languages. Try somewhere else. Sydney is a beautiul city full of much better accomodations.

<Content>Good value hotel This hotel is a good value for a modern, stylish hotel in Sydney. We shopped around and compared this against the W and the Sebel Pier One and the price for this is substantially lower. Granted, it's not as nice as the W or Pier One, but it does has a similar modern feel. It has a nice bar attached to it and the restaurant has a good breakfast buffet.A few things to be aware of:1) The location is a little out of the central area. You will need to take a bus to get to the Harbour area, Circular Quay, etc. It's not a long ride - maybe 10 minutes or so - and it's fun to ride the bus with people going to work. We stayed here almost a week and we took the bus everywhere. The Kings Cross area is within walking distance of the hotel. 2) The rooms are small. They are hip and modern, but they are small. 3) Realize that it's a good value sort of place - it's not a luxury hotel. It's a mid-range boutique hotel. I think the photos on the web site make it seem more upscale than it is. If you don't go in expecting a 5-star experience, you will be pleasantly surprised.

<Content>Great value great hotel Great hotel newly refurbished just a short walk from the bars and cafes of Kings Cross and walking distance to Kings Cross station. Had a beautiful room overlooking Rushcutters bay park which was not large, but clean and very comfortable. Staff were very obliging. The beautiful rooftop pool and gym overlooked Sydney Harbour - Wow! Will certainly return on my next visit to Sydney because is extreamly good value compared with other 4 star Sydney hotels.

<Content>Too small to have 'the vibe' Stayed here over Christmas and New Year 2004. Hotel looked good from pictures on website, but we were very dissapointed on arrival. The rooms are very, very small, hardly any space to walk or even put an ironing board. We stayed here for 9 nights as part of a world trip and found this to be the worst hotel on our travels. The equipment in the gym does not work either, rusty old rowing machine and a broken bike. The room service menu and bar menu are also very limited. Its also a bus ride away from central Sydney, and I would definitely recommend staying closer to the centre as there is not alot to do in Rushcutters Bay area.

<Content>Vibe Rushcutters: Stylish and a good location This hotel's now called Vibe Rishcutters and, having stayed twice, I can tell you the vibe is good - if you'll pardon the pun.The rooms have a minimalistic but extremely swish styling, with fantasically comfortable beds, seating, and a very nice bathroom. There's also a rather large in-room electronic safe - a big plus if, like me, you travel with a laptop. Everything's well kept and very clean. On both my stays I found the staff pleasant and helpful.As for location, the hotel's right next to the harbour and a beautiful park. The latter has a wonderful outdoor cafe for brunch at the weekend.Transport's pretty good. Buses to the CBD are just across the road (takes about 8 minutes), with the subway 5 minutes walk up the hill. Kings Cross, with its 'delightful' nightlife and strange characters, is 10 minutes walk the other way. Having said that, the hotel isn't in the Cross and the surrounding area is safe.I'd highly recommend the Vibe Ruscutters. It makes a great base to explore Sydney without the extortionate cost of staying in the CBD itself. Mind you, don't use the hotel's broadband internet or lobby net kiosk. Both are ridiculously expensive!

<Content>Awsome Sydney Hotel This place is one of the best hotels in Sydney I have stayed at, especially for the price. The staff were fantastic - no fuss, check in, room ready, easy, quick, no problems. The rooms are decorated very stylishly, with big feather pillows and feather doona on the beds. The location is second to none - just a quick pleasant walk to Oxford St, and the CBD, with rushcutters bay park, the marina and cute little cafes right on the doorstep. I couldnt fault this place, and will definately be back, what a lovely relaxing experience the whole thing was!!
