<Content>Spot on for central location! My husband and I were very pleased with our stay at this hotel. I was a little worried after reading some not so good reviews, but was pleased to find it was not as bad as some had made out. Our room was simular to your basic travel lodge style room, just missing the ketle, but it had a fridge. The room was cleaned everyday. The breakfast offered a selection of cereals/fruit/bread/meats/cheese/eggs/bacon, it was always hot and well stocked up! The hotel staff were very welcoming and friendly, we would stay here again, as for us the location was excellent, just on the corner of Dam Square.

<Content>Very !! good location...not bad for 3* ..good breakfast... We loved the location, in the old part of amsterdam , walking distance to most local attractions, there are loads of food places to eat.The hotel has a great reception area, kind of 1920/30's feel, the rooms are pretty standard but clean, the bathroom were a good size again standard and clean. The breakfast room is airy and bright a very good range to choose for breakfast. For us this hotel is great for the short weekend breaks..recommend for anyone wanting something middle of the range for a short break!!

<Content>Great location, good hotel I stayed at the Rho Hotel for three nights in October 2008, and I would stay there again. As many other reviewers have noted, the location is just about as good as it gets. The hotel is on a side street right off Dam Square, within easy walking distance to most tourist attractions. It's not cheap, but decent budget accommodations seem to be hard to find in this part of the city. The included breakfast was good, and the staff were generally polite. (Like most people in Amsterdam, they speak excellent English.) I didn't think that the hotel was particularly noisy, either in terms of street noise or noise from neighboring rooms. I could occasionally hear the people in the other room, however, and I imagine that this could have been a problem if those people had been noisier. There's a computer with internet access in the lobby, which is a big plus for those who don't feel like lugging a laptop around. I notice that the TripAdvisor icon for free high-speed internet is not filled in for this hotel. I'm not sure why this is (maybe the internet isn't high-speed--it did seem slow at times), but the internet is available and free. Note that the written directions on the hotel's website are incomplete: they tell you to go to Dam Square, but they don't tell you how to find the side street. Be sure to look at the website's map so that you know which way to go from the Square.

<Content>Fabulous Location!! My husband and I stayed at this hotel from thursday 9th October to Sunday 12th October 2008.We arrived at the hotel very early and well before check-in time and yet we were allowed to check-in and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We had booked a double room , but were given a twin- I went to complain at the reception and staff were apologetic and gave us a double room straight away.The room was on the 4th floor,and it was spacious and clean-very comfy bed! Bathroom was also spacious and clean.Naturally ,staying in a city centre means noise outside as its a busy city- but we didnt notice it much. The only noise which annoyed us was the guests in the hotel talking LOUDLY early in the morning..!!!The cleaning staff were not very easy to understand and were not friendly.Breakfast was lovely- huge choice of food- nice and relaxed atmosphere in the breakfast room.Overall a great hotel. Close to everything!!! I would stay there again !!

<Content>good location we were a group of travellers at amsterdam. hotel location is at dam squre and its very closer to the red light district, coffee shops and shopping street kaiver straat, by walking its take 10 min to arrive leidseplein squre.. hotel breakfast a little bit poor but clean and taesty.. rooms has no airconditioning system, in summer time it might be a problem. staff are normal... if you wanna rent a bike, hotel is the worst way, they are renting for one day 20 euros but other bike renting companies around the dam squre renting bikes for 7 euros per day. hotel is just 10 min to the central train station by walking... from schipol air port to central train station the cost of train ticket 4.60 euros.. if you wanna vist volendam, marken, edam and monickendam twons you can find one day bus ticket from the tourist information center next of the central train station... arriva buses ll carry you up to those towns only 6 euros( cost of one day bus ticket)...

<Content>It's a great mid price hotel You can't go wrong with the Rho. It's clean, good breakfast and fantastic reception staff. Rooms are small but that's the norm for Amsterdam. They are well maintained and decorated. The entrance is lovely and the hotel was apparently a jewellers in a previous life. The glass dome is a treat as you walk in. I can happily recommend it as a place to stay. Very central (but not noisy) to Central Station which picks up from the airport. The defining sound in Amsterdam is that of travel case wheels rumbling over cobbles! If you haven't been to Amsterdam then go - it's an utter delight of a city, small, friendly and a walk along the canals with a stop for hot chocolate can't be beaten!

<Content>Not worth the money My husband and I stayed at The Rho Hotel from 7th - 11th September 2008. We were allocated room 2008 on the 2nd floor.(there is a lift) The ROOM was a nice size. It overlooked a residence, therefore you had to keep your curtains closed at night. The room was very dark, lack of lamps. On the skirting board below the bed, there was a spill stain, it had obviously been there for ages, not the cleanest hotel, but on first sight it looks ok until you really look. The BATHROOM reminded me of a fish market slab, there was very BAD MOULD around the shower and tiles, the shower was either v.hot or v.cold. They only provided shower/shampoo gel and some soap, would have expected more for the price. We had to chase the maid every day to leave us two bath towels,bath mat, toilet rolls and tooth mugs. For some reason she forgot to leave them, she was a 'shilling short.' BREAKFAST, this was a mixture of dried up cheese, rubber/cold scrambled eggs and over cooked bacon. When they refreshed the eggs, they threw them in from a distance, it was clear they could not care less. There was tinned fruit in syrup and runny yogurt. The bread was nice and fresh. The breakfast staff had a bad attitude problem, never a smile, they do not clear plates until you leave the table. The dishcloths they use to wipe the tables were a FILTHY GREY. It was very NOISY at NIGHTwith druggies shouting and scooters roaring, not a good nights sleep in 4 nights. The blanket was ripped and the beadspread was stained, the mattress had not been cleaned in ages, the dust on the TV had been there for months. THE FRIDGE had mould in it and was not very efficient. Upon check out, there was no 'thank you/goodbye' THE LOCATION WAS GREAT,NEXT TO DAM SQUARE AND TRAMS. The reception staff were pleasant enough. We would not stay there again, it is not worth the money, it is more a 2 star hotel. THE PILLOWS were very LUMPY, you can request some thicker ones, even so they are horrid. Not worth the money, we felt cheated. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL UNLESS ALL YOU WANT IS GOOD LOCATION. It is so basic. For the price I would have expected better service. Perhaps the Dutch are not known for their service!If you want a great place to eat, just turn the corner and eat in the Chinese,(the first one you come to, CANNOT REMEMBER THE NAME) it is great value. This is an honest review. I do not have any pohotos as we have been to Amsterdam before and there is a limit to how many pics you want to keep. Wish I had taken some of the mould in the bathroom though.

<Content>RHO maybe for hard of hearing seniors First I want to start with problems will happen in any business. It is what you do to resolve those problems that separate the pros from the hacks.The RHO has a great location . After that ? They need to step it up two notches. The plumbing makes loud noises all night with toilets running cutting on and off and the pipes clanging (quite annoying). The breakfast is OK. The place is basically worn out from the keys to the beds. Hasn't been updated since the 70's. If you are going to Amsterdam to partake in the local coffee shops I would stay away from the RHO. They have a TOTAL non smoking policy. In fact, they are quite judgmental about Marijuana Smokers. Now this is one of the worst experiences I have ever had in my life. My last night when I went back to the room at about 8:30 to grab some cash and head back out the room safe wouldn't open (not attached and could be carried right out by anyone). O-K, everything of value I had in Amsterdam was in this safe. I am diabetic and some of the medicine I take was in the safe. This is where it gets unbelievable. The night manager took 30 minutes to finally come look at my safe. He looked at it and said they would have to drill it. I told him I needed in the safe. He then gets belligerent and accuses me of doing something to the safe and that I had been smoking pot in the room (I hadn't). He called me a druggy for smoking pot in Amsterdam. Tries to put me on the defensive when it was their safe that was broken. Finally he says it will be an hour before someone could open it. I can deal with that. I check with the front desk after about 30 minutes and the manager was no where to be found and flunkies at front desk are telling me it would be the next morning before they could open the safe. I told them I needed to take my medicine and also needed money out of the safe. They just gave me the finger. I couldn't believe it. I had to settle for the next morning at 7:00 when I needed to take my big medicine. Went to front desk at 7:00. He told me nobody available. I informed him I needed my medicine and let me know as soon as someone got there. It wasn't until 8:30 that they would open my safe. My hands are shaking because I needed my diabetes medicine. The reason they waited until 8:30 was to wait for the manager so she could see inside my safe to see if they could figure out a way to blame me for it. Going up to the room she said that I smoked too much pot and that I did something to the safe. No care about diabetes. Took 2 seconds to drill the damn safe open! Bad battery! Couldn't blame that on me! Now I have had some strange experiences at Hotels but I have never been locked away from both my medicine and my valuables by people that didn't give a crap and had bad attitudes. Shouldn't they be ready for safe problems 170 rooms = 170 old safes. Like I say, difference between pros and hacks!

<Content>Good value, great location The Rho is wonderfully located just off of Dam Square. Most of the tourist attractions are an easy walk from the hotel (or take a tram to the outlying museums).The rooms were quite basic, but clean and perfectly acceptable. No AC, but the fans in the room were fine to sleep by.The staff were extrememly friendly and helpful, and the hotel is large enough that there were always a few people on duty to answer questions.Breakfast was superb and served in a bustling dining room overlooking Nes street.Easy walk with roller bags to and from the train station.

<Content>Location, Location, Location In total our stay at Rho was average...the location is fantastic right off Dam square so top marks there. However i felt that the hotel was a very basic 3 star and for 拢100 per night you were defintely paying for the location.That said when we wanted to move rooms (into the dble that we had booked rather than singles) we were moved the next day. The staff were always very friendly and helpfulThe rooms are basic; no air circulation unless you left the window open, very student like, manky blankets on the beds and could defintely do with modernising.Overall if you are just looking for a central place to crash then this hits the spot, but it is not even Travel lodge standard so if this is your minimum you may want to look elsewhere!

<Content>Excellent Hotel/Location/Staff/Everything!! We stayed Friday 27th and Saturday 28th June, I found everything about the place to be of a high standard. I made the reservation direct with the hotel - on the reccomendation of a friend - which made things simple and straight forward in that respect.The hotel is in an excellent location within walking distance of most attractions and many great bars/restaurants and cafe's, yet as it is on side street is very quiet itself. The staff are friendly and helpful and the breakfast is not too bad at all - cereal and fruit, fruit juice, tea and coffee and scrambled eggs and bacon - considering most hotels do not include any breakfast I don't think that's to be sniffed at!! Our room was an ample size for all the time we spent there, and was very clean and comfortable - the shower was particularly good!!! That's important to me and I am sure many others too!!!All in all I cannot think of any negative points to this hotel and would highly reccomend it to anyone!

<Content>getting better Having stayed here for the 3rd or 4th time over the years I have to say the Rho is getting much better. The rooms seem to have had a touch up and now appear much cleaner and brighter. The staff at reception are friendly and helpful as ever. Breakfast - well its edible and plentiful. THe location is the selling point - very good.

<Content>Great Staff, Terrible Breakfast The Hotel is in a great position in Amsterdam just off Dam Square and ten minutes from Centraal Station. The Rho is spotlessly clean, with staff who could not do enough for you be it answering question about Amsterdam, the best places to go etc, I can not speak highly enough of them! We stayed there for my mates stag do and even when I found myself locked out of the room in just a towel due to high jinks no one complained or got the funnies with us. The only downside was the breakfast I went down looking forward to the bacon and scrambled eggs but, realised on the first mouthfull I had made the wrong choice it was minging!!

<Content>Basic hotel but clean and great location This hotel has a great location, just across the street from Dam Square its close to all the main attractions. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but we have stayed in Amsterdam before so we expected that. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. No noise at night time from the street. Hotel breakfast is nice, bacon is very salty though! We spent 3 nights in the Rho hotel and would recommend it highly!!! We had a wonderful stay.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel  This hotel is in a fantastic location set one street back from 'Dam Sq'. It is also a 2 min walk to the top tourist attraction 'Madam Tusaurds'. The hotel itself offered everything i want a hotel to offer me when visiting Amsterdam, Me and my friend returned last night after a 4 day trip, we had an large size Twin Bedroom with a good size bathroom (which is rare for hotels in Amsterdam). The room had a nice size window which let in a huge amount of sunlight and 'background' noise from the city centre. Breakfast is pretty standard but substantial untill late lunch, breakfast includes; Scrambled egg, Bacon, Toast, canned fruit, a choice of cereal and orange/tea/coffee, the cup size for tea and coffee is small in the restaurant so i suggest taking a travel kettle with you for a proper cup in the morning when you wake up (There is a fridge in the room for milk, water, beer etc). The hotel is a 10 min walk from 'Centraal Station' (which you can get a train too direct from the airport). The hotel now operates a No Smoking Policy. I would recomend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit Amsterdam who is not looking for expense  luxury.

<Content>Great base and fantastic staff This place is really basic so if you want luxury it isn't for you.My boyfriend and I went for two nights and had such a great time. The staff are really friendly and will do anything they can to help. The breakfast is basic but nice. The rooms are plain but clean and comfortable.Th ebst bit about this place is the location. You are seconds from the red light district, Royal Palace etc. And even the further attractions are within easy walking distance. A really great weekend so thanks to all at the Rho Hotel!

<Content>Basic but does the job The hotel is a basic hotel, but is clean, welcoming and friendly. Pretty good breakfast.Originally, we were given a double but staff were more than happy to shift us to a twin once we told them we weren't actually a couple.The room was not bad in size, and the en-suite was much larger than the walk-in cupboard I had rather been expecting.It is true that noise could be heard from Dam Square at night. We were at the front, practically overlooking the Square. However, the compensation is that it is a great location - bars and restaurants just around the corner, and a pleasant walk (if it's not raining as it was for us..!) through the city to the Museum Quarter.

<Content>Great location, priced right Overall, me and my friends liked the RHO. The location right off Dam Square is great, and the lobby is pretty cool. I read some reviews beforehand about noise; the walls are pretty thin, but other than a little noise, we just didn't hear much. Also, I was really surprised by the large size of the room, plus the bathroom and tub were large as well. First time I've experienced that in Europe for under $175 a night...The free breakfast was pretty good too, so take advantage of it and save some $$$. Everyone was helpful and we really don't have any complaints. Would stay here again and probably will.

There certainly were no rodents and the hotel was extremley clean, and the bedrooms basic but comfortable (all linen/ towels clean).Will definatly stay again when I next visit.

<Content>Not bad, and cheap! I visited the hotel in december with my boyfriend and my parents. We arrived friday and stayed for the weekend. Wen we arrived the reception staff were very helpful and assisted to us rite away. They also said they had tried to get us rooms as close as possible (this being the same floor, around 2 corners, but luckily we wern't too bothered).The hotels location is excellent we couldnt have hoped for better, litrally 2 seconds from Dam square and the same from pubs and restaurants and about 30 seconds from the nearest coffee shop if your looking for that sort of thing.The rooms themselves were clean and well kept. It appeared to us that all the rooms were smoking rooms, but luckily you couldnt smell anything in any of our rooms. Occasionally you could smell it in the corridors but well this is Amsterdam an its legal so i guess you could get that in any hotel.The corridors as other people have mentioned are a little problem, you can hear everything in your room. But well it didnt spoil our sleep. Breakfast was included in the stay and wasnt bad compared to some i have been offered. The staff were quick in filling up the empty plates etc as an when they were empty. There wasnt a huge choice but i have found that quite common in european city hotels.The hotel was great for the money tho. If your looking for cheap, central and a good nights sleep this is the perfect place to stop.

<Content>Rude employees and rodents I was expecting a budget hotel and was fine with that, but things became unbearable when I made my way onto the floor I'd be staying on. I heard construction as soon as I got off the elevator and turned down the hall to find a fairly large mouse running down the hall. When it heard me approach, it ran under a nearby guest door. I went to the front desk to tell them a mouse on the fourth floor wasn't acceptable, and was told by the conceirge, if you don't like mice, you should probably leave Amsterdam. With treatment like that and rodents free to roam the hotel, I left for another hotel.

<Content>Great city centre hotel Rho hotel is ideally situated in the centre of Amsterdam just off Dam Square. We stayed in a triple room, plenty of room. Very friendly and helpful staff. As a 3 star its very good value, the food was good for breakfast, the only down side was the bar in the hotel could not serve any beer, not a big problem as there are enough around.

<Content>Superb hotel and friendly staff I stayed here on 8 Oct 2007 for four nights in a single room. Asked for a quiet non smoking room and got it on 4th floor. One side was the hotel corner, the other the service room so no next door problems. Some noise from the back street with shouting drunks at 3 am just one night but not enough to disturb ones sleep.Room size quite adequate and decent towels and shampoo and gels. Reasonable shower wet room with toilet and washbasin. Bed comfortable and crisp clean sheets. Blanket not duvet. Top quality new curtains.Breakfast room pleasant. Good selection and reasonable quality. Hot scrambed eggs, boiled eggs (Hard), bacon, rice. Lots of bread choice. The best was slice your own from a choice of two fresh loaves. Two cerials, tinned mixed fruit, peaches, yoghurt, cheese, ham, butter, marg, jams, orange and grapefruit juice and superb really hot coffee. Only crit is that scrambled eggs are overcooked and come as omlette tough.Staff and service really good. There is a small bar but it is not really used as there is so much to choose from nearby. Good safe store room to leave baggage. Location is just right.I would stay here again without question as it is so easy to take a tram for one stop from Centraal Station or walk for 10 minutes.Lots of eating places all over this great city.Enjoy.

<Content>The Rho....very comfortable and friendly hotel we stayed in the rho hotel in amsterdam for three nights at the end of september!! location...fantastic...it was so easy to find as it was right beside dam square and a 5-10min walk from the cenral station!!! the staff were very friendly and helpful (even when i managed to lock the safe, not able to open it!!!) check-in was quick, 24hr reception was fantastic...you could leave your key in at anytime!! the bedroom was clean  comfortable, but im glad there was a fan in the room....it got very warm quickly!! the ensuite was nice and big!!! the bedroom had its own safe that you made up ur own code for...which was very good!! the continental breakfast was fantastic...kept us goin to well into the middle of the day!!! only had one problem, as a non-smoker and used to the smoking ban in N.Ireland, i disliked people smoking in the lobby...especially in the morning when heading down for breakfast.

<Content>Value for money... A group of us went to amsterdam for my b.friends 30th birthday so we just wanted a clean hassle free place to stay, I would recommend this hotel if you want somewhere comfortable and in the middle of everything... the staff were very friendly and helpful and breakfast was good. We requested rooms to the back of the hotel as Dam square can be noisy. Some of the rooms are a little narrow but we just wanted somewhere to sleep! Would stay there again...

<Content>Loved it we payed a good and low price to stay at this hotel so you cant expect 5* standards. For a hotel situated right next to dam square it was fantastic. The entrance to the hotel is very large and airy and the hotel staff were extremly friendly. When we arrived we found a lightbulb not working in our room we called reception and in 5 mins a new one arrived. The rooms are basic but comfortable and we heard no noise what so ever.The location is fantastic we walked onto dam sqaure an it was about 10 yards from the corner. fantatic location for shops bars and eating places. Breakfast was nice and the times were great 7-10.30 so when we had slept in we could still make it and when we had an early flight we could still make breakfast. Amsterdam was great and when i go back i will definatly stay at the Rho. I recommend this to all!!

<Content>Good Value My 1st time at this hotel. Have had better, but also much much worse in numerous trips to Amsterdam. Room was comfortable but not luxurious and adequate for me. Generally a good, if slightly tired, budget hotel. Never up in time to eat.Noise outside the biggest downside, and a few local dregs hanging round.Paying up front is usual in budget hotels.

<Content>Don't recomend It was easy to find, right off of Dam Square (good location). Something I found strange was that they made me pay for the full stay on check in (?) The hotel was such a disapointment; dark hallways, dark rooms, no AC just a fan, musty smell, unlike one of the pics I saw our bathroom didn't have a shower basin just a curtin and the water would splash all over the floor, the safe worked but we found a used bottle of lubricant in it :( ewwwww, there was a note on the window that said not to open it for safety purposes so we didn't then one night we came back and found it wide open!!! there were many drug dealers in the area which i found scary. On a lighter note the bed was comfortable, and the breakfast was ok.I do not recomend this hotel.

<Content>Delightful stay Just returned from an 8-nite stay. The rooms were somewhat small, and the decor minimal, but they were clean and comfortable. GREAT mattresses. We stayed first in a front room and it was noisy at night due to street noise from The Dam. Went out at midnite to see what all the ruckus was, but it was just people sitting out in cafes talking, and a band at one cafe. Felt very safe. We moved to a room at the back and it was very quiet. Breakfast was wonderful, with a choice of English/American or Dutch. Everything you could want. I would stay there again.

<Content>Location, location, location Just returned from Amsterdam and stayed at the Rho. The location was excellent and had an easy time getting around. The room was immaculate. We stayed at the recommendation of a friend who is stationed in Germany and have only one complaint about the hotel - if you want a shower where the temperature stays constant this is not the place for you. Otherwise, the staff was great and when asked offered all kinds of great ideas of where to go and made reservations for us. When we left they called a cab, I asked how much it would cost, then when the cabbie came I made sure to doublecheck after being ripped off several times in Nice (It cost me 40 euro).The breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, rice, yogurt, cold ham, and lots of juices and coffee. There were some rough looking characters hanging out at the corner but that had more to do with the bank machine than the hotel but we also noticed a lot of police presence especially in the evenings.

<Content>Look around for a better hotel. The location of this hotel is okay but a lot of local tugs hang around at the side of this hotel.They make a lot of racket at night and sleeping at this hotel is not easy.We didn't eat breakfast because it looked so bad.Rooms are dark and stank of fags.The safe did not work in any of the rooms we stayed in.The staff didn't really seem to interested in any thing we asked of them.We booked our taxi from reception to the airport , got a price and then were charged an extra 鈧?5.00.If your hotel is important to you when you travel do not stay ay the rho hotel.

<Content>Good and bad My boyfriend and I just returned from Amsterdam and the Rho. First the good: excellent location. Breakfast OK, no complains there, rooms clean, but the noise level from the other rooms was a little too much. One can hear the person in the next room snore, the one above walk and everybody else slam doors. If that is not an issue, the hotel is great. For the right price, I would return in spite of the noise. Also, you will be asked to pay for the entire stay at arrival, which for us, for a week was over 1000 Euro and to leave the key at front desk.

<Content>Avoid at all costs. Very basic hotel,rooms clean but furnature old  inadequate for todays traveller. Very noisy at night because of its position in the city  all the drug taking ect. Breakfast very good  management helpfull. Hotel rooms need major refurbishment.Do not use Connexxion airport shuttle, they are not to be relied on.Use the train to and from airport.

<Content>Great location, clean and friendly Stayed here for three nights and found it to be an excellent location for walking around the sights of Amsterdam. Easy to get to from Central Station, about a five minute walk. Arrived late at night but felt quite safe walking with suitcase from station. Hotel just metres from Dam Square. Reception staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms clean and tidy, everything available except kettle to make a hot drink. Although close to Dam Square, no noise could be heard in room. Breakfasts were very good and plenty of choice. Would recommend this hotel to anyone. Would certainly stay there again if visiting Amsterdam again.

<Content>nice breakfast thats about it! got a great size room,and were delighted,but that soon passed when we tried to go asleep that night..we were put next to the staff room of hotel and constant banging of door kept us awake all night.(room 105) clean towels only giving once on 3 day visit,we had no clean towels left on last nite.bring a hairdryer,they say they have one in room but its not worth using.i would pay the extra money in future to stay in a higher star hotel,it is a holiday after all!

<Content>Basic good value Wife and i just returned from 4 nights in the RHO celebrating New Year. This is the second time we have stayed here and i must say the reviews on here are pretty accurate.Location merits 5 stars, as do the staff, who are genuinely friendly and helpful if you approach them with the right attitude. General cleanliness is 4 star as is the breakfast. Unfortunately the rooms only just warrant a 3 star rating. The beds are too soft as has been stated in other reviews and, as many others have said, the walls are very thin indeed. You can actually join in a conversation with your neighbours in the next room without raising your voice! If this puts you off then - beware - it's bad. If that does not bother you then stay here - given the price it does represent excellent value for money.Beware - for some reason they DO ask you to pay in full on arrival. Having stayed here before (and read the recent warning review) it was not a problem for me - but first timers might not be quite so relaxed.

<Content>Pretty basic Stayed for two days in November 2006. Best thing about the hotel is its location - smack bang in the middle of town and the reasonable price.Rooms are clean but a bit basic, showers the same.Breakfast isn't that good, couldn't really face it.

<Content>Good location, very average hotel Three good points:1. Very central location just off the Dam Square - ideal for all the sights.2. The staff are friendly and helpful.3. The standard of cleanliness is goodHowever!1. The rooms are quite small and ours on the fourth floor had a sloping ceiling which made it impossible to get into or out of bed without having to stoop (and I'm only average height).2. The walls are very thin - conversation from adjoining rooms could be easily heard.3. The overall quality is basic - not even a 'do not disturb' hanger for the door - and the room attendants do start quite early.4. Our room only had a shower and the shower 'well' is so shallow the water easily goes all over the floor.5. Although we had booked a double in a no-smoking room some weeks in advance when we arrived we were allocated a twin. The only alternative was a double in a smoking room. Their allocation procedure seemed to be a mix of computer and written sheet - not very efficient.6. Breakfast was also basic - yes there is bread, preserves, fruit etc. but the bread was virtually all toasting bread, the preserves were of a poor quality and the fruit consisted of tinned fruit cocktail, tinned pear halves and very little else. There was also thinly sliced ham but some nice Dutch cheese. If you are bothered more about quantity than quality then you can stoke up for the day but not with anything special.7. There were some cooked items - however, the only eggs were scrambled. If they were fresh into the hot containers then that was fine but they appeared to be kept over a dry heat so quickly dried out and became very unappetising.To be fair whilst the hotel appeared busy and whilst we ate breakfast at different times during our stay we did not encounter any queues nor had a problem getting a table.We only noticed 1 lift but had no problems during our stay. There is a baggage room and the reception staff were very helpful with us leaving our bags on the day of departure.Overall the firm with whom we booked the break to Amsterdam described the RHO as 3* superior. Our view is it more 3* basic.

<Content>Long Weekend Booked a weekend away with my husband. Booked with a travel agent but only after reading the reviews on here. Perfect location. Friendly and helpful staff...(listen to there recommendations for eating out!!!!!) The room was spotless and quiet. It was on the 4th floor. Breakfast was excellent with a decent enough choice. The young lad on the bar at night was a little treasure. There is nothing more I can say other than I wouldnt hesitate to go back!!!!!!

<Author>Something-Different!
<Content>Great Location - shme about the rooms! The Rho hotel is in a fantastic position - just off Dam Square down a side street. The main foyer is very ornate and looks a bit like an old Victorian Train Station. Our main gripe was the room.It was very small with little space to put your suitcase out. The rooms look like they have been split into smaller sizes and of course this makes the corridors etc very difficult to navigate as they wander around all over the place. We were on the first floor and at first got the lift up to our room. We decided to walk up the stairs the next day and couldn't find our room and so had to backtrack to the lobby. Again, because the rooms have been split the walls are paper thin and you can hear everything above, below and beside you. At the end of the day, this was not a luxury hotel - but we weren't expecting one! It was clean and basic and even with the funny room we enjoyed our holiday and would recommend it as a hotel.

<Content>Eh... Not Great, not terrible We booked on the basis of a review in our guidebook (Rough Guide). Having booked a non-smoking room for 3 nights, we arrived to be told that only smoking rooms were available, but that we could move to a non-smoking room for the second and third night. We agreed, since the alternative was to schlep around looking for another hotel.The smoking room was vile - almost unbearable. The non-smoking room was fine, clean but threadbare, with a gigantic bathroom. The rooms had very basic furnishings, carpets etc., and felt very flimsy. Each of the two rooms were very different in size and shape. Both rooms were at the back of the hotel and the non-smoking room was on an upper floor. Both were pretty quiet, in terms of both hotel noise and street noise.The stafff were helpful and friendly, although the lobby was more train-station-like rather than comfortable and welcoming. We didn't pay a huge amount, so we were happy with what we got, but it was certainly oversold by the guidebook review. If you're looking for a budget place to sleep, this was fine. If you're looking for a nice place to stay as part of a romantic weekend away, this is not the place to choose.

<Content>Can't believe some of the reviews here I stay regularly at the Rho. As a single female, I always feel safe there. The staff couldn't be more helpful; the single rooms aren't cubby holes; there's a safe, fan and fridge in all the rooms I've stayed in; breakfast is plenty for me, including fresh-squeezed orange juice.Only downside is that the (preferable) outer rooms can be noisy with the window wide open because of the wretched tourists in Dam Square until all hours of the morning.But, all in all, for a mid-priced, comfortable hotel which is absolutely in the centre of things, it's hard to do better.

<Content>Glad I stayed! I was only staying two nights so I wanted to be central , so the Rho, at 104E for a single a nite seemed to fit the bill. I almost cancelled after reading some of the reviews here.I arrived very early on a overnight flight from Newark. I actually sat in Dam square for 20 minutes admiring the square and the dawn because I just assumed the room would not be ready.Hit reception at 7:00am. Cheerfully greeted by a young man and offered immediately a choice of a smoking or non-smoking room. Asked about floors, he said non was on the 4th..very quiet.Took that than remembered the 4th was mentioned, not well, in some reviews.441. Small but adequate, kind of an L shape so appeared a little more roomy. Also blonde modern furniture added to effect. Refrigerator that was not a mini-bar..vending machines in lobby!I was on the courtyard aka shaft side so no view but also no sloping ceiling as mentioned in some reviews. No A/C but a fan and a large new window that opened several ways. The days were warm but it cooled down at night so it was fine...would not not have A/C in June, July, or August.Breakfast buffet, included in price, was fine. Very efficient, lots of choices, from eggs, to rice(?), bacon, yogurt, salmon, cheeses, ham, salami, cucumbers, tomatos, creal, breads and rolls. And no choice of juice as noted but the OJ was fresh squeezed! Coffee and tea also self sevice so no waiting for that first cup or refills!asked for an Indonisian Restaurant nearby and was given a great one..Kantjil en de Tijger.Yes the floor boards are creaky and the walls thin but on my non smoking 4th floor only the second night did I have a bit of a noisy neighbor..but just the creaky sounds and door and such.All and all for the price and location I can't fault the place.One thing, I was asked for payment upon check in. I'm accustomed to paying by credit card at the end of the stay. Not a problem but if I were staying longer than the 2 nites I might be hesitant.

<Content>Bad hotel, good location This is clearly not a 3 star hotel ! The staff is rather unpleasant, decoration is inexistant, rooms are tiny and beds are too soft, no air conditioning in the rooms which are just under the rooftop, and to finish breakfast is mediocre (no croissants or pancakes only bread, no choice in fruit juices etc...). The only good point is its location right on the Dam place.

<Content>Good price, good location, helpful staff Ideally located, just of the Dam Square. Some other reviewers have been critical of the accommodation and staff. True, it is not exactly plush, but the rooms were clean, the public areas pleasant, and it was excellent value for money. Staff v helpful and friendly.

<Content>not too bad I arrived in Amsterdam and discovered there was no way I was going to stay 4 nights in the hotel I had booked from home. So, on my way to find a new hotel for the same day, the RHO was one of the few hotels that could take me. If you want a hotel room that is clean, equipped with a bathroom, tv, phone, and safe - the Rho is fine. Nothing special, but it does the job. My main complaints are these: the walls are thin, so you hear any noise. If you're there in the summer, there seems to be no air conditioning, and the room can get really hot. They have a storage room to hold your luggage the day you leave, but this is totally unsafe as anyone can go in and take any luggage. And, finally, be careful about how they charge you. I was over-charged for one night by a particular staff member who knew I had nowhere to stay (despite the other reviews, I didn't find all the staff that hospitable; some were, some were not). When I went to pay the next morning, I luckily was saved by another staff member who couldn't undersatnd why i was over-charged 50 euros. Overall, considering other hotels I came across in Amsterdam, I would give the Rho another try, aware of the problems above. Oh, and just down Nes, a few steps from the hotel really, there is a great pub/cafe. Awesome food, staff, ambience. Give them a try.

<Content>Hotel Rho...........perfect for us three Hello to all review readers.Me and my 2 friends went to amsterdam and stayed on the 30th of june till the 2nd of july 2006 for the idt sensation white event at the amsterdam arena, and our choice of hotel was the hotel rho.On first impression when we found the doorway into the hotel, we were all very impressed with how clean, tidy and very presentable the place was.It is a converted museum or hall or something because the main reception is huge and very grand looking.We were welcomed by a nice lady who spoke great english and who booked us in and gave us our door card to room 111 which was at the back of the hotel.We entered the room to be impressed again which was very clean and tidy with all amenities inc: tv, bath/shower, towels, wardrobe with hangers, fridge, fan, hairdryer, table and chairs, bedside lamps, full length mirror, big wide opening window (although never any breeze) and not to forget 3 very nicley made soft clean comfy beds.The next morning we all went to breakfast and again we were all very impressed with the buffet they had put on.The range to pick from was tremendous, oh my they had it all except slice sausage and tattie scone, which we soon forgot about because of the choice we had in front of us.So all in all this hotel was absolute perfect for 3 lads going to amsterdam for the weekend. Dont get me wrong it was not 5 star high class swanky town, but it was defo above average and very clean and presentable.It was great value for money, just for that little feeling of security and comfort, and it is perfectly located just 2 steps from dam square which is the main centre point of amsterdam. I wish i had photos of the hotel to show you, but no dought you will see if you are looking for hotels on the websites.Just like to add, the 5 friends we went with decided to stay in a cheaper hotel/hostel and let me tell you, it is not worth it at all. Their room was like small squashed army barracks with broken crappy beds, tiny bathroom, didnt look and feel clean and just had that dodgy feeling about it. Pay that tiny little bit extra for comfort and security and you will get it at this hotel, which we will definetley be back at, perfect.

<Content>so disappointed I stayed here for 3 nights. There were 3 of us sharing a room. We paid over the odds for the room I feel. 535 euro for the 3 nights for the 3 of us.There was a bit of a heatwave while we were there and the room had no aircon. The temp was at least 30 deg in the room, it was like a sauna. I just happened to have become ill on arrival with a vomiting bug and had to spend most of the time in bed. I explained this to the reception, who could not put me in a room with an aircon, as she said they were all taken. Apart from that, the floorboards creaked, the matresses were too soft, the fridge hardly could have been called a fridge as nothing was kept cold, only slightly cool.The smell of smoke in this hotel is appalling (I am a social smoker but only smoke outside) But it was the most disgusting smell. There is no room service, and no kettle in the room either..................what more can I say???????

<Content>Well worth a look We were please with our stay, very friendly staff who were only to happy to help, good sized room and great breakfast. But as with all hotels there were a few faults. Beds were very soft, we were on the 4th floor so it was very hot, could of done with air conditioning. We had to leave the window open all night and, as we looked out onto a street, we could hear loud music and people leaving bars at all hours of the night. There also seemed to be a shortage of large towels which lead to us asking at reception repeatedly.For the amount of time we actually spent in the room though it was fine for us and we would stay again.

<Content>Clean,but wouldn't go back We stayed at the Hotel Rho @ the end of May. It had been recommended by a friend.The hotel was clean,our room was fairly small, no view at all, a roof and another roof!! The bathroom sink leaked and the showerhead just flopped to one side.The room was quiet considering it was backing onto the lift.The breakfast was good and plentiful.A fairly average hotel, excellent location.One thing did however bother us,on our final night about half one in the morning,a man came into our room!He had obviously got the wrong room but his plastic key fob had given him access into our room! We informed the staff the next morning who said they would check and change the code.I personally wouldn't go back and stay at the Hotel Rho.

<Content>Interesting Just spent 3 nights at the RHO Hotel, situated right on Dam Square. Pleasant hotel, a lick of paint would be nice but otherwise OK. The room we were given was huge, could easily have slept 6, staff very helpful. If you visit this area I must tell you about THE best place to eat. Its called 'van Kerkwijk' and is situated down the street from the RHO hotel (entrance to hotel in side street). It is nothing fantastic to look at but you will not get a better meal anywhere on Dam Square. The food is outstanding. The best time to get a table is about 6.00 p.m. or you will have to wait in a queue, but believe me, the wait is worth it, fantastic tasting food and great staff. Give it a try, you will not be dissapointed. Hope you enjoy.

<Content>BEWARE...wouldn't stay there again! I usually agree with the reviews here, but am definitely not a fan of the Rho Hotel. Yes, the location is unbeatable, the staff were very friendly, the breakfast looked pretty good although I never made it in time. But that's all I can say that is positive.We stayed in room 442 and it was awful! We were situated right in the middle of the hallway across from a squeaky door that led to the elevator. The room was very stuffy and small. The floor boards creaked with every step and the matress was awful. And the hotel STINKS!I got no sleep our first night. Then the next morning I went to talk to the manager and he kindly switched us to another room. Same floor but further from the elevator. It was a bit quieter, but still smelly. The hotel seems to have very little water pressure and the water temp was always changing from very hot to cold.I would never recommend the RHO nor return to it!

<Content>B+ / A- Overall, we liked the Rho Hotel and would probably stay there again. The location was unbeatable, fotsteps away from Dam Square. The staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. They were great. The breakfast was very good as well. We stayed in 2 different non-smoking rooms there because we left on a trip out of the city and then came back. The first room was a double and was quite small. Of the two slanted windows, one had a missing blinds and the other a broken blind. The mattress had pretty much no support. The second room, however, had 2 twin beds and was much larger and nicer. The hotel was quiet, but we were told that the smoking rooms were not as quiet. Also, I'm not sure if you'd need to open the windows in the summer because I'm not sure if they have a.c. I'm not sure what the noise level would be like with open windows. Of course, I've stayed in much nicer hotels, but for the price and location, this one is pretty good.

<Content>Great people, wonderful hotel! after arriving in amsterdam to see that the hotel i made reservations at was non-existant, a kind man showed me and my 2 friends to the Rho Hotel and said he liked it. WOW! its a very interesting looking hotel, the GM is a great guy who cut us a great deal on a 4 person flat for 9 days. If it weren't for that hotel, AND THEIR AWESOME BREAKFAST, our trip wouldn't have been nearly as sweet ;) I now call the Rho Hotel my home away from home!

<Content>Helpful Having read previous reviews before travelling I completely disagree about the staff. They were all friendly, helpful, and had a good sense of humour! The breakfasts were good, and it was all very easy. The location is convenient. The hotel was warm; it was freezing outside. Big rooms with all you would expect in a city centre hotel in this category. I would be happy to go there again.

<Content>A pleasure. I spent 5 days in Amsterdam with my mum in February 2006, staying at the Rho, and I must strongly disagree with the previous negative reviews of this hotel, as we found it very pleasing. The hotel staff were polite, professional, efficient and friendly. No, they didn't chat with people too much, but do you really want that? The room was clean, the beds clean and comfy, the bathroom was spotless, and the hot water was HOT! Slippers were provided, as were cloths for cleaning shoes. Our twin room was a good size and there was plenty of room for storing luggage. The room contained a full length mirror, and the TV received BBC1 and Sky news for us Brits. Our only concern as makeup-wearing women would have been that the lighting in the room could have been a bit better, but maybe we shouldn't be quite so vain! Oh, and tea-making facilities would have been nice, but different countries have different ways of doing things, and our lack of tea was no great loss. The hotel breakfast was excellent, with something for everyone: bacon and scrambled eggs, toast, cereal, fruit, cheeses, hams, smoked salmon etc. Heaven! It was buffet-style, too, which is always good when you're feeling rather peckish.The location of the Rho was faultless. Although on the corner of the busy Dam Square, it spans down a narrow side street where there is virtually no traffic and therefore extremely quiet. The hotel is central and within walking distance of everything you will want to visit during your stay. We had considered the Rokin hotel on the next road, but were so glad we didn't stay there as there is major building work going on in the middle of the street.Luggage can be stored free of charge at the hotel after you check out until you're ready to go to the airport. Also, if you take the Connexxion bus service to and from the airport (about 拢12 return pp), the hotel staff will phone to arrange for the bus to come and pick you up from Dam Square.There is also an excellent restaurant nearby called Beems brasserie, situated on Rokin. Delicious, and reasonably priced.Staying at the Rho was a pleasure, and I wouldn't bother to consider anywhere else on subsequent visits to Amsterdam.

<Content>Excellent Location and Service. This is our 2nd visit to Amsterdam and we would def reccommand the Rho Hotel for location and Hospitality shown by all the staff.Rooms are basic with no tea or coffee making facilities but it did have its own fridge for drinks.Rooms were so warm even in bitter cold Feb that we had to open our window at night and walk in shower was something else with always piping hot water.Breakfast offered a great choice of cooked or continential.Location is ideal for shopping 1 min away and not forgetting the Red Light District and other bars and restaurants only walking distance away.We will def stay there again.

<Content>Great location! Recently stayed at the Rho for a weekend break with 5 friends. Girls weekend (though all 40 something. Ideal location to see all the sights of Amsterdam, easy to know where the horel is as it's next to the big yellow clog shop on Dam Square.I had read some Rho hotel reviews on this web site and it wasn't as bad as some people make out.Plenty of hot water, though no bath in my room. Breakfast was fine with plenty to choose from and yes it was the same each day but there was enough choice to vary your own menu.Tea  coffee facilities would be next in the room, though I'm told by the senior desk staff that isn't classed as 3* in Holland ( I was in Madrid last week ans stayed in a superior 3* to the Rho  no T or C facilities in the room there either.)Yes it is a bit noisy and quite alot of singles and younger groups staying there, but all in all it was value for money and ideal for visting such a strange city as Amsterdam.Not the hotel I would choose for a romantic w/end away with my husband but definately suitable for a w/end visit with friends.

<Content>Appalling The worst Hotel I have ever stayed in. I would not recommend it to my Dog.The major problem being the staff at reception, and in the breakfast room. A good course in customer service would not go astray here, I found most of them rude and unhelpful. I have been to Amsterdam 3 times this year, and have never come away with an impression like this.

<Content>Great value budget hotel This is a great hotel situated right in the middle of everything in Amsterdam (5 mins walk from station). The rooms are basic but just what is needed on a budget break: Good size, comfy beds, tv, safe, telephone (made a 35 min peak time call back to the UK and it only cost 4 euros, bargain!) and most importantly of all - it`s clean (Although no tea and coffee). Didn`t experience any problems with noise but I suppose it depends what part of the hotel you are in. Breakfast is a buffet of bacon, eggs, cereal, toast, meats etc. but there is plenty of it which sets you up for the day, and it`s served until 10.30.Staff are very friendly and welcoming, nothing is too much trouble, they really make for a pleasant stay.If you arrive expecting luxury then you`ll be disappointed, but for a good value, centrally located budget hotel the Rho is perfect, and I`ll stay here on every trip to Amsterdam.Also previously stayed at the hotel Rokin (Owned by same family as the Rho) just down the street so if the Rho is full try them.

<Content>Pity about the staff Excellent location, rooms ok but a double bed means a room too small for twin beds. Same breakfast every day. Senior male reception staff unwelcoming, unsmiling and patronising. Female staff marginally better. The 'bar' is a section of the reception area occasionally attended and laughably stocked. The ambience added nothing to the pleasure of my trip. Fairly cheap but not cheerful

<Content>It was fine! If you are looking for a quiet yet central location with interesting things to do in every direction - this is your place.We stayed in room 481, which was on the top floor in the corner closest to Dam Square... where we could actually pick up a free wireless connection (no, not part of the hotel services). From peeking in some other double rooms, I'd have to say our room was quite a bit larger than average. The room was on the basic side, but had everything we really needed... clean, very good bathroom, tv that works, NO road noise, room safe, fan, windows that open, and refrigerator. There were two twin beds shoved together with end tables on each side, a couple of small but cushy chairs, and some small tables. A friend travelling with us had a single room, which he said was tiny. I don't remember seeing any shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom, so bring your own.The breakfast was free but totally uninspiring. There's a nice outdoor coffee/pub/food place right on the corner if you want something different. (It turns out there's an excellent wireless signal from there as well.)I can't help but think of all those poor people staying at the Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky a half block away that were paying triple what we were paying, and putting up with so much more noise.

<Content>Good location,the rest very dissappointing!!!!! Stayed from the 7th Sept 05 to 9th Spt 05. The hotel is fabulously located, unfortunately thats all I can say in favour of it. We hate to complain, however, when we checked in we were given room 228, Ok, the window would not stay open and in that humidity and the hotel had no ventialtion hardly and was very hot and airless we complained. The hotel receptionist asked could we prop it open with a book? (how dangerous could that be if it fell from the 2nd floor straight down on to the street?) We advised the reception of this and they said well we do not know what else we can do for you. To our rescue came the manager and moved us to roon 232 which was fine and had a window that opened. The location as I said is Fab, however there are so many more situated in the same area, I do not recommed this hotel!! I do though recommend Amsterdam, we love it!!!!!!!

<Content>Bring Your Own Water My friends and I stayed at the Rho Aug 05. First impression was ok, nothing special, although the huge lobby area was somewhat misleading as to what to expect once you get up to your room. The room we stayed in (229) had no running cold water, the window was broken, which meant that it could not be locked once we left the room and the layout was terrible. We had to move the furniture around to get some form of normality in the room. After telling the receptionist about the water problem, we were told some1 will come up to have a look. And that's exactly what happened, some1 came up and had a look. THAT'S IT. Again, highlighting our concerns to the hotel, we were told that they could provide us with A BUCKET OF COLD WATER. Oh we were also offered 10 euros discount for the three nights we were there. What a joke. I'm sorry, going on about this place is really starting to remind me of the black cloud of my trip across the continental Europe. So to conclude, this is a LOUSY PLACE to stay. Find somewhere else.

<Content>Ideal location for Dam Square I stayed in the RHO hotel for one night in August 2005. I arrived around 0930 am and to my suprise the single room i had booked was available. There is a lift, my room was on the second floor. once i found the room, you have to go around a maze of doors and corridors to find your room.. not wasy when you return after a skin full of Beer. I had a nice large bath, with shower, toilet, sink. etc, the only thing which let the bathroom down was the lighting... The lighting only came from the saving mirror above the sink.I had a TV, and a view of the side street, if you put your head out of the window you could see Dam Square. The room had a safe in the wardrobe, which you enter a 4 digit number to use. The bed was clean as was the room overall. There is a buffet breakfast which i never did get to see, a small bar also. the hotel does have a web site you can look at.The Staff where pleasent. and they looked after me. There is a room to lock your bag away pre or after check out until you depart the hotel. check out was 1100am. all in all, i would stay there again. The hotel is great for the Red light district, China town, area. Central Station is around half a mile away 10 minute stroll up Damrak. The floating flower market is about 1/2 mile down Rokin, in the opposite direction. Dam Square is twenty five yards away.

<Content>Great location Often when hotels boast a great location thet are a little economical with the truth, - this cannot be said about The Rho. The front door can't be more than a 1 min walk off Dam Square.The accomodation is fairly basic but most importantly is clean and tidy.My room was quite small but adequate, but was equipped with a fan a good room safe and the bathroom was impressive I stayed in August 05 , and managed to book a room for under EUR100.00 a night which for a hotel in such a decent location represents excellent value.Accross the road cycles can be hired , and the hotel is also close to Damrak with its numerous bars and shops , the heart of the Red Light District is a 5 min walk .

<Content>Very close to centre of city and reasonably priced Just off Dam square - so very handy for bars and restaurants and tram stop, about a half hour walk from central station. You couldn't hear any noise from traffic or from passers by as is on a quiet street. Nice lobby but quite basic rooms. TV had very bad reception and there is no airconditioning just a table fan. Our room seemed to be in a converted attic space so had a sloping ceiling and was quite warm. Room was clean, with a normal sized double bed and not much else in it. En-suite bathroom was pretty basic and not that modern but seemed clean.Breakfast was ok, some of the cooked items such as bacon and scrambled eggs seemed a little overdone and had been sitting a while.Pretty good value though and great if all your after is a bed in a centrally located hotel and not worried about the usual 4 or 5* luxuries. Would rate this hotel as a 2 star.

<Content>Good value for the price I have stayed at 6 different tourist class (2-3 star) hotels in Amsterdam Centrum between 2001 to 2003. I stayed at Rho Hotel in my last 3 visits. I found this hotel offers the best value for the price and location. This is the hotel if you want to be near Dam Square at a reasonable price . The rooms meet Amsterdam standard for a tourist class hotel. It is true the wall may be thin, you can hear footsteps as people walk by the hallway outside your room, and the street noise can last until 5 am when the drunks return from the bar. They do not bother me afterall this is Amsterdam!!! The free hot breakfast is good. The hotel staff always say hi when I walk by the lobby (except the really hot looking blonde girl who seems has never greeted me). Again, for Amsterdam hotel standards in the Centrum, I have not found a better hotel for the price. If anyone has a better suggestion for a single room with private bathroom for less than 100 Euro (including VAT/service charge and hot breakfast for weekend days) I would like to know about it.

<Content>Good basic hotel I stayed here last weekend and thought it was great for a basic hotel. The location was what sold it to us and it didn't let us down - slap bang opposite the big dept store on dam square. The breakfast was good - although when it got busy it was quite hectic as not a lot of room at the buffet - and set us up for the day so avoiding the need for lunch!The only thing that let it down was the room - perfectly adequate but like previous people have said, had wafer thin walls (think office partitioning rather than walls). Room was clean, functional and had comfy bed and spacious enough bathroom but there was no feeling of luxury at all - felt quite like a travellodge room but with less sturdy walls!Overall I would recommend to friends but only for less than say 拢80 a night per room - anymore than that and i'm sure you could get more for your money!

<Content>basic rho hotel We arrived at the Rho Hotel  were delighted with how close it was to Dam Square. The Hotel itself however is very basic  our room was really dark.There was no mini bar as advertised and the TV was useless. It was very clean though which is the main thing. There is nothing special about this Hotel at all but it really was in a great location if like us you are there for a short trip.

<Content>Excellent location Excellent location (just off the Dam Square), friendly and helpfull staff, clean and not-too-tiny-by-amsterdam-standard's rooms, clean and spacious bathrooms, excellent breakfast (I loved the smoked salmon) and perfectly reasonable prices.what more do you need?...The only complaint I have is about the paper-thin walls.You could hear a fly sneeze on the next room. But if you enjoy the city the right way, you'll be so beat up by the end of the day it will take you 5 seconds to get to sleep when you finally get to bed.

<Content>Basic hotel with a great location This converted theatre is now a basic economy class hotel. Staff is helpful and rooms are small but clean and safe. One thing that disturbed me was the noice level. Walls are thin and you can hear if your neighbor is snoring. On the plus side, it's a great location just next to the Dam. Also, if you fancy a great hotel bar, just walk to 5-star hotel Krasnapolsky located less than a minute walk from Rho.As usual, you get what you pay for. Rho is good value for money, but if you expect anything better than a economy class hotel, you will be disappointed.

<Content>Rho, its fine We have stayed here for three times now. It is a fine hotel if you are not expecting luxory. Its a old building (formally a theatre i think) and maybe the rooms need a freshen up. They are fine, most are roomy, tv etc. Bathrooms are on the large side in most rooms. Staff are young people and very nice and chatty, and are a good laugh!! We find the front of hotel over looking the square can get a bit noisy if you plan a early night, so request a room at the rear. Breakfasts are the same as you would find anywhere in amsterdam, cold meats, cheese, boiled eggs and scrambled eggs, bacon, fruit etc etc, it is all tasty and plenty of it.All in all the RHO is a decent hotel, central and handy.

<Content>Great hotel, great location, location, location! This was our second visit to Amsterdam and our second stay at the Rho hotel.My girlfriend and I were very happy with the room and the hot buffet breakfast that was delicious on both occasions.The location is excellent, right on Dam square, next to the shops and the vibrant nightlife.We will be going to Amsterdam again soon and when we do we'll be definitely staying at Rho.

<Content>Great Location, but didn't like the hotel Just returned from a 16 day trip through Europe (Paris, Amsterdam and Germany). The Rho Hotel was the only hotel I was disappointed in of the 5 hotels we stayed at during our travels. You can't beat the location. It's right off Dam Square, but..... They allowed smoking in the lobby of the hotel, which although very European, was tiresome as an American, and the stale smoke was not pleasant on the way to breakfast every morning. The floors in the hallways were super-creaky, and in our room, I felt like I should wear the paper slippers they provided b/c the floor didn't seem clean. The bathroom felt unclean as well. I was glad there was a safe in the room, and I was even more glad when it was time to leave for Germany!

<Content>Definitely not 3*** hotel! The room was very dark as there was only a small window. Maybe it was better not to see walls that were pretty cruddy. A lamp was broken that was never fixed even we asked for it. And we didn't have a minibar in the room (which was forgotten as per the staff). A hotel not to recommed! The only good thing is the location if you like bars/restautants around the corner. On the other hand there are hundreds of bars EVERYWEHRE in Amsterdam!

<Content>unique hotel in a great location The RHO has a unique colorful lobby, that I believe used to be a theatre. Rooms are standard for Europe -- small. Unfortunately the walls were quite thin and the floors extremely creaky. Location on Dam Square is fantastic. The price is right for this hotel, but I'm sure there are better places in Amsterdam.

<Content>Great location - but hollow walls/floors The location of the hotel is excellent - between Dam Square (shopping area) and Coffee Houses/Red Light District. A bit of a walk from the Central Station (need wheels on your suitcase or take the tram). Location is perfect for restaurants and evening entertainment ;o) Hotel is converted theatre - lobby looks lovely but the rooms are not noise insulated so can hear rooms upstairs, downstairs, next door, corridors, etc. Can be annoying as feel unable to move without squeaking floorboards, and if neighbours are up all night... forget about sleep (unless comatosed). Rooms do not have coffee/tea facilities in room, no ay-to-view TV (just CNN, BBC1 and a couple more), one lift serving all floors (couldn't find stairs). Very basic - safe in wardrobe (ours was falling apart). Breakfast OK - scrambed eggs and bacon, as well as cereals, fresh juices, toast, etc served opposite lobby. Summary - Rooms are low spec, location is perfect, price is OK (esp occasional offers).

<Content>Perfect Just got back from Amsterdam, stayed at the RHO hotel while in the Dam for some mates birthdays. The hotel was right in the square, very easy to get to all the bars and red light district. we booked a 4 person room in the hotel and got given an apartment which had kitchen, lounge with TV, 2 bedrooms and huge bathroom. it was very clean,hotel staff were very friendly - they even knocked on the door at 9am to change a light bulb!! will be staying here again if we come to Amsterdam!

<Content>Great Location! We stayed at the Rho Hotel from Jan. 16-20. The hotel is located in a great spot right off Dam Square, which made it easy to walk or catch a tram to anywhere in the City. We found the hotel to be clean and spacious. It was the largest room we have ever had in Europe. The staff was friendly and spoke English. The breakfast served each day was good. Fresh squeezed orange juice and great granola! The noise level in the hotel was very low. Our room was on the third floor, and the only noise we heard were people walking/talking in the alley located below. At times, they could be quite loud, but overall it was very quiet. The only negative was the smell of smoke that filtered through the bathroom vents--even in the non-smoking section. As someone mentioned before, just keep the bathroom door shut and the rest of the room smells fine. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Good value for a European city in July. Stayed here a few years ago. Clean, small rooms which get quite hot and humid in July (small, useless fan inside). Reserved for non-smoking but we just gave our last room away so had to settle for a slightly stinky room. The front foyer is impressively large as it used to be an old movie theatre. Front staff speak English (as most of the city) and offered advice when asked about local sites.The price was reasonable (for July) and for being centrally located. There is a lovely atrium in the basement for the buffet-style full breakfast (included in your room price). Plentiful food, cold cuts (a dutch tradition), waitresses to bring you drinks (don't need to tip) and even high chairs for babies. This hotel is quite a long walk from central station (especially if you are carrying luggage) but situated off the main busy street so noise is not a problem.For a European hotel, this one isn't bad for the money.

<Content>Great hotel, highly recommended Very nice hotel, nice treatment, clean rooms, everything is allowed to do in your room (you know what i mean :) ), nice staff, they let us eat there with food we bought outside. The only con is that in most of the rooms you can't open the window completely, only at a 30 degrees angle.

<Content>Will go back I spent a week in the RHO the last week before Xmas. I had no problems with finding the hotel - 6 min walk from station  when there I stayed in a basic but very clean room. Great location as it is off the main street, therefore no chance of being kept up all night by passing traffic etc,. The breakfast is good  staff polite. Personal safe kept in cupboard. Tip with safe is to enter code numbers immediately after you hear the first beeps - it fooled me, I waited to long. The reason I did not give a 5 star rating is because you can hear nearly everything in the room next to you - so if you got noisy guests next door who were up all night then you would have a problem getting asleep. TV has BBC1 BBC 2  CNN International. But this is only a minor quibble, I would go back there as pricewise  location wise it made my vacation that much more enjoyable. I switched to the RHO from another hotel because of Tripadvisors good advice. Thanks

The location is great; you walk out the door and see a spectacular view of the Royal Palace and the public square in front of it. I would recommend the Rho to those on a budget who want clean rooms and good spot.
