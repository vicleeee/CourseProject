<Content>Loved the location, hated the room size and lack of mini markets I moved to this hotel from the Regal Riverside Hotel, Shatin cos I wanted to be closer to the city centre. They had a winter promotion of buy 2 free 1. Average price came to about HK$800 per night. Came with a small room (couldn't fit a cot in there), queen bed, daily fruit and friendly counter staff. Was there with wife and infant. Didn't want to stay in the dodgy mansion areas. It had a great location, was walking distance to restaurants, shopping and ferry terminal. It even had a pedestrian bridge to the park next door. MRT stations were about 15-20 min walk away. However, there wasn't any mini markets around. That meant that buying bottled water became expensive (I needed clean water for the baby). To sum up, it was smack in the shopping district so everything became expensive when compared to Shatin.

<Content>very good location, good value I was concerned about the hotel after reading the feedback below, but my stay was very pleasant.Stayed 4 nights, on 22nd floor of hotel wing, which is one of the 'premier floors. 'Premier' rooms include continental breakfast and free access to business center.The room was very tiny indeed and the street view was not anything special, but everything was very functional and very clean. The furniture looked brand new and modern (flat LCD tv, small modern and convenient desk, sufficient storage place). Bed was harder than in the US (as supposedly all Hong Kong hotels). The service very efficient with absolutely no problems. Every night 2 or 3 pieces of fruit.Continental breakfast was basic (breads, 3 types of fresh fruit, another 3 types of canned fruit, yogurts, musli, cheeses, crackers, juices, cereal, coffee), but everything was fresh and tasted very well.Business Center was often busy, so sometimes computer was not available, but never very long wait time -- maximum 5 minutes. (i could not locate the free wireless that previous postings referred to.)I paid HK$1200 per night, but one can get as low proce as HK$800 or $HK900 per night. The executive floors in the tower building are much bigger and have a view, but obvioulsy they are more pricy. The location is great: on Canton Rd, about 5-7 minutes away from Nathan Rd, 10-15 min north is night market, 10 min south is promenade and also access to ferries that take you to the Central.

<Content>Good location slightly dated decor I stayed at the Royal Pacific in a superior room for 1 night on a business trip. The location is ideal for shopping and overlooks Hong Kong Harbour and is close to the harbour ferry. The decor is slightly dated - a 70s chintz to everything gives it away but it is well looked after and prices seem to be average for the area. Breakfast is generally not included in the room price so you may well be better off getting it at one of the local shopping centres rather than paying the high in hotel prices. I wasn't overawed by the experience but it was good enough.

<Content>Royal Pacific - Needs a Makeover I stayed in the Royal Pacific for a business trip to Hong Kong. Our HK office arranged the reservation, as this hotel is walking distance to the office. Not a hotel I would willingly book for myself, ever. First room was on the 22nd floor of the Tower wing- upon opening the door I was presented with a narrow hall with a closet and very little light. Around the corner was a bathroom and 2 twin beds crammed together with dingy comforters and old looking pillows, along with a musty smell. Suddenly the whole room began to hum and shudder - it was incredibly loud. The motor system for the elevators was 2 doors down from me. I complained and was moved to a 2nd room on the 17th floor - smaller, quieter but still dark, dingy and very very smelly. I dropped my bags and went out to window shop and grab some dinner. Upon my return later that night I saw how truly decrepid the bathroom was - black mildew or mold was growing on the side of tub and along the tile trim in the shower. The shower curtain itself had a mildew/dirt ring around the bottom, and there were sounds of gurgling and glugging from the bathroom floor drain all night. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I am being forced by my company to stay there again next week - supposedly in an upgraded room after they contacted hotel management about my experience- but even that is not reassuring based on the general dinginess of the hotel overall.

<Content>Great Location We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights (August 9-12) in our first visit to Hong Kong.Location - I must say this is the biggest asset of this hotel. It's on top of a mall (China Hong Kong City) where you can access a wide variety of restaurants and coffee shops. It is also next to Harbour City, which apparently is the biggest shopping mall in HK. There is an easy way and a hard way to get to Canton Road. The easy way is to take the elevator down to where you just walk out of it and have to walk about 100 feet to the street. The hard way is down a series of scalators and through the ferry terminal and mall... your choice.The Room - A complimentary fruit plate and water every day was a nice touch. The room was small but we never felt claustrophobic in it! No complaints on the bed. No cigarrette smell either. It was a nice little room.Front Desk - I walked past the front desk many times and there were never more than 3-4 guests in line. They always had at least 4 people manning the desk. Check-in and check-out were smooth.I booked this hotel for the location and I believe it was a good choice. Easy access to many interesting areas in this part of HK.Airport Shuttle - It actually is a MTR Kowloon Station shuttle, and from there you can take the Airport Express. The shuttle runs every 12 minutes. I would advise anyone flying out of HK and staying at this hotel to make use of the shuttle, the airline Check-in service at Kowloon Station and the Airport Express train to the airport... it all worked out perfect for us... no hassle... Nothing beats walking into the airport with boarding passes in hand and no luggage.Following the hotel's staff advice , we used the shuttle once to go to the Kowloon Station and take the MTR to Disneyland, and then back to the hotel at the end of the day.This hotel matched all our expectations for our short stay in Hong Kong: quiet and comfortable room and convenient location. If you want a luxurious room and hotel, stay somewhere else... by the way, the price was right too: under USD100 per night.

<Content>Nice business-y hotel This place is located about a 20 minutes' walk from the Star Ferry Terminal, and about 15 to the subway. And great walks they are, one down Canton Road and the other across Kowloon Park. Also, the boat to Macao departs directly from the hotel building. It was quite luxurious, and inexpensive in US dollars. There are several options for breakfast, from a huge buffet to a coffee shop with a few tables near the boat terminal.The hotel charged for wi-fi in the room, but there is a shopping mall next door where you can sit at a table and log on.

<Content>Great views This is probably one of the better hotels I've stayed at in Hong Kong. The views of the harbour were amazing, the prices were fair,  the rooms were quite nice. The location's good for the TST side, it's just above the ferry terminal  closer to Harbour City  the Star Ferry Pier. - Dakota Smith, TravelersDigest.com

<Content>good time at the Pacific My family of 4 stayed at this hotel from Aug 16-19, 2008. We booked through a travel agent and we were given two rooms, 1629-30 in the Tower. Rooms were clean, beds firm, pillows soft, carpet clean, bathroom bigger than usual with a separate shower cubicle and bath. I can only fault the lighting as it was too muted. The staff was courteous and helpful. I opted to include breakfast, as advised by one review, and we enjoyed the buffet. in the Cafe. It was a mix of west( cearals, hotcake, breads) and east (congee, vegetarian rice, steamed dimsum). The gym was open 24 hours and though small was complete with a treadmill, weights machine and stepper.Location was good as we took the ferry to Macau and it was just an escalator ride down from the hotel. It was also next to a mall. The MTR is further down the raod, about 15 minute walk.We will stay here again.

<Content>yuck for the most part Ok - let me start by saying I know some people who happen to really like this hotel... I am not one of them.This hotel USED to be convenient if you needed to travel via the China Ferry Terminal - which is located in the same building. However, most of the boats to Shenzhen, China have been moved to the Macau Ferry Terminal (located on the HK Island side of HK) - which makes this hotel no longer convenient for us Shenzhen ferry travelers.The rooms are old -- and smell like cigarettes. The beds are SUPER hard, and did I mention the smell? Also, they architecture is ridiculous in that you have to carry your suitcase up about 4 stairs to get to the elevator. At the end of a day of business I do not want to carry my wheeled bag up 4 steps to get to an elevator. It's crazy.I do have some good comments: 1. Breakfast is included -- and they have a pretty decent buffet. Lots of good dim sum.2. The executive lounge has been updated quite nicely.3. The staff is very friendly and helpful.Other than that - skip the Royal Pacific.

<Content>Convenient location and reasonable pricing We stayed at Royal Pacific Hotel and Towers for two separate nights. Chose the hotel because of its close proximity to the China Ferry Terminal and a free shuttle to Kowloon station for the airport. Hotel has a convenient location, esp. if you are travelling into cities in China along the Pearl River Delta, and would definitely recommend for value-conscious business travellers, who are not looking for something fanciful. However, because it is catered for business travellers, the two floors we have stayed in, stunk of cigarette smoke! Even though we are staying on non-smoking floors! The hotel is rather far, by Hong Kong'er's standards, from the subway stations (in between Tsim Sha Shui and Jordan, approx. 15 mins walk). However, considering the price (~630 HKD a night), the distance is reasonable.

<Content>We had a great time We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights and 6 days. It was a brief, but wonderful. The hotel was very nice, and the spectacular views of Victoria Harbour was excellent. Great location. A perfect place for the family. The staff was very helpful and we enjoyed one of our best meals at the Caf茅 on the Park. It was close for everything, like ferry terminal, shops and parks. We would definitley recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>Loved our stay at the Royal Pacific Towers This was my second trip to Hong Kong and I selected the Royal Pacific Hotel after reading some of the reviews and the description on their website. My girlfriend and I had a great time and enjoyed our stay there. The staff at the hotel was very nice, friendly, and attentive. I booked a Superior room in the Tower Wing and found the room to be very comfortable, ample, and very clean. The bathroom was very nice, clean, and had a separate shower and tub, a bit larger than other hotels. The hotel is close to virtually all locations in Kowloon. You can walk to the back and walk along the waterfront, cross over to Kowloon Park, or take the escalalators down to the three story mall, where you will find Pacific Coffee House and a Starbucks :) The bottom floor exits on Canton Road where you will find the Harbor Mall and many other stores, restaurants, and attractions. Five days went by too fast for us and we hope to return later this year. We will definitely stay at the Royal Pacific Hotel again and would recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Excellent Location, Good Food and Service The primary motive for booking a room here was the location; as the majority of my trip was spent in the mainland, staying directly above the ferry terminal to mainland China was a great benefit. During the rest of the time in Hong Kong, the location also provided easy access to the rest of Hong Kong. It is near a mall, very close to the walk of stars where the nightly laser light show can be seen, the museums, and the ferries across the bay to the other side of the city.The restaurants and staff at the hotel were both fantastic, although for the price being paid, the additional cost for amenities which ought to be included standard (wireless access, etc.) is a bother.The lounge act downstairs near the lobby was great; there's nothing better than watching soccer while drinking a frosty beer and listening to a Malaysian group.

<Content>Great Staff at an aging hotel This hotel has certainly seen better days. The booked rooms were sold out so we were upgraded to the best category of rooms they had. A good sized room (given Hong Kong standards). The room was clean, although there was a sizeable (from the bathroom door to the center of the room) stain on the carpet. Fresh fruit was provided each day. The front desk staff and everyone else on staff that we met were pleasant and very helpful. If you are planning on going to Macau, an excellent choice, as the hotel sits overtop the actual ferry terminal. Two escalators down from the lobby and there you are. About a 5 minute walk to the MRT (Hong Kong subway system) and from Nathan Street (one of the major throughways of Hong Kong). Overall, a good hotel, but I am sure there are better choices for the money.

<Content>Lovely place, but a bit small room We stopped by here for the Chinese New Year in Hong Kong.Room was beautiful but very small, compared to the other hotels I generally stay in HK. However, the staff was pleasant, location pretty good (just by the Harbor City Mall in TST).Everything was perfect, only though I did not really find this place value for money. Else, would sure stay here again.

<Content>Average. Staff Attitude We stayed here for the convenience of the ferry terminals to Macau.Check-in was below bar. Lady behind the counter had serious attitude and seemed to be doing us a favour. When we got to the room, it was Smoking room and stunk badly - we had requested non-smoking. We asked for a change and were actually 'downgraded' to a much smaller and more crammed room. It was so small the chair for the small desk had to be used at a 45degree angle. (ie. it could not even fit straight under the desk)Even the porer who moved our cases to the new room basically dumped them and walked out the room. As we were only staying one night we decided to grin and bear it.Stay there again - not likely.

<Content>Just OK I missed the last ferry to Shenzhen so I picked this hotel simply as it is part of the complex. I just walked in and asked for a room. The room was small and a bit outdated. It was comfortable nevertheless. It is actually a good deal for UK$850. I could not get to make the wireless internet in my room so I had to use the buisiness center. The staff was very helpful. Even if the business center was closing at 23h00 they proposed to let me keep working there. It was also given a credit for the lack of internet in my room.

<Content>Mediocre We have been to Hong kong more than 8 times, and this is the first time we stayed here because other hotels have been booked. We stayed here because of the location and the price. We booked a tower room. The room size is not bad for Hong Kong. However, the hotel is in dire need for a renovation. The rooms and bathrooms are so old that they literally cry for a renovation like 5 years ago. Bring a hair-dryer if you have to stay there as the one by the hotel is so terrible that I am not sure whose hair can be dried by that stuff.Like many hotels in Hong Kong, the hotel management and front desk is extremely rigid and inflexible. Don't expect much of a service by western standard. But if you need a reasonable place to stay a short while, the hotel provides all the basic needs and is adequate. In summary, the strength of the hotel (tower room) includes the excellent location, the reasonable size of the tower rooms and the price. The weaknesses are the aging status of the rooms and some of the inadequate facilities and the lack of warm service (rigid management style).

<Content>Nice Place My wife and I stayed here for a few days before heading on to Bali, and we liked it a lot. (They did upgrade us to a suite.) It was a good price for the room, and it wasn't a big US chain hotel. The rooms were of course smaller than at home, but they were very clean, modern and made good use of the space at hand. They also left us some fresh fruit in the room when we arrived. We were able to get to it using the free shuttle bus from the Airport Express train station in Kowloon. That was a big relief after a long flight from Canada. From the hotel it was only a 10-15 minute walk to the famous Star Ferry terminal that got us over to downtown. For tourists, this is a better way to go than booking a hotel in the more expensive central district.

<Content>No regrets I and my family stayed in this hotel for 2 nights from 28th Nov to 30th Nov. 07. Contrary to some negative comments , we found there is nothing wrong with the hotel in terms of conditions and locations. I booked 2 rooms and was given one upgraded room at the executive floor overlooking the harbour. The view was nice. Both the rooms I booked are in excellent condition, clean and cosy.The staff were helpful and courteous. I am satisfied with my stay there.

<Content>Liked the location We stayed here going to and from China for a total of 5 nights. Overall we were happy with our experience. The rooms were large by Hong Kong standards. Yes it is a bit shabby but that is not uncommon in HK. The room were a bit older and the bathrooms would have been wonderful 10 or more years ago. But no complaints.Our last few nights we had fabulous views of the harbour and Island, which more than made up for any deficiencies. I think the hotel is 2 towers. It is also 3 lobbies and many elevators. It takes a while to just orient yourself on how to get in and out. It is also very very busy, just like most everything in HK. Below the hotel is the ferry terminal, and if you take the bridge to Kowloon Park from the lobby level you can take a pleasant walk to the TST station. The Pacific Coffee Company on the street level is a nice place to relax and doing some surfing. You have to briefly go out on Canton Road to make your way into the mall which you can follow to the Star Ferry. Or you can stay on Canton Road and fight the pedestrian traffic to get there.The restaurant has good buffets for dinner and breakfast. Maybe a bit pricey, although this is HK.

<Content>Small rooms but convenient location First stayed in this hotel in 1999 and again in Oct 07 which means you can tell this is an old hotel. Rooms are old but properly maintained and bathroom is extremely small. Renovation are ongoing during my stay in Oct 07 which means it is a little noisy during the day which means you cannot sleep lateThe good thing about this hotel is that it is located right above HKG-China Ferry terminal which makes connection between China and HKG as well as Macau and HKG very convenient. All you need to do is to go up to the reception on arrival at the ferry terminal. also adjacent to the Kowloon park and despite my numerous trip to HKG, this was the first time I went over to the park which is quite refreshing indeed, a park smack right in the centre of a busy TST. Also at the ferry terminal is a food court which added to the convenience. The only negative aspect of this hotel is probably the long walk to TST MTR station which is about at least 15 mins walk away

<Content>Okay if you're willing to put up with dirty conditions I stayed by myself in this hotel earlier this year for 5 nights. The package deal with my travel agency included a free upgrade to one better than the cheapest room (I can't remember the name). Anyway, the bathroom was dirty. I would not have used the bath if you had paid me. There was a permanent dirt ring around the interior of the bath, and also several pubic hairs (yes, that's right) inside the bath from previous visitors. The dirt ring and pubic hairs were never cleaned up during my entire stay.I wanted to use a blanket, so I removed the only one available from a plastic wrap. I thought it was okay at first, until I realized it was choc-full of human head hair. It almost felt like it was woven from human hair! Disgusted, I chucked it back into the closet. I didn't want to request another, for fear it would be the same.Also, once I returned to find my bed had been made as per usual; fine - except that there were two freshly clipped fingernails (complete with black nail polish) sitting in the middle of the bed. What had I done to deserve this, I thought. I am a pretty neat room occupant!There was also a toothpick on the carpet in the entry, when I arrived on the first day, and rubbish still stuck to the plastic bathroom bin from previous visitors was never removed throughout my entire stay.This hotel is also very hard to get to from street level if you're on foot; it takes ages. You either go through the shopping mall/port station, up maybe half a dozen small escalators to the lobby. Or you can take the one extremely long escalator right to the top, then go through another building, then across the driveway, then you're there.I think the room size I had was okay for one person, maybe at best for two people. There was space for one suitcase on top of a storage cupboard. I also wished I had requested a non-smoking floor. Because smoke was all I could smell in my room, and in the corridor! Even in the closet, when I hung up my clothes, it didn't help. They just smelt worse.The window had no view either, unless you're interested in looking at the office block next door. But if I looked down I could see the front entrance of the hotel below. And I believe if I craned my neck I could see a few inches of the port.I don't recommend buying the buffet breakfast either. I regret having pre-paid for 3 breakfasts. At first it was a novelty, but then I got really sick of it. And you had to be there before 9:30am, which wasn't worth it because a lot of shops don't open until after 10:30am. So often I got there late and had to eat really fast. The fried food was strange and didn't tase good. Also, the fruit was literally tasteless. I would've much rather gone to Macca's, a local place like Cafe de Coral or a European-inspired cafe chain for more variety, and at least you know the food hasn't been sitting there all morning.So I would only recommend staying here if you can put up with all of these conditions, perhaps if you're budget conscious. I really don't think it's worth its 3 star rating. Maybe 2.

<Content>wrong room?? the deluxe room given to us looked to me like a superior room because i was expecting a separate shower facilities as advertised in their website but ours was only shower/bathtub. i know 2 rooms with separate shower facilities, deluxe and grandluxe rooms. deluxe rooms face the city/building while grandluxe rooms face PARTIAL harbour view. since there was no SEPARATE shower facilities, i presumed i was given a superior room?? i wrote an email about this but there is still no reply from them.i don't like their housekeeping which doesn't provide DAILY cosmetic consummables like shampoo,conditioner, soap etc. compared to other hotels i have stayed in, OTHER hotel housekeeping always gives us these consumables daily even though i haven't used them. there is also ONLY1 free distilled bottle for 2 occupants every day of stay which is unusual as the hotel knows there are 2 of us registered in the room.

<Content>Good for the price We stayed two nights at the Royal Pacific in the midst of the conference season and secured a tower room for 1200 HKD. It was not the height of luxury but was large (37 square metres) and perfect for a family of four (one infant). Location is excellent with a traffic free pier (great views to HK island and nice to relax at night) on one side and Kowloon park on the other - both great places for kids to run around. I could find fault but we wanted a big room in a great location for a decent price and it matched all those criteria.

<Content>The rooms were not quite as what their website showed... The front desk at the Royal Pacific Towers were very friendly and helpful, we had booked the room through travelocity for a great deal for 2 rooms, 1 double and 1 triple. Only that the triple was a smoking room, we wanted a non-smoking room, they offered to spray down the room so the smell of the smoke would go away, but we were pretty insistent that wouldnt work and plus all of us had allergies so that would have been a bad move. They were very helpful in changing room to a non-smoking floor. Much better but the room didnt look like what their website showed as for photos of rooms. The hotel part where the double room was small but newer but the bathroom was not updated. Our room with a rollaway was a decent size and the bathroom was too, so we were pleasantly surprised. Their cafe on the park restaurant was good. The area of the hotel is prime location for shopping so we were very thrilled.

<Content>Great Hotel Ask for room facing the victoria harbor on the Tower Wing... and you can sit there and enjoy the lights across the harbor every night. Never regretted for choosing that hotel for our stay in HK. There's a ferry terminal beside the hotel and MTR is Tsim Tsa Tsui (just walk across a park). The rates we got was great and it was packaged with CX airline.

<Content>Good value We stayed at the Royal Pacific Hotel and Towers because it seemed to be one of the cheapest quality hotels (I think it's a ***, not a **** as stated in another review) in HK and we wanted to stay in the Peninsula for our final few days. The RPHT enabled us to do this without spending far too much on our stopover from Sydney to London. Furthermore, the hotel is situated directly over the China Ferry Terminal, and we wanted to take a ferry to Macau from this terminal on one of our days there.The RPHT lived up to our expectations. Our room, in the hotel wing, was really quite small (though we could have upgraded for HK拢300 or so a night, which isn't much), but it was clean and pleasant and the staff were very helpful. The laundry service was amazingly good compared to hotels in Australia. The layout of the hotel takes a bit of working out, but this is true of many hotels in HK, because of the shopping malls they stand on. There is a Pacific Coffee Company (a rather superior Asian version of Starbucks) on Canton Road under the hotel, if one wants a cheap Western breakfast (we can't comment on breakfast in the hotel, as it cost extra and we didn't have it).The hotel is very near (10-15 minutes walk) both the Star Ferry Terminal and Tsim Sha Tsui MTR (Metro/Underground/Subway) station, both of which take you to Central Hong Kong very quickly. There are several very atmospheric shopping streets around Tsim Sha Tsui, as well as modern malls, and it's only one MTR stop from Temple Street Night Market. The city art gallery (next to the Star Ferry Terminal) and space museum are not far either. Well worth staying in if you want a cheap central hotel in Kowloon.

<Content>Great Location, Great People, Great Room My husband and I stayed at the hotel wing over the weekend. We bookedthe room via the hotel website and got a very good deal from it. Regular room costs HKD850++, but since we stayed for 3 nights, we were upgraded to a contemporary premier room, which has been recentlyrenovated. Although it was a tiny room, it was clean, bed and pillowswere comfy, bathroom had a tub. Being upgraded to the premier floor allowed us to have access to the lounge, with free breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. The food was not my type since Iam more of a buffet with several choices of food person, my husbandwas happy with the food, especially the large strawberries. Drinks were also complementary the entire day! Staff were all soooooo f$riendly and attentive. My husband got stomach flu while we were there, and staff were very accommodating, advising that there is a doctor available should he needs one.Location is very good. China ferry is just below if you want to cross to Macau. There is a huge shopping mall beside it - Ocean Terminal/Harbour City. Great restaurants across the streets.Check out their site now if you intend to visit HK before 31Jul07.

<Content>Great location and services but very dirty and old Hi, this hotel has the greatest location, near shopping, ships, mtr all, but my room was very old the bathroom is scary roof is falling, from how old it is, their towels are as thin as papers. The pillows stink. walls in the room dirt were realy dirty, carpet full of stain. I had to put my cloth on the pillow to be able to sleep on it. However the size is great, the people there are eager to help when they can speak english. Cheking in is fast. I would stay there again if they renovate the rooms. location, again is really great .

<Content>OK hotel but not worth the 4 stars OK hotel . We were in a standard room in the hotel wing and it JUST adequate for me and my son..there did not seem to be any facilities other than a lift and the lobby and the coffee shop downstairs which gets most of the credit...nice coffee and danishes and free internet..We were in HK for a week and I really did not feel they noticed we were there..apart from if we left the curtains open at dusk when some one came up to close them?The position was OK but as a previous reviewer said a bit on a limb for the EXCELLENT MTR system but fine for the lovely park.I would not use it again if i could get into the YMCA Salisbury which is much better placed..for what we paid (average 拢50/night Hoteltravel.com) it was OK ..just like a travelodge

<Content>Okay hotel The Royal Pacific has a towers wing and a hotel wing. We found the layout quite confusing as there are seperate lifts for different floors etc.The room was comfy - hard bed though - and was surprisingly spacious. Nice bathroom. Not much of a view from our 'superior' room but we weren't in there much as Hong Kong is a great place to be out and about soaking up the character and atmosphere.Service was okay. They were helpful but not as friendly as many of the other hotels we had stayed out throughout the trip. We requested a late checkout and had to pay a fair amount to keep the room until 6pm. Other hotels had not charged us for this so we were a bit disappointed but guess this could be consider usual practice and we had been lucky previously.We would go back however I would probably rather try out another hotel. This one was a bit pricey for what it provided. Location was good but no better than others, depending on what you are after. This one is close for the ferry and boat trips. Not so close to MTR but is walking distance - 15 mins or so.

<Content>Less than average W\e booked with expedia and paid nearly $AU200 for one night stopover). We were terribly disappointed.The hotel appears to be undergoing renovation. Our room was BASIC. Two SINGLE beds - have had better in hostels. This is not an international standard hotel.The room had none of the usual information on the hotel. One outcome of that neglect was that when we wanted to use the pool we were told rather abruptly that it was closed in the early afternoon for cleaning. Its location is 'interesting '- not many tourists get to stay in the Hong Kong 'burbs'! There are no street scapes, shops, alleyways, justshopping centres and building sites for more of the same. However, ifyou make it to the public space/gardens at the back of the Shatin Local Council offices before 07.30 you will be soothed by the sight of local people doing their morning tai chi and get to see where the Hong Kong people live.In other words, the hotel was sub standard and the location is miles from anywhere except China!

<Content>excellent choice Stayed here with my husband and two children and thought it was ideal for us. We had interconnecting rooms which were spacious, clean and very comfortable. However we upgraded to the towers so this is what i am commenting on. We were on room only basis but had breakfast each morning in the downstairs cafe and it was outstanding, quality of a 5 star and really cheap. Ate there in the evenings on a couple of occasions and faultless.However this hotel is above ferry port so it was endless hikes on the elevator but this is the only drag. Really central and views over the harbour. excellent staff and i certainly will return.This made our holiday so stress free, it was wonderful.

<Content>Good Service Since I'm coming in through Macau, I thought it would be ideal to book myself at Royal Pacific Towers, which is just above the ferry port. True to the core, it's a floor above the arrival hall (the only frustrating point is that the Macau ferry port is such a long walk to the exit gates of a floor under the hotel lobby.Moreover, when you hit the escalator leading to the lobby, the ram is so small for an average size lugguage bag. There are 3 steps leading to the escalator, and when I checked in, they upgraded me to the deluxe room on the Towers Wing.From the lobby, you have to take 2 flights of stairs to reach the lift on the Deluxe towers wing. I didn't have the energy to pull the bags, so I had a bellboy do the honour. The service is totally excellent - fast and efficient. Check in was good.Room size at the Deluxe Tower wing is good. There is a different area for wardrobe  mirrors... and they have a different bath area, and a shower area. The marbled white walls look a little dirty to me.Amenities were sufficient, even they had an electrical adaptor for overseas travellers. The air conditioning wasn't working good though - I stayed for 5 nights and throughout the 5 nights, it was cold. I turned the air conditioner off, but it still felt chilly. As for the bedsheets, it's the most uncomfortable one I have ever slept on. The blankets were made of those brown thick hard woolen type, and they were harsh to the body. I tried the room service - it came in half hour, and the food is excellent. If you take the escalator down to the shopping mall, you will find a 7-Eleven shop (operations from 8 am - 11 pm)... and a restaurant next to it which serves good Chinese boiled soup. Try it... you'll never regret it.One thing I need to remind you though - I booked the room through Precision Reservations... and I requested for a Victoria Harbour Room - I did not get it. Not all rooms have harbour views... you'll probably face another office building of gold colour. Try observing this - if you hit the 'Cafe On the Park', you will notice that the window glass shakes each time some boat comes along.... it's like a a minor earthquake.

<Content>Very Good Hotel The Royal Pacific Hotel is a very good hotel to stay in Hong Kong. It is conveniently located along Canton Road where public transport is so accessible. It is also very near the Harbour City Mall (supposedly the biggest mall in HongKong); ferry terminal to Macau; ferry terminal to cross over Hong Kong Island; and Haiphong Road and Nathan Road which are shopping districts. The MTR Tsim Tsa Tsui station is also just about 10 mins walk. Rooms are also very clean and elegant. Just a tip though, don't get the top floor rooms. At first I was flattered that we were given a top floor room, until we were actually in the room and were disturbed by the loud hum of the elevators. Apparently, the top floor is where the elevator machines are also located.It was a good thing the airconditioning in our room was not working and we were able to request for a transfer to a lower floor room.Their buffet breakfast is also very very good. I recommend this Hotel.

<Content>Great! This is not the first time i stay at The Royal Pacific Hotel and I love coming back everytimes. Staffs are all friendly and nice, and they even recognize me! Location is great as the ferry to China is just downstair. The hotel seperate into 2 wings, hotel wing  towers wing. I stayed at the towers wing everytime and the room size is good enough. It provide wireless internet service at HK$120 per day which is a Hong Kong price. Sometimes I can see the victoria harbour view from my room, it is beautiful at night! I also love the bathroom as it has seperate shower and bath which can not easily found in most of the HK hotel. With no doubt, I will come back to stay in this hotel next time, for sure!

<Content>Great, convenient location We arrived in Hong Kong after a 15 hour flight and proceeded to go by bus (30 minutes) to Kowloon to check into the Hotel. There were 8 in our group requiring 4 rooms. We were offered an upgrade to the top floor (22) (which is reserved for smoking) - This floor gave us a view of the Star Ferry area and the Harbor. The maids cleaned the rooms (wiped down wood) and sprayed to rid of any smoking odor. The rooms were spacious - twin beds (hard as boards) beautiful full marble bath with tub and separate shower. The amenities supplied in the room were first class. There is a restaurant located down one floor from the Hotel, which comps those staying in the Hotel for one breakfast each day. Excellent food - generous - buffet to include hot, cold, eastern and western and continental foods. Also located beneath the Hotel are the bus and ferry stations to depart to go to Macau . Shopping centers are also accessible from this locations via underground walkways, as well as Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds (if you must). The hotel is alongside Canton Rd which has wonderful shopping plazas plus there is an internet cafe nearby (free of charge with a purchase of a drink). The Hotel has a business floor (19th) offering internet service for 40 HK$ per 15 min - Not worth it as their connection is too slow and troublesome. Suggest you use the internet cafe. All tours you schedule will have a bus pick you up at this Hotel. The Hotel concierege service is not very helpful to non-cantonese speaking visitors, nor do the Hotel Staff have a secure grasp of other languages. There is a money exchange service at the Hotel (they were buying dollars for 7.30 HK per 1$ - far below the bank rate of 7.7 to 7.9 HK for $1. Nevertheless, it is convenient and always available. There are long lines in most banks - Kay NelsonHK, Macau, Canton tourist Jan 07

<Content>Excellent We stayed 3 nights on dec2006. The room was a little small, but the was a small minus. Friendly staff, very clean and modern hotel; i would say give it at least 4 stars. Great location at canton road, just a short walk from star ferry. There is a really nice cafe downstairs with wireless internet. Oh.. the gym was the smallest i've ever seen..No problems, clean, excellent location etc.

<Content>Weird... Coming from the hotel business myself, I found the lay-out a little strange. We got dropped off in a parking lot and had to go through a renovation process. Once up, we had to cross some kind of walkway to go to the actual lobby. The breakfast restaurant is one floor down, in which seemed to me, a ferry terminal slash shopping area. Also, for some reason they have a few steps to get to the elevators for the Tower. Had to bounce the suitcases up and down, as there wasn't always someone paying attention. Staff is extremely polite, but especially at the concierge who was always busy, it felt like they mapped out where you wanted to go faster than you could follow, and went on to the next guest. The location is perfect, short walk to the subway, shops and Victoria HArbour. Also, our 2nd night, both the restaurant and Safari Bar had been booked for a private event, leaving other guests nowhere to eat but in their room, ordering roomservice. (Which was quick and good)As for the room, we had a Tower room. Not a very exciting view, but we did see some water. Didn;t matter much to us, as we were there only to sleep! The bathroom was perfect! Seperate shower and bath and nice amenities. Size and beds were fine for us.

<Content>Not too bad. Good location Just came back from a 4D3N stay in Hong Kong. Stayed in the hotel wing with my gal pal.After reading some of the reviews here, i was kind of prepared for what to expect. Check in was swift, staff was polite. Checked into my room and indeed it is a little small but that is what to expect from Hong Kong hotels.Bathroom is clean which is a big plus. My friend found the bed abit hard but i quite like it. I like that there is a Pacific Coffee outlet right below the hotel. Not crowded with free internet surfing. Try their cheesecakes, its delicious. Location of hotel is good too. With many shopping malls nearby. Transport is efficient, taxis are always right in front of the main road and the MTRis a short walk away.Overall i would not mind coming back to this hotel again. But i'll ask for the Tower Wing instead just to see hows it like.

<Content>Fantastic experience ..... We had a great time at the Royal Pacific .......... opted for the Club floor but the additional expense was well worth it. Great service and good quality breakfast, tea and evening drinks.The view from the room across to Hong Kong City was magical. The room was good and had everything you could need for a very comfortable stay.Had dinner (buffet) at the Cafe on the Park ........ it was good. Also enjoyed drinks and snacks in the Safari Bar with a great view of the night time city.Great access to good shopping ........... easy to get to local transport including the famous White Star Ferry. Take the bus (only HKD 13) from outside the hotel to Stanley Market ......... sitting upstairs you get great views of the city and then the bays along the way, culminating in a chance to vist a good quality local market.The staff were great - helpful, well trained and gave a quality service.The hotel made our trip to Hong Kong an abiding memory ......... would definitely go back.

<Content>Not the best, not the worst We spent two nights in the Royal Pacific Towers, and have the following observations:1. Be sure you get the room you paid for. We were coming from an inland Chinese city and booked our flight/rooms through Dragonair Holidays, as it was the cheapest alternative for us. When I made the booking I specifically requested (and paid for) a room in the tower wing based on the larger size and reviews here. However, when we arrived they tried to put us into the regular hotel wing. It appeared the reservation had not been made correctly due to miscommunication between our Chinese travel agency (Dragonair holidays), the HK travel agent and the hotel. It took us nearly an hour to sort it out, during which time the desk agent asked me to sign a slip saying we would pay the difference in the room charge if it was not a mistake (I refused). Finally I think she got embarrassed to have us standing there at the counter, and agreed to let us go up to the tower room without signing the slip. We had not been in the room two minutes before they called to confirm the travel agent error. The desk agent was nice enough during this process, but I wish she had been more willing to take our word about the mistake. 2. Tower wing is not ocean viewI had assumed from information on the hotel website that rooms in the tower wing all had ocean view. This is not the case. Our room (1534) had views of the surrounding buildings only (one about 3 meters away, one about 5 meters away). I was disappointed with this3. Mini-bar location a problem for those with kidsThe mini-bar in our room was in a cabinet at floor level. We have a toddler, so this was a bit problematic. 4. Air conditioning very noisyEven at the lowest setting, the air conditioner was very noisy. It was not too hot at night, so we could turn it off. Would be a problem in hotter weather.5. Stairs between lobby and room elevators inconvenientThere is a short flight of 5-6 stairs between the main lobby in the towers wing and the elevators that take you to the rooms. Stupid design. Had to carry the stroller up and down. Assistance from the staff was sporadic -- sometimes they were there, sometimes not. We managed, but would be an issue for people with more limited mobility.6. Location.Most convenient if you are taking the express ferry to Shenzhen -- probably the only reason I would choose this hotel again. At the far north end of Ocean City, so a bit of a slog back and forth to star ferry, etc. Location is very good for Kowloon Park, which has a nice kids play area, though -- you are just across a skybridge to the park. But there are stairs on both sides of the bridge, so you have to carry the stroller a bit.7. Other notesRoom size was o.k., but I don't think it was 38 sq m as advertised. Bed was a bit hard, but that is common in China. We got a king sized bed, which was nice.Broadband available but WAAAAY too expensive (120 HK$/day). Free coffee and tea, but no newspaper, fruit, or bottled water.We were the first stop on the shuttle bus from the airport, and the last to get picked up, which saved some time over other hotels I suppose.Kind of wish I had spent the extra money to stay at the Shangri-La Kowloon, which was the other option we were considering. Live and learn...For what it's worth, we have also stayed in the following hotels in HK over the past several years. Marco Polo GatewayMarco Polo PrinceHoliday Inn Golden MileRegal KowloonI would say all are pretty comparable to this one in terms of amenities, services, etc.

<Content>Stay in the Tower After staying in another hotel on our first visit to Hong Kong we were very disappointed when we checked in to this hotel. Yes it is quite conveniently located close to the fun shopping areas, but the hotel wing really needs attention. We were originally given a VERY small room in the hotel wing with 2 twin beds. After complaining, we were upgraded to an equally small deluxe room, also in the hotel room. At least this room had been refurbished and was fine for a short stay, but still not worth staying in. Eventually we ended up in a premium room in the tower. Finally a room was what we had originally expected. This hotel is worth staying in, only if you get a great deal, and only if you are in the tower.
