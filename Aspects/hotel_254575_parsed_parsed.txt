<Content>A Must! I absolutely love this hotel. My husband and I stayed in a double and my kids were in the room next door with two twin beds. They were very comfortable too. We stayed for 6 nights and we were very pleased, the staff was very friendly, the room was an adequate size, clean and the English breakfast was hearty.The #24 bus runs 24 hours and stops in front of the hotel, which can be a plus when you're out late. It's also within walking distance to either the Pimlico or Victoria Underground.It was the perfect hotel for us.

<Content>Great Value  I stayed at LS for 6 nights in late November in single w/ shared bath. Everybody knows these rooms are small. And they are...but perfect as a place to rest your head and allow you to spend $ elsewhere. The property is clean and as a solo traveler I felt safe in the neighborhood. Easy walk from Victoria or Pimlico station...Pimlico a much calmer experience. Breakfasts were filling and tasty. Great access to bus, tube, grocery and restaurants. I would stay here again.

<Content>Never felt so welcome in London! My best stay ever. What a change compared to the thousands of shabby places with shabby service in the medium-low price range in London! This was a perfect stay, and I will look no further in the future. Luna Simone are two twin hotels (or two parts of the same hotel) with a common reception, I was in the Luna part, room 7 (twin) on the first floor. I can't speak for the Simone part, but I assume it was the same.The place is spotless, with soft built-in carpets, security fire doors, simple but pretty furnishings. The room lacked nothing, and was quite spacious. The bathroom was magnificent, better than mine at home, with a gigantic shower. Very confortable beds, very clean linen, towels changed every day, space for luggage, desk and chairs, hangers, wardrobe, extra pillows, a fan, very good heating and lighting, hairdryer. Never seen anything like this room at this price in London!The breakfast (A' LA CARTE!) is magnificent, served in a modernly furnished caf猫 in the basement. You can select one thing from each of the three paragraphs the menu, but if you don't fancy something, they offer you stuff that's not in the menu. And they bring you more if you want. Better service than in any caf猫 in town! It's like being in a luxury hotel.The BEST thing of this hotel is the service and the staff, all EXTREMELY nice and professional. I just couldn't believe it! The staff at a Sheraton hotel I once stayed in were no nicer than the ones at Luna Simone. Heartwarming, really.The hairdryer broke, so they instantly gave us a replacement, and the next day a new hairdryer had been installed. The curtain had come off one of its hooks, and immediately they sent someone to fix it. Never in London have I felt so welcome before.We were checking out early, so I asked for a discount and they did give us one. Not as much as I was hoping, just 5拢, but that's more or less what I spent for breakfast for two in Starbucks at the airport, so it was fine. I appreciated their fairness. Other hotels don't give a fiddle if you miss breakfast.It was well worth spending (per room) 15-20拢 more than a lot of budget hotels in London to have such a wonderful and confortable experience.Loved it!

<Content>look no futher! Clean, comfortable and at a good price with breakfast included and not far from London Victoria. A pleasant, quiet, family run hotel. After spending over 2 hours looking online this hotel kept popping up. Do not let the fact of not being able to check vacancies online put you off. I rang them the next day and was able to book without a problem. I asked for a ground floor room as my mother has walking issues and they accomodated us by moving some bookings around. There is also a flight of stairs down to the breakfast room in the basement. The bus stops just outside the hotel, so do not forget to get your ticket in advance. Taxi's pass by frequently but the cost varies on the driver not the distance. We will recommend this hotel to our friends and would have no hesitation in staying there again.

<Content>Look no further After spending hours and hours trawling through websites to find accommodations deals, I began to think there was nowhere in London that could provide us with a room for a night at a reasonable rate, in a good location and that wouldn't have a trip advisor review without the words, dirty, terrible, and don't stay here, etc. Finally, on the basis of all the positive reviews on trip advisor I booked the Luna  Simone, and was delighted to find it was exactly as all the previous reviewers had said - spotless, warm, in a good location, and with very friendly hosts.We stayed for 5 nights and friends who live a few hours outside London came down to join us and stayed in the BB in the room beside us for 2 nights. They also found it to be excellent and would definitely stay again. As we hadn't booked directly (it was through an agency), the rooms allocated were on the top floor (my friend tells me she counted 86 stairs!) and whilst you dread climbing it after the simple but filling breakfasts, the rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable and it wouldn't put me off going back. The breakfast is as described, cornflakes or orange, eggs with or without bacon and beans, or ham and tomato, and toast. The breakfast room is immaculately clean. The owners, who were as hospitable as everyone says, did offer to provide alternatives if we wanted, but I found the breakfast to be just what we needed for a day out in London.Our rooms were cleaned and made up every day and we were provided with fresh towels daily which I didn't expect. There is a hairdryer, tv and tea and coffee making facilities. I can't compare the size of the rooms to other hotels as this was my first stay in London, but you can't beat cleanliness and we were there to see London rather than stay in the room. As Victoria station was approx 10 mins walk away, we bought a weekly travelcard and used the tube to travel about. The travelcard also got us 2for1 deals into things like the Tower of London, Tower Bridge Exhibition and the War Cabinet Rooms etc, which was very useful and they were all worth seeing. The travelcard can also be used for the buses and we went to see 2 shows and were delighted to find that the number 24 bus stop was not too far away from either theatre and it dropped us off right outside the door. I would definitely stay here again, and if you are currently searching for a place to stay, look no further and book the Luna  Simone.

<Content>Wonderful B I've stayed in many places in London and this one tops the list.The rooms are typically small London rooms, but absolutely spotless. The bathrooms, although small are nicely tiled and have great showers and lots of hot water - not always common in London. Breakfast was more than ample and I loved the jovial atmosphere in the breakfast room, where the owners actually help to serve. The location is very central and there are a couple of great restaurants just around the corner. All in all this BB offers the best of everything and I would highly recommend it.

<Content>Great Value Hotel My son (13) and I stayed at the Luna Simone for 2 nights last week. We found the hotel to be in a great location for us due to close proximity to Victoria and easy walking distance for many of the attractions. The staff were friendly and helpful, the breakfast simple but good quality and the bedroom and en-suite, although small was clean and warm. Great value for money, would definately use again.

<Content>Great hotel! Lovely little hotel, extremely clean rooms, pleasant staff and good cooked breakfast! Rooms were absolutely spotless, decent selection of tea and coffee in room - the hotel is old, but very well maintained! Staff was very welcoming. Had a single room w/ shared bathroom, small room but more than okay for a weekend trip! Short walk to both Victoria and Pimlico.

<Content>Very Clean. We stayed here for only one night on Sat 22 Nov.The hotel is located very close to Pimlico tube and is also only a short (5mins) walk from Victoria.The area around the hotel was fine with plenty of pubs, bars and places to eat. These we found just by wondering from the hotel towards Victoria station.We paid just 拢80 for the night inc. breakfast. We booked directly via the hotel鈥檚 site.We had to complete an inquiry form and ask for the price, but they were very quick with their response. We asked for a quiet room on a high floor and got one. Our room was at the back and up 4 flights of stairs. There are no lifts in the hotel, but I鈥檓 almost sure that if you were to ask any of the staff, they鈥檇 help with heavy bags etc. The whole place was spotless and very tidy. The en suit in our room was very clean and no crappy mould in the corners.All the lights worked as did the TV and hair dryer. There was a safe in the room with no additional charge.There was of course the usual tea and coffee making facilities, but we didn鈥檛 use them.Breakfast was very simple but ample. It was served in yet another spotlessly clean room and consisted of:Juice or Corn FlakesBoiled egg or Bacon, egg and beansWith Tea / Coffee and toast.I鈥檓 a vegetarian, so just asked for beans and egg. I got two eggs instead of the usual one as a replacement for the bacon. A nice touch.All in all, a great hotel and I really don鈥檛 think you could do a great deal better in London (Inc breakfast) for the price.Many thanksGraeme  Sandra

<Content>Wonderful! What a lovely and friendly little hotel! I stayed for four nights and I really enjoyed my stay. The staff is brilliant- you can tell they like what they are doing. The rooms are spotless and comfortable. Central heating, good waterpressure, tv,safe,hairdryer and kettle to make your stay more pleasant.The breakfast was served from 7.00 to 8.30. You can choose from a wide selection and as I wasn't keen on baconeggs style- they brought me a youghurt as an extra. Plenty of food to keep you going till lunch.It was lovely to watch the staff at work.Everything happened so smoothly(years of experience I guess) and the atmosphere was relaxed. Many guests were regulars as they hugged or shook hands with the staff when they were leaving. You don't get that in bigger hotels do you?I know where I'll be staying on my next trip to London.

<Content>Great deal in London Town! Had not stayed in this place for 23 years -- what a gem! I was in #5 - a single room w/ shared bath (right next to me) and was totally satisfied.Great breakfast - spotlessly clean and incredibly friendly staff.My single room was extremely small, but for 40 pounds and in a great location it was a deal!

<Content>Great Hotel Great little hotel, very clean. Good hearty breakfasts and the owners are extremely helpful. Try to get a room away from the front of the hotel where it is quieter. Otherwise, no complaints.

<Content>Great Value in London My family and I stayed at the Luna  Simone hotel this past spring. The Luna  Simone offers an excellent value in pricey London. Our rooms were clean and well-kept. The hotel is conveniently located half-way between London's Victoria and Pimlico tube stations, offering easy access to the Undergound. There are a number of nearby restaurants as well.The Luna  Simone offers an excellent British breakfast each morning, which my family and I took advantage of as often as possible. The owners of the hotel were very pleasant and welcoming.I'd highly recommend the Luna  Simone for a stay in London. My family and I were very pleased.

<Content>Great location Was really pleased with the price of this hotel considering the location (5 mins walk from Pimlico tube, 10 mins from Victoria). Great to find an English breakfast included for a change, unlike the previous hotel nearby where we got cold croissants, biscuits and long life yoghurts! Room wasn't massive, but plenty big enough and really clean. Hade to queue for breakfast on second day, but wasn't too much hassle and staff were very attentive. Friendly, family run hotel which I would reccommend to anyone.

<Content>Nice place great staff Stayed here on the tail end of a small Eurtrip with friends (3 of us total, all mid 20's). The staff was insanely helpful, I'm pretty sure it's family owned. It's convenient and is 2 blocks from Pimlico tube station. Rooms, while basic, were very clean. The bathroom stood out as new and clean.Overall, from what I researched from booking the hotel, the price was reasonable and it's a great place. Definitely not 5 star or anything, but newer and clean.

<Content>Fab Hotel First time in London. Had a fab time. Absolutely loved everything about it especially this hotel. It had everything onecould ask for - fantastic location, lovely staff, spotless roomand a great breakfast to set one up for the day. The Marquis of Westminster public house a short stroll away was the perfect place to end a perfect day. Would definitely stay at this hotel again.Mary  Carmel, Dublin.

<Content>Great B We booked a few nights' stay at Luna  Simone based on the Tripadvisor reviews and didn't regret it. The location is great, close to public transport, you could even walk to Buckingham Palace. Free breakfast and internet were great as well. Superb service. The room is small, but that's expected, it's clean and does the job. There's a kettle, no microwave though, and no lifts (that I'm aware of), so ask for room on the first level. The hotel staff did help us with our luggage though, so that was very appreciated. Value for money!

<Content>Lovely Rooms - Great Service - Excellent Location! This sweet little hotel is in the perfect location, located just a block and a half walk from the Pimlico Tubs station which gives you direct access to all of the Victoria line stops and transfers.It is owned by two brothers -- twins, I believe. You would see one of them hustling food out for breakfast then run upstairs and see the other one manning the front desk and think This guy is everywhere! They and the rest of the staff are incredibly responsive, friendly and will stop at nothing to take care of their guests.The rooms we stayed in were not large but were well laid out and cleanly decorated with a fresh continental touch. The beds were very comfortable and housekeeping was excellent.The included full English Breakfast was a welcome start to every day, delicious in a warm and bustling dining room downstairs.

<Content>Loved the Luna!! This is a great place to stay. We spent 3 nights here in October in a triple room. Comfortable, exceptionally clean rooms and bathrooms. Room had TV, Tea making facilities, hairdryer. Breakfast was served promptly and was well cooked. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Great location - Victoria Tube station less than 10 minutes walk, Pimlico tube about 5 mins walk and the 24 Bus stops right outside the door and goes to Westminster, trafalgar Square and Leicester Square. Perfect for transport back from theatres. I would recommend travelpasses. We bought one for 3 days and this can be used on tubes or buses. Restaurants, supermarkets all close by. Looking forward to our next trip. The best hotel we have ever stayed at in London!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel, Terrific Location I stayed at the Luna and Simone for 3 days from October 21 - 24 and again on October 26. I stayed in one of the basic singles with shared bath. NOT for the claustrophobic, as the room probably measures 6x12, but for all that, it's a cell with amenities-telephone, television, teamaker, hairdryer, wireless Internet. Clean room, a window that opens for ventilation, washbasin, towels provided, comfortable bed. The shared bath is small but servicable and right outside the door. If all you need is a place to stash your stuff and sleep at night, you don't need much more than that, and the price couldn't be beat, especially for central London!The staff - all family members, I believe - are wonderful and friendly. Breakfast was good and plentiful, and the service was efficient. They also have an Internet terminal if you can't get wireless (apparently, the signal doesn't go beyond the first floor - in my room, the signal was spotty) in your room.Best of all, the Pimlico neighborhood is wonderful. Victoria Station is about a 10 minute walk, Pimlico station is about 5, the #24 bus stops directly in front of the hotel and takes you to Westminster Abbey, Leicester Square and the British Musuem, and the #2 bus, which is the next street over, takes you through Mayfair to Marylebone. The Tate Britain is a short 10 minute walk away. And the neigbhorhood itself is replete with amenities - a mini-mart on the corner, a laundrette down the block, pubs and restaurants galore, nice shops, a fruit market up the street. In short, a real, liveable neighborhood, for all Belgrave Road is full of small hotels. This is someplace one could live for real.If you're a single wanting the basic room, try to ask for #5 instead of #4, as it is slightly larger and laid out better (#4's wardrobe is only accessible by standing on a chair). But don't hesitate to go for the singles, as despite their size, they're surprisingly comfortable.If I could make one recommendation, it would be for a wireless signal booster to improve the signal in the rooms. Other than that, I had absolutely no complaints. I really recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London who wants good, basic, convenient accommodation at incredibly reasonable prices.

<Content>Cosy Hotel with Great Location Great location within few minutes walk from Pimlico and Victoria stations and no. 24 busstop just in the front of the building. Comfortable neighbourhood with great local pub and selection of restaurants. And one big advantage was that National Express bus from Heathrow arrives to Victoria Coach Station that is only few minutes walk from the hotel, so no need to take the tube or taxi from airport.Staff was extremely helpful and friendly and you really got feeling about family runned hotel, not a big hotel chain. Rooms are neat and the shower was excellent with proper water pressure. There was also internet connection available besides reception (1 computer). It is also good to note that there is no lift and quite a few steps to walk if you are staying in top floor (perfectly OK for person with normal condition, but might be too heavy for eldery). Breakfast was served between 7 and 8.30 which was bit early in my opinion. It included tea or coffee and toast and either orange juice or conrflakes and then one of three: ham and tomato, boiled eggs or bacon and egg. If you are not fan of eggs it is a good alternative to switch third option to cornflakes or yogurt!I can recommed this hotel and would definately stay there again!

<Content>Excellent Great location. Bus 24 (24 hr) is steps from the front door. You can come home late at night from a play, no problem.Great value. The location is central to everything.Great rooms. Basic, but well appointed. Even includes a TV and wireless internet (only works from ground floor).Friendly Staff. I was pretty self sufficient, so didn't have a lot of interaction, but from what I saw, they were friendly and helpful, for a hotel with so many rooms to try and take care of. I also stayed at the Vicarage Gate hotel. Comparing the 2, they are very similar. VG is in a swankier neighborhood, but both have good connection and are quiet. VG's breakfast is more comprehensive, but it is also more expensive. LSimone's bus connection (24) cannot be beat. You can get anywhere and come home at 2am if you so desire. I didn't, but the bus runs 24 hrs a day.

<Content>Loved the Luna! Stayed at the Luna for three nights during the school's October week with my two children.The hotel is situated less than 10 minutes from Victoria Station where you can get transport tLoved the Luna!o all parts of London. Oxford Circus is only two stops away!Wicked and Billy Elliot are showing just beside Victoria.The hotel itself is very clean with the rooms being serviced every day and the towels changed. Our triple room was very spacious.The only negative thing was that breakfast finished at 8.30 am - too early! But that is a small point. I would definitely recommend this hotel for your stay in London!

<Content>Exactly as imagined. Stayed at the LS in mid September, with my wife. After checking out its homepage and the reviews here, It was exactly as we imagined it to be - a pleasant, welcoming place, well run by its Brit-Malteze owners. The room and bathroom facilities were adequate, although as others have stated there was some effort involved in getting our suitcases up there. As believers in having a solid breakfast before hitting the sites, the generous breakfast was also well organised. We'd sit down, place our order and in no time coffee, toast, real eggs (not that awful powdered stuff), bacon etc were brought out. The proximity to transport (Pimlico was closer and slightly easier to use than the cavernous Victoria station), restaurants and pubs were major pluses. Have to recommend the Italian corner restaurant a few metres away for its cheap and delicious pizza and a little further down Chimes a traditional pie and cider place.Importantly we also got a sense that the general area around the hotel was fairly upmarket and quite safe, so any walking to and from the LS in the evening/night time was not an issue. The only negatives would be the street noise, which was sometimes present but not unbearable and the inevitable noise from other rooms. One night, the people next door has their tv on loud and this could be heard - perhaps setting a limit on the volume might be a good idea (this was the case in a Paris hotel we stayed at immediately after the LS). If you're a light sleeper like me, earplugs may be a good idea although my wife had no problems. All in all, the LS was a comfortable and conveniant place to stay whilst in London.

<Content>Spotless hotel We had an overnight stay here prior to a long rail trip. It was absolutely perfectly situated for London Victoria's railway station. The hotel was very clean and the bathroom looked newly refurbished. The breakfast was good as well. I think it could sell itself better on several points though: we had eaten before travelling thinking there would be nowhere to eat nearby as we would arrive late. However, there were lots of good restaurants very close by and a good supermarket - the hotel could inform people of this on their website. Any downs? Well, we had to walk up 8 flights of stairs with our bags as we were on the top floor - would be good to think about installing a lift, and we could have done with a bedside table instead of just the shelf. The receptionist could have been a bit more forthcoming in selling the place too instead of just doing the basics - she may not be a stranger there, but most people are and could do with some advice. We wanted to borrow some glasses and/or an ice bucket as we were celebrating a special birthday, but no luck - would be nice to offer that option, would cost peanuts.The breakfast was good and the owners/managers in the breakfast room were very welcoming. It's good - just a few changes would make it excellent! Don't undersell yourself LunaSimone!

<Content>Great People...very Friendly and clean. We stayed there one night on Sept 10, prior to a cruise but I would have stayed there longer. Location is very good, the people were excellent - staff and owners were tops! The rooms was ample for European standards, bathroom was new and everything was clean. I will stay there again on my return.

<Content>Great stay at the Luna If you are looking for a budget hotel in London, then the Luna Simone is an absolute gem. It is on Belgrave road in-between Pimlico and Victoria tube stations. The hotel is spotlessly clean from top to bottom and the hosts are very nice people. It is run by a couple of brothers and they are proper Londoners,The room we had was small but adequate and is what you would expect from a London hotel in this price range. The bathroom was exceptionally clean and everything was fine. I was surprised to find that there was a free safe in the room also. Our room was on the top floor and for us, was hard work climbing the many stairs to our room. If you have heavy luggage this may be a problem. My advice would be to book early for a room on one of the lower floors. The hotel was completely full, which speaks volumes. We didn't have a problem getting a table in the breakfast room but a large family may have to wait a few minutes for one of the larger tables. The breakfast was with you in a jiffy. It was very nice and perfectly cooked with lots of toast. Service came with a smile and no waiting for anything. The hotel is on a bus route (No 24) wich stops almost outside the door. This bus runs 24 hours, every 5 minutes before 8pm and every 10 minute after that. It's a fantastic route that takes you past Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Downing Street and Trafalgar Square which all have stops. The bus carries on to Leicester Square in the heart of the theatre area. Get on the top deck and enjoy the views. We purchased day passes for the underground, around 拢5 each and these tickets are good for the buses also (a fantastic deal).We really enjoyed our stay in London and the Luna Simone made it a perfect break. I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel. We will definatly be staying there again.

<Content>Convenient Location We stayed for 3 nights at this hotel recently. We were on the 3rd floor overlooking the main street. Room was nice and cosy. Love the shower. It was great to have free WIFI internet that even reached to the 3rd floor. Otherwise, there's 1 computer in the computer room that you can use for free.Conveniently located to laundromats, grocery stores - Tesco, Sainsbury  a convenient store, pubs, restaurants. Bus 24 right at the front and less than 5 minutes walk to Pimlico train station or about 10 to Victoria Station. We had lovely breakfast down in the breakfast room.Friendly staff. Will stay here again.

<Content>Nice staff, great location I was going to London with a friend to visit the British Museum and I wanted a cheap hotel that was close to the museum and shops. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was clean, there was a good choice for breakfast. The room was small but it was reasonable for London prices. There is internet facilities in the hotel (which I never used). Bathroom steamed up a fair bit though.

<Content>Great hotel in great location Stayed at the Luna Simone Hotel for two nights recently. This hotel is one of the cleanest hotels I have stayed in. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was excellent. The breakfast room was spotlessly clean. Rooms were of a decent size. Hotel is situated close to Victoria and Pimlico tube stations. Can't find any fault whatsoever with the hotel. Excellent for anybody taking a city break in London. Sinead, Cork.

<Content>Good Location Just back from a weekend in London where we stayed in the Luna and Simone Hotel. This is a lovely family run hotel just a few minutes walk from Victoria Station. The staff were extremely friendly and offered loads of helpfull advice on various tours etc. The hotel was spotlessly clean and we couldn't have looked for nicer accomadation in an area that we felt safe walking in both day and night there are some lovely pubs and restaurants within walking distance. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to London.

<Content>An UNBELIEVABLE value for London! The raves from other travelers are completely warranted. The rooms are small but the fittings are modern and the bed was excellent. The twin brothers who own/run the hotel -- who have been in the hotel business for 37 years -- are considerate, professional and fun.The location is good (Pimlico and Victoria tube stations are no more than a ten-minute walk), and there are excellent restaurants nearby. I especially recommend Solo Mio, the Italian trattoria a half-block away and Seafresh, a fish restaurant about two blocks away. I paid 90 pounds a night, full price, including English breakfast and wi-fi (which drifted in and out). In London these days, that's a STEAL!The only (minor) criticism I have is that breakfast is served only from 7-8:30am.

<Content>A Wonderful Place to Stay in the Heart of London I can only add to all the positive reviews of Luna  Simone. We stayed for five days from August 28th 2008. The hotel is in a great location - walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Parliament/Big Ben etc or for those less used to walking catch bus 24. Walking distance from Victoria Station (we paid 拢3.40 for a taxi when we arrived with suitcases), nearby is a great Sainsburys, Boots (chemist) etc. We had a twin room on the ground floor and it was impeccable. It was simple, clean, comfortable and had a tv (5 channels - inc BBC1, ITV, Five, Dave), kettle for making tea or coffee, a safe. The bathroom was small but really clean and nice.We were able to access free wireless internet through the hotel (ask at reception for the password). I know some people have reported not being able to get wireless in all parts of the hotel but we had no trouble at all.Breakfast was fab! There are three choices - bacon, eggs and baked beans or boiled eggs or ham and tomato. You can also have cornflakes or OJ and all breakfasts come with toast and tea or coffee. The dining area was incredibly clean.Our hosts were friendly and helpful - as so many others have reported.All in all I give our stay 10/10. For the price I dont think you can do any better in London.

<Content>Fantastic stay, great people. We staid here for 6 days and it was fantastic. The rooms were super-clean, the shower was great, the beds really comfy and the location perfect. Surrounded by a huge variety of nice restaurants and only about 5 minutes walk from Victoria Coach station where you can get a bus, coach, underground or taxi.

<Content>I Love this Hotel, but just a couple of catches It's great value for money: cleanliness, warm and friendly hospitality, nice service; proximity to the Victoria Station; bus at door. It fully met my expectations.Area for improvement: mattress a bit worn out, particular on the sides; need to be replaced. Rooms a bit too small for 2 adults.Travelers should be aware that there is no elevator in the hotel. Carrying heavy luggages to 2nd or 3rd floor could be a challenge. Hotel staff was kind enough to help out with a couple of pieces of luggage out of the 4 that we brought for the family.

<Content>Great hotel with lovely restaurant nearby My husband and I stayed here with friends on August Bank Holiday. We were all delighted with the standard of cleanliness and the great showers at the hotel. Admittedly the rooms are not huge but they are big enough. Breakfast choice is limited but what you get is sufficient and nicely cooked. All in all this hotel is really good vale for money and the reception staff are friendly too! There is only one draw back and that is the lack of a lift so if you think climbing up to the third floor will be too much for you make sure you get a room on one of the lower floors. The location is great, with a stop for the bus which goes directly to Trafalgar Square etc right outside the door and it is within a few minutes walk of Victoria Station. There is also a very nice restaurant in Churton Street, which is just a few metres away. It's called 'Grumbles' but we certainly didn't have any grumbles about our meal there, it was delicious. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the restarant diagonally opposite called 'Chimes'. They claim to serve traditional English food but if the beer battered cod and frozen chips is an example of what they consider traditional English cooking it's easy to see why it's got such a bad reputation. At 拢9.50 per person this dish was hardly cheap and the fish was disgusting. Give this one a miss.

<Content>lovely, lovely luna We had a fantastic 10-day stay at the Luna. From the moment we arrived, we were impressed with the friendliness of the staff and the immaculate condition of the hotel. The twins are a real hoot, especially at breakfast, which was more than enough to keep us going for several hours.The location was perfect...two underground stops near by, and a bus stop right outside the door. What more could tourists ask for?Our room had twin beds, which we pushed together at night to create a king. The bathroom had one of the best showers we've ever used while traveling. Had it been around several hundred years ago, the water pressure probably could have put out the great fire!The only down side of our trip--we had to return home after our ten days in London. We hope to be back in 2009.

<Content>This hotel should be #1 Fabulous! We stayed here 3 nights and returned for 1 more.Every morning I'd come down to breakfast and kid the twins, wives, kids...family all over the place! I'm not a fan of London, but I'm a BIG fan of this hotel and everything around it. (And the young man on the front desk, if you're reading this, you are a 10! You are SO personable and kind. Are you smiling? You are always smiling.) Lots, and lots of small restaurants a few steps away, (ate at Solo Mio - twice), plus laundry, super-stores, nails and hair; everything within reach. Go to Luna and Simone. You'll love the place (small, but very, very clean) and tease the twins...they love it. Such fun we had in July! Mary-Margaret and Douglas Porrey

<Content>nice place and good value for money My wife and I recently stayed at the Luna  Simone Hotel as part of a two day visit to London. We found the hotel to be very clean and friendly, and was perfect for our needs. The location is excellent, and we were very happy with our stay. This is a family run hotel and it shows as all the staff are very helpful. Would recommend this hotel to all my family and friends.

<Content>Decent but not fantastic I booked this Guesthouse (that would be a more accurate description than calling it a hotel) due to it at the time being ranked 10th most popular in London on Tripadvisor.It is ok and decent value I suppose but I chose this over what was described as a luxurious 4star because the 4star was ranked just over 300th most popular. I feel I may have made the wrong decision as the price difference was only about 鈧?0 per night.It's in a good location approx 10 minutes walk from Victoria station. The rooms were cleaned everyday and the two men that run the place were very helpful and pleasant.The rooms are very very basic and the breakfast is also very basic. The satellite TV is 7 maybe 8 channels and if you have trouble getting up stairs this place is most definitely not for you.I wouldnt warn people to steer clear of the place but for a small amount of extra money you would probably get something much nicer.

<Content>good value for money in London and a note for 1st time travelers to the UK My husband and I stayed for 3 days at the Luna  Simone and thought it was quite good value for money in London; a good breakfast, very good and quiet location easily accessible by tube or bus. First time travelers to the UK (or Europe for that matter); please bear in mind that room sizes and usual amenities (air conditioning for example) North Americans are used to are usually not found here. This will go a long way in ensuring satisfaction from your stay. I would ask for a room giving onto the backyard and not on the main floor for more peace. All in all, quite enjoyable.

<Content>Great Location We had a fine stay at the Luna and Simone. The staff was always available and very friendly.A couple of caveats, the rooms are small but quite adequate. The beds are on the hard side. While the staff is friendly and available, most rooms are upstairs and you'll need to carry your own, so pack light!Now, I thought the rates were great for such a clean nice propety in London. There is coffee and tea in the room. Also, we were able to hook up to free wireless. It was ad supported, and you had to relink every hour.....but did I mention it was FREE!The location is outstanding. Just around the corner are lots of great restaurants. Our first night there, we were walking along reading menus and a gentleman crossed the street and advised us on every restaurant in the area. Two of his area recommendations, Chimes (for English fare) and Cyprus Mangal(we like Greek food too) were absolutely excellent.Just up the street a bit, you will find Victoria Station, from which you can take the tube to pretty much any place in London. Several times, we just walked over to Westminster, the London Eye, Buckingham Palace, and Trafalgar Square. It was a bit of a walk, but quite doable.Also, just across from Victoria Station, on the same street as the hotel, is St George's Tavern, an outstanding example of an english pub which specializes in a vast array of sausages, but the fish and chips was the best we found. Their french fries should get an award. That said, stay away from their hamburgers!One last thing, if you've ever had any interest in Shakespeare, get tickets to the Globe Theatre. We saw 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' and it was one of those experiences of a lifetime. If interested, get your tickets early as they sell out. I ended up getting our tickets thru a broker, Albemarle.

<Content>Safe and Friendly Stayed here in July with my family. It is in an excellent location for sight seeing . The rooms were safe, clean and comfy and the English breakfast provided was terrific. We found Peter, Rita and Mark to be very friendly and helpful and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Great, friendly hotel in convenient location This is a lovely, family run hotel in a very convenient location near Victoria Station in London. The people that run this hotel are friendly and very helpful and welcoming and it reasonably priced accommodation. We spent 5 nights there and the hotel was full the whole time and we had to book 6 months ahead. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.

<Content>Little gem right in the heart of London This little gem right in the heart of London was a great find. The ultra friendly staff, clean, tidy, spacious rooms, wonderful breakfast and excellent service were all included in the very reasonable price. I was travelling with 2 other friends and we all enjoyed our experiance here at Luna  Simone. We would all stay here again should we return to London and have no reservations in recommending it to everyone else. Thank you for such a wonderful stay in the UK.

<Content>Friendly, Clean  Great location in Victoria with a #24 bus stop directly in front of the doors. Quick walk to the station to catch a tube or a tour with it's central location. Excellent food and service, breakfast was cooked for us individually every morning. The owners take pride in serving their customers. Our room was clean and had a private bathroom and it was quiet at night. Great place to stay for business or pleasure. The free internet kiosk was a nice priviledge.

<Content>Wonderful and clean hotel with great staff! An absolutely wonderful little hotel. I've been to London four times before this visit and I've always stayed in the Bayswater area. Read about Luna and Simone on tripadvisor and gave it a try. I can just say no regrets to that decision. Can only give high recommendations to this little establishment. The staff are friendly, everything is clean and a surprisingly nice breakfast. Don't miss out!

<Content>Charming, family-run hotel We stayed at the Luna-Simone for 2 nights. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Victoria Station and is family-run. The price was 95 GBP/night and breakfast was included. Now, for the specifics. The family that runs the hotel is very nice and really keep the property up. Various members of the family gave us helpful advice on several occasions and they really made our stay pleasant. We stayed in a room with a double bed, two night stands, a decent-sized wardrobe, small TV and dresser. The bathroom had a shower. Both the room and the bathroom were very clean (the bathroom nearly sparkling). Our room faced the street, but we were not disturbed by noise at all. The hallways, dining area and reception area of the hotel were also well-kept. There is a small room with a computer terminal for internet access available from 7:00AM-11:00 PM. However, as a courtesy, you should only expect to use it for 5-10 minutes at a time, since other guests were usually milling about or checking in to take a quick surf, too. One of the best touches of our stay was the complimentary breakfast. With the dollar continuing to struggle against the pound, the free breakfast was much welcomed by our family of four. It was quite filling (we left food on the table both times) and good. Overall, we had a really nice stay here and would return.

<Content>You Will Not Do Better in London Late with my report but here goes. As the title suggests, for the price/location/friendliness you won't do better. I've stayed at the fancy ones while in London on business over the years and, had I known, would have picked the LS over many of them even though the company was paying. Wonderful, welcoming, helpful owners (the twins et al) and while the rooms are small, everything works, they're spotless and you get what's on the label. Easy to get to (#24 bus), your own keys, so no turning in at the desk each time in/out (we're smokers so important-never/never in the room though), hearty breakfast (not fancy but well done), and lots of eating choices within easy walking distance in a very safe (IMO) neighbourhood. These folks cannot do enough for you and if you have a problem (we didn't) I have no doubt they'll go the extra mile to resolve any issue within their control. We're heading back next year but have decided to do an apartment rather than hotel for the advantages contained therein; that said, if the LS had a flat to rent they'd be my first choice based on the professional approach these folks take towards their guests. Kudos to the LS; the competition should check in for a night or two, take notes, and follow the LS 'game plan'.

<Content>What a BRILLIANT hotel!! For our four days/three nights (1st July-4th July 2008) in London we were looking for somewhere reasonably priced; fairly central and clean and comfortable. As the Luna-Simone hotel came highly rated on Tripadvisor we took the plunge and booked via the hotel website. The hotel was easy to find being only a short 5 minute stroll from Pimlico Tube Station. Pimlico, on the Victoria tube line is a bit closer to the hotel than Victoria Tube Station and has the welcome advantage of being a whole lot less frantic. Tip:- From Liverpool Street take the Central line (West Bound) to Oxford Circus then change to the Victoria line (South Bound) to Pimlico exiting Pimlico station via the Rampayne St exit. Hotel is about five minute walk from here. NB Due to engineering work until End Nov 2008 no service on Victoria line after 2200h - but you can use alternative lines (Circle or District) to get you to Victoria tube station and then walk to the hotel in 10 mins or so from there.We arrived at the Hotel at 10.30 am and the friendly receptionist checked us in speedily and with no fuss. She made a short internal phone call and then gave us the good news that our room had just been freshly cleaned and was ready for us. Handing us our keys (one for the room door and one for the Hotel entrance door) she gave us clear directions as to where our room was. We occupied room number nine at the rear of the building on the 'Luna' side. We liked this as it was quiet - well away from any possibility of road noise. We were impressed with the general level of cleanliness throughout the Hotel - especially the room. I am a bit picky when it comes to hygiene and I can honestly say i found nothing to cause me any concern. No matter where I looked everything was gleaming - all credit to the cleaner; they do a great job. The maid came in each morning and made our bed; tidied up and left us fresh towels for our return. The shower was very good - we thought it was like a power shower - this was welcome after a sticky day spent amongst the throngs of fellow sightseers in London at the height of the summer heat. The shower cubicle was gleamingly clean with no mould or soap scum. Although the room overall was on the small side it was adequate for us and lets face it - how long do you spend in the room anyway?Breakfast, which is included in the price, is served form 7.00 am to 8.30 am. To be honest, this suited us as we like to get up early and make the most of our days and try to fit in as many sightseeing activities as we can. Breakfast is served in the sparkling clean basement 'breakfast room.' Service is quick and the food is fresh. Nothing was too much trouble. For instance, I asked for scrambled eggs in place of the fried eggs and it wasn't a problem. You have a choice of cereal or juice to start with. After that you have a choice of boiled eggs or bacon-egg-beans complete with toast and tea or coffee. We found this to be ample and kept us going until lunch time no problem.I needed to iron a pair of trousers - reception lent me an iron and board free of charge. We found the staff - who were mostly family members (the hotel is family run) to be very helpful. We were glad of the free internet access to check emails etc. There is a desktop computer available for use free of charge - we thought this was a nice touch. There is a wireless network but i am unsure if there is a charge for this.Our stay at the Luna-Simone hotel was enjoyable and we will be returning there the next time we are in London.Steven Milloy and Sandra McSkimming

<Content>We loved LS! We stayed at LS for 4 nights, 10-14 June. We love this hotel and would stay here again. The staff were very friendly and helpful and accommodating. The room was small, but great shower. And we loved having the #24 bus right outside the door. We got the Oyster Card and got our money's worth, taking the bus and tube everywhere. I love this neighborhood, it's a little off the tourist track, but everything you need is nearby -- including a nice Italian restaurant, O Sole Mio, down the street. Highly recommended.

<Content>Great for central London Enjoyed our stay here immensely, especially compared to other experiences in London. Good clean room with decent space for London. The hosts were helpful and friendly, and we were able to have en suite bathroom access for less than a lot of other places. Great value, given London prices!

<Content>Good value The hotel was exactly what I expected. The rooms were clean, showers were hot, and breakfast was decent. The location is great; within walking distance to Buckingham Palace. Overall, this hotel was a great value.

<Content>Stop searching...this is the place! I am picky, and L  S satisfied. I spent hours and hours researching every place in London and finally decided to stay here. We're so glad we did. It is a nice family owned and operated hotel. They are very kind and helpful. Peter and his twin brother will serve you breakfast and his son, Mark, works the front desk. We stayed in room #2 on the first floor. There are double doors to give more privacy and as a sound barrier. I recommend this non smoking room.

<Content>Nice, cosy hotel Luna  Simone Hotel is a little, nice, clean, cosy hotel in an elegant quiet street of Belgravia; Victoria Station and Pimlico tube station are at 10 minutes walking distance. More, just in front of the hotel there's a bus stop: bus 24 goes 24h/24 to Victoria, Westminster, Trafalgar, Piccadilly.The English breakfast is maybe not hudge but completely satisfiyng; there's an internet point.According to me and to my wife, the quality/price ratio of this hotel is very very good. Next time we'll go to London we'll choose Luna  Simone again.

<Content>excellent value in London This hotel is certainly the best valued accommodation in London. WE had a change of plans when we arrived and required 4 more nights which they were very willing to provide us even though it meant switching around other reservations. Our stay was terrific , Our room was quite spacious for London, the bathroom was small but entirely adequate for our needs. The cleanliness of this hotel is superior and the staff is the best I have encountered. The breakfasts were everything you could ask for and if you wanted something different the staff were only too pleased tp offer. This was our first time to London and the Luna  Simone hotel made it much more special. It is convenient to all bus lines, the train station and subway.There are also several excellent restaurants nearby and the St George Pub is only 5 min away and is super for meals and winding down after a long day of sightseeing. The brothers are only too willing to make your stay as comfortable as possible and we loved every single day and were very sad to leave. The computer access proved invaluable to us. We would certainly return and would also not hesitate to recommend it to friends.LorraineVancouver, Canada

<Content>Decent hotel, nice stay I was in London for a 4 days trip, just to see a few of the city attractions. I read a few review of the hotel and I decided that is a good choice for my trip. The location is OK, 10 minutes walking to Victoria station from where you can go everywhere. Also, 10 minutes from the nearest subway. Neighborhood was OK, not very noisy and quiet in the evening. We came back later at night and had no problem. A few shops closer to the hotel and even some nice restaurants. The room was little but clean, with TV. Bathroom with shower OK, also clean. We did not have any complains about it. The breakfast was enough, just a few choices but tasty. The staff was helpfull and the owners very nice people. I would stay here for my next trip especially if I will go as a tourist and not spent more than the nights in the hotel room.

<Content>terrific place I stayed in this hotel in April for 5 nights. I thought about writting a review here, although did not want to repeat what the other people already said, e. clean, excellent location, friendly staff, etc.After reading some of the negative reviews, I could not keep it to myself. This hotel is of a great quality for the type of place. If you expect 5 star quality , then go to a 5 star hotel, and pay the 5 star price. This hotel is considered a Bed and Breakfast with a 5 star guest's service. I know the rooms are not big, but you are not paying 拢300 - 500 per night, as you would pay for a large room in a larger hotel. If you are looking for luxury, look or somewhere else, but if you are looking for a home away from home, then Luna Simone is the place to stay.

<Content>American dollar stretcher clean and convenient! We agonized over picking a place to stay in London because like every big city, London is expensive! Then add in a bad time to be using American dollars and it gets downright depressing. This place is clean, nice and a perfect operating base. We spent about $250 dollars for a room with 4 beds. We brought our 20 yr old daughter along.This hotel should be an insider's secret: it is on the 24 bus line which we used every day. Pick up and drop off in front of the hotel! Add in a very accomodating dual hosts at breakfast - you don't drink coffee or tea - have some hot chocolate, you don't eat sunnyside up eggs - how about scrambled eggs. The breakfast was a good way to start our day and it was included! The security was very good and they have an internet nook to use for free! Nice soaps and shampoo and above all clean,beautiful bathroom and comfortable beds. There are grocery stores close by and even some restaurants. We had our requirements met to have a nice place to sleep and start the day because we were out all day and caught some shows at night. We will be going back and reccommending this to our friends - just don't tell everybody!

<Content>Good budget hotel We recently stayed at the Luna and Simone for 4 nights. The property is pretty much as advertised. It is a small, basic hotel. The rooms are clean, although showing a little wear. Scuffs on the wall, stain on the desk chair. The bathroom was a comfortable size and very clean. Linens are spotless, but of a very basic quality. The breakfast was basic, as well. A fried egg, toast and tea does become a little boring after a few days. There are high spots to the Luna and Simone. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The price is definitely bargain rate for London. It was in a nice neighborhood. Access to transportation was fantastic. If you are looking for any type of luxury, you will be disappointed. If, however, you are looking for a great price and do not mind basic but clean accommodations, then the Luna and Simone is for you.

<Content>Great little hotel We really enjoyed our stay at the Luna and Simone! The staff was friendly, the room was small but cute, cozy and clean and the perfect amount of space for the two of us, the breakfast was delicious and an awesome start to the day:) The hotel is within walking distance to everything and if you don't want to walk the bus stops right outside the door or Victoria tube station is just a bit of a walk up the road! We would definitely go back and highly recommend for anyone travelling to London!

<Content>Excellent Value and Very Welcoming Brilliant stay at this hotel. We booked last minute direct with the hotel. Me, my sister and my mum went stayed for one night in London for a girly get away.At 拢110 for a triple room including a full english breakfast, it was excellent value. Is located near to Victoria Station. Good for bus travel but a bit of a trek to the Station and back. Room big with french doors to a patio area which was really nice. Shampoo etc a nice touch for shower room. Everything very clean and fresh.Breakfast lovely although started as early as 7am I think (and our room was right next to dining room) and as it was full, it was a bit noisy. But then you don't really go to London for a lie in!Owners and staff all very helpful and so friendly. Would definitely stay again.

<Content>Perfect little place We stayed in this nice little hotel for four nights in early May. The room was very clean and nice. Nothing fancy, but it was perfect for what we needed. Our room (#9) had one of the smallest bathrooms (the owner said they were hoping to make it bigger soon). There was an in-room tea kettle which was a nice touch. The breakfast was also delicious and the perfect way to start the day. We booked directly through their website, which worked out quite nicely. There were lots of restaurants close by and the street was nice and quiet. We felt very safe there. And it really was just a short walk from both Pimlico and Victoria Stations. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay and I would recommend if you are looking for a small, quiet. lovely little hotel!

<Content>Second time round, just as good as the first! This was my second stay at this wonderful hotel and it didn't disappoint. Lovely and clean with excellent service.We were able to check in as soon as we arrived (1:00pm). We were in room 9 in the Simone side of the hotel. Last time I stayed in room 17 on the Luna side and I found both rooms to be of consistent quality.The room had the usual facilities; a small desk  chair, wardrobe with a free easy to use safe, a lovely clean bathroom with shower, toilet , handbasin and plenty of lovely HOT water!One change from the last time I stayed is that combined shower gel and shampoo is provided along with soap so no need to provide your own toiletries.My wife, who has mobility difficulties due to arthritis, found that walking up four flights of stairs, to reach our second floor room, a strain on her even though several stops were included each time! She also found that although the shower was large, the bathroom itself was quite small, which caused a bit of discomfort. She loved the ample hot water and found the bed to be extremely comfortable though, which did make up for the lack of room.Last time I came here I used the tube train to get around. It's best to get on and off at Pimlico station since this is nearer and also smaller so doesn't have the rush and confusion of Victoria.This time I came with my wife and we used taxis to get around. an indication of costs for May 2008 is that it cost us approx 拢22 to get to the hotel from Euston Station. We also caught the number 24 bus to and from Trafalgar square. It cost 拢2 each for a single trip on the bus. It would have made more sense to have bought a one day ticket each for 拢3.50 each. We paid the bus driver direct, but I was told the second time that I should have bought tickets from the machine at the bus stop.Either before or after check in the hotel reception will look after your cases while you go around London.There are lots of restaurants and pubs nearby and also a small shop just one minute away to buy newspapers, sweets and milk, especially if you don't like the powdered milk in the rooms.All in all this is a lovely hotel in a good location.

<Content>Great Value!Great Location! This was my first experience using a budget hotel in London and I was pleasantly surprised. With the exchange rate as it is with the US dollar, I could not afford to stay in the 4 star hotels I have stayed in before. Compared to the high-priced hotels this hotel was a great bargain! The Luna and Simone is in a great semi-residential area with great shops and restaurants close by. I highly recommend Mekong, a Vietnamese/Thai restaurant around the corner on Denbigh St. The Pimlico tube is a 5-minute walk away and the #24 bus stops right across the street. We stayed in room #1 on the basement level (where the breakfast room is) and it was very quiet and clean. There was plenty of room for 3 people and the bathroom was a good size. It was kept very clean. The free breakfast is a great perk given the high cost of dining in London! All in all, I would definitely stay here again. It is not a luxury hotel so if that is what you are looking for you will be disappointed but at $210 a night for 3 people this was a GREAT bargain!

<Content>Over-rated My husband and I just returned from a 2 week vacation in Europe, the last two nights in London at the Luna  Simone.We travel extensively and while I don't think this hotel is horrible, I can't believe it's in the top 10 of all the hotels in London.Yes, hotels in Europe are small. The bathroom was fine and almost as big as the double room. The room was tiny with very old furniture. While it appeared clean, my husband and I were covered with bites that we noticed on the flight home. Bed bugs?There's also no lift so you should be prepared for that.The owners and staff were friendly and the location very convenient. After 2 weeks in Europe with a weak dollar, we were trying to save some money. You get what you pay for. I wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Deserving of its high rating The breakfast dining room is located at the lowest level of the terrace building.The styling is contemporary minimalist, with everything clean, neat and in place. Fellow travellers are enjoying their bacon and eggs and planning their day's adventures.The friendly owner takes your breakfast order and walks back into one of the two entrances to the kitchen. Before you have a chance to blink he comes out of the other entrance with the breakfast order for the table behind you. This is quick service. Where does he get the energy ? No sooner have you asked the question of yourself, then he returns to go back in the ktichen and is out again serving another meal. This is extraordinary.Suddenly he is at your side with your order and as you look up and thank him, you notice out of the corner of your eye that he is also walking up the stairs on your right. How many ales did I really have the night before?Yes there are two of them - twins - although one is ten minutes older than the other so they insist they weren't born at the same time. It makes for some interesting times at breakfast, trying to tell them apart.We enjoyed three mornings here, and each time the breakfasts were consistently good ( although the same each day - but that is not a criticism).The hotel itself is well maintained and although the rooms are small, they and the bathrooms are kept clean and refreshed each day. Let's face it - when you are in London you should be out sightseeing or taking in shows etc rather than being in your room for any longer than you need to sleep and to get ready.The hotel has a bus stop directly outside the front door and another directly across the road for heading in the opposite direction. Victoria Station is a 10 to 15 minute walk away. We found it an ideal base from which to see the sights of London, on this our 5th trip to the capital.One block around the corner is a cluster of various small shops where you can get food and basics as well as a laundromat if needed.Luna and Simone is not a luxury hotel, but what it offers is excellent value - clean, equipped with essentials, friendly and efficient staff, good location, and based on our experience and what we have read a wonderful consistency in what it provides. On our next trip to London, we would automatically make this our choice for accommodation.Plus, where else can you play the Which Twin is Which Guessing Game?

<Content>A great place to stay in London I am a budget traveler and stayed at Luna  Simone Hotel during my 7-days in London. I picked this hotel because of its high ranking and relatively low price. I stayed in a single-room with shared bathroom on the first floor. The room is small but comfy (with tv, safe, kettle, tea, and a light switch right beside the bed). Bathroom is very cleaned and which is even better is I am only sharing that with another person. Breakfast is good and keep me energized for the rest of the days. Since this hotel is very close to the Victoria station and have a bus stop right in front of the entrance, it is very handy to get to any attraction sites or areas in London. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends.

<Content>Great choice, central, safe, clean and friendly Great little hotel. A double and twin with a balcony and bathroom which I have stayed in are great value for the location at anything under 拢80. Also stayed in a small single with shared bathroom for 拢50. It was actually fine also, with a bathroom right outside the door only shared with one other single room. It's a basic little hotel but you can't beat it for cleanliness and friendliness. It's clearly a family business which explains why they take care in cleaning the hotel and dealing with customers. Excellent safe central area to stay in within easy reach of all London sites and nice breakfast. Having stayed in other similarly priced hotels in London I think this one deservese 5* in comparison.

<Content>`Will definitely be back!!!! Having spent weeks searching the internet for a hotel in London, we settled on the Luna Simone on the Belgrave Road. We were looking for a place with good links to the city centre, with breakfast included and value for money (in a city where hotels are way over priced!). I found the Luna Simone thanks to the Tripadvisor website and was very happy with my choice.We travelled from Stansted airport with the Terravision bus to Victoria station and from there the hotel was a short walk over Eccleston Bridge and down Belgrave Road.Our room was on the ground floor nearest tot he reception desk so thankfully we didn't have to haul our bags up the stairs! We never heard any noise form the street in front either. The room was on the small side but immaculately clean with the most comfortable bed I've slept in while on holidays. There was a much needed fan over the bed (weather was roasting!) and a good sized safe in the wardrobe. Breakfast was great and filled us up for the day.Free internet access was a bonus too.Number 24 bus stops outside the hotel and goes in the direction of Westminister, Trafalgar Square and beyond so that was handy but we mainly used the Tube from Pimlico station and got a day ticket each day.Belgrave seemed to be a very quiet area, lots of lovely local bars and restaurants and plenty of nearby shops for bottled water etc.Overall we had a very pleasant experience at the Luna Simone. For location and value it is top notch. I like to travel and have been abroad 5 times in the past 11 months and so I feel that I have alot to compare this hotel to.I would definitely recommend it and will be back again before the end of the year.

<Content>Always a good stay at Luna  This was our second stay at the Luna  Simone and we were not disappointed.The bedrooms and bathrooms are always spotless. Crisp, clean linen on the beds, fresh towels everyday and a sparkling shower (with water pressure!! Not found everywhere in the UK)We were on the top floor which gave us lots of exercise, but we didn't mind. It was quiet and the bed, comfortably firm.Breakfasts are always good at Luna  Simone, with the staff/owners friendly and always have time for their customers.The location is perfect for walking, busing and tubing around London.This is my choice in London!

<Content>Like our friends home I stayed at Luna  Simone for 3 nights and I subscribe everything that was said on the other reviews.It's true rooms are small, but enough for what you need (You don't go to London to stay in the hotel room, so...), but everything was clean, what's for me the most important thing.Rooms are warm, have TV, tea and coffee, hair dryer, free safe box and it's possible to borough an adaptor plug for electricity.English Breakfast was wonderful, tasty and served with sympathy between 7:00h and 8:30h, which is good to wake you up to London activity.The neighbourhood seemed to me very peaceful and easy to reach from Pimlico tube station, even at night.I recommend

<Content>Nice but in the top 10 hotels in London???! We stayed at this hotel while stopping through London. I have had experience with various hotels in London and lived there for a brief time so I know what to expect when it comes to room size, etc. Maybe my hopes were too high from these reviews. For 90 pounds a night, we got a clean tiny room with a clean tiny bathroom. I asked for a quiet room and we were put under the stairs for the 1st night. It sounded like a herd of elephants were stomping constantly until midnight and then started up at 6 am. Nevertheless, I slept very little. I complained and was nicely put on the top floor. After moving, the experience was much better. This room was even smaller, but at least quiet. On the pro side, the breakfast was excellent and very fast. The location was also great off of Pimlico tube stop. The hotel also offers free internet. Overall, good experience but this hotel definitely doesnt need to be in the top ten. I dont know if I stay there again.

<Content>The cleanest hotel anywhere! This was a first for us - not booking into a large chain or recognisable name. However, we were far from disappointed.Ok the room wasn't the largest and the breakfast wasn't a plush buffet but for the price it was all excellent. The owners were friendly and very helpful. Good central location cut the cost of travel whilst in London. We would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Had a great stay! After 1 night at a terrible, non service minded place, we checked out and moved to LunaSimone Hotel. Coming here was a haven. A bit small(but, hey it's London) but very clean room with a great bathroom(tiled). The staff is super friendly and even stored some kimchi for us in their fridge, even though they knew it's really smelly (I'm sure they put it in some air tight container). People at the reception were always smiling and helpful. Breakfast was great and it was possible tho choose full english breakfast or continental. The place is centrally located....close to Victoria station.

<Content>A gem of a hotel This is an excellent value for a pleasure or business stay in London. I had already stayed in London in an equally priced hotel in Notting Hill--filthy and delapidated--and was prepared for the worst. Much to my surprise, the HLS is a spotless and charming property in a convenient area, well served by taxis and buses.My room (no. 8) was light and airy, with a large balcony. My business partner, an elderly man, stayed in no. 17, as we thought it would be nicer being on an upper floor. Though adequate and clean, it was, by comparison, less appealing.Great showers, excellent breakfast and a very helpful staff. In particular, Peter, one of the two owners (twin brothers, by the way), was always attentive and seemed interested in us as people, an unusual occurence. One small flaw: no elevator, so you must take your luggage upstairs on your own. All in all, a superb place to stay for the money and the service included.

<Content>Spotless and well maintained This was my first stay at the Luna Simone. I used the TripAdvisor reviews to select it, and later found out that a friend has been staying here for 30 years. The room was small, but well appointed. I shared a spotless bath, but what impressed me most was how well maintained everything was. It almost looked like new construction.The staff was friendly and helpful. Making a reservation was not stressful, and my request for a low floor room was honored. All in all, great value for the money.

<Content>Cute hotel The hotel was located about a 3 minute walk to the Pimlico Underground stop. We made the mistake of getting off the Victoria stop the first time and had to walk about 10 minutes in the rain to the hotel. The hotel is recently updated and charming. The room was clean, updated, and small. There are no elevators so we had to haul our luggage up 6 flights of stairs, but by that time we had been travelling for a day, were soaked and we started laughing at the situation.I guess the walls or floors are thin because my husband and I were awakened in the night by someone snoring.The breakfast was good and the staff friendly. There is a free computer with internet for guests.

<Content>A Haven This was my second stay at Luna  Simone and it is still the same peaceful, clean haven.Three tube stops from Oxford Circus and you can emerge into the relatively calm, village-like atmosphere of Pimlico with it's local restaurants and shops.On a cold, rainy evening, we went just around the corner to eat at Grumbles, a sixties throw-back with excellent food which we heartily recommend.I seriously doubt that, for the money, there is a better or friendlier hotel in central London. Ok, the rooms aren't enormous but they are clean and comfortable and have everything you need.My only complaint is the nasty powdered milk provided for tea/coffee

<Content>A Great Little Hotel My wife and I stayed in this Hotel after reding favourable reviews on TA. We were not disapointed. Our room was smallish but adequate for our needs. The whole Hotel is spotless and in a very good state of repair and decoration. The Staff are very friendly and the food was very good too even if the breakfast choice was a bit limited. The location of the Hotel is excellent and we ate one night at the Goya restaurant which was just a few hundred metres form the Hotel. My one negative comment is that there was no lift so if you have a problem with stairs, then make sure you book a ground floor room. Overall this place is a Gem that is very reasonably priced.

<Content>Handy and friendly We stayed here when visiting various exhibitions in London.We struggled to find somewhere convenient and at a reasonable price, and found this hotel on Tripadvisor. The reports are accurate. It is a clean and friendly hotel in Victoria. The room was a bit small but it was clean, and the breakfast was fine. The twins, owners of the hotel, chatted with us over breakfast and we saw the kids going off to school. Much nicer than a chain hotel.One tip: take the bus (24) to get here. It stops outside the hotel and passes many of London's top attractions en route.

<Content>Good choice We stayed for 3 nights during February half-term. This was our 2nd stay in this hotel and we were not disappointed. The family are friendly and helpful. Breakfast is good, though on our 3rd day I didn't want bacon, egg and beans again. I asked if I could have fruit juice, cornflakes and a yogurt, plus toast. They were more than happy to comply. (Yogurt is not listed on their menu, but you only have to ask).Our only (minor) gripe was that we were on the top floor (about 80 stairs) and there is no lift. Fortunately, we are two fit 60year olds and by the end of the stay we returned after heavy sightseeing on foot, laughing at the thought of having to go 'mountaineering' before we could have a rest. We were at the back of the hotel and found it very quiet. Our daughter has booked to stay there in May and is quite looking forward to it. It has an excellent reputation, in a lovely area of London, though I understand there are hotels in Belgrave Road that are not to be recommended! No such problem with Luna  Simone.

<Content>love it ! Did research on trip advisor prior to our trip to London and Paris. Booked through European Destinations and requested the Luna  Simone due to reviews. Just as posted was not dissapointed at all. Good location, nice pubs and restaurants , grocery store and shopping mall area near by and walked to Victoria Station where you can catch everything! Underground, Double Decker buses and trains. The rooms were very clean and plenty of room for 2 of us with twin beds. Breakfast every morning was perfect to get going and served in their very clean, clean dining room area. This family run, friendly, nice and clean hotel was great. Owned by brothers and all the family is involved with the establishment. When I return to London I won't bother looking elsewhere I will just call the Luna  Simone and book with them again.

<Content>Great value near Victoria Station Just returned from a trip to England where I spent one night at the Luna  Simone. I stayed in a double room with my husband on the second floor facing the front street. Reception was very kind and helpful getting us checked in. The room size was actually quite nice by European standards. We had a very clean room and bathroom with a comfortable double bed and a balcony overlooking Belgrave Road. We were not at all bothered by street noise. For 80 pounds a night this really was a great choice for us. Breakfast is included however we did not make it down for that due in part to some cider sampling at a great little restaurant/pub around the corner called Chimes. This place had a huge array of ciders, once you've worn yourself out on real ale. There is also a computer for public use which was helpful in some last minute planning. The hotel is situated between Victoria Station and Pimlico station, but I recommend getting around via the Pimlico tube since the Victoria is rather hectic and crowded. I sincerely hope to return to this wonderful little hotel.

<Content>Highly Recommended My husband and I stayed at the Luna and Simone for 7 nights last week. We can't say enough good things about this hotel. It is clean, bright and well-priced. It is owned and managed by two friendly brothers and their families. It's location is excellent. The Number 24 bus stops right outside the door. Victoria Station is a 10-15 minute walk. The Victoria Palace and the Apollo Victoria Theatres are close by. (We saw Wicked - great show!) Good restaurants and cafes are handy too. Enjoyed our breakfasts in the spotless and well-light breakfast room. The free internet access was a welcome bonus. We took a National Express bus non-stop to/from Heathrow to Victoria Coach Station. It was a 15 minute walk from the Coach Station. (A cab from the hotel to the Coach Station cost 4 pounds.) The coach fare to or from Heathrow is only 4 pounds per person - much cheaper than the Heathrow Express and it takes less than an hour - no Tubes to deal with our luggage. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Wish I Could Give More Than Five Stars We stayed at the Luna  Simone Hotel March 13-March 18, 2008! We found this lovely hotel by reading TripAdvisor reviews and I'm so glad we did. What a wonderful find! The family that owns this hotel bends over backwards to please. Pimlico station is close by and also the Young England Kindergarten at Saint Saviors Church where Princess Diana worked while she was dating Prince Charles...all within a short walk.; it is centrally located; has cafe's, pubs, restaurants...anything you need close by. The breakfast is very good...the toast was very hot and they had a great selection of jams/jellies/marmalades. The food is really good; loved their bean, bacon and egg breakfast. The rooms are small but it is London. The rooms are small but functional and extremely clean. The shower worked very well and there was plenty of hot water. There is a great oscillating fan anchored up over the beds which we liked. There is tea/coffee fixings in the room and the coffee is good! I can't say enough good things about this hotel. When we come to London later this year, we are booking our stay at the Luna-Simone. Thank goodness for TripAdvisor for letting us in on this wonderful and inexpensive hotel.

<Content>Lovely :) Great location, very friendly staff, clean and comfortable room. I booked based on the recommendations on here. I was staying on a business trip and requested a quiet room - surely enough, my room was at the back of the hotel and I couldn't hear a thing. Room was small if you're used to Travel Lodges etc but was a reasonable size if you travel on a budget usually. Breakfast was better than I expected and service was quick. A really lovely little hotel, for business or pleasure.

<Content>Outstanding Cleanliness, Value and Location We wanted to stay at a central location in London and the Luna  Simone was one of the hotels that fell within our search area. We then checked out the reviews on Trip Advisor and decided to book. We certainly were not dissapointed. The location is ideal. A short walk to transit and many important sight seeing locations. This is absolutely one of the cleanest hotels I've ever stayed in! The breakfast is very good and served by Management which gives you a chance to talk to the owners. The management and staff are outstanding and very friendly. They can assist you with your site seeing plans with no additional charge to you and in fact probably save you money. We got our London Bus Tour tickets through the hotel at less than Vendor rate. We are already thinking about our next trip to the Uk and Europe and the Luna  Simone is the London hotel we will be staying at!If you are going to London, we reccomend the luna  Simone.

<Content>Perfectly happy here A semi-budget facility, offering full service. The location is great with two Tube stations not more that 10 minutes away each, as well as the Thames ferry being about 12 minutes away.Even better, the 24 bus stopped right at the door. And you can see so much more of the city from the top of a bus. This one foes to Westminster, Trafalgar and out to the British Museum.Very clean, nicely appointed, great staff. The room was a bit small, but the bathroom was good sized ... which at our age is the more welcome.Limited television station availability. But, again, not what we come to London for.Breakfast was adequate, but it never varied : eggs, beans, bacon, toast and juice. Oh, you could have corn flakes instead of eggs and bacon, or you could have a slice of cold ham and one of cheese. We settled on boiled eggs, toast , bacon and juice...and made bacon and toast sandwiches for lunch.Given the prices of hotels in London, I would recommend this to everyone.Oh, and the Internet was free. (But I don't think they had wireless.)

<Content>Best Hot Chocolate in London! Our family of four was fortunate to stay at Luna Simone this past Fall. I can fully confirm all the wonderful reviews that have been posted to date. Can't imagine a better location - many good restaurants and shops nearby, easy access to public transport, and a safe clean neighborhood. The staff and owners are wonderful and went out of their way to make our stay the most enjoyable we've had in London. Our son Liam, who is a bit of a connoisseur, believes Peter makes the best hot chocolate on the planet.

<Content>In Top 10 For GOOD Reason! My teenage daughter and I just returned from a wonderful trip to London and Paris which involved a four night stay at this wonderful top 10 hotel in London. The reviews that follow this one are absolutely spot on. I selected this hotel from the Trip Advisor reviews and am very pleased with the results.The location of this hotel is perfect to accommodate any need from holiday to business. The accessibility to the Tube (Victoria is 5 minutes and Pimlico is 3 minutes) as well as the fact that the No. 24 bus line (24 hour service) is literally at the doorstep of the Luna  Simone and within 2 stops you are dropped at the entrance door to Victoria Rail Station. The ease of navigating one of the busiest and confusing cities on the planet was incredible from this hotel.The rooms, as stated in all of the other reviews, are clean, comfortable and welcoming. While we did not have the need for internet connectivity, I am certain with the helpfulness of the management at this hotel, I would have had no problem gaining access but being on holiday actually meant no laptop, for once, which was a treat. For the rate paid, we were very happy with the accommodations.Being in London during the half-term holiday break meant that there were few vacancies anywhere in London so we were happy to have this hotel available. We actually returned to London in transit from Paris back to the US and were not able to book this lovely jewel again which forced us to book at a neighboring hotel which was a major disappointment. Believe me when I say, I have a comparative study and Luna  Simone is superb.The Full English Breakfast that is offered is a delightful and perfect way to start each day. The management/ownership team that greeted us each morning made our stay all the more memorable. They always had a smile and kind comment as well as many recommondations for what to do and where to go. We were in need of a cell phone SIM chip and they were eager to assist with a recommondation to a wonderful little shop to buy what we needed, right around the corner from the hotel.Keep in mind that when you are traveling to London, you will spend most of your time out and about so having a safe, clean, friendly, warm and welcoming place to return to each night is a treat that even the largest, chain hotels could never achieve.The Luna  Simone is in the Top 10 London hotels for VERY good reason. The twin hotels are a perfect homebase for any London traveler and you will not be disappointed.Cheers!!!

<Content>Great Little Hotel My wife and I stayed at Luna  Simone for 3 nights in February 2008 and thought the value was excellent. The rooms are smallish but very clean and there's plenty of hot water. The included breakfast is superior to what we expected. If you have a lot of luggage please note there are no lifts. Execellent location in a relatively quiet area and close enought to walk to Victoria Station. Enjoy your stay. We can't wait to return!

<Content>Just as expected! After all of the rave reviews on Trip Advisor, my husband and I decided to try Luna  Simone for our trip to London. This truly is a GREAT value in London. (We previously stayed at the Darlington, but their prices have greatly increased.)Instead of paying a huge sum of $$ for the Heathrow Express, we took the National Express bus to Victoria Coach station for only 8 pounds per person (round trip). A 50 minute ride from Heathrow, without any traffic. Very comfortable bus with a bathroom as well. Then from Victoria Coach station, it is about a 10-15 minute walk to Luna  Simone. It's not the easiest hotel to find on a map, but we made it with no problems.The rooms are a sunny yellow, but definitely could have used a coat of paint (lots of black wall scratches from luggage being moved around). We stayed in Room 11 that faced the main road, Belgrave. The windows are not well insulated and the street noise is quite clear, as well as the wind whistling against the window panes. But it's not something a pair of earplugs can't fix. The radiator pumped out a lot of heat, that can be manually adjusted. The bed was quite hard, but after multiple days of sightseeing, a welcome place to relax.The bathroom was small, very clean with fantastic water pressure in the shower for a hotel - both my husband and I were impressed. As the previous reviewer suggested, bring your own toiletries. We were provided only with a couple small bars of soap and two plastic pouches of shampoo. (Don't forget your own washcloths!) Fresh towels provided daily.There are plenty of outlets in the room for plugging in your various electronics, bring your own adaptor. Ladies - the hairdryer is tough to maneuver as you have to hold the switch down the entire time you are drying. As well, if you have thick hair like me, the dryer overheats quite frequently. Bring your own if you can.Breakfast was served in the bright, cheery breakfast room and was quite good. Choice of OJ or corn flakes...English breakfast or 2 boiled eggs and toast, coffee or tea. The coffee was very tasty as well.For the money, this was a great bargain in London...I would definitely recommend to those folks who don't want to spend a lot of time in their hotel room, but want a comfortable, clean and affordable place to stay.

<Content>Great stay at Luna Simone My husband and I stayed at Luna Simone between 15th and 17th February. We were greeted with a warm welcome. Throughout our stay nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We arrived earlier than check in but were still able to drop off our case and get on with our sight seeing.The room was small, but perfect for what we needed (even extra pillows in the wardrobe). Everything was spotless and well maintained. The shower was superb! It was also nice to have clean towels every day. Overall it was great value for money, especially having a good breakfast in with the price. The location is great for two tube stations, Victoria station and some famous attractions. I would not hesiate to recommend this hotel for anybody staying in London. The area has some nice local places to eat and drink as well as being close to two theatres and of course the tube and train stations. Thank you Luna Simone, its nice to get good value for money in London!

<Content>Great value for money I have just returned from a 3 night stay in London and my friend from the USA and I stayed at the Luna and Simone hotel. For the money we paid I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Although the rooms are tiny they are spotlessly clean and comfortable. Our room had a hairdryer, tea  coffee making facilities and a safe, all of which were included in the cost of the room. The beds were really comfortable and the bedding was also spotless and new looking. The bathroom was fabulous.....it looked newly refurbished and was beautifully tiled. There was no mould or mildew anywhere and there was plenty of hot water and the water pressure was good. Breakfast here is included in the price of your room and whilst not having the most extensive menu ever it was very appetising, filling and tasty!The staff here are wonderful, very friendly and helpful. I had forgotten my phone charger and they managed to provide me with one so I didn't have to go out and buy one and they were also able to lend my friend an American adaptor and convertor. The location of the hotel was great, only a 5 minute walk from Victoria station and within walking distance of Westminster Abbey. If I had one moan it would be that the walls between the rooms are very thin and you can hear what is going on next door (we had the snorer from hell next to us!) but having said that everyone was considerate and kept the noise down.I would definitely stay here again and whilst it is not the Ritz it is excellent value for money.

<Content>SUPERB!!!!! My friends and I have just returned from a short London Trip, and this was our choice of hotel from reading reviews on 'Trip Advisor'. We were NOT disappointed. Our main priority was cleanliness and value for money - the hotel excelled in both areas. Between us we had three twin rooms; all 'spotless'! We had fresh towels each day, comfortable beds with nice clean linen and decent pillows. The staff were welcoming and friendly - special thanks to Tony for sorting our rooms and directions to a superb local Indian for an enjoyable meal ;-) Breakfast is hot, good honest food, and you pass the 'spotless' kitchen (with no doors - don't find that very often) so you can see where your food is cooked. All in all fantastic hotel, great location, and without doubt this would be my first choice of accommodation for any future visits.

<Content>Great value, great location, great everything After extensive research on affordable hotels in London, I came to the conclusion this is the best value in the city, and booked accordingly. Because we were staying for a full week, we received 6 nights for the price of 5, apparently a common practice in London if you know to ask for it.The hotel was definitely no frills, but it was affordable, clean, and convenient. The free breakfast was very good and filling, but it was served a little early in the morning for our schedule. The night bus stopped right in front of the property, which made it easy to get back even after a long night. It was within walking distance of two tube stops, including Victoria Station. Also a long but do-able walk away from Buckingham Palace.Anyone staying here should be aware that while towels are provided, guests must provide their own soaps and shampoos. Also, like many European hotels, there is no elevator.

<Content>Really nice, pleasantly surprised!!! I really liked this hotel. It's not too far away from Victoria mainline/tube station and very handy for getting in/out of London due to the Victoria Coach Station being so near. The hotel is really in the Pimlico end of Vicoria but that shouldn't pose a problem for anyone as everything really is that close. The rooms were really clean, the bathroom/shower was really clean and you can't really ask for more than that - even the windows were spotless!! I would definitely return there again, the staff were pleasant, friendly and helpful (however, I feel like I shouldn't say that, to keep this little gem hidden!)

<Content>Affordable, clean, friendly, central. My girlfriend and I spent 3 nights at Luna  Simone in early Feb '08 and the hotel was perfect for our needs.We were on a budget so to find a well-thought of hotel at this price (拢75 per night for double room) and in this location was a real bonus. The hotel itself was perfect. Situated halfway down Belgrave Road, in between Victoria and Pimlico underground stops, it is the perfect base from which to explore London.Our double room was of a decent size and included a tv with about a dozen channels. It also had tea-making facilities but no mini-bar. The bathroom was very clean and looked rather new, with the shower always hot. The room was cleaned every morning and fresh sheets and towels supplied.The very tasty and filling breakfast stops being served at 08:30, which was a tad early but at least it ensured we didn't sleep-in, and with so much to see in the City we couldnt afford to.The hotel is ten minutes walk from the Tate Britain, another 5 from Westminster, London Eye, Westminster Abbey, and only a short skip from there is Tate Modern, MOMI etc etc. And with the underground being so close, expansive and frequent Luna and Simone really is a great place from which to visit further afield attractions.I would definately recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a cheaper stay in London

<Content>We will return to this hotel We stayed here in June 2005. We plan to return this Spring. We loved this hotel. The rooms are very clean and the staff was very friendly. We had a double bed room with the glass walk in shower. I would stay here again for the shower alone. It's in a great neighborhood, close to all transportation and a great pub around the corner. Oh, and the breakfast is great too!

<Content>Not as good as the rating would suggest Despite the title of this review let me say one thing first, it is outstanding value. 10 minutes walk from Victoria station in one direction and 10 minutes walk to the Thames in the other direction. I paid just 拢65 ($130) for a stay on a Monday night after booking through a link from Tripadvisor.The hotel is located in the City of Westminster and as such there is nothing rough in the area. The front facade reminded me of a row of Embassies or Consulates.Now for the main problem I encountered. Both my partner and I are disabled although ambulant. This was indicated when we booked the room the previous week. On arrival we had been allocated a double room on the third floor (US 4th). With two flights of stairs between each floor. My partner asked if there was a lift available or a room on a lower floor - unfortunately there was neither. However, I think that the young gentleman on reception took pity on us both when he saw the difficulty we were having walking and swapped us to a triple room on the first floor (US 1st) and offered to carry our bags up the stairs. An outstanding bit of customer service on the one part but also it was nearly 10pm and probably unlikely that the larger room would be needed for the one night we were staying.The room itself can be best described as compact. A double bed and a single bed. It was clean and tidy but the walls were marked with what appeared to be plastic scuffs from shoes, bags and cases. The storage was sufficient and there was the usual hairdryer, kettle, television and telephone. Wireless internet is available at 拢5($10) for each 24 hour period.The bathroom was very compact. A WC, sink and shower - the only way to get into the shower is to enter the bathroom, turn around, shut the door and then walk into the shower. There were plenty of good quality towels. Two criticisms of the bathroom were that it probably needed a deep clean and there is nothing at all to aid disabled guests needing help with balance, just a couple of grab rails would have helped.Breakfast the next morning was fine - my partner just wanted a couple of well cooked eggs on toast instead of the bacon egg and beans and the two brothers that own the hotel were only too happy to oblige. Extra toast and tea/coffee were offered although not needed.On balance, if you're not disabled then it's a nice little place. However if you can't manage stairs or have particularly heavy bags then you may struggle with the stairs. Counter this with a maximum rate of 拢130 ($260) for a room that sleeps 4 and you get breakfast thrown in.

<Content>Nice quiet area, A very nice little hotel in a good, fairly quiet area. Close to the river, within walking distance of lots of places of interest, and handy for underground, buses and small shops/restaurants. Room cosy, extremely clean, light and well maintained throughout. Friendly, helpful management. Cooked breakfast and tea making facilities in the room is a bonus for a London hotel in this price bracket.

<Content>Loved the hotel I stayed at a small single room without bath/toilet. Even though I had to share a bathroom, it was very clean and always available because it was shared only between me and a person staying at the next single room. The hotel staff were very helpful and charming. Location was good too. It was close enough to walk from tube, bus stops and Victoria station. I do recommend this hotel to everyone.

<Content>We will defnitely return! We found this hotel on trip advisor, and booked straight away.We received a very warm and friendly welcome from the owners.Our room on the first floor was spotlessly clean and despite facing the main road, was extremely quiet at night.Room was of an adequate size for a short trip.Tea and coffee were provided, and the bathroom facilities were excellent, with a great power shower.Good breakfast with fresh bacon and eggs to start the day!All in all an excellent stay, and we would certainly return.

<Content>Excellent stay!! I stayed at the Luna and Simone hotel in December based on the reviews on this website and it was exactly as I expected. The rooms were small however all London hotel rooms are and they were exceptionally clean and comfortable. The bathroom was spotless as described by many on this site and after a long trip from Perth to London it was fantastic to be able to take a long hot shower! The staff could not have been more helpful and the location is excellent for a short stay as it is convenient to everything. I will definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends and family and will be staying there again next time I head to London!!

<Content>Great stay at Luna  Family of four-parents and two teenagers-booked with hotel after reading reviews here; we were very pleased with this hotel. We stayed here Dec 07/Jan 08 for four nights in a quad room which had three beds, with two singles for the kids and a large double for parents. Beds were comfortable, and room and bathroom were very clean. Bathroom had very good sized shower, and plenty of hot water.Breakfast was good-basic British egg/bacon/beans/toast and was served hot and fast. Area around the hotel is nice; found a great pub just down the street. Subway is very convenient, and Victoria station is about a 15 minute walk; if you're flying into Gatwick and are traveling light, take Gatwick Express to Victoria and the subway to Pimlico will get you within a five minute walk of hotel.Finally, the hotel is directly on the #24 bus route-and this is a fantastic bonus! This bus travels past Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Parliament, etc-while taking you directly to the West End theatre district. We rode the bus frequently; we enjoyed seeing the sights from the top level of the double-decker bus.We would recommend this hotel to everyone.

<Content>Great place for our group of 9 including kids We had 6 adults  3 children in our group  were given three rooms together downstairs. They were perfect! Very clean with fresh linen daily  shampoo etc readily available.We all used the biggest room as a base as it was quite a large room  we even had our own small outdoor area. Breakfast was great,cereal,juice,toast  choice of 2 or 3 cooked items. The VERY helpful staff even made the kids a hot chocolate which went down very well! Around the corner was a large supermarket which also sold ready cooked meals so those on a budget can take things back to their room, but there was also quite a few reasonably priced restaurants close by . We traveled by train around London  the station was an easy 10 - 15 min walk. We all loved this hotel  wonderful staff  will recommend it to anyone staying in London

<Content>The fantastic Luna  My wife and I are very satisfaied of this hotel. Located in a very queit area, remarkable for the cleaning of the room and the fantastic staff to whom we want to give many many thanks. It's also located near the underground station of Pimlico.We come from Italy and we'll be very lucky to find, at about ten meters far from the Hotel, an extraordinary italian restaurant: O Sole Mio. For the next holiday in London I'll come back! Certanly!Leonardo Battiato.P.S. Sorry if my English isn't perfecet.

<Content>A warm friendly and comfortable experience A great small hotel.Spotlessly clean, in a good position with very friendly staff who try to do everything to make your stay enjoyable and happy to help with advice about where to go and how to get there.The rooms are European size so they are small but adequate and with decent beds, linen and heating. The breakfast is generous and tasty and the hotel is situated near lots of small reasonably priced restaurants. This hotel is great value and I would highly recommend it. We stayed with our three teenage boys and were very happy.(There is also a laundromatte just round the corner).It was our first booking via a tripadvisor recommendation and we were very happy.

<Content>Reasonable but not exceptional. Nice reception, helpful staff. Very large room with little garden just out a door. All necessary facilities, bathroom very small though.However i wasnt over impressed because we were situated right beside the breakfast area and the stairwell so we got some disturbance from that.other than that not too bad, breakfast was good too.Little bit of a walk from the nearest tube station.

<Content>Good value, basic hotel We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Luna Simone hotel. It is excellently priced, and very well located just a few minutes walk from Victoria station. There are a myriad of restaurants/cafes/pubs within a couple of mins walk.The rooms are small, spotlessly clean, and the staff are pleasant. The breakfast is filling and adequate.I had read a few reviews about uncomfortable beds, but for a 2 star hotel I usually dont expect alot in terms of comfort. I do agree with other posters though, its hard to ignore them, they are probably the most uncomfortable beds I have ever slept in.That said. Its a great value, clean, budget hotel with no frills in a very central location

<Content>A wonderful weekend in London ... We just came back from our weekend trip to London last night. After booking the hotel online we were not sure if the hotel would fulfill all promises made and what can I say It clearly did ... We really enjoyed the very warm welcome and the atmosphere of the hotel. The rooms are small but have everything you need ... bathroom and shower are clean and allow enough room for a good start into the morning :o) In summary: The perfect choice ...

<Content>Great value! Husband and I spent a week here in November. Booked on TA recommendations and were not disappointed. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Room and bath were spotless and comfortable. Access to computer was a plus. Husband enjoyed breakfast more than I did but the room was clean and bright and service was speedy. We would not hesitate to stay at L  S again.

<Content>Quite decent as expected Stayed here with a mate based on these reviews. Very, very clean, Good bathrooms (keep the shower door closed), Friendly staff, centrally located. You will not find better in Central London for under 100 quid, no way. This is a top notch 2 - 3 star hotel, no delusions of grandeur. Had no problems coming in late, didn't eat breakfast, 8 mins door to door to Victoria station, and everyone says St. George's pub and a few others are commuter pubs, and they are really quite all right (I had been before as friends lived in neighbourhood). You can keep looking, but why bother? I'd pay the extra 10 quid to stay here vs. other dodgier sounding places in the area, though I am sure they are fine. I booked directly, all went smooth.

<Content>Clean, Affordable, Great Location - What more do you need?! My husband and I stayed at the Luna  Simone for two nights in November and it proved to be an excellent choice. If you want large plush rooms with a huge bathroom then forget it (you're in London remember!) but if you're looking for a convenient, clean, friendly and good value hotel then look no further. The rooms aren't massive but they're certainly not the smallest I've come across in London and the bathroom was spotless. You may have to travel up a few flights of stairs to get to your room so I wouldn't advise anyone with mobility difficulties to stay here. We got a great deal with breakfast included (although it's an early start if you're on holiday, 7.00-8.30). The hotel is a 5-10 min walk from both Pimlico tube station and Victoria bus/train/tube station so you can be anywhere in London in no time. If you are visiting London and plan to spend more time pounding the streets than relaxing in your room then this is definitely a great choice.

<Content>Fabulous breakfast! Couldn't believe the fresh bacon and eggs every morning. Ciao,Stayed at this wonderful hotel in London. I usually stay at my relatives home when I travel to London. But it was a last minute decission to fly to London. Peter and Bernard were so wonderful. Everyone was so helpful with directions and helping me find a hotel for my last night in London. Since the Luna was already booked up. Coundn't believe the free internet. I had just traveled from Venice, Italy and paid $20.00 for 60 minutes on the internet. I will recommend the Luna to my clients and friends.

<Content>Great budget hotel in London I would like to say that ALL the nice things that have been said about the Luna  Simone Hotel are true. Found the service is second to none and the two rooms I have stayed in were both very very clean. The area is safe and there are lots of good eateries and a supermarket nearby. Took me a bit over 5 mins to walk to the Victoria Station. The free use of internet is a thoughtful gesture and the breakfast was good.As for some previous comments about the lack of a lift, the staff will help to carry your luggage on request. The steps are not too high anyway.There were also comments before about the fact that you can hear sounds from the next room and/or from the street. I found that it was true when I stayed in one of the rooms on the top floor. However, there was no such problem when I stayed in the twin room on the ground floor. Just ask for one of the ground floor rooms, which are at the back of the building, if you are a light sleeper and have issues with stairs. This is my fourth trip to London and I have stayed in both higher end and budget hotels. The owners and staff of Luna Simone had definitely made my visit this time very enjoyable and I will not stay at any other hotel when I visit London in the future. If only all budget hotels around the world are that great on service and cleaniness, I would be a very happy traveller.Thank you to all those who have left comments previously. It has definitely helped me to find the right hotel for my visit.

<Content>The Luna Simone is now my home in London! Preparing for my fourth stay in London, but unable to stay with friends...I found the Luna Simone highly recommended on Trip Advisor. After booking directly with the hotel, I stayed at the Luna Simone last week (Wednesday-Sunday). If they aren't fully booked--I will stay there on every future visit. The hotel is easily walkable from both Pimlico and Victoria stations as well as on the #24 bus line. The entire property is immaculately clean and quiet considering its location. While the room was small, there was more than enough storage room and it included a new-looking, sparkling en-suite bathroom. (My only gripe...there could be a few more cable stations offered.)Of course, I'm saving the best for last: the owners, who are brothers, who do everything personally. From catering to your choice of yogurt with the included breakfast, to loaning A-Z maps, to chatting about the best kind of chocolates to buy friends. You truly don't feel on your own in London. I'm highly recommending the Luna Simone to all my friends and coworkers. I hope to stay again.

<Content>Highly recommended, a great value Just returned from 5 nights at the Luna Simone. The hotel is a great value for London. We found most everything exactly as described in the reviews and candid photos posted here. We had a triple room which was very quiet. The beds were comfortable and linens fresh and of high quality. Everything in the hotel was spotlessly clean. The breakfast was excellent.The neighborhood is very good, with a dozen restaurants, stores, pubs and a small street market within a few blocks. We ate one night at the Oh Solo Mia Italian restaurant located about 100 yards from the hotel and it was very good. There is also a convenience store within 100 yards where we bought drinks and snacks for the room. We traveled around the city using the oyster card from Victoria station which is about a 4 or 5 block walk.

<Content>Marvelous and inexpensive hotel near Victoria Station My wife and I stayed for four nights at this marvelous little bed-and-breakfast hotel near Victoria station. The rates are extremely low, by London standards. The rooms are quite small, but as we didn't plan to spend much time sitting in the room, that was no drawback. The rooms are clean and comfortable. No lifts (elevators), as has been noted elsewhere, but the owners/managers helped us upstairs with our heavy suitcases. The location is ideal - tube station about a five-minute walk away, and the number 24 bus stops in front of the hotel, with service to Victoria, Trafalgar Square, Westminster, and the Charing Cross Road, among other places - a great bus to simply get on and ride for sightseeing.The service could not have been friendlier - the brothers who own/manage the hotel are wonderful. They serve a full English breakfast in the morning which was more than adequate for our needs. We'd stay there again in a heartbeat. Note, however, that there is no air conditioning (though there are fans), so we'd be hesitant about visiting in high summer. Overall, we loved our stay.

<Content>Nice place, nice location Traveled to England for a two-week tour with spouse and two teens. We needed a relatively inexpensive place with a room for 4. We were quite pleased with the Luna  Simone. The beds were quite comfortable, even though the room was very small (didn't bother us). We loved being so close to Victoria Station because we wanted to tour lots of places within London, plus we picked up our rental car for the rest of our trip there. The bathroom was clean and sufficient (why do I always forget that the British don't use washcloths so I could bring my own?). The only drawback was the breakfast--minimal choice and rather cheaply made, I thought, especially compared to later places we stayed.

<Content>Fabulous The location is great, not too far away from Victoria Station (with the musicals etc around it) plus there is a bus stop very close to the hotel. It can be a bit tricky to find it at first, on your own from the station late at night after travelling all day, though. However, the area around it was packed with restaurants, Boots and small shops.The service given was very good too. The breakfast was perhaps a bit too early in the morning, so I didn't have the chance to check that out. However, they were very helpful with questions and were happy to order a taxi for the airport etc. They offer an internet connection in the rooms, and have a 'computer room' (which is a computer in the smallest room of all time! :D).We lived at the top, and as others have mentioned, there is no lift. We managed, however, even if the trip up with heavy suitcases was - well - exercise. The rooms, however, were nice. The walls were a bit yellow, but clean and surprisingly not tiny. The bathroom was amazing, the shower like no other on budget hotels, and cleaned every day by a sweet maid.The street was busy in the morning, so if we had the window open it would wake us up, but not bother us, really.

<Content>nice hotel Clean, very friendly, and good location. Rooms were small, but the price was fair. The rooms were new looking. The bathrooms appeared to be brand new. We stayed in 2 differant rooms at 2 differant times. The rooms were nearly identical. We were within a few blocks of Victoria station. Which meant that we had access to trains and tubes. Staff was family, and very friendly. We always had a nice greeting in the morning with our complimentary english breakfast. Egg, ham (its called bacon here), baked beans and toast. I would highly recommend it.

<Content>Perfect location,first rate hospitality from a lovely hotel Taking note of reviews,we chose the Luna and Simone' for a 6 night stay and we were not disappointed.My son and I had a twin room,my cousin a single and the 3 of us were all impressed by the rooms,ensuites, and the traditional English breakfast.The family who run the hotel are very sincere in making your stay as enjoyable as possible and will always find time for any needs you may have.The location is ideal being located between Victoria(10minutes walk) and Pimlico(5minutes walk)stations.The other plus is the 24 bus stopping at the front door.The use of the London pass for siteseeing together with a 6 day travelpass, the Luna and Simone as a base made our holiday so enjoyable we have already booked the hotel for May 2008 to see sites we missed in 2007.Exceptional value for London.

<Content>More praise for Luna  I'll keep this short because much of what I could say has been said before. The only negative - small room and very small bathroom, but this was as expected. We stayed in room 1a next to breakfast room - 4 of us. Price was more of an issue than space as we intended to use the room only to sleep. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel and room very clean. Great shower. Excellent location. 24 bus runs almost every 5 minutes to Westminster, Trafalgar Square, Theatre district, towards Kings Cross.Would recommend and will use again when next in the Capital.

<Content>Wonderful This Hotel is spotless. Located in a wonderful area of London. The busline is in front of the hotel. Within walking distance of the Victoria Station. Great restaurants and pubs within walking distance. The owners, Peter and Bernard are very gregarious and gracious. Internet access was a plus!! We had a fabulous stay and can't wait to go back Peggy Lee Ristas

<Content>A perfect little getaway in London We stayed in this hotel for three nights, and I have nothing but good to say about it. We had a room on the fourth floor, and there was no elevator, but we were told this when we booked. The location was excellent. After spending all day and into the night running around crowded, busy London, the hotel was like a peaceful oasis to come home to. Each morning the breakfast was served with a smile, and it was substantial enough to keep us satisfied until mid afternoon. This was a help with the prices in London and the value of the dollar vs. the pound. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Great hotel I found this hotel via trip advisor and was not disappointed. Myself, partner and son stayed in a triple room which was down from the breakfast room. The room was spotless and a decent size. Breakfast is included in the price and that was good too, juice, bacon egg and beans coffee etc. The hotel is about a 15 min walk from Victoria tube station, we arrived at 10 and as the room had been cleaned they allowed us to check in, if not you can leave your case with them in reception, same on checkout day we left our case with them in the morning and collected it at 5pm before heading home. This hotel is in an ideal location and perfectly safe to get to at night, the staff are friendly and we will definately be staying here when we visit London again.

<Content>What They Said London is a VERY costly place to visit, but the Luna and Simone is fairly reasonable for budget travelers. The generous breakfast will keep you going through a good part of the day, and the #24 bus is just wonderful -- with this location, and an Oystercard, you are set for convenient sightseeing all over the city. If I have one complaint, it is that our room was VERY small...even smaller than I expected, and I was prepared for close quarters. The problem with our room was that you could not even open the bathroom door all the way as it ran into the side of the bed, so my husband and I were continually having to step out of each other's way when en route to the bathroom. I'm sure some of the rooms must be a little larger as I haven't seen this problem mentioned often. Our room was on the fifth floor and required a climb of 80+ steps, so we tried to have everything we needed for the day with us when we went down to breakfast to avoid too much stairclimbing.All else was fine, and the staff couldn't have been nicer.

<Content>Comfort, value and a warm welcome I've stayed at the Luna  Simone several times before and continue to be hugely impressed by the way they manage to offer an outstandingly clean, comfortable and welcoming hotel at an excellent price. These are owners whose interest in every guest is absolutely genuine; the attention to detail comes from the heart, not from some corporate training manual. This is a simple place without pretensions. It's well located, walkable from either Pimlico or Victoria tubes and the neighbourhood is very pleasant, with a scattering of small shops and caf茅s not far away. There is nowhere else in London I'd want to stay.

<Content>Service with a smile! After being greeted by a pluthora of frowns and scowls in Barcelona, I was very happy to see the very charming and smiling faces at the Luna  SImone hotel in London. The people were extremely friendly and helpful, but not intrusive. The location was just perfect. I was only there for 2 nights, but was able to see much of London, as all of the main attractions were close by. The rooms were small, but very clean. They were quite stuffy, however, so I'm not sure it would be so enjoyable inthe summer. I was there in the middle of October, so it was perfect. Another treat were the breakfasts. Bacon  eggs! I was so elated to not see hard croissants and unripened melons. Veggie alternatives were also available. We were always greeted with a sincere smile, which again was much appreciated after Barcelona's grumpiness! Our room was 70 pounds for 2 twin beds and a private washroom, which was quite costly for the size of the rooms, but in comparison to other hotels in London, considerably cheaper. I would definately return to Luna  SImone.

<Content>Ideal Location for touring London We just got back from a three night stay here in Late October. Once again I trusted TripAdvisor, and I wasn't disappointed. We flew to London into Gatwick Airport, took the Gatwick Express from the airport (which is simple and very efficient) and arrived at Victoria Station in 30 minutes. My wife and I had luggage but we still decided to walk from the train station to the hotel, reading other reviews that said it would take 10 minutes. The hotel was very easy to find and it only took 10 minutes as promised. Upon arrival at 10:30 AM, our room was ready and we were allowed to check-in. The hotel is in a quiet, residential neighborhood. We asked for a room on a lower floor, due to the fact there is no elevator and we got it. The room wasn't very big, but it was very clean and we didn't plan on spending too much time in the room so it worked out great. There is no air-conditioning, but we didn't need it in October. Wireless internet is available, but it's not free, unless you can get a signal from a nearby establishment, which we could!! There is, however, a computer for all guests to use on the first floor, but you may have to wait for it. Breakfast was served from 7-8:30 everyday in the downstairs dining room and it was very good, and it was included with your room. If you are in town to tour London, this is a great location. There are two Underground (Subway) stations within a 10 minute walk (Pimlico and Victoria). From Victoria you can get anywhere in the city quickly. The Underground is very easy to use and very clean, I recommend you buy and Oyster Card when you arrive, put 20 Pounds on it and use it on every trip. The Oyster completely refunds any unused funds on you card when your stay in London ends. If you are American, you know the dollar is getting killed against the pound, so anyway to save a bit is key. This hotel was 85 pounds a night, which is really good for central London. I have absolutely no complaints and would stay here again.

<Content>Super hotel Just returned from a four night stay at the Luna Simone. We booked this hotel on the strength of reviews and were not disappointed. Upon arrival we were welcomed and given the downstairs room which we had requested. The room was not as small as we had expected, and was immaculately clean and well kept. Everything we needed for our short stay. Tea and coffee replenished every day, and extra pillows provided when we asked. Despite the room being directly onto the street, we were not affected by any unreasonable noise.The ensuite looked as though it had recently been refurbished, and like the room, was beautifully clean. Fantastic power shower. Fresh towels provided every day.My husband enjoyed the cooked breakfast every morning, and said that it was freshly prepared and lovely and hot. Best pot of tea in London! I am not a breakfast person myself, but when we were leaving the owners said that they had missed me, and did I not like the breakfast. I thanked them for their concern, and how thoughtful of them to ask.The staff are the backbone of this lovely hotel, so kind and helpful. Answering questions about our visit and providing information to make our trip more enjoyable.Travelling around London is no problem from the Luna Simone. Excellent bus service (24 hours) outside the hotel, running every ten minutes or so. Also tube connections from either Pimlico (which is slightly nearer) or Victoria.You will not be disappointed if you book a stay - exceptionally good value for central London.

<Content>Lovely Hotel, Excellent Location My husband and I stayed at the Luna  Simone Hotel for one week in October. The location was central and the room immaculate (request a quiet room if you don't wish to face the street). We would highly recommend this hotel as an affordable and convenient option for staying in London.

<Content>Great Value in London. My wife and I stayed for 5 nights from September 30 through October 5th, and we enjoyed our stay.The staff was friendly and helpful, and really made an effort to get to know their guests.The hotel may not be ideal for those who plan to spend a lot of time in the room - our room was smallish, and the tiny TV only offered 5 stations (which is par for the course in England). However, the rooms were spotless and comfortable, and the bathrooms were clean with a nice, hot shower.A full English breakfast was included, and was always cooked perfectly, and the breakfast room was always a friendly hub of activity. Those who like to sleep in, though, should take note: breakfast was served only from 7-8:30.The hotel is only a 10 minute walk from Victoria station, and is an ideal location for tourists. There are a couple of great pubs within a few minutes walk, including the CAMRA recommended Jugged Hare.There are bigger and fancier places to stay, to be sure. But considering the cost and location, it is hard to imagine a better value in London.

<Content>Nice hotel, great location The Luna  Simone is a great hotel near Victoria Station. The hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly. The rooms were average European size and the bathroom was very modern with plenty of hot water. As mentioned in previous reviews, there is no lift. So if you have trouble with stairs request a lower floor. We slept in every day so we did not try the breakfast. However, we did eat at several of the restaurants nearby and enjoyed all of them.All things considered, the Luna  Simone is a great hotel and we would stay there again.

<Content>Great Location clean rooms We pent 3 nights at this location. This review may be the hardest for me to write. We spent 10 nights this trip in various locations. 4 of them were in Travelodge's, 3 in a BB knowing that you will understand that I don't like to spend allot of money on a room. We booked here solely on Trip Advisor notes and I can say we were not disappointed. After looking at various rooms in London and seeing that most were well over 100 pounds we were glad to find one that was only 85, even though one night here was more then 3 in a Travelodge. Bottom line, we would stay here again in a heartbeat but folks need to know what I consider the Pros and Cons. Pros: PriceLocation to VictoriaNice neighborhoodFriendly staff and ownersIncluded breakfast (saves about 5-6 pounds PP)Internet kiosk, sometimes you have a wait. Clean roomVery nice shower! After the 4 foot high shower head at a Travelodge this was very welcome. Cons:Steps, we had 69 to climb to the 3rd floor if you have bad knees be sure your on the ground floor. Street noise, we were in the front facing Belgrave, with the window open it was quite noisy all night. Bad bed, we could feel the springs, Fan over bed had bad bearings and made more noise then the traffic outside.

<Content>FANTASTIC Such a lovely hotel! We stayed in the triple room (1) downstairs for 2 nights which was lovely. The bathroom was spotless and the room was really quiet at night. No road noise or noise from other guests as it's not really joined to any. Just across the coridor to the breakfast room (less than 10 steps), which was great for after we'd stuffed ourselves.Staff at the Luna and Simone are very friendly and will do anything to help and make your stay more enjoyable. Tea and coffee facilities in the room, also a fan and a safe. Towels are lovely and soft and clean. Extra pillows and blankets incase you're cold.Quiet street, but still very close to everything. 10 min walk to the underground (pimlico is probably slightly closer). Close to Victoria station and Coach park. I had a problem with my bed on the first night (spring had broken and poked out of the bottom of my bed) which was very quickly sorted out and the staff couldn't seem to do enough to help. Very friendly and very nice, they all seem to take pride in thier jobs which does make a real difference to the atmosphere of the hotel.Not a problem to leave your luggage behind the reception desk on the morning of your departure. We went off to Buckingham palace (20/30 min walk) after breakfast and they had no problem looking afer our luggage until we were ready to catch our coach in the afternoon (just let them know a rough time that you'll be collecting them) Enjoyed my stay so much i'm going back in December with my Mom to celebrate her birthday :)

<Content>Affordable with A-1 service! We stayed in a triple room, and yes as other reviewers have mentioned space was small, but still comparable to London standards and at half the price. Room was clean, bathroom was impeccably clean and modern and shower was large which we loved! The twins were super friendly and super knowledgeable about London, it's like having two guides at your fingertips. Breakfast which was included was hearty and wholesome, and service was fast. The high-speed internet access was an added bonus. Location was great, the tube and Victoria station were within a short walking distance, and the 24 bus that is right outside the hotel goes to all the major tourist attractions in London and runs 24 hours. We would recommend it to anyone!

<Content>Great value in London! We enjoyed our stay at the Luna  Simone Hotel. The staff were very helpful, especially Mark. The rooms were great, we were on the 2nd floor, but our friends were on the top floor and had to walk up 8 flights of stairs, that didn't go over so good. But Bernard carried the largest suitcase up the stairs for them. Breakfast was fine. The staff went out of their way to help us with buses, site seeing etc. The location was great, 10 minutes from Victoria Station and the #24 buses pick you up and drop you off at the door. Lots of pubs  restaurants close by. The rooms were very clean. Excellent value.

<Content>Great experience at the Luna and Simone I stayed four nights with some friends at the Luna and Simone and liked it very much. I read a few other recent reviews here and I don't agree with the complaints about the room size or the food. The rooms are small, yes, but rooms in city hotels are always small, unless you're staying at an expensive hotel. I've definitely been in smaller places both in London and in New York. I thought the breakfast was good. Not gourmet, but fresh and tasty. The place was spotlessly clean and the location was unbeatable. The staff were friendly, helpful, and very humorous. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it without hesitation.

<Content>Great value! Me and my wife just stayed for four nights at the Luna Simone. Relating to other hotels in London - we麓ve stayed at different hotels in different price categories earlier - I must say that Luna Simone delivers great value for the money. It麓s a exceptionally well kept hotel, spotlessly clean and with very pleasant people running the place. So OK - the rooms aren麓t that big but contains everything you need - eg safe, tv, hairdryer, bed ;-), etc.If you expect a ballroom - go somewhere else (and pay double).The breakfast is hot, good, plenty and served with a smile. Again - if it麓s a buffe you want - go somewhere else (and pay double, again).So as far as I麓m concerned - money for value - the Luna Simone is the best London has to offer (and I麓m comparing with at least 10 other hotels). I would gladly recommend it to anyone going to London and will absolutely go back there.Best regardsJoakim, Sweden

<Content>Book it! This a true gem in a city full of expensive and not always great hotels. If you're after a luxurious hotel with pools and gyms etc, then give this one a miss. But if you're after a clean hotel in a great location with decent rooms at a decent price and friendly staff to help you out, then this is the one for you. Breakfast and internet access was a welcome inclusion in the room price. We loved it and will definitely book it again next time we're in London. One word of advice - try to book as far ahead as possible because it is very popular and the word is out!

<Content>Nice hotel, no elevator We stayed at this hotel for three nights. The staff was great - family run operation and they seemed genuinely concerned about our stay. There is no elevator and we had a room on the 3rd floor, which was a lot of steps. Breafast was included and was nice. The room itself was nice - large restroom and even a desk if you need to set up a computer.

<Content>Loved it! This is a great hotel. The location is in the Pimlico area - close to the tube and Victoria Station and within walking distance of major attractions. It is extremely clean and well appointed. The room I stayed in had a nice little balcony with a sliding glass door which was very pleasant . The hotel staff is soooo friendly and helpful and has been a family run business for over 35 years. I would stay here again in a second. The rooms are small but you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Good location, but small room The location is a great one for touring the Victoria area of London. However, the rooms -- at least the one we were in -- was very small with an absolutely tiny bathroom. Clean, though. Also, we found the breakfast mundane and bland and the breakfast room was a bit noisy on this particular occasion. After a series of countryside BBs before this stay in London, we were a bit disappointed. I doubt we would stay here again, but it is not a bad option for those who need only a night or maybe two. Beyond that, and you'll feel too cramped.

<Content>Nice location We stayed 3 nights and then decided to book another night for our return to London. The hotel is nicely located in a safe neighborhood close to Victoria Station, about a 15 minute walk. It was very clean and well maintained. We were served a hearty English breakfast each morning by Peter and Bernard who were gracious hosts. Rooms were not large but adequate. There was a computer available for guests for free. No lift available so upstairs rooms are an effort with luggage. But that wouldn't stop us from returning. Bus stop right in front of hotel. Nice pubs nearby.

<Content>Disappointed Based on the previous reviews, we had our hopes up for our one night stay at this hotel. It is actually rated number 5 in London. The area was pretty good, but the hotel was average. Our room (#13) was very small but clean. The bathroom was nicely decorated, but was tiny and there was no room for your toiletries. Breakfast was served between 0700 and 0830. Too early for us, but since it was included in the price, we got up. You had three choices, and we did enjoy our egg, bacon and beans. The service was good, but all this was totally ruined by all the noise from the kitchen. Just terrible! We will not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Good value, great location! My husband and I stayed in this hotel for our first visit to London. We had just spent 6 days in Paris, so we were accustomed to the rather small size of European rooms. We had a very nice stay at the Luna and Simone. We took the Underground from Heathrow to Pimlico station and with a little help from the locals were able to find this hotel a few blocks away. The hotel was quite affordable by London standards, very clean and the room and private bathroom were both adequate in size for the two of us and our luggage. The only complaint I have is that the platform-style bed with its futon mattress was rather lumpy and probably the most uncomfortable bed I slept on during our vacation. We did not mention this to the front desk, so I'm not sure if this problem was unique to our particular room (#8) or if they would have offered to move us. One nice feature about room #8 is that we had our own private little balcony overlooking Belgrave Rd. There is quite a bit of traffic- vehicular and pedestrian, along this street, but with the windows closed it did not keep us awake at night.  Everything else about the hotel was great. The breakfast every morning was good and hot, your basic English breakfast of ham, eggs, beans and toast. The staff were friendly and helpful with booking tours and even letting me use their printer to print out a voucher for a tour I had booked online. They also have a computer for free internet access although it is often busy. Probably the best feature of this hotel is its great location in the neighborhood of Belgravia. We were close to a variety of good pubs and restaurants. We were also a 5-10 minute walk away from the Sainsbury's market where we could get a hot pizza and beer for a cheap dinner. We were a 10-minute walk away from the Victoria train, bus, and Underground station. Also, although we did not go to a show, there are a couple of theaters next to the Victoria station with good shows like Wicked playing. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonably priced room in London.

<Content>Small, Tiny, Miniscule We looked at the reviews for this hotel and booked because of them. I feel as if I was in a different hotel. The area is as described but this was the smallest room we have ever been in. I don't think you could have swung a hamster! Even the beds were tiny. No room to put your case anywhere or you could not walk. Amazed that they could manage to get all in the space. Breakfast is absurdly early, finishing at 8.30 in a holiday hotel. You get a choice of orange juice or cornflakes, tea or coffee, small cooked, with bacon, beans and fried egg or spam type ham and one small tomato. Lots of toast. It must cost pennies to do this. It is ok but really down to a price! The owners are nice but just bear this in mind and if you are booking and if you are of a larger size you aint going to get into the room without opening the window!

<Content>Nice and clean, but oh so teeny! I stayed at Luna  Simone for a week in August. From making the reservations, to check-in, to breakfast and check-out the staff was absolutely wonderful to deal with. When I opened the door to my single room with shower and WC I was shocked how small it was. I could barely fit my two medium sized suitcases in the room (one had to go under the bed). And there is no room whatsoever to put your toiletries or anything else.The room was pretty modern and extremelly clean and kept, but it was like living in a sardine can. I would still recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London a night or two, not carrying anything larger than a dufle bag. As far as the price goes, I paid 60 pounds and that is great for a decent hotel in central London, so it's a nice deal. However, as an USA resident, it still came out to $120 per night which very pricey.

<Content>Fabulous time with my son. My son and I traveled to London for the Harry Potter book release and lots of sightseeing. We enjoyed 6 evenings at the Luna Simone. Although we were unable to enjoy breakfast while there (it's rather early for us night owls), everyone we did come into contact with at the front desk was quite lovely. It has the feeling of staying with very nice family who respect your privacy. You are able to come and go as you please and the rooms are very clean. We traveled with some friends and we were able to get rooms right next to each other. They do like to clean the room by noon each day but are very flexible if you need a little extra time if you're running late. If you would like to refrigerate something, you just have to ask them to place it in the fridge in the office as there are no refrigerators in the rooms. The street is not noisy but not incredibly quiet so if you are staying in the summer months (and need to leave the window open for a breeze), you may want to ask for a room at the back of the hotel which I'm assuming are quite quiet as they are not facing the street. Overall I was pleased with our choice of hotel.

<Content>A gem of a hotel! We (me, my husband and college age son) just returned from 6 nights at the Luna  Simone and couldn't have been more pleased with room, location and staff. The room (#1) was clean, pleasantt and comfortable, with a spotless bathroom, cushy carpeting, and plenty of pillows and blankets. A fan added comfort on those warmer days and nights (yes, we had a few!). We stayed in a room for 3 (3 twin beds) on the lower floor and it was quiet and conveniently had an extra bathroom (toilet) just outside the door. We were also just steps away from the dining room. Breakfasts were served promptly and were always to order. If you have special requests, the staff were ready to oblige. Upstairs was a computer for internet access but my son had no problem finding a hot spot in the room for his laptop.The location was perfect for us. Bus #24 runs 24/7 and stops just outside the door. Victoria Tube and Rail station is on the #24 line or just a 10 minute walk away. ATM, banks, restaurants, grocery stores, pubs, all very close by. Also, Victoria Tube has an upstairs eatery which has lots of restaurant choices. From the hotel to the city centre (Westminster) is only about 15 minutes ... and you can continue on to Trafalgar Square and even to the British Museum. Can't say enough about how convient being on the 24 line is. And as far as the staff goes, they were all marvelous. Friendly, helpful, genuinely concerned for our well-being and enjoyment. They will help you book tours, mail post cards (and they sell really nice ones too!), arrange a taxi for you, whatever you need.Can't say enough about the great staff at Luna  Simone!We will recommend to family and friends without reservation!

<Content>great location We stayed three nights at the Luna  Simone Hotel and were delighted with the location, the simple but very clean room and the helpful, friendly staff. The hotel is located on Belgrave Road - a pristine Georgian St. only a 10 minute walk from Victoria Station and a few minutes walk to the Thames River. The price was reasonable for expensive London and the location was excellent - Belgrave Road is very quiet and sedate. The family members who own the hotel (for 30 years) are fun, helpful and very friendly. The desk clerk was eager to find information for me and printed out what I needed from the computer. The breakfast menu wasn't large but fresh and tasty. We had a very quiet room downstairs at the back of the hotel. It was spacious, simple and clean.Highly recommended to you, travellers.

<Content>A Wonderful Discovery What a wonderful discovery, thanks to Tripadvisor Users: I stayed here for three days from 21-24 August. I was allocated Room Five, a single room without loo etc, however there was a shower/loo beside my room which was fine.My room was small  bijou: about 15' x 7' or thereabouts; tea/coffee facilities, a wardrobe, telly... everything necessary. And very clean too.I cannot speak highly enough about the breakfast: I enjoy a full breakfast so I opted for fruit juice, a cooked brekkie of two very lean rashers of Danish back bacon (no fat at all), one egg, beans and two slices of white, hot toast with butter and tea/coffee. Absolutely perfect. Couldn't wish for anything more.Very amiable staff and the proprietor who has relatives in Northern Ireland; so we had a good natter! They make you feel at home and are most helpful for advice about London, bookings etc.I really loved this place and hope to return again. If the staff read this, I wish to thank them from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. By the way, I do not usually give five stars for my reviews; however, given the value of this guesthouse, I feel it more than merits this.

<Content>Great Customer Service and a Great Price! While traveling in London with my 3 gal pals, we stayed at this hotel. It's very conveniently located near the Victoria Tube station and was very affordable. The owners are incredibly nice and having the breakfast included was an added bonus. The rooms are very modest, but everything was clean. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an affordable stay at convenient location.

<Content>Great stay! We stayed at the Luna Simone hotel in August of 2007 for 3 days. We knew that this hotel should be good because of many good reviews we read about it while looking for an affordable hotel in London, but we still did not expect to see such a modern, cozy and lovely place. When we made reservations there was just one room available with 2 beds on the 3rd floor, but the owner was very nice promising us to change it in case there will be a double room on the lower floor. When we came to the hotel we found our double room on the street level and were wery pleased with it. The owners were very helpful on each step of our stay telling us where to buy tickets and how to get where we wanted. The hot breakfast was big and very good. The location is superb, we were walking most of the time to the main attractions. Next time we are in London we are not looking for any other hotel, but if you want to stay there you have to book it in advance, because it is always full. Tatyana, USA

<Content>Perfect stay! We could not have asked for more! I researched hotels in London (100's) for several months in planning our trip, as it was important to me that we stay in a clean, safe, and reputable hotel that fit into our tiny budget. The Luna and Simone was all of that and more. My 13 year daughter and I stayed in room 10 on the Simone side for 9 nights and had the perfect 'home' in London. The rooms were spotless, the bathroom was sparkling clean and beautifully updated, the breakfast was always quick, delicious, and filling, and the owners/staff could not have been better. We LOVED laughing with Rita and 'the two brothers' each day, and the nice Brazilian lady who cleaned our room each day was meticulate in her attention to detail. I'm not sure which brother is which, but you'll come to know their different personalities quickly (both are funny/helpful, with one being a tiny bit more low-key and the other being an animated little bugger). The fact that all of these characters are delightful human beings only makes things better.The location is great (bus 24 is LITERALLY outside the front door and goes to Victoria Station and beyond), and there are many places to eat nearby. The street is quiet but it never felt deserted or dangerous in any way--just beautifully residential.BOOK YOUR ROOM NOW!!!!! They stayed full most nights. We paid 85 pounds for a twin from Aug. 6-15th and, because it included a hot, hearty/traditional English breakfast, we saved atleast 10 pounds each day on breakfast. What a deal!Re: Food, I found that we saved a lot of money by picking up 'ready to eat' items at Sainsburys, Tesco's, and Marks and Spencer. Nowhere in London is cheap with the pound being so strong against the dollar, but we loved having fresh fruit, hummous, sandwiches, pastas, couscous, and other things available at great prices. We were able to keep our meal budget under 25 pounds a day (that's 12.50 pounds per person), and some days, were even under 20 pounds for the two of us. My 13 year old is growing and hungry as well, so we only split an entree once or twice during our entire stay there.Thank you Rita and brothers for maintaining such a stellar hotel in what must be a hard and sometimes frustrating business. We can't wait to stay there if we're ever blessed enough to return to London!We have many other 'tips' that we picked up or learned the hard way while in London and are happy to share. Just ask.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Great Staff My husband and I spent 3 nights at this hotel near the end of July. The quality and price of this hotel was above and beyond comparison to anything else I could find in London.The location was perfect...within walking distance of Victoria Station (you can get anywhere in London from this station) and the many restaurants and pubs that surround it. As well you could easily walk to Westminister Abbey, the London Eye and Buckingham Palace if you enjoy walking and taking in the sights.The room was extrordinarily clean and suited our needs perfectly. Both the room and bathroom were very modern and updated. There is no elevator in this hotel, however, so be sure to find out which floor you are staying on, as not everyone can carry their bags up 85 stairs. Breakfast was provided every morning and you could choose from a typical English breakfast or a lighter version of cereal and toast. The staff was friendly and helpful. When I return to London, I will definately stay at this hotel again.

<Content>L  We flew to London in July and arrived at Heathrow at around 11:30 AM. We took the National Express coach from the airport to Victoria Station which was wonderful (cheap and relaxing) and then we trundled off with our luggage to find the Luna  Simone. This was somewhat more arduous than I would have liked after a long flight, but we made it after a 10 or 15 minute walk from the bus station. The first impression of the hotel was very positive (as were most of the later impressions). The neighbourhood was clean and stylish. The hotel itself was compact and the staff were friendly and helpful. The room was on the small side, which we expected, but was very clean and comfortable. The #24 bus stops right in front of the hotel and heads towards Trafalgar Square and other central locations before going to Hampstead Heath (highly recommended). The breakfasts were quick and plentiful, but became slightly repetitious after 4 days. All in all the hotel was just what we were hoping for and we felt it was great value for the money.

<Content>Excellent deal in London After reading reviews on TripAdvisor, we thought Luna Simone would be a good bet, and we were not disappointed. Convenient, safe location with restaurants, Post Office, bank, tube station, etc., nearby. Room 7 on Simone side was on front--a little noisy early in evening, but quiet later. Room small, but this is London! Bathroom had plenty of room  good shower. Hotel overall looked to be in good , well-kept condition. Breakfast was ample.

<Content>Lovely atmosphere, great location This is actually two side by side small hotels, two houses in a terrace (where there are other hotels). They are joined at the reception area and the basement breakfast room. We were in 47 which I think is luna. We enjoyed staying here: the place is very nicely decorated, the room was clean with a nice shower and toilet. They had warned us when we booked that it was at the top, a long way up the stairs - if you have luggage get a room on a lower floor. But what makes this hotel one we will go back to is the warmth of the family who run it. The two brothers and other members of their family are very friendly, welcoming, and helpful, and that warmth permeates the hotel.Not cheap, but what London hotel is: we paid 85 for a Sat night in July 07, two people, bed and breakfast. The location is great: 5 mins from Pimlico tube station, 10 mins from Victoria tube station and bus hub. So Tate Britain is 5 more minutes the other side of Pimlico tube, and there are lots of things near Victoria - Houses of Parliament are 15mins or so by foot. The italian restaurant, Sol Mio Uno, two minutes away from the hotel on the corner of Denbigh and Belgrave, an independent restaurant not a chain, is highly recommended.

<Content>Great value! We stayed at the Luna  Simone in July, 2007. What a pleasant surprise and a great value considering the price of other hotels in London. The rooms are small but in line with European standards and the rooms and other facilities are SPOTLESS. The two owners - Peter and Bernard are gracious, charming, and willing to assist guests in any way to accomodate their needs. A full English breakfast is served every morning. The property is located a short walk from Victoria Station which will get you any where you need to go in London and the 24 bus line stops in front of the hotel. I would definitely recommend Luna  Simone to my friends and family and am hoping to return their soon. When it was time to go we really hated to leave. Peter and Bernard keep up the good work!

<Content>Clean, Convenient, Friendly My husband and I booked Luna Simone based on previous reviews. We were not disappointed. We requested room 15 at the top of eight flights of stairs and found a great room with a nice shower, quiet atmosphere and view over London rooftops. There is no roof access, but the room is well worth the stair climb!Breakfast is provided each day - orange juice, eggs, bacon or ham, toast, tea or coffee. A great start to the day. Victoria Station is a short walk away and in the neighborhood are several coffee shops, a laundramat and some nice watering holes.kw -Redmond, WA

<Content>Nice hotel, good value We stayed twice and Luna  Simone (in two different rooms) and had a good experience both times. The hotel is clean, the staff is friendly, and the breakfast is good. The location is great - within easy walking distance of the Pimlico tube station. The number 24 bus stop is practically right outside the door, and Victoria station is less than a 10 minute walk away. The only downside was that some of the beds were a bit too hard.

<Content>Fantastic FInd We won't bother looking anywhere else next time we travel to London...this place has it all. The hotel is located in a clean and safe area and once inside, we felt welcome and comfortable. We arrived at 9:30am and were allowed to check in, but we could not enter the room until 11:30, so they held all of our luggage while we ventured out into the city. We walked the short distance to Buckingham Palace to watch the changing of the guards which was well worth the walk and the wait. Once we got into our room, we slept a few hours before heading back out to grab the 24 bus to the London Eye. The bus stop is literally across the street from the front door and could not have been more convenient. Our room was a triple, one double bed and one twin bed for our teenage daughter, and it was exactly as spotless as everyone has described. We had two great nights' sleep and enjoyed the hot showers in the small but immaculate bathroom. Breakfast was very good and served with a smile. Everyone there was friendly and made us feel welcome. After reading some of the recent reviews, I now realize that there was a computer for guests to use, and I cannot imagine where it was located. Had we known, we certainly would have used it to email family members back home that all was well. We had an great meal at Grumbles, around the corner from the hotel, as suggested by the hotel staff. Upon checkout, again they held our luggage while we ventured out to collect our rental car.I cannot recommend this place highly enough, but I do suggest booking early, they do seem to be full every night.

<Content>good for the money We stayed on the Luna side of the Luna  Simone from June 23rd through the 26th. Great property for the price. My wife reacted on how clean the place was, despite the small rooms. But hey that's what renting hotel rooms in a big city like London will get you.Property is a 5-10 minute walk to Victoria Station, a large interchange for bus/train/underground transfer. Plus, on the way to/from the station, there's a supermarket if you want to bring food back.Back to the hotel, our room was #15 - all the way on the tippity top floor of the hotel. Just be forewarned that you have quite a few flights of stairs to climb and no elevator. The room had its own bathroom with a shower, a small tv, coffee pot, and a window. the thing that made this room for us was that we were able to climb out the window onto the fire escape and see the London Eye off in the distance.The staff was friendly and able to help us with pretty much anything. A good thing to note is that if you are planning to take any tour buses around the city, this hotel can book them for you and put it on your bill, saving the hassle of converting more cash. They can also arrange taxis to the airport and what-not, but they'll be sure to tell you (as they did for us) that hailing a cab in the street will often be cheaper.Breakfast was good everyday, and there's a little closet with a computer hooked to the web that is open for use. All in all, a good little hotel for the price in London. If given the chance, we'd return (but maybe we'd get some help with our bags to the top floor).

<Content>Great budget hotel. My family and I stayed at the Luna  Simone hotel June 3-7, 2007. It is a great budget hotel. It is close to both Victoria and Pimlico tubes, Pimlico being closer, about a 5 minute brisk walk away. As peole have already mentioned, the 24 bus drops you off right at the door, especially handy after going to the theatre. The rooms were very clean, the bathroom was quite large and very clean, there was even tea and coffee available in the room. The managers were extremely helpful, helping us decide which tours to take and making recommendations. Overall, a great value for the price. The only reason I'm not giving the hotel a 5 rating is that it did not have air conditioning and it was a little warm when we were there - but ifyou were going in the fall, it would be perfect.

<Content>Liked it a lot!!!! We (Norwegian family) stayed at Luna  Simone from June 23th to July 1th (7 nights).We booked our rooms after having read so much nice about the hotel and the owners, and we were certainly not disappointed.The hotel was exactly as welcoming, clean, charming and well located as promised. We had one 3 bed room down under the ground, and one twinroom in the stairs down to the breakfastroom. Both of them were unbelievable clean. Quite simple though, but they had nice, clean bathrooms with plenty of water, nice beds, TV, and a fan which we never used. There were a water boiler there as well, and clean towels everyday. This is not at luxury hotel, but the charm and cleanlyness count up for that in every way. I have stayed in lot of luxury hotels, but never seen anything so clean. The breakfast was tasty, and enough to keep us full up for hours. The owners serving the breakfast were so nice, attentive and full of humour. As our kids sometimes didn't want anything else but toast, they were offering yoghurt and other stuff. Also the neighbourhood was really nice. Victoria Station only a few minutes walk away. We did'nt use the 24 bus everbody talk about, because we never managed to get a timetable, so we never found out which destinations the bus was going to. There were a lot of nice restaurants nearby (we tried 5 of them and were never dissapointed.) And are you going to eat Fish and Chips once while staying i London, choose the restaurant Seafresh, very nearby. We did, and it was a really nice experience. We will reccomend Luna  Simone to all people going til London, and definitly stay there again, We really hope they manage to keep up with the clean and friendly style, this is a gem!

<Content>Lived up to expectations! I stayed here with my mum at the end of June - we had trouble booking directly with the hotel as it was full but were lucky enough to get a room via Ebookers. I had seen all the great reviews on here and we weren't disappointed!As everyone else has said, the room and bathroom were gleaminingly spotless. So was the dining room for breakast, and the food was just right. Not to mention the service! In contrast to the hotel we stayedat the following night in Wembley, the difference in customer servicecouldn't be greater - everyone at Luna Simone was so friendly and helpful.If I'm looking for any negatives, lugging our suitcases up 4 flights was quite an adventure, but I'm sure the owners would have helped us if we'd have asked. Also our room facing the road and there was a fair bit of traffic noise, even overnight. But these are small quibbles and I would definitely stay here again. If I can get booked in!!!Highly recommended.

<Content>Safe, Clean, Good Location We stayed at the Luna  Simone from June 15 - 21, 2007. We were very happy with our experience. We had a room on the third floor, overlooking the street. The room was small but very clean. The private bath was fine. The room did get a bit warm during the day but had a huge window to help cool off. There was also a fan mounted on the wall above the beds.As noted in previous reviews there are no elevators so be prepared to haul your luggage up to your room.Security in the hotel was good. You needed your key to enter the hotel past the main desk. Also, our room had a safe in the closet.The location was great for us as were where there as tourists. The Victoria station is a 10 minute walk away, also the #24 bus stops in front of the hotel and its route hits many attractions.Breakfast was provided each morning from 7:00 - 8:30. While not fancy it was well cooked and quickly served.We will definitely stay at this hotel again if we return to London. We will also recommend it to everyone we know. It is very popular and was full every night so I would suggest booking early to ensure you get a room at this excellent hotel.

<Content>Good value, clean but small we stayed here june 18-20th and it was very nice place to use as a starting point for our days of exploring london. close to victoria station and even closer to the Pimlico station. The rooms were VERY small, but it looks like that's common for mid-range hotels in London. we also tired of the stairs after a long day of walking. all in all i would recommend the LS for a short stay in london, but the room may feel a little cramped for a longer stay. there is also a couple of very good restaurants around the corner. we walked all over the city looking for a good place before we realized that the best meal we had was 1 block from the hotel.

<Content>Nice hotel Luna  Simone is a nice hotel in a lovely area of London. I doubt you could find any hotel in London this nice for the price. The area is safe and clean and easy to connect to all of London through two nearby subway stations and the bus which stops out front is an even easier way to travel. The hotel staff is very warm and friendly. Our double room on the ground floor was a bit on the small side, especially the bathroom - but acceptable. It was clean and comfortable. If you enjoy a good shower - the water pressure was excellent! Free internet access was great. Hotel was quiet, and a great bargain.

<Content>Nice Place Our stay at the Luna  Simone was a great experience. The room was a triple which had 3 single beds. There was plenty of room for the three of us to navigate around each other without being too cramped. The bathroom was small but completely updated and really very nice. The room had a fan but no A/C. It's close to Victoria Station so that made it easy to get anywhere in the city pretty quickly. The brothers who run the hotel were the best part I think. They were very nice and funny and seemed to genuinely enjoy what they do.

<Content>A Good Value for London London is expensive, but this hotel is a good, clean place to stay in a nice neighborhood. Fairly convenient to the train and the Tube (but we still recommend staying in Bath and taking the train to London rather than the bother and expense of staying in London). Room was a bit tight by US standards, but then again, that's expected in London. We had a nice balcony overlooking the street and the twin proprietors were very helpful. Decent value, standard breakfast fare, and a good place to stay in London.

<Content>Two thumbs up!! Paul and Bernard run an excellent little hotel!! They are like your favorite uncles--joking with the guests while efficiently serving breakfast. Five of us stayed three nights in a double and the triple room. The triple room is quite large and on the lower level which made it very quiet. It overlooks a sweet courtyard. As others have posted, the hotel is very clean. Bathrooms are clean and quite large. The English breakfast served each morning is a fun and enjoyable way to start the day. We either used the Pimlico tube station or Bus #24 to get around. There is a Sainsbury market close by. Also, the Jugged Hare on Vauxhall Bridge Road is a good place for pub grub. We would definitely use the Luna  Simone again.

<Content>Very convenient Our family of five including two teenagers spent one night at the Luna and Simone in transit through London back to the United States. It was exceptionally convenient and only a ten minute walk to Victoria Station and the Gatwick Epxress. The beds were a bit hard, but the rooms were exceptionally clean and the staff was truly friendly in assisting us with luggage and an early checkout. (NOTE: The Pimlico underground station is a bit closer than Victoria and much less congested for those seeking to start tours to other parts of the city.)

<Content>Great Location for travelling to and from Gatwick Our family of four just returned from London via Gatwick airport and we stayed our last night at the Luna Simone hotel. It was a simple walk from the hotel to Victoria staton to catch the Gatwick Express which saved us time and lots of money and anxiety getting to the airport. The hotel had lovely rooms at a good price and the service was excellent. The family that runs the hotel was helpful and cheerful and helped us finish our trip to Europe on a high note.

<Content>Good Value Good location near Victoria Station, resturants, and bus lines. Liked the full breakfast that came with the room. Also the free computer station to get internet was nice. Very friendly, helpful staff. The room was small but didn't spend much time in it - and it was quiet.

<Content>Welcoming Home away From Home Everything was great from the moment we arrived by underground to the moment we were on the Gattwick Express after a less than 10 minute walk . We left the hotel after 7 in the morning and were able to catch the 7:15 express to the airport.We were welcomed at the front desk and after a last breakfast were personally sent off. If you like _ clean rooms, a fantasic hot breakfast with choices, friendly staff, free internet then this is the place for you! We used both the underground and the bus which stops in front of the hotel and which we were able to catch back whenever it was raining and we didn't want even a short walk from the two underground stations which we used both depending on where we were going that day. We travelled with carry on suitcases with wheels and found going up and down the stairs and travelling by public transport a breeze. We will definitely stay here next time we visit London.

<Content>Again, fantastic! Stayed here again in May 2007 due to the great hospitality and attributes of the hotel. I booked about 1 month ahead and they didn't have a single room with a shared ensuite for the four nights I needed them, so for the first night they let me stay in a single room with an attached ensuite for the same price as a shared bathroom!! As everyone else has mentioned, the place is spotless, super convenient (I walked everywhere and hardly ever used the Tube, but Victoria and Pimlico station are a short walk). The staff (especially the twins!) are SO friendly and helpful, I really appreciated the time they spent helping me out.Will definitely stay here again when I'm back in London.

<Content>Poetry in motion We stayed at this hotel once again. The same standards of cleanliness and friendliness. Breakfast, as usual, runs like a well oiled machine-poetry in motion. We always use Pimlico station-about 7 minutes away-in preference to Victoria. If you are pulling a suitcase there are convenient ramps at Pimlico and it is a smaller station.(The only one on that line that does not interconnect with anything else.) Make for the Bessborough Road South exit. Close by the hotel there are many local shops and eating places- no need to go far to eat after a long day. Go towards Victoria station a few yards and then turn right down Churton Street, and then left and round the block and back down Denbigh Street. There is even a local market down there.

<Content>Great staff! This was a fine place to stay, although we got more exercise than we needed with a room on the seventh floor (no lifts). My macho husband wanted to carry the quite heavy bags upstairs; but after I mentioned to Bernard (one of the twin brother managers) that he had quadruple heart surgery, Bernard graciously carried both our bags up the stars as if they were two pillows. Peter, his brother, was also a pleasure to talk to. Did I mention there is free internet? The room was very clean. We will definitely stay there again, although on one of the lower floors. Bacon and beans, anyone?

<Content>Clean and caring 4 of us stayed here for almost a week in April. It was very convenient to 2 tube stations (Victoria  Pimlico). The 2 brothers  their co-workers were pleasant  caring about our needs. The rooms are very small, but CLEAN (same for the bathrooms) -  since we were essentially out all day, the cramped area didn't matter to us. The breakfast rooms were bright  clean  the food good  plenty. There is a hair dryer in the room, tea-making supplies, but no extras like shampoo. You need to be able to climb stairs (no lift). The neighborhood was safe for walking  there are nearby coffee shops, etc. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Clean and Pleasant We stayed there for 8 nights and were truly surprised with the quality of the hotel. We were told at booking that there was no lift and the only room was on their 4th (US 5th) floor. I was pleased they let us know this up front. It was quite an adventure climbing the old and uneven stairs up everyday (there were 85 stairs), but the room was very nice. It was roomy by European standards, the bathroom was SPOTLESS clean. The staff was always nice and helpful and the breakfast was very tasty. Room wise the only down was that the sheets were a little rough, but no worse than most hotels. (The towels were remarkably soft.)The hotel was a hike from Victoria Station - about 10 minutes, which is far by London standards. But the 24 Bus line stopped right in front of the hotel and we used that more than the Tube. The 24 bus goes to Victoria, Westminster, Leicester Square (theater area), and Tottingham. By going to these places we were able to hit most of the Tube lines and avoid transferring. We also got to see the a lot of the city. I would recommend using the buses - in London they are much easier to use than they are in Washington DC.

<Content>Great hotel, its all good! My husband and I stayed at Luna  Simone for 2 nights and would definatley stay there again. The only negative was that there is no lift and our room was on the 4th floor, which meant 8 flights of stairs with our very heavy suitcases. Otherwise, everything was great. Breakfast was delicious, cooked to order, friendly service and plenty to eat. Single computer in small private room with free internet access was very handy. Excellent location- Bus to/from Leicester Square at door and 5 minute easy walk to Victoria Station (this is also where you can join the hop-on-off tour buses). The rooms were clean, beds comfy and shower and toilet were modern and clean. There is also a convenience store on the corner and a supermarket 2 minutes away that sells cheap made to order take-away meals along with all other grocery items. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. Overall great hotel at a great price.

<Content>A Jewel of a Hotel I chose this hotel based on it's price and the reviews I read here on TripAdvisor. But, it was even better than I expected.I stayed at another budget priced hotel last trip, and it was OK. Worn and plain, but OK. The Luna and Simone is far, far better. It is very nicely decorated, and looks like the paint, carpets, and room decorations are fairly new.Incredibly well maintained hotel. Rooms are small, but the beds are comfy.Free internet cubicle, breakfast was good, fans in the bedroom (no a/c), reasonable arrangements for airport transfers, and super, super clean!!The owners are incredibly nice people. It's run by twin brothers and their extended family. It took us all of 45 seconds to check in, they gave us the requested ground floor room due to my husband's recent foot surgery, and we were in our room by noon after an all night flight from California. So, early check-in, too!!We paid 80 GBP per night.

<Content>Nice, Clean and Reasonable I stayed for a couple of nights as I wanted to be near Victoria Station as I had an early flight out of Gatwick. The hotel was nicer than I expected for the price. I was in a single room, pretty high up (5th floor?), facing the back (so it was very quiet). The room was small by US standards, (but large by European standards), had a nice bathroom, TV, fan, etc. Simple, but very comfortable. The walk to Victoria was not bad (maybe 10 minutes or so?). Note that there was no elevator, so you get to carry your luggage up the stairs. In an expensive city such as London, it was nice to find such a comfortable and reasonable hotel.

<Content>Reasonable Prices, delicious breakfast We thought the Luna Simone was a great hotel and felt instantly welcomed to London when we checked in. The staff was very nice and the room was very clean. It was more spacious than the last hotel I stayed in in London, but it was still more cramped than an american hotel room (of course). We didn't hear a lot of street noise but could hear people coming up the stairs. The bed was comfortable enough to suit us.Breakfast was delicious - a true english breakfast. Toast, orange juice or cornflakes, eggs, bacon, and beans. It was all delicious.The location was great, about a 10 minute walk to Victoria station. There were a few restaurants nearby, we went to Seafresh, which was ok. We also went to the Jugged Hare pub for bears and really enjoyed the atmosphere.

<Content>Great hotel, nice location! The Luna  Simone is located in Belgrave Road, nice area with lots of smaller hotels. With luggage, it takes a 10-minute walk to get there from Victoria Station. Alternatively, bus no.24 runs along the hotel and takes you from there via Victoria to Westminster.We arrived at 10:00am. Although our room had not been cleaned yet we were lucky to be allowed to put our bags into the room's closet. When we came back in early afternoon the room was ready. It was not very big but nicely furnished and remarkably clean. Compared with the room size the bathroom was big with a new shower and very clean as well. During the night we left the window open and street noise was no problem at all. Our room was on the 3rd floor (just beware that there is no lift!).The receptionists were always friendly, happy to assist with any questions we might have. A nice, personal experience and a hotel we would definitely return to again!

<Content>Excellent location, excellent base for London trip! The Luna and Simone Hotel is a short walk from Victoria bus and trainstation and in a lovely neighbourhood. The location is fab and if I had stayed longer than one night I would've tried more of the local bars and restaurants. I found all the reviews from trip advisor veryuseful and accurate and can understand why this hotel is ranked so high on the London hotel list. I look forward to visiting London again and staying in this hotel. Totally recommend it!!

<Content>Great budget hotel!!!! I stayed at the Luna  Simone last month on a family getaway trip. We got a triple bed room for 100 pounds, inlcuding a free breakfast and free internet access downstairs! The service was great, especially during breakfast (which was delicious). The location was convenient as well, as it is a short walk to the Pimlico tube station. We also were able to walk to Buckingham Palace and Parliament/Westminster Abbey quite easily. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Fabulous base for sightseeing Pleased to say the reviews of this place are spot on, what a find!However, Luna  Simone is not for those looking for a big hotel with large rooms where you can be pampered so if you want chain hotel 'luxury' book elsewhere. The rooms may be small-ish (as in the whole of London) but incredibly clean, breakfast is simple, freshly cooked and the staff are very, very friendly and helpful. Their patience when fellow guests sought options not on the breakfast menu (yoghurt) then complained about the flavoursofferred showed admirable restraint!Location is excellent. 8 minutes walf from Victoria and a similar distance from Pimlico Tube. We'll be back and judging by the conversations we had with other guests at breakfast they will too!

<Content>Wonderful little hotel!!! My daughter and I just spent four lovely nights at the Luna and Simone. Peter, Bernard and the rest of the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The hotel is clean, comfortable and in a safe, convenient location. Each morning we enjoyed a nice breakfast and getting around was so easy! The #24 bus stops right across the street and runs 24/7 or you can walk to Victoria Station or the Pimlico tube station. Most of the great sights of London are within a few miles. There's a neat little pub, the Constitution, and a very nice Indian restaurant, Paradise, right around the corner. We're already making plans to go back with the rest of our family.

<Content>Very Nice Place to Stay We stayed 4 nights and were very satisfied with Luna  Simone. The brothers were very friendly and helpful. The carpet up the stairs looked new, and the bathroom was nicely tiled and clean. We could ask about anything we needed. After we booked online, I emailed them and requested a room with twin beds and facing the street. That's exactly what they gave us. One day the in-room coffeepot just quit working--my husband just took it downstairs and came back up with a new working one. Our room was small, but very adequate and clean--it looked like it had been refurbished not too long before. The bus from Victoria stopped almost at the front door. We would recommend this hotel to everyone.

<Content>The PERFECT place to stay. Luna  Simone had everything we wanted for our one week stay in London (April 14-21, 2007). The location is very convenient; close to Victoria Station (trains and tube) and the #24 bus stops right outside their door - making it very easy to get to all of the places we wanted to visit (we were not experienced city travelers - although now we are). The hotel is very clean and comfortable; and had everything we needed. The included breakfast was excellent every morning and every night we were able to email our family and friends with the free computer use and interent access. Plenty of restaurants were around the corner and easy to walk to. Hotel reservations were easily made on the internet. The best part of Luna and Simone was the freindly family that operates the hotel. They do everything from cook to clean, to giving good directions and suggestions, to help make reservations, and to share friendly converstaion and interactions. All of this at a very reasonable rate - for London anyway. We loved the Luna  Simone; it was the perfect place for our once in a lifetime visit to London. My sister and I would recommend staying here to anybody.  Thanks to all the fine folks at Luna  Simone! You have a great hotel and wonderful people operating it.  Barbara and Gale

<Content>great value London hotels are very expensive but this place is a find and a great value. Location is great- only a few blocks from the Tate gallery (which is free like all other london museums). It's close to everything and the underground is very convenient. The room was small but clean and pleasantly decorated. Breakfast was good and the service was very friendly. This is really a family run hotel with friendly service. Notice the man at front desk has an identical twin brother so you would be forgiven if you mix them up- they are both very nice. I would definitely stay here again -. you would not get broke while visiting London- this Pimlico neighborhood is very nice and unpretentious. Enjoy London.

<Content>A Real Find in London We stayed at the Luna  Simone for a weekend recently based on the reviews here. We were delighted to find out how nice the street it's on is - we felt very safe at night. Pimlico as a nice residential area which has tons of great places to eat and drink - we had breakfast at Grumbles (or Mumbles or something) every morning (nice big breakfast menu) and had drinks in a charming pub called The Page which was light and airy and had a fantastic Thai menu. We preferred a quieter area, as London can be quite manic in some neighbourhoods. The hotel itself is owned by Peter  Bernard, and two nicer lads you'll never meet. We asked for a quiet room and that's exactly what we got - at the back all you could hear were birds. The room was teeny tiny - we burst out laughing when we saw it! But it only took a second to see that it was spotless and had everything we needed. The bathroom wasn't as small as we feared based on the size of the bedroom and my God, you could have eaten your dinner off the surfaces in there! London was in the grip of a heatwave and thankfully there was a massive fan affixed above the headboard of the bed, so that was much appreciated. Complaints: well, not much really, but I suppose breakfast ending at 8.30am is a pain - we simply didn't wake up for it in time once, even though it was included in the price. And you don't get any toiletries other than soap, but I didn't really care about that much as long as the towels were plentiful and fresh every day. Oh yeah, the hairdryer was rubbish, so bring your own if you need one. And the whitener instead of milk was yukky, but in fairness at least there was a kettle in the room, which you don't often get at this level. The best thing was how near Victoria station is - from there you can get to absolutely everywhere so that was unbeatable.

<Content>Loved it Just got back from a one night stay,clean,clean,clean-did I say clean! And very friendly staff,had a good chat with one of them and he was saying they have a huge amount of repeat customers,including me as I'm back again in June.Great breakfast and a nice bonus was each room has its own safe.Terrific and highly recommended and yes the 24 Bus stops right outside and can get you into central London pretty quick.拢60 is a bargain for this place it really is.

<Content>Friendly and good value We stayed at the Luna and Simone on a Saturday night. It is a small family run hotel and the pride in their business shows. Check-in was quick and friendly, and the rooms and public areas are spotlessly clean. The rooms are not huge, but for this price in Central London I don't think you can complain. The breakfast doesn't offer a huge choice. You have to chose between cornflakes or orange juice, then 2 boiled eggs or bacon, egg and beans, and tea or coffee. There is plenty of toast. Not the largest breakfast I've had but nicely cooked and probably more than adequate for the cost. I have certainly paid more for a room without breakfast included.The hotel is situated less than 10mins from Pimlico tube and about 15mins walk from Victoria stattion. The Thames is about 10mins walk away, and within less than 30mins you can walk to Westminster.I would recommend this as a clean, friendly, good value hotel in London. I will certainly use it again.

<Content>Friendliest staff in London! My girlfriend and I stayed at the Luna  Simone in mid March of 2007,and we were expecting a pleasant stay based upon all the wonderful Tripadvisor reviews and a few other guidebook endorsements. Wow! Let me tell you, the reviews only hit upon some of the positive aspects of this hotel; if you're going to London soon, do yourself a favor and try and stay here, this is as close to a sure thing as you can get!When we were walking out of Victoria Station and down Belgrave Avenue(it's less than a 10 minute walk- buy a train pass from Heathrow or Gatwick to Victoria and walk to the hotel, you'll save so much money over a taxi), I was immediately impressed with the very pretty Victoria neighborhood. Most of the buildings have been converted into hotels, but they all have a very quaint and pleasing look to them. We were enthusiastically greeted when we arrived at the hotel, were able to IMMEDITATELY check in, and we were even given a prime balcony room. The room was lovely! The owners have made the most of their budget hotel status and decorated the rooms in warm pastel colors and modern art prints hang on the walls. Our room was fairly SPACIOUSby European standards, the bathroom was very roomy compared to other European budget hotels I've stayed in. The one thing that was probably the most important to both of us was the cleanliness factor-this hotel was ABSOLUTELY SPOTLESS every day we were there, the cleanest and most tidy hotel I've stayed at in Europe or the states!For security purposes, each room has a safe. This one worked better than others I've used before, and it came in quite handy for things like our valuables and passports. The location of the hotel is excellent. If you get a chance to explore some of the side streets around the Pimlico neighborhood, you'll be delighted. It's a very quiet, pristine residential neighborhood, not heavy with touristy trappings, but not alot of noise either, and that's what we were looking for. The hotel is basically right in the middle of two Underground stops, Pimlico and Victoria. Pimlico is probably just a little bit closer...if I have any kind of a slight criticism about the hotel, it might be that if you like subway transportation and intend on using the Tube ALOT like we did, you're going to have to walk about 10 minutes to an Underground station...it would be nice if one was just a little closer, however, it's not that bad, and anyway, the walk to the Pimlico stop is very pretty. Make sure to have breakfast every morning, you're warmly greeted down in the breakfast room upon arrival, and you're given the choice of some pretty good food. Mainly eggs and ham, baked beans, cornflakes, things like that...decent meal to get you going in the morning. You can check your e-mail on a computer which sits right by the stairs to the breakfast room, this came in quite handy when we were checking our flights.Finally, let me just say that the brothers who own the place are two of the nicest gentleman I've ever met! We chatted with them every morning about London stuff, and life in general. We had to leave a day early due to a flight situation, and they were kind enough to refund that night even though they technically didn't have to...very classy gentlemen. London wouldn't have been half as fun had we stayed in a lesser hotel!

<Content>Luna  The family that runs this hotel are very nice people! You will feel welcome (they are very helpful). I stayed in a single room...clean and quiet! The English Breakfast is great, if you stay here, don't miss it! The hotel is a good value for London. London is an expensive city! The hotel is located near Victoria Station (the Tube), an easy 15 minute walk. Bus 24 stops in front of the hotel (goes to Victoria Station, Westminster Abbey (Parliament is across the street), Trafalgar Square, and Leicester Square.My next trip to London, I am definitely staying here again.

<Content>As Great As Expected I stayed at the hotel for 6 nights on my first trip to London and it was a wonderful stay. I was able to check in as soon as I arrived (1 hour before checkout time) and had no problem coming and going as I pleased (lock to the room and the front door are provided for each guest). The #24 bus is right outside which makes all the major tourist spots very easy to get to. The staff are all very friendly and the rooms were spotless. I stayed in a double ensuite and the bathroom was much larger than expected. Great breakfast is served downstairs every morning making it a great way to start your day. A great added plus is the computer with internet provided for all the guest to use free of charge. I will definately stay here again!

<Content>Good but... My boyfriend and I returned from our trip to London and Paris recently. We stayed at the Luna  Simone hotel in London for 5 nights, March 27-April 1. I chose this hotel based on the excellent reviews it has received here and because it is so reasonably priced, especially for London. As the other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel shows pride of ownership. It is very clean, the service pleasant, and the breakfast decent. However, the rooms are tiny, even for London. The bathrooms were no bigger than a postage stamp. I have stayed in London before at several hotels, and this one was the smallest. It was a very pretty bathroom though, and again, very clean. The hotel is quiet, and in a safe neighborhood. However, there is no elevator, and trust me, if you are staying more than a flight up, you will feel the pain of hauling your suitcases up those stairs. This is not a place for the disabled. My main complaint is of no fault to the owners of the hotel. I do not like the neighborhood. It is boring, and not particularly near the main sites. The tube at Victoria Station is a 10 minute walk away. There is a bus (number 24) that stops right outside the hotel, but I could never find the pick up point at Victoria Station. I far prefer the neighborhoods that are closer to the action. I have stayed near Russell Square and in Marlyebone, both of which I prefer. They are near the action at Covent Garden and Soho, but not right in the thick of the madness. So, while I cannot fault the hotel for the service or rooms, which are basic and clean, I will probably stay elsewhere when I return to London.

<Content>If you like nice, this is the place! We just left the Luna Simone this morning after a breakfast of fried egg, bacon, beans, toast, orange juice and coffee. All good and served by the brothers who run the hotel. They are fun and friendly from the word go. Our room was laid out well, like a cruise ship's cabin, and immaculately clean. Convenient--10 minute walk--to Victoria Station. We liked our three night stay very much. The area is well-stocked with pubs and restaurants, and lots of other small hotels, but you really can't beat this one.

<Content>Great stay at the Luna  We stayed in the Luna  Simone hotel (Simone side) March 24th through the 29th. The hotel is just as all the reviews state. The rooms are absolutely spotless. We saw a housekeeper vigorously scrubbing down the shower in another room like it where her own bathroom. The room is somewhat small but gives you a feeling of staying at a friend's house (just as another had posted). The hotel is comfortable and met all our expectations.Luckily, we had a room with a balcony that gave us a nice view of Belgrave road. The French doors to the patio were helpful in cooling the room during late afternoon. (Note: to lock the balcony door, pull the handle up.) We did not notice road noise however; we live within a mile of a major interstate in Texas and may be use to the noise.The breakfast was great (one fried egg, two slices of bacon, beans, toast, hot tea, and orange juice). We heard many people asking for more items and the owners were very accommodating with the request. There were other options but we stuck with the plate above. The owners are on site and quite friendly (actually fun to chat with). The owners are two brothers that look quite similar. They actually serve breakfast to the guests.There is a bus stop literally outside the front door. Also, there is a Sainsbury store about two blocks away that can be used for a low cost dinner. In addition, there is a small convenience store not even a minute's walk away that stays open late.A computer with internet access is available to all guests.Overall, we highly recommend the hotel. The location and service are great. Cleanliness can not be beat.

<Content>Good value..... A need at the last minute to get a room in London for one night  I expected to be parting with at least over 100 pounds for a small box! Anyway the Luna  Simone came up trumps with a single room (shared bath) available the day before. Overall it was clean, pleasant and good value with a few minor problems.The room was very small but room under the bed and in the closet if you had a lot of luggage. The bed (single) was very comfortable with the tv high up on the wall above it making it easy to watch in bed. A small handbasin was useful and there was a hairdryer and tea/coffee making facilities if you needed those. I think there was a safe in the closet. I noticed a fan on the wall above the bed - for the summer. Probably useful as I can imagine the room gets very hot and stuffy. The shared bathroom (shared between 2 rooms I think) was spotless with a toliet and shower. Plenty of hot water and the shower pressure was excellent.Breakfast (in a simple, clean dining room downstairs) was simple but adequate. Choice of cooked breakfast or something else (think it was fruit and yoghurt). It was more than acceptable and not too greasy.Now....the downsidesThe room was located directly next to the other single room (the one I was sharing a bathroom with). It was clearly nothing more than a partition wall between the two. I could hear everything from next door. When I first got into my room I was treated to a very loud mobile phone conversation which was then followed by the tv on such a high volume I couldn't hear my own. I called reception who then called up the occupant - fortunately he seemed quite embarassed (I know because I could hear the conversation!). The tv volume was then nothing more than a background annoyance and other than the slamming of his door (whenever he went out to use the bathroom) which shuddered my room there wasn't much noise at all.The front desk staff could do with being a little more organised. When I turned up (9pm on a Sunday night) the young woman shuffled some papers around and then said there was no reservation for me, that they were full and there was nothing she could do!! I asked her to double check and reminded her that I had actually spoken to her the night before to make the reservation. She found it and said she had been looking at the list for the Simone side rather than the Luna side of the hotel. So, she checked me in gave me my key and off I went tupstairs to my room. Let myself in and was surprised to see a double bed with an ensuite bathroom! A minute later and the phone rings and it is the receptionist telling me she had given me the wrong room on the wrong side of the hotel. Back to reception for a change of keys. No apology just a shrug of the shoulders. I wasn't too impressed though! I assume this was a minor glitch but just gave me the impression of a rather disorganised check in procedure. pleased to report no problems on check out and I was charged the correct amount for my room!Would I stay here again - probably but I wouldn't go for one of the single rooms with shared bath. Not because of the shared bathroom but the lack of a proper wall between the rooms!

<Content>Clean, comfortable and cosy The Luna and Simone was a great little hotel if you want clean, comfortable and affordable accommodation in central London.The rooms were clean and tidy with all basic facilities. The bathrooms looked as though they had been recently refurbished as they were modern and clean. Breakfast was limited in choice but nice. The staff were very friendly. Location - it was within 5 mins of PImlico Tube station and within ten minutes of Victoria station. There are plenty of shops, cafes and bars in the immediate area. Take some ear plugs in case you are in the front of the hotel as the road is very noisy early in the morning.

<Content>Very friendly I stayed at this hotel for one night only as I was visiting my husband who was in hospital at the time.I had read good reviews on Tripadvisor and I must confirm all of these and more. The hotel is great, very welcoming and splotlessly clean. I didn't expect a lot for a single room, but how mistaken was I. I felt as if I was staying in a friend's spare room! It was at the back of the hotel, and very quiet .You would not believe that you were in central London.Even better than the premises itself was the very friendly service I received. I was feeling a bit fragile, not used to travelling alone, but Peter and his brother made me feel so comfortable. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great location for Victoria Station and theatres We stayed here for one night whilst on a weekend to London to see the show Billy Elliot. The hotel is around 10 minutes walk from the station and theatre. The staff were welcoming and friendly and the room spotlessly clean! It is newly refurbished and modern. The bathroom was really nice too. Breakfast is served in a downstairs dining room which is clean and light. The choice of breakfast is simple and is served to your table.Overall the cost of this hotel is very good value for money and I would highly recommend this. There is also an excellent little restaurant round the corner called Grumbles which served a great lunch!

<Content>Excellent hotel Our family of 4 stayed in the quad room the week of March 12, 2007 - very clean room and bathroom, friendly and helpful staff, wonderful service, great breakfast - we loved our stay there. The hotel is close to the Pimlico tube stop on the Victoria line (it seemed closer to us than Victoria station) and was close to some very good restaurants as well. We will definitely stay here again!!

<Content>Excellent stay. My partner and I stayed at the Luna Simone Hotel for 3 nights. Our stay was excellent. The room was clean and basic...with a desk. The breakfast was very good. And free internet is available. The owners and the rest of the staff were very helpful. Every question we asked they were able to help us. In addition, the hotel is in a prime location. Bus 24 stops just outside. We were a little hesitant about navigating the bus and tube system, but found it was very easy. There is a Sainsbury's within easy walking distance if items are needed.We would not hesitate to stay at the Luna Simone again.Cheryl and Dorie

<Content>I'll be staying here again! This hotel has everything going for it: friendly, helpful staff, super clean rooms, great central location. My group of 4 stayed here for an 8 day London visit. We had 2 twin bed rooms which were actually larger than many in a similar price range in the area. (2 of our group had been to London before) The #24 bus stops in front of the hotel and will take you to Victoria Station if you want to skip the walk there. There are grocery stores and many restaurants in the area. I will definitely stay here again!

<Content>Outstanding After seeing the reviews on this site I was very excited about going to this hotel. We had booked this hotel for 2nights as it was my 18th birthday trip and was going with my mum. The hotel is literally just round the corner from victoria station and the tube from paddington takes 2seconds to get to victoria so your not lugging your suit case round streets upon streets!. The hotel is just round the corner and in the area is buckniham palace 5 mins walk away! So your sleeping near the queen lol and as victorias less than 5 minutes walk away you can get on the tube straight away and your off explorin london! The area also has supermarkets resteraunts like indian, chinease, takeaways list is endless! The hotel is a lovely building and when you check in you are welcomed and are able to help yourself to the many guides and leaflets in the hall way. Our room was a long way up!! and we shared a twin with an en suite bathroom. This was spotless and modern you coulden't ask for more! You get tv, cups, clean towels, shower etc and plenty of covers if it gets cold but we were staying when it was very cold and the heating is perfect so no need for that! The rooms are cleaned every day and beds made with towels changed. We never stayed for breakfast as only staying for 2 nights we wanted to get out very early out and around london. I found this hotel to be absoloutly brilliant and you can even keep your luggage there on your depature date to spend more time in london before your train! I loved it completley you can't get better than this and at the price which is very very cheap for this safe neighbourhood! 10 million stars!

<Content>Clean Clean Clean Cannot do anything else except confirm all the comments that have been posted before. However not to confirm the compliments would be to demean the efforts of the owners who obviously work very hard to give their customers a pleasant stay and to show that London isn't all about ripping the customers off.

<Content>A Peaceful Spot in Busy London My wife and I stayed at Luna  Simone for three nights in February 2007. It was an enjoyable stay and I can warmly recommend this hotel! The hotel is well kept and the rooms are modern and clean. The included breakfast is rich of choices and served to the tables! The Pimlico area is peaceful and very central: Only 10 minutes walk from Victoria station. Bus 24 stops outside. We will stay there the next time we come to London.

<Content>Great value, great location, great hotel. I booked the hotel for me and my Girlfriend as an overnight stay on our anniversary when visiting London to see the Lion King. I thought about spending a lot, but seeing as we weren't going to be in the room much, I decided to go for a 'budget' option....Well, this place put most other 'expensive' hotels I've stayed in to shame. Compact double room, but it was spotless. The shower was excellent, which is just what you need after using the underground for several hours over a day. Breakfast was just the ticket - bacon, egg, beans, toast, jam and a pot of tea, just the job!!! All in all, well worthy of such a high position on this website, and all for just 拢70 for the night, absolute steal. A+++++

<Content>Truly a good, reasonable hotel in London My teenage daughter and I have just returned yesterday from a one night's trip to London. I chose the hotel purely on the reviews given on this site.This hotel was an excellent choice. As said by other reviewers, the Luna Simone does not have big rooms - but who cares - as you only sleep there after a day doing the sights. The main thing, as far as I am concerned, is the cleanliness. This hotel is really clean and fresh - from the moment you step through the front door. We had room 10 on the front and even had the window open at night. We don't mind traffic noise and had a good night's sleep.We had a nice breakfast in one of the very clean and stylish basement breakfast rooms. It was not the most interesting breakfast we've ever had, but very nicely cooked egg, beans and bacon, having first had cornflakes and toast.This hotel is close to Victoria and Pimlico underground stations and is in a very select area of London. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a clean, friendly, budget hotel in a nice part of the city.

<Content>Excellent choice My nine year old daughter and myself stayed here from Jan 25 to Feb 1, 2007. We could not have been more pleased with our experience. Our room was spotless and the staff was more than helpful. The breakfast in the morning was very good and was a perfect start to each day. The location of the hotel makes it perfect for site seeing in London or getting anywhere in the city. Its about a 10 minute walk to Victoria Station and the #24 bus stops right outside the door. We will never have to look for another hotel in London. This is our hotel from now on.

<Content>Highly Recommend the Luna Simone We booked this hotel for 7 nights, beginning Jan. 30. Our choice was based on previous reviews, and we weren't disappointed.The room was spotless, the staff was courteous, friendly, and efficient. Breakfast was basic but very decent and the staff were happy to accomodate an adjustment to the offered menu. We were especially happy with the central location - easy walking distance (pulling a suitcase) to Victoria Station. A nice little pub, The Constitution, was just around the corner - but don't count on them to be serving food every night - much to our disappointment because they did make great pub grub. The No. 24 bus, which stops just outside the hotel, was very convenient - and an Oyster Card makes bus and tube travel a breeze.

<Content>The best housekeeping ever Stayed for one night on route to Australia. The room was small but perfectly formed. The standard of housekeeping was excellent. One of the cleanest hotels I have ever seen. We stayed in a double ensuite which suited us perfectly. The shower worked really well plus plenty of hot water.We needed a wake up call and the electonic thingy was broken they happyily sorted us out an analogue clock. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and will certainly stay again.

<Content>close to everything, reasonably priced, wonderful kind helpful owners We arrived with huge heavy bags and Mark ran with them up the stairs, nothing was to difficult for him, it was a very nice welcoming he was so friendly. Mark's Father and Uncle Bernard and Peter identicle twins are the owners of this lovely hotel, and they are equally welcoming, with wonderful personalities.The rooms are very clean, they serve a great breakfast and the showers are good too - A good shower can be hard to find in Europe! The hotel is in a very safe upper class area, and is opposite the bus stop and only 10 min walk to Victoria station.My husband  I will most definately be back, it is a nice place to be. The only down side is there is no lift and plenty of stairs, but they were so helpful it didn't affect us at all.Regards Heidi  Sean

<Content>Fantastic........... The brothers are so helpful and so friendly. The service is fantastic. The room is sufficient and comfy. As we are from singapore, we are not familiar with central heating system, we felt very cold at night. So they were kind enough to lend us a heater in the middle of the night (3am). Thank you so much!They were very accomodating when we had a late flight on Christmas eve and they allowed us to leave our luggage at the counter although they were closing for Christmas. They also arranged for late room cleaning so that we can check out alittle later. Total customer service!The breakfast was great, fresh from the oven when we gave them our choice. There were three or two choices on the menu. The location was fabulous. Within walking distance to Victoria station, to a huge supermarket Sainsbury and a theatre and more......The bus service near the hotel goes all the way into central area. The toilet is super clean. Spotless.......Luna and Simone provided kettle, tv and hair dryer as compared to some 4-star hotel in some europe place which did not. We were pleasantly surprised.Just to inform, there is no lift (all the bed and breakfast there has no lift anyway). Nothing bad to say....... Will absolutely stay there again and again.

<Content>Great Value...Very personable The Luna  Simone is a hotel where ownership is on premise and personaly involved. Twin brothers Peter and Bernard(along with nephew Mark) try and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. They personaly serve the complimentary breakfast and man the front desk area much of the time. Our family of four spent 10 days here in late September, and found the Hotel to be very clean and in a safe area. The Victoria train, bus and tube stop is 10 minutes walk in one direction and the Pimlico tube stop is about 5 minutes in the other direction. The bus stops in front of the Hotel. Plenty of good places to eat and drink close by, as well as an ATM.

<Content>Great price and location I think this is one of the best bargains in London. We stayed here for 5 days in early January. Perfect location for transportation, small restaurants and cafes and in a very safe, nice area. It is a family run hotel and it is quite obvious there is great pride and care in their property. I loved their breakfast. Not only were the owners the breakfast hosts, but they also did all the cooking. Even though there wasn't a mini bar in the room, my husband needed some medicine refrigerated and the front desk put the medicine in their small fridge. They really cared about their customers.Nice touches: tea making facilities in room, a computer with high speed access in the lobby, nice shower with hot high pressured water, fast home cooked breafast, very good tea and coffee at breakfast.Things that might matter to some people, but didn't matter to us: No elevator, no shampoo or fancy soaps in room, limited breakfast menu.Thank you Peter, Bernard  Staff. You are the best!

<Content>A Gem! Stayed for one night in November as part of a two night stay, wish we had stayed both nights! Bernard and Peter were great entertainment and the family as a whole were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. The rooms were spotless, yes small but all you need is somewhere to rest after a long day. I will stay here whenever I am in London in future and will recommend it to all my friends.

<Content>Could not have been a better experience This was our third trip to London. We picked the Luna  Simone based on these Tripadvisor reviews. Might have been one of the best travel decisions we ever made. Everything good that you will read in the reviews is true. Do not let the rare criticism scare you away! We lucked out and got one of the front rooms with a small balcony. Don't be afraid to ask. Street noise was not a problem. Sure the breakfast menu says orange juice OR cereal, but if you ask, they'll bring you both. These are truly accommodating folks. Scramble the eggs, skip the beans, go vegetarian. I never saw them refuse a request. The room may be relatively small, but you are not going to London to sit around in a hotel room. It is very clean; so's the bath. There are extra baths in the hall which were remarkably convenient. Wireless internet is available on the lower floors and a public computer is available in a small room off the hall on the Simone side. The Pimlico tube is closer than Victoria, but the convenience of the #24 bus can't be beat, especially if you buy an unlimited travel card. You can literally catch the bus in front of the hotel to take you to the tube stop. A really good traditional pub, the Constitution (I believe) is right around the corner -- as is a better than average Thai restaurant. An ATM is just a block and a half away. Ask at the desk. They are very helpful, agreeable people. All the great things we saw and did in London, but what we most want to share with our friends is our discovery of the Luna  Simone.

<Content>Good value for money It's in a good postion (near the tube, Tate and with a bus-stop into central London right outside) and good value for London.Does exactly what it says on the tin; the rooms are not flash but clean with en-suite bathrooms, and although the breakfast won't win Michellin stars, it comes quickly and with friendly staff.Don't go expecting a luxury hotel; it's not, and doesn't pretend to be. It is a good value, clean, friendly basic hotel in a very convenient position.

<Content>The "value for money" hotel A very good hotel not too far from the City. It's just 7-8 mins walk from the PIMLICO tube station or 15 from the VICTORIA rail and tube station. Also, it has the bus 24 stop just in the front, very useful at night time beacuse it is also a night bus.The hotel is divided into two parts, the Luna and the Simone sides.It was full in the period I stayed there but it seemed to be empty because of it's insonorisation.The staff was gentle, the rooms were spacious and the private bathroom too, with a large shower and hair-dryer provided.The breakfast is served toooo early, from 7 to 8:30 only, and it's a bit poor: you can just choice between few dishes a la carte, the same ones day by day. The bacon wasn't so great...

<Content>Excellent Hotel and location Excellent Hotel and location, only 10 mins from Pimlico tube station. Glad we checked out Trip Advisor site before going to London and paying lots more money for a Hotel that would not have matched up to Luna  Simone!Any time we go to London we will be using this great Hotel.

<Content>Loved it all! We returned from a short stay in London at the Luna  Simone and we were thrilled with this property, except for 2 small incidents (no fault of the owner's). The rooms are small (as is all London hotels), but impeciably clean and tidy. The beds are comfortable and well kept. The staff is very welcoming and warm. They serve a delicious English breakfast and are adaptable to some finicky tastes.As for the 2 incidents, we were awaken by a fellow guest who was locked out of their room and had returned late to a sleeping partner. After a quick call to the front desk, it was resolved. Fellow travellers need to refrain from smoking in the non-smoking rooms! Our room reeked of cigar smoke for a day until we mentioned this to the staff and they took care of it right away!I would stay at this property again. The neighborhood is safe and well-kept. It is central to downtown London and the tube is within easy walking distance. The bus drops right in front of the door. They welcome children and the staff is delightful.

<Content>The reviews are right...super place! Stayed for 4 nights in early November - as the reviews say its very clean, the staff are helpful and the brothers and family members who run it are cheerful and can provide plenty of useful information.Breakfast is fine and there are tea/coffee facilities in the room.OK - rooms are not huge but you're not paying Ritz prices - as a cheap base from which to explore London I've not seen anything better at the price - if you HAVE - let me know please!Highly recommended.Bernard Lewis

<Content>Excellent location and direct bus no 24 to Theatreland was an unexpected bonus Stayed here 29/11 after seeing the reviews here and was not disappointed. In fact the what we did not realise is that the no 24 bus stopped outside the door in both directions and we used it to to see the show Mamma Mia. Had a ground floor room which was at street level and there was no noise. Bathrooms and communal areas all spotless and free internet! A lovely area and good breakfast included and I will definitely be staying again.

<Content>Decent Hotel The bus stop in front of the hotel is great, but the tube is a good 15 minutes walk. The room was VERY small and the bathroom was even smaller, although the shower was decent sized. The floor sloped from one side of the room to the other, and the bed did too. It was quiet, clean and the breakfast was very good. We would choose another place next time.

<Content>Convenient with friendly staff Just returned from London 11/27 and found the Luna Simone to be incredibly convenient (to the Victoria Tube Station). The rooms are small and basic, but VERY clean and the staff extremely cheerful and always willing to answer questions. Would advise senior or health-impaired guests to request a 1st floor room. The walk up the stairs with (or without) luggage was a workout! Also...bring soap-the bars supplied by the hotel are the tiniest we've ever seen. The neighborhood is safe to walk, day or night. You can't really sleep in as breakfast is only served from 7-8:30 am, so even if you attempt to sleep later, you can hear other rooms emptying at the same time for early breakfast.

<Content>Defenitely Lives Up To Its Reputation All hotels could learn a thing or two from the Luna  Simone. If I'm ever in London again, I know where I'm staying.Armed with written directions from Victoria Station we arrived in London to the quintessential London downpour. Headed out into the wet, juggling umbrella and luggage (my daughter carrying more than usual having just spent a year abroad). Even though it was a short walk, we were soaked and unhappy by the time we got to the hotel. Once there things brightened significantly. Having been informed that our room was on the 4th floor (no lift and 72 step up, I counted) the staff were very quick to agree to carry our luggage and they let us know that upon check-out they'd be happy to bring it back down again!!Things just got better from here. The brothers who own the hotel are a delight. They are in every a.m. to serve breakfast creating a friendly lively atmosphere. Feels like a comfy BB, not a hotel with about 30 rooms.They said it was all redecorated about 5 years ago but is still fresh and new. Our room was small, but functioned perfectly. The tiled bathroom was great with toilet, sink and shower.

<Content>So Friendly! The Luna and Simone is in an excellent location and is priced very well, but what puts it over the top is the friendly and cheerful staff. They are eager to make you feel welcome and will do anything in their power to make your stay as comfy as they can.We traveled with our children ages 7 and 9 to explore London for four days. Our family room was equipped with a tea service, hair dryer, a double bed for mom and dad and two single beds. At breakfast, the kids balked at the choice of eggs, bacon, and toast. Luckily, the Luna and Simone kitchen is equipped with a secret stash of Cocoa Pops for picky kids! (we grown-ups thought the breakfast was lovely).The rooms are super clean and fresh, though they may not win any decorating awards. There is free wireless internet access, you watch a short commercial and are granted onto the network from there. When we visit London again in the summertime we will absolutely stay here again.

<Content>So Many Good Things ... We just returned last night from our second trip to London. The Luna  Simone Hotel was a great experience.We love Belgravia and stayed there last year (in another hotel), so the neighborhood felt like home. The room was very nice, although not overly large, which we expected. However, it was roomy enough for our purposes and both the room and the bath were immaculate. The bath was fine, with a roomy shower and lots of hot water in the morning.Peter and Bernard and staff are welcoming and friendly and ready to answer any questions, no matter how small. I had requested a room on a lower floor due to some slight mobility problems on my part, and my request was noted in the reservation and we were put into Room 2, at the back of the hotel. Very quiet.Breakfast each day was hot and filling and served very quickly. The breakfast choices were fine with us and the coffee was hot, strong and delicious! (That's important for us -- we're morning coffee people and it helps us get started on the day).Bus 24 stops right outside the hotel and can take you to many of the places you will probably want to go. Excellent restaurants just steps away, Boots just around the corner and Victoria/Pimlico stations a few minutes walk away.BUT ... there was one thing that we didn't find enjoyable. The beds were VERY hard. Not just firm, but hard. This being our first experience with the hotel, we weren't sure if all the beds were this way, but the twin beds in our room were on the verge of being uncomfortable. However, we enjoyed the hotel so much in other respects that we actually contemplated bringing an inflatable mattress on the next trip. More comfortable beds would have made the stay a 10 instead of a 9.All in all, our experience here was positive and I can recommend the hotel without reservation. This may be the best value in London.You will not be treated nicer in any other establishment, and that is something we are sure of.

<Content>Good hotel for the money, good area, but bed was hard. Since we usually have an early flight out of Gatwick, I like to have a hotel close to Victoria Station. I chose the Luna  Simone hotel this time based on the reviews on this site. All of the hotels on Belgrave street are the same in that they are in older buildings without lifts, we expected that. Also, the bathrooms are often small. We had no problem, but a 'plus size' person might have had difficulty. Everything was just as the other reviewers have said, the only criticism we would have is that the bed was pretty hard. The staff are all very nice and helpful. When we were cold (the heat is on a timer and not always on) they brought up a little space heater.

<Content>Echoing the Cheers! What can I say? I can only repeat the wonderful comments that have been uttered by previous visitors to this friendly, cozy, and very centrally located BB! The staff are warm and wonderful. My friend and I had both forgotten to bring alarm clocks, but were happily lent the use of one during our stay. The breakfasts are hearty and good, as is their coffee (the latter something I found a bit of a challenge finding in other spots in London!).The lodging itself is in a fantastic location - beautiful street and only about a 10 min. walk to Victoria Station.Both my friend and I agreed - we would not hesitate to recommend the Luna  Simone to anyone who is planning a visit to London....I will definitely be staying there on my next trip!

<Content>Nice place, great location I stayed at the Luna for 4 nights in the spring, and it was pretty good. My room was facing the street, so it was a bit noisy, but that was somewhat to be expected. Everything was quite comfortable and very clean. My only complaint would be that I had specifically requested a 1st floor room because I'd recently injured my knee. When I arrived, I was upgraded to a larger room that was on the 4th floor! They didn't have anything closer to the ground available, so I made do.

<Content>Perfect Location This hotel is located in a very up market location in London which is only a couple of blocks from Victoria Station. It is very reasonably priced for being very close to the heart of London. The rooms a very small but they are clean and you dont spend much time in them anyway. The bathroom we had was very new and again small but that was not a real problem. Breakfasts were very good and the owners very accommodating if you wanted something slightly different then the menu. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The only thing I can say is that if you are traveling with a lot of luggage prearrange for a room on the lower floors. We had over 50 kilos in two suitcases and my husband had to lug it up 8 flights of narrow stairs to the fourth floor. There is no elevator. However, you couldnt ask for a better location and such reasonable rates which included breakfast. We walked to Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square and the British Museum which is close to the entertainment district. It was a lengthy walk but not too ridiculous. I highly recommend this hotel if you are not looking for luxury but just a good quality value for money place to stay.

<Content>A gem My best firend and I chose to stay at this hotel for a girly weekend in the city after reading the fab reviews on this site. We weren't disappointed. For the 拢65 we paid for the room we got a lovely bright twin bedded room which looked freshly decorated, with a bathroom better than many of the so caled four star hotels I have stayed in in London. We got a complimenatry cooked to order breakfast which kept us going until afternoon tea. We got friendly service, from smiling staff - also rare in all but the priciest hotels. We got a bus into the city right outside, and a ten minute walk from Victoria station. We got a fantastic cheap and cheerful Italian restaurant (O solo mio) a few doors down the road - great for a post theatre meal. I was a little put off by the powdered milk in the room, but actually, it tasted no worse than the horrible 'tastes like mik' stuff you often get in hotels. My only real criticism, which could bother some people was that our twin beds were on castors and proceeded to fly half way across the room if you happened to bump into them. You could pay an extra 拢100 per night, without breakfast and perhaps rectify this, but I doubt it would make a notable improvement to your stay in London. A big thanks to all you trip advisor reviewers who make it easier to find a lovely little hotel like this, when there are so many bad examples in the city. And thanks to the owners who bother to go the extra mile and do things properly (without expecting big bucks) when it is so easy to follow the bad example of those around.

<Content>What a gem! Just got back from a three night stay in this lovely little hotel. The hotel is spotlessly clean, the staff friendly and the breakfast excellent. This is the only small BB hotel I have ever stayed in that cleans the rooms and changes the towels every day. The staff could not have been more helpful, even carrying our suitcases down the stairs for us and looking after them after we had checked out.The road the hotel is on is surprisingly quiet considering how close it is from Victoria station (about a 10 minute walk), yet very convenient for buses or taxis to all the tourist hotspots. There are numerous buses that run past the front door if you don't want to walk to Victoria station.Yes, the rooms aren't the biggest but this is more than made up for by the cleanliness and friendly staff.The only downside is no fridge in the room so they give you powdered milk for your tea. However, we were allowed to bring a small jug of milk up to our room from breaksfast so problem solved! Some friends stayed in a hotel close by which cost a lot more money and was no where near as good as this hotel. I don't know how they do it so well at such a good price.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone on a break to London as it is excellent value for money

<Content>A great find! We chose this hotel for a very short weekend in London (late Friday night til early Sunday morning) . We got a good rate and the staff were lovely. The emailed us back very promptly to confirm our booking, check-in was a breeze and they even got my son's favourite cereal for him on the second morning (after checking with him on the first day which one he preferred). I think the best thing is that it's a family run hotel and you get great personal service.We had to move rooms after the first night which we knew about beforehand as they had emailed us before taking our booking to make sure we didn't mind. We left our bags in the room, went out for the day and when we came back, everything had already been taken care of.We were in the basement both nights but it was handy because it was right beside the breakfast room and there was only one flight of stairs to negotiate when coming or going. On the second night, we were in a room that has little french doors out onto a courtyard area which was lovely if you fancied a bit of fresh air.Our room and the breakfast room were spotless and the hotel was in a very nice area. We walked from Victoria Coach station at about 10.30pm and felt safe.For the price, you get a very clean room, a decent breakfast, great personal service and it's close to transport links. I'll definitely be staying here again.

<Content>Great place to stay My husband and I only had one night to stay in London before continuing on to Italy. But I still spent a long time researching a hotel that would be convenient and affordable. The comments about this hotel that I read on Trip Advisor convinced me to give it a try and I wasn't disappointed. We took the Gatwick Express into Victoria Station and quickly found the hotel. We met Peter and Bernard and instantly liked them. How could you not? They were so friendly and helpful, giving us suggestions on pubs close by, etc. We were early, but they put us into a room right away so that we could put our luggage down and head back out again.The room we had was on the ground floor and had a window that looked out onto Belgrave Road. The room was small by American standards, but you have to expect that if you are traveling to Europe. The bathroom was large enough for us and both the bedroom and bathroom were spotless. Even though the street was so close, we had no problem with noise. We had to leave very early the next morning to get to Victoria Station. It takes about ten minutes to walk to the station. And even though it was 5 a.m., we felt very safe. Because we left early, we cannot vouch for the breakfast. All in all, I really enjoyed this hotel's location and it's owners. We will stay again and would certainly recommend this hotel to our friends.

<Content>Basic but comfortable We stayed in a triple room with our daughter. No views as it is in the basement and none of the extras that you get in many hotels outside of London, but the room was clean and comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel is well located near two tube stations and a short walk to the Tate Britain and the Thames. Breakfast was basic and finishes early so be careful - we missed it on the first morning, but were offered coffee and toast!I would be happy to recommend this hotel as an alternative to the basic chains that charge a similar amount but are a bit souless!

<Content>location location !!! stayed 4 nights here with my wife in Sept. Great location for the price, 5 min walk to Victoria bus (london sightseeing buses operate from here) or train station, bus at door, or lesiurely stroll 20 - 30 minutes to major attractions. Front desk staff very helpful. Room was clean and reasonable size for London. Breakfast was great and well organised. Lots of restuarants, pubs and laundromats within a 5 minute radius. Can't fault this establishment and you wont find better value elsewhere for this location and service.

<Content>What a place! I should lie, and tell you all that this is a terrible place, but after the wonderful experience I had here, I could not do that to Peter, Bernard and the rest of the wonderful people here. My room was a double, on the top floor. It was bright and cheerful, larger than the rooms I had previously stayed in while in London. The free breakfast was filling and tasty, even if I do find baked beans with breakfast to be a bit odd, but hey, when in Rome.....The bathroom was smaller than what I get here in the States, but at least it didn't seem like it had been shoehorned into the room. The water pressure was great, and I never had a problem with either drainage or hot water (I've run into this problem at more than one hotel in London).What really sets this place apart from the other places I have stayed is the staff. I did not feel like I was in a hotel, but like I was staying with old friends. They seem to know where everything is, and can get you set up for your voyage by telling you how to get there on public transport, or getting a cab for you if needed. Peter and Bernard were in the breakfast room every morning, chatting with all of the guests. The only thing that would have made the place better was a lift, but hey, walking up the stairs helped me work off that breakfast!The place is about equidistant between the Victoria and Pimlico Tube stations, so I would suggest, if you are on the tube, to come from the Pimlico Station instead. It's not nearly as hectic as Victoria.I will definitely be staying here again on my next trip into London.

<Content>Great value  I stayed in this Hotel twice in the month of October and it certainly lived up to all the reviews that I had read.The rooms were clean and adequate in size considering the you are really only there to sleep. Tea  coffee making facilities are also a plus. Not to mention the staff who are very helpful - on one occasion I was in a room on the 4th floor and the guy on reception carried my bag up for me. Breakfast is excellent - the only comment is that it does finish a little early.The only down side is if you have a room on the Belgrave Road side there can be a bit of traffic noise until around 11.00pm.Would certainly stay there again on my next visit to London

<Content>A Genuine London Experience Date: October, 2006D. LoCicero, Allentown, PAMy wife and another couple stayed at the Luna Simone for six nights this fall, and found it to be a delightful experience. In addition to the reasonable rates, the hotel exuded charm. The location is excellent and the the twin brothers who run the Luna Simone make one feel completely at home there. Should we go to London again, we will definitely stay at the Luna Simone.

<Content>A real find I had read the tripadvisor reviews, thought that this hotel could not be as good as it sounded for the prices charged 鈥?have to say it was so much better than anticipated.Location: ideal for Victoria or Pimlico tube, bus stop outside, excellent for our visit to Apollo Theatre, some lovely restaurants nearby that are open after shows have finished.Rooms: were basic but had everything we needed, tea and coffee facilities, tv, en-suite with large shower, safe, extra pillows, comfy bed, hair dryer and plenty of plug points.Breakfast:: cooked to order, hot and tastyHotel in general: Spotless throughout, the friendliest (but not intrusive) staff I have ever encountered.Can鈥檛 recommend highly enough 鈥?I will definitely stay here on any more trips to London

<Content>What a Find!!!! This is a great boutique hotel/guest house in Victoria Station area (great location/central).Small very clean rooms with ensuires  large showers. All newly re-modeled. Has coffee, safe and yes even Internet. Close by is a laundrymat, bus and tube station (all the things a traveller needs). Ask for a room with a balcony.Twin brothers (no you aren't seeing double) and family (hosts) are entertaining and informative. Breakfast was plain but delicious (cereal/juice/egg  bacon) and tea  coffee.Highly recommend as has everything including decent price for area.

<Content>Great Place To Stay Flew in from the states - they checked us in early. Staff was so friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean, bathroom was large and the towels soft. Free internet access a plus. Breakfast was made to order. Location was close to Victoria Station - bus stop accross the street for easy site seeing access. Would definitely recommend to all.

<Content>What a charming delight! I have always trusted the reviews of TripAdvisor for my travels, and had used the site for my recent trip to London. As always, I was not steered wrong- if ever there was a hotel that really made one feel at home, Luna and Simone would be it. I had originally booked the wrong type of room for my stay, and the hoteliers went out of their way to accommodate my request. I could not have asked for more helpful, congenial and friendly service! The rooms were immaculate, and the breakfast hit the spot. Indeed, the next time I visit London, I will be sure to stop off and visit the wonderful people at Luna and Simone.

<Content>Can't recommend highly enough This hotel is just wonderful.The staff are so helpful, you feel like familyThe rooms are clean and spacious, the towels are soft (quite a rarity in a hotel nowadays), the breakfast is superb.What really made our trip was the owners, Archie  Bernie, who were just so friendly and entertaining.The location of the hotel is ideal for Victoria station and for sightseeing in London as the no 24 bus stops right outside the door.Free internet access too.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London for any lenght of time.

<Content>Great location for touring London Stayed at Luna and Simone in September, 2006 and could have not chosen a better hotel for location and the service. We took several Grey Line Tours and easily walked to their pickup location from the Luna and Simone. Even though you can't beat the location, what we liked the most was the friendly attitude of the staff - they're great! London is a wonderful city, and the people at this hotel make you feel really welcome. We did have rooms on the fourth floor, but the walk is good for you! The rooms are a little small, but vey clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>A Gem for the Budget Traveller I was halfway to the airport when I realized that I left my passport and $1000 in a pouch hanging from a hook in my room at the Luna  Simone Hotel. A quick call to Mark at the front desk relieved my anxiety when he quickly recovered the pouch and kept it at the front desk for me. Mark was also helpful with tour and travel information.Now for the hotel, itself. The room, though small, was spotlessly clean. This is a hotel for a budget traveller who is interested in sightseeing all day and returning to his or her room for a good hot shower and a night sleep in a comfortable bed. Before retiring, there is free internet access so that you can catch up on your e-mail.In the morning, you are sent off with a hot breakfast for your hard day of sight seeing.The hotel is conveniently located near Victoria Station where you can purchase a daily travel pass and ride to all points around London. The bus depot is also nearby so it is easy to obtain transportation to Stratford upon Avon and other points out of town.You can step out of the hotel and get the #24 bus for points around London including Trafalgar Square and Picadilly Circus where you can get those half-price play tickets.If you really want to save , you can catch the underground at Heathrow and with one train change ( right across the platform ), wind up in Victoria Station in about an hour. The walk to Lunar  Simone is ten minutes which was quite manageable for a 68 year old man with one piece of rolling luggage and a small carryon backpack. The cost of the trip, was 4 pounds, no cabs needed.If you read this, Mark, thank you for your help in making my London visit most enjoyable.Bill Messina

<Content>A Gem in a Superb Location Stayed at the Luna  Simone for a week in Sep/Oct, 2006. Room and amenities were modern, clean and bigger than expected. Breakfasts were fantastic. The extras were appreciated (free internet access, safe in room, tea/coffee/jug, hairdryer). Location is second to none, with many attractions within walking distance and public transport very close. BUT...what sets this hotel apart from the rest is the service...that intangible something that cannot be contrived, but comes naturally to the owners Bernard and Peter. They were friendly and courteous without being intrusive and they went out of their way to help two first time visitors to London. We look forward to our next trip and we will definitely stay at the Luna  Simone again. Cannot recommend it highly enough.

<Content>Very Welcoming! After a long overseas flight from the U.S., it was a very easy location to find within walking distance from Victoria Station. Upon arrival, the owners realizing we were tired, immediately got us to the room without officially checking in. How often does that ever happen! They had a great sense of humor and were very hospitable. The hotel was also within walking distance of many sights including Westminister Abbey, the theatre and some great Indian restaurants. I highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Good value, good location, nice hospitality Given the number of reviews for this hotel, it looks like most of its visitors are big TripAdvisor fans.We enjoyed the hotel, but I think its overall TripAdvisor rating is a little misleading.We paid 80 GBP for a one night weekend stay in late September.LOCATIONThe hotel is located within walking distance of the Victoria station and Pimlico subway stops. This makes it convenient for anyone who is flying into any London airport, since they all seem to have bus or train connections to Victoria. The hotel is a 10 minute walk to Victoria station down a single road. It is in a nice area of town with Victorian architecture. There are many hotels next to Luna  Simone that occupy similar looking Victorian buildings.SERVICEThe front desk staff was very friendly and efficient. Let me just say that I'm the type of traveler who is a little uncomfortable with service that is too personal. I didn't see the owners during my visit so I can't comment on all the positive comments about their service. I'm the type of traveler who is perfectly fine with competent, friendly staff, so the service level as described in other reviews wouldn't be that important to me.Note there is no elevator in the building, so visitors with a lot of luggage should be ready for some exercise.ROOMSOur room was a nice, clean, three-star quality room. It was average size for European standards. Our room had twin beds that were of average comfort. Extra pillows were available in the room. A fairly small TV was mounted high on the wall.There was no A/C in the room. This wasn't a problem given that our room was high enough to get a nice breeze. However, having the window open made traffic noise a bit of an issue. There isn't double-glazing on the windows (nice in a way, since it keeps the Victorian feel), so you can hear a little noise even with the window closed. You might want to request a room without a street view if you aren't a heavy sleeper.The bathroom was clean and nice. The shower was a bit small.INTERNETI believe Wifi is available on the lower floors of the hotel. But if you don't want to bring your own computer, there is a handy PC station in a private room on the first floor. It has free high-speed internet access. I think it was available from 7 am until 11 pm.BREAKFASTWe did not eat the breakfast that has been raved about here. Given that it lasts only until 8:30 am, it might be a little inconvenient for people who want to enjoy the London nightlife the night prior. Breakfast is located in a quaint room in the basement.SUMMARYWe felt the hotel was a pretty good value at 80 GBP. It does feel like a personal, local hotel (it is family-owned), so travelers who like that feeling should enjoy Luna  Simone. Its rooms are basic and its amenities are simple; its high overall rating is due to the service level of its owners and the good comparable value for a hotel in its location. We probably would not stay here again as we felt there was nothing remarkable about the hotel (again, remarkable service isn't that important to us), but the decent price and central location made it a good choice for us.

<Content>Pretty Good Value for London Initially, I was put in the basement, right by the breakfast room, which was noisy. The out-of-date decor was also a bit of a let-down. However, when I asked to change to another room, the warm, family atmosphere of the place became apparant. They were eager to help: they happily changed my room to another on the second floor which was still small and not very modern but spotlessly clean and quiet. I was very impressed with their attentiveness, which was always evident in the morning at breakfast. When they realized that I don't eat meat, they suggested all sorts of alternatives and were absolutely wonderful. Given London's very expensive and often dismal accomodations, this place is clean, very friendly, and very conveniently located (10 mins from Victoria station). I recommend it and would consider staying there again myself.

<Content>Little gem If you don't need spacious luxury but are satisfied with clean, basic and inexpensive, you won't be disappointed with the Luna and Simone Hotel. On a recommendation from another hotel that didn't have rooms available, I booked several nights for my sister and me after reading raves on Tripadvisor. We were not disapppointed. We had two single rooms and a shared bath. The rooms were very tiny, not much bigger than a walk-in closet, but they included a sink, a TV, a hairdryer and enough closet and storage space that we managed ok. The double room we saw was roomier. We would definitely go back to this hotel again for several reasons. It was very clean. The shower and bathroom tiles gleamed and the rooms showed little signs of wear and were kept very clean, also. The breakfast room gleamed as well. The entire hotel looked as if it had been redone in recent years. It was very quiet; there was almost no noise to bother us from others staying there, just the occasional opening or closing of a door, and it was full every night. They have free internet service.We found the staff to be outstanding in their friendliness and helpfulness. After making our initial reservation, we had to make a change in the dates which caused some complications. The staff corresponded with me frequently until we got things worked out, never expressing a moment's irritation or impatience. They were so welcoming upon our arrival that we felt we were staying with friends. After two nights in Paris we returned to find the suitcases we had left with them already in our rooms waiting for us. They were interested in our plans for the day and were eager to offer advise or assistance with any of them including booking a taxi to the airport for 5:45 a.m. At breakfast they made sure we had plenty to eat and offered other choices to be sure we were satisfied.And finally, the price was reasonable for London and the hotel's location not far from Victoria Station about half-way between two tube stations and on a bus route. We were sad to leave and look forward to staying there, again, in the future.

<Content>Everything it promises to be ... Location and surrounding neighbourhood was great! Near to cafe's, bars and markets ... easy stroll to victoria tube station. Check-in was fast and courteous. Our room was on the 3rd floor and had a large window and lovely clean bathroom ... I felt very comfortable staying here and would do so again!

<Content>No kidding, this place is the best. Everytime we visit a city in Europe, the first thing we always do is get lost looking for the hotel. But the website from the Luna  Simone had detailed directions from the airport right to their door which we really appreciated. Obviously they've listened to what most people want and have acted on it. Our room here was spotless and larger than most European hotel rooms we're used to and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfasts were also very good with a nice selection of cold and hot dishes. But most of all the staff treated us like visiting dignitaries rather than just another hotel guest. They took the time to answer all our questions and really wanted us to feel at home here. We left the hotel knowing that we'd stay here again without a doubt the next time we're in London.

<Content>Wonderful and then some My husband and I stayed at the Luna and Simone from Sept. 5-Sept 13. I booked the hotel based on the other reviews at Trip Advisor. Let me just say that they were so right! This place was wonderful; the staff was very friendly and kind. The room was nice and comfortable. The location was safe and close to the things you need for a good vacation. We were in room 4 on the Simone side. It was fairly big (for UK standards) and while our window faced the street, the noise from the cars and such never really bothered us. There is no A/C but a nice big window and a fan over the bed was all we needed to stay cool. The room also comes with a vault, which you set the code for... a nice touch and a good place to keep your valuables. The closet had enough room for our clothes and we could even hide away one of our suitcases.The shower in the room was amazing. Heck I wanted to pack it up and bring it home. It was nice sized, with GREAT water pressure. The bathroom was always clean and fresh towels were left every day. (though bring your own wash cloth... they don't provide those)The breakfast in the morning was a wonderful way to start the day, the menu is set, but it's very good. and if you find you don't like the beans (I didn't, my husband did) just ask them to leave them off (I didn't though, I just let the hubby eat them :) ) It really helped save money; we ate breakfast and then dinner...The neighborhood was wonderful and posh. It's very safe and comfortable to walk around in. You are surrounded by restaurants (curry, Italian, pubs, pastry shops). We HIGHLY recommend Marquis of Westminster... two blocks up (toward Victoria station) on the corner. The owner, Chris, just redid the place. The food was great, I mean great (try the burger or the chicken and leek pie... i tried to get the recipie from him to bring home...), and the mood was relaxed and comfortable, even for a non local. Plus it's so close to the hotel, that if you have a long night at the pub, it's not a far stumble home.The tube stops close by are Victoria (much larger and in the middle of basically a mall) and Pimlico. Pimlico is closer by a block or two but only has the Victoria line running through it. Victoria Station has the Victoria line as well as District and Circle lines. This was very helpful because just about every good tourist stop is on the district or circle line.To sum up: this hotel is amazing for the very low price, especially when you see how much a flat in the area rents for. It was always clean, the breakfast was very good and the location was dang near perfect. We will never stay at any other hotel in London again.

<Content>A wonderful hotel I occasionally go to London for work purposes and although I enjoy the stay, as a female travelling alone I have never really felt completely safe and have always felt a little uncomfortable even in expensive hotels. Until now that is. I recently stayed at the Luna  Simone and as well as the hotel being absolutely spotless (and believe me I am fussy), the welcome I received after a long journey made me feel that the staff were genuinely pleased to see me.Breakfast was ok and when I told the member of staff that I did not want a cooked breakfast I was offered several alternatives.Pimlico is only a couple of minutes walk away and there were plenty of cafes/restaurants and I felt completely comfortable going out on my own. The Kazan Restaurant was particularly good and staff were very polite and friendly. I spoke to Peter and Bernard on a couple of occasions and they were extremely helpful and a fountain of knowledge. Checking out was easy and efficient and the atmosphere and friendliness of the hotel makes me have no reservations about recommending it . I will certainly be returning.

<Content>Couldn't see what the fuss is about We stayed here one night booked on the basis of the reviews here. Whilst the room was clean and bedroom comfortable (though tiny as expected), we have stayed in much better accommodation for less than the 80 pounds LS charged (eg. Darlington Hyde Park 3 weeks earlier). Additionally the breakfast selection was limited to certain combinations that they wanted you to have (you could have cornflakes OR orange juice but not both!). So all up, sure it's ok, but its placing in the top ten of all London hotels is a little puzzling. Can't fault the friendly staff though.

<Content>Nice and tidy The staff was friendly and the room was very clean. We came a bit early so they let us leave the luggage behind the reception.The rooms was 4th floor so the stairs are not for the weak but we knew that in advance. The rate is pricy in european standard but quite fair London standard. Everything within walking distance.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel We chose this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews and were not at all disappointed. The facilities were exactly as described elsewhere. We had a triple room in the basement. The beds are quite firm but was not a problem for us. I found the room to be a good size and the bathroom to be both clean and roomy. As others have mentioned the breakfast is early but tasty and made to order. My 4-year old daughter was especially pleased with the hot chocolate! If you do have a problem with the room, the owners are more than happy to fix it -- you just need to tell them. The surrounding area is also very good for cafes, grocery stores and restaurants. We ate at Sole Mio and thought it was quite good and the servings generous (2 pizzas were more than enough for the 3 of us). Overall a very positive experience. We would definately stay there again.

<Content>Perfect London Hotel My partner and I stayed at the Luna Simone in August. Best part about the Hotel is it's proximity to Victoria Station and London CBD where all the major tourist sites are. Other hotels in the area are much more expensive than the Luna Simone + you get a breakfast included every morning which is just perfect for a big day touring London. The staff are really friendly and by the end of our week at the Hotel we were really impressed with the hospitality of the staff. One other thing we really liked was the area the Hotel is located, it is a nicer part of London and fairly quite at night, yet minutes away from the hustle and bustle of the CBD - nice combination. If I could find any criticism at all it would be the size of the rooms - they are small and so is the bathroom, but saying that, both are functional and spotlessly clean. If you after a very reasonably priced hotel with breakfast included, close to London tourist sites and located in a safe area with really friendly staff, you would be crazy to look anywhere else.

<Content>Enjoyed Our Stay My wife, 6-year old son and I stayed here on the last 2 nites of a 2 week vacation in England. After arriving at Victoria Station and making the trek (four blocks) to the hotel, we were welcomed by Benard. We stayed in the room downstairs with 3 single beds. The dining room is located on the same level, but any noise during the a.m. breakfast hour was barely audible due to a glass door separating the two rooms. Although the room had its own bathroom, there was also a toilet outside of the room which we found handy and convenient. The room was small, but clean and comfortable. The beds were firm and comfortable. We appreciated the in-room safe. The bathroom was tight, but usable. The shower worked well with good pressure and plenty of hot water. Fortunately, we did not have to use the fan (and forgo any A/C) because the heat wave had passed so the temperature in the room was comfortable. There were 2 chairs in the room, but we often sat on the bed. The only criticism that I have about our room is that the channels on the television were very limited and the tv reception was spotty. But then again, we didn't spend a lot of time in the room. Loved the neighborhood and all that it offered - many restaurants, markets, coffee shops, etc. We had a very tasty dinner at the indian restaurant recommended by the hotel. We would have ate at Sole Mio, but it was closed on Sunday so we ate at a nearby italian restaurant. Benard and Peter were great and made a supreme effort to make our stay enjoyable. At breakfast, they both competed to serve my son the best hot cocoa in the morning. I'm glad my son didn't take sides. We would definitely stay here again. The value, service and convenience simply can't be beat. We look forward to returning again.

<Author>Dave49
<Content>Great Family Hotel We were returning from Nairobi, Kenya from seven weeks at a children's home and wanted to stay in London for a few days to relax and have a vacation before we returned to America. It was our first trip to London. We booked the Luna and Simone hotel sight unseen based on tripadvisor reviews and we really enjoyed our stay there. Everything about the place especially the friendly service is excellent. While we were there the story of the plot to smuggle explosives onto aircraft at Heathrow broke and many questions about our return flight occurred. The owners were very helpful in calming concerns about staying extra days and our return flight back to California.  If you look at the list of top London hotels, you will notice they are all over $200 a night with most over $400 and $500. We picked the hotel mainly on price and were amazed at what a great value the Luna and Simone is. We had a small, but very clean and tidy room on the third floor which involved several flights of stairs which we didn't mind. The shower worked well, the bed was comfortable, and there was coffee and tea on the desk. The ambience of the hotel including paint job, paintings, carpet, etc. is clean, neat, beautiful, and well organized. All of the staff including the wife of one of the owners and the son were friendly, helpful, courteous and pleasant. We enjoyed having dinner at the Italian restaurant, Sole Mio, on the corner as well as the Mekong Vietnamese restaurant also around the corner. I was able to walk down to see Westminster Abbey, the Parliament, and Big Ben in about half an hour to forty five minutes. The breakfast was of OJ, egg, bacon, and beans as well as toast and coffee was delicious and filling. We will stay there again if we ever make it back to London and would highly recommend the place to anyone who is looking for a great, great hotel value in London

<Content>Luna and Simone's Service is Tops! The Luna and Simone Hotel is a fine place, situated in a street of Victorian townhouses in various stages of refurbishment (or lack thereof). No surprises 鈥?the previous glowing Tripadvisor reviews are absolutely correct. This family-run place means they REALLY care about your having a pleasant experience. Peter and Bernard are full of info and suggestions and, if they don鈥檛 know, will find out for you. Our spare but adequate three-person room downstairs overlooked a lovely patio. And, as we stayed during an unusually hot spell (90+) in London, the French doors and the sturdy rotating fan made life bearable. Breakfast, though plain, was fast and hot. You can get creative if you choose鈥攕crambled eggs, bacon well-done--whoopee! Small bathroom, but nice shower, fluffy towels, and wonderfully clean. There鈥檚 a heating pot for tea or coffee in the morning (a must for me). The location is just a short walk from Victoria Station, where you can catch a train or a subway. The area is safe and loaded with little stores on almost every corner where you can get a semi-cold soda pop if so inclined, though you have to drink it fast鈥攜ou won鈥檛 find a big ice machine on every floor at Luna and Simone as in American hotels. The hotel does have tiny little bags of tiny little ice cubes you can ask for in a pinch if you just must have ice. Try the Cypress Mangal restaurant for GREAT shish-kabob. Ask for Cheryl and tell her Peter sent you. This place is well worth trying. Peter and Bernard and company, keep up your wonderful service. We SHALL return!

<Content>Average, at Best I chose this hotel based on the excellent reviews on this site, but I was disappointed. I had an average experience with a few problems. First, when I booked, I had no idea breakfast finished being served at 8.30am. It was not mentioned anywhere on their website or when I booked. I though this was ridiculously early for the weekend. And I would have chosen differently if I had known.One, the room and washroom was tiny, and I'm used to UK  European hotels. It was quite hot, and they had provided a fan, but it was stuck to the wall and pointed straight down. To get in the washroom, you had to squeeze through the door, duck around the toilet, and wedge yourself by the shower to shut the door again. On a positive note, there was a soap dish on the wall of the shower that fell off on our first night there, but it was fixed the next day.The hotel was conveniently located to transport and staff was nice.

<Content>Kindness and warmth We arrived in London a day late and in a terrible state having missed flights because of an airline strike. Peter and Bernard were friendly, kind and sympathetic. Their welcome helped get us through the next few difficult days while we re-booked flights home to New Zealand. The hotel itself was comfortable, clean and reasonably priced. It was close to Victoria station and close to the centre of london which was easily accessible by bus. They also provided a great breakfast. Unfortunately our room was noisy being on the street side and I'm sure our hosts would have moved us had we made comment, but we felt that they'd already done quite enough to accommodate us so we didn't mention it.. I would heartily recommend this hotel to all.

<Content>A Lucky Experience In London We were at the Luna Simone Hotel for 1 week, June 23 - July 3. It was great ! The hosts, Bernard  Peter could not have been nicer or more helpful.The room was clean and fun, the window looked over a courtyard full of other windows and life in London. The bathroom was clean and nice and the shower was big and hot!!Breakfast was filling, personally served by the hosts!!Do ask about stairs if you have an issue with climbing.There were many nice eating places as well a couple of grocers in the area. It is close to 2 Underground stations, Pimlico  Victoria and a bus stops right in front.We were new to London, and chosing this hotel was such a stroke of good luck. I would stay there for a month if I could.Christine  Mike, Walnut Creek, California

<Content>Comfortable and Convenient Our family of 4 stayed June 22, 23 and 30 at the Luna and Simone. Though it was small, it was comfortable and spotlessly clean. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful with information on buses and where to eat. The hotel is located very near Victoria Station which made our travels very easy to manage. Breakfast was quick to receive and made an excellent start for our days of adventure. For value and convenience, I would definitely stay at the Luna and Simone on any future trips into London. Thanks guys!!!!

<Content>Fabulous! I almost hate to write this, in fear that the Luna will get smart and raise their prices, but this is by far the best value hotel in London. The rooms were nice, clean, and more than basic white. Our room was small, but very functional. It also had a bathroom, which is a rare find in such a low priced hotel. The hotel's breakfast was hot, fast, and delivered by the owners themselves. The menu was not expansive, but it was free. The hotel itself is about a 10-15 minute walk to Victoria train station. This was nice, since we used both the tube and the trains from this station. It was also a leisurely twenty five minute walk to Buckingham Palace. The neighborhood was not only safe, but charming. I would definately stay here again.

<Content>Friendly and clean Just returned from our trip to UK. Our family of 4 (2 adults and two children ages 10  12) stayed at the Luna Simone for 5 nights. All the previous reviews are accurate and our stay was no different. We stayed on the main floor,(no stair climbing for us) and the room was large and roomy for our family with a double bed and two twin beds. The bathroom was the largest that we stayed in while in the UK, very clean and the best water pressure too. I didn't understand what all the fuss was in the reviews about the water pressure, but now I do! Some other places we stayed in, the water pressure was non existent. The staff was cheerful, friendly and very helpful. We arrived very early on a Monday morning in the rain and they held our bags for the day so that we could go see London before checking in later. Our room was in the back, so it was very quiet, I could see that rooms facing the road would be noisy as it is on a busy street. My only complaint was that the room was hot at night, but it was one of the few places that provided a much needed fan! There was also an in-room safe, which we found nowhere else. Breakfasts were quick and satisfying and always served with a smile. The location was great with the bus stop right outside the hotel and only a 10 minute walk to Victoria Station which we managed with all of our luggage upon arrival and check out, even in the rain. This place is not fancy but a wonderful place to stay, even for a family. We stayed at a different hotel on our way back through London a week later, and we were wishing we had instead booked the Luna Simone again. We will stay here our next time in London!

<Content>Great stay provides comforts of home! I stayed at the Luna Simone for more than a few nights. I was young 20 something female travelling alone on a budget, I felt safe in the area, and the Hotel was terrific. I went from a hostel to this so it was a lot more peaceful and clean. I was able to stay in several rooms during my stay, because I did not book in advance, however the staff was always able to place me in another room. I stayed in both the single basic rooms that share a bathroom. These were very comfy! and only 35-40 GBP. I also stayed in a room way up at the top floor, I sure got a work out on the stairs. Once I even was in a large double room facing the front, with ample space and a great view to the street. I felt the bathrooms were always clean, modern and the beds were pretty comfy. The extras such as the in-room safe and the free coffee and tea, the full english breakfast were so worth it, as well as the internet rooms. The staff were super accomodating and I love the fact that the price of the rooms was so low. I felt that you get extremely better quality rooms and service than some of London's other hotels that cost more and are definitly not as nice-- (trust me I stayed at one prior to my european tour- that was provided by the tour group-- and it cost more than triple the price). The nice thing is it is fairly modern, they newly renovated the place and the spectacular area is so close to everything from touristy areas to transportation and grocery and laundry etc. I would walk to Victoria station every day to catch the Underground or walk towards Buckingham Palace to site see. A Laundromat was just around the corner. I would highly reccomend this hotel for travellers on a budget or those who want a practical starting point for their tours of the city so they can be close to the train station, coach station and tube etc. As well as those who want a comfy, inviting stay. My mom and family are going to stay there this summer -and I'm sure they will enjoy their stay! If I someday return to London I will be knocking on Luna Simone's door again for sure!

<Content>Excellent value for money We stayed for three nights in late May. Two adults and a 7yo child. The triple room we had was downstairs and incredibly quiet. Small but very neat and the bathroom, particularly the shower, was wonderful. The staff were really helpful and friendly, breakfast was really satisfying, free access to the internet and all for one of the cheaper prices around. Bus stops straight outside, less than 5 mins one direction to Pimlico Station, less than 10mins the other to Victoria Station.

<Content>Fab value, location etc We were in london for one night last weekend and chose the Luna Simone Hotel from these reviews, and we were not disappointed. Exceptionally clean, welcoming and tidy, modern hotel. Yes the rooms aren't massive but for the price it's nicer than a travelodge with personal touches. The bathroom was very clean with nice fresh towels and a great power shower. Beds were comfy and we had a fan in the room which was much appreciated on a hot evening. Also nice tea and little kettle etc.The morning of check out my friend and i were doing a charity run and finished at the time of checkout, however the manager let us have the room for an extra hour so we could shower etc, which was also a very kind and generous touch.We were delighted, had a great time made easier by the location and value of this hotel. Fab, would recommend and definitely stay again. Bout a 10-15 minute walk from station and main town, but pubs and shops in closer walking distance.

<Content>Stayed here twice. Stellar hotel. This is a great place to stay when in London. I've stayed here twice: once in 2003 and again in 2005. The first stay was in a single room with its own bathroom, and the 2nd time was a single room with hall bathroom. The hotel is extraordinarily clean and welcoming. It's located in a quieter part of London, close to the tube stop, and near a grocery store and laundry. There isn't much to do near the hotel, but it's a nice change from the hustle of London.

<Content>The reviews here are spot on Based on the many positive reviews here, we booked 3 nights at the Luna Simone. We weren't disappointed. For a budget hotel, they do a great job. (80 pounds a night for a double with the current exchange rates may not seem like a budget hotel, but anything under 100 pounds is a budget hotel.) We requested a first floor room for my father-in-law and they came through. We were in room 14 up a few flights of stairs, but we knew this ahead of time and were prepared for it. They do a great job keeping the place clean and the showers/bathrooms were a cut above what you normally find in comparably priced accomodations. The beds were comfortable. Rooms were small, but we weren't there to spread out. Breakfasts were good and the menu was flexible. Free internet was great, but there was usually a queue. Luna Simone is convenient to Victoria Station, which made getting around rather easy. There are also a lot of restaurants within a few blocks. After a long day traipsing around London, it was nice to have dinner nearby. Our room faced Belgrave Road and it could be a bit noisy at times. The first floor room was in the back and was very quiet. I would stay here again.

<Content>brilliant hotel for a short break! myself and three of my female university friends went to london for a short break recently and through trip advisor came across the luna simone. We got it for a great price at short notice and we were very pleasantly suprised by the hotel and the people who work there. Very close to Victoria tube station so is ideal for travelling by tube and it was clean, tidy, provided a good service and we felt safe and happy staying there. My only complaint was that the rooms are a little on the small side but who cares when you are only staying there for a few nights especially at such a good price! would definately stay there again.

<Content>A great value and location We've just returned from an extended trip to the UK and Scotland.With one exception(which turned out great) we depended on Trip Advisor reviews to help with our booking decision. A ten minute walk from Victoria Station took us to the front door of the LunaSimone. As walkers, we were thrilled with this location -the Pimlaco tube stop was not even ten minutes stroll. Towards Victoria Station and Pimlaco we passed large numbers of restaurants and takeouts- great for budget travelers. We spent our money on the theatre each night - the West end is a very short hop on the tube. Our room was modern, very clean and with a nice bathroom w/shower. Our English breakfast was served up each morning by the twin brothers who own the property. Both were just wonderful hosts. The LunaSimone is definitely going to be our choice for future visits to London.

<Content>Tremendous value for its location - clean and friendly We stayed at the Luna  Simone hotel for one night and found it to be tremendous value for its location. The room was extremely clean and the owners and staff particularly friendly and helpful. It certainly justified the earlier comments in the reviews we read on this site and would not hesitate to go again.

<Content>Loved it It was a great place to stay. The reviews were right on, and I plan on staying there next year again. The owners are twins from Malta, who really made our stay in London easy. Food was great and the location cannot be beat. Place was super clean with brand new bathrooms, and staff very responsive and helpful. Look nowhere else!!!!!!

<Content>Awesome!!! Place to Stay There were 6 of us fom Canada staying in 3 rooms. We were very impressed by the cleaniness of the rooms and the showers. The rooms are not big but we only slept there and the beds were very comfortable. One of the rooms had a bacony over the entrance and was great place to relax after a day of sight seeing. The free Internet and their breakfast in the morning served by the Twin Brother owners was fantastic!!! the staff was always helpful.We flew into Gatwick took the train to Victoria Station and walked with our luggage to the hotel. the area is safe and a bus stops just a few doors down the street. We would definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>it takes years to build a reputation We made our decision on Luna  Simone after reading the reviews here. Everything turned out pretty much as expected. Apart from the good location, clean room, firm beds, powerful shower, tasty breakfast, friendly service etc., what makes L  S unique is that extra something, tangible or otherwise, that guests have all experienced during their stay. In my opinion, that extra something is the economic moat that keeps the hotel filled and the competitors from getting close. A successful business is one that gets repeated sales and unqualified referrals. Many thanks to the entire team at L  S for a pleasant stay at your premise. You have got three new supporters here in Greater Vancouver. p.s. love your Pickwick teas( a blend of quality teas) but couldn't find the same tea bags in all the places we looked in London. Guess we'll have to wait till our next visit to enjoy some.

<Content>Great Hotel!! My family stayed at the Luna and Simone hotel for a week-long vacation. I read the negative reviews before going on the trip and I have to say most of them were blown out of proportion or were written by people whose expectations are a bit high for someone trying to stay in a budget hotel in a good location in a big city. The rooms were small but what is to be expected for staying in a large city. (We also weren鈥檛 visiting London to sit in our hotel rooms all day.) The bathroom was an adequate size and had excellent water pressure! Our rooms were cleaned daily before we returned from sightseeing. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful- they helped carry my bags up to my room. Also, our rooms were not ready upon arrival so they had them cleaned while we waited in the lobby and chatted with the owners. (this process might have taken 15 minutes). It is true that there is not a lift in the hotel- perhaps this is a lesson to those not accustomed to city traveling- travel light!! I read some reviews about noise from the stairwell- while we did occasionally hear some people in the stairwell it was not sustained noise nor was it very loud so it did not trouble us at all. Victoria Station is very close (10-15 min. walk) and the hotel is also close to restaurants and a grocery store. The neighborhood was clean and safe. Staying in a budget hotel that provided breakfast was also a nice treat- and with the exchange rate being so high for Americans this was a big money saver! Overall, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly, the hotel was *very* clean, and having breakfast and en suite bathrooms for the price was unbeatable!

<Content>Love the Luna and Simone Hotel My husband and I, and our 13 year old daughter just travelled from Ontario Canada to Brisbane Australia via Europe and Japan. We stayed in many many hotels along the route- some of them a LOT more expensive than the Luna and Simone. Yet, I have to say, the Luna and Simone was one of the best we stayed in - and one of the most reasonable. Our room was quite a good size, clean, and efficient. The location is fantastic - in a quiet, clean, safe part of London, close to everything, including train stations, shops, and London sights. The brothers do a smashing job at breakfast, and run the place extremely well. And the little computer / internet terminal cubicle is very handy. The Luna and Simone is well run, clean, efficient, safe, reasonable, friendly and in a perfect location.Now here's for the really outstanding bit - once I got to Japan, I realized I had left my computer USB memory stick (which was the only source of all my family photos) somewhere along the route. I wrote to all the hotels we had stayed in along the way. Most of them did not even bother to answer, including the extremely expensive hotel we stayed in, in Paris. To my surprise, I had a very prompt email back from the Luna and Simone hotel - to say they had found my USB port and would send it to me via registered mail in Australia. They did this very efficiently, at no charge, and my USB port arrived promptly - all the way around the world. NOW THAT IS SERVICE. Thank you Luna and Simone!!!! You are the best.

<Content>It takes years to build a reputation A successful business is one that gets repeated sales and referrals. That little bit extra that guests have experienced at Luna  Simone is the economic moat that the management has been building around its business to keep the competitors from getting close.Many thanks to the entire L  S team for a pleasant stay at your premise. Everything is as good as advertised. As for suggestions for future improvement, perhaps a small frige in the rooms and even extended internet hours would be nice. You have got yourself three new (unsolicited) promoters here in Greater Vancouver, British Columbia.

<Content>Best budget hotel My husband and I have just returned from our annual trip to London. We've stayed in a number of different budget hotels but found Luna and Simone to be the best by far in its price category. We paid 80 pounds per night for a double room (room 9) with private facilities and breakfast. In comparison to rooms we've stayed in at other budget hotels in London, this room was (slightly) bigger, cleaner and more tastefully decorated. The bathroom was tiny, but the shower was good. And breakfast was a treat, with a few different options to choose from and always served with a smile. The friendliness and genuine interest displayed by the owners/staff is another thing that makes L  S stand out positively from other London budget hotels. The central location is another asset. Belgrave Road is easily reached by tube (Victoria) and there are a few decent pubs/cafes, restaurants and supermarkets closeby. It's also an easy hike to places of interest such as the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye.

<Content>Luna Simone is lovely We stayed at the Luna Simone Hotel for four nights in May and found it a very charming hotel. The twin room we had was more than roomy enough for us and our luggage, and was spotlessly clean. There was a closet with room for our luggage and a safe for valuables. The selection of tea with an electric teapot on the desk was a nice touch. The included breakfast was hearty and the breakfast dining area was spotless and nicely decorated. The hotel offered a computer with free internet access for guests. The location within a five minute walk of Victoria Station was very convenient. I would highly recommend the hotel for couples, families, and single travelers. The only downside was the lack of a lift, which made getting to our top floor room with our luggage a very good workout.

<Content>Highly recommended This is a family run hotel where the owners take a real pride in their hotel and with good reason - it is ideal for a short stay in London.There is no lift, no air conditiong and the Reception is small. The rooms are quite small too but clean, modern and well equipped. I booked five rooms for a group of French visitors and they were all very pleased with the hotel. We were warned about the stairs as some of our rooms were on the top floor but it really wasn't a problem as we did not have large bags.The owners are very welcoming and helpful, they gave us plenty of advice and we always had the impression that they really cared about their guests and nothing was too much trouble.Breakfast is full English, on the first day my wife asked for purnes which they did not have but on the next day they had bought some prunes for us and my wife enjoyed a light breakfast of prunes and yogurt.

<Content>The Positive Reviews are right! Everything that was said positively about this hotel is true. I traveled with two seniors, and three teenagers. I am 43. We were on the top floor, and although I hated the steps...I would stay here again in a minute. The brothers were wonderful to us...especially my parents, the place was absolutely spotless (the dining room, the lobby, bedrooms, and the bathroom), and the breakfast - which is included - was wonderful. I also loved the fact that I could e-mail my husband back home, could easily walk to Victoria Station, and that it was very convenient to get off the bus right in front of the motel. There are restaurants, a convenience store, and a drugstore nearby. If you have older people with you...get a room on a lower floor. My parents were on the first floor, and had absolutely no problems whatsoever. This is a place that makes you want to visit London again in spite of the three days of rain we had (after a drought...go figure) and total confusion about transportation at the start. I will tell everyone I know who is headed to London to stay here!

<Content>Great place to stay My Mom and I stayed at the Luna  Simone May 4th - 9th, 2006 and again on May 14th for one night. The staff could not have been more helpful, the location was perfect, the rooms were comfortable, the showers were hot and the breakfast was more than adequate. I don't think we could have done better for the price. The area itself was very nice and we felt completely safe walking from Victoria Station to the hotel at any time during the day or night. We found some marvelous restaurants within walking distance (soups  escargot at Chez Gerard and the Turkish/Mediterranean food at Kazan were fabulous). Cannot say enough about the owners  staff - they were friendly, funny and always willing to help with directions, weather reports  tourist advice. During our stay we met several guests who had stayed at the hotel before and one couple (from Canada I think) were on their 6th visit. There are plenty of restaurants, shops, laundry, dry cleaners, ATM's, pharmacies up and down the side streets and the bus stops across the street. Would defintely stay there again and recommend it to anyone looking for a clean, centrally located, budget friendly hotel.

<Content>Loved this hotel! We really enjoyed staying at this hotel! Not far from Victoria station and on bus route 24. There were loads of great places to eat near the hotel (we particularly liked Kazan). We stayed in room 7 which had a balcony and faced the front. The room was a little loud with road noise, but the balcony made up for it. The beds were firm, but we were so tired from touring that it didn't matter. The rooms were well kept (how do they tuck those sheets so tight?!) and the bathroom was spotless. The entire staff was really friendly and efficient. Breakfast was a great start to the day and really made this hotel quite a deal. There's also an internet room so you can check your email or do some planning for the day. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London.

<Content>A Most Remarkable Hotel My wife and I stayed at this hotel for three separate nights recently, as well as one night in October 2005. It already feels like our London home. I can only echo previous comments praising the cleanliness and maintenance of the rooms, the wonderful staff including the Desira brothers who own ithe hotel, the very reasonable cost, and the great English breakfast.I just can't understand the thinking of the contributor from Tampa. The achievement of being number 9 out of 990 hotels in TripAdvisor's popularity speaks for itself. This is emphasised if you go to the list on this site setting out the hotels in popularity order and compare what you pay for rooms in the eight hotels ahead of Luna and Simone with the LS rates.This hotel is up there not because it pretends to be something it isn't, but because it does everything it tries to do exceptionally well. Congratulations to the owners. You are achieving excellence.

<Content>Book It Now!! The customer service at this hotel is without doubt the best I have ever encountered. They come across as 100% genuine, friendly people and will do whatever they can to help you. (Thank you to Tony who was a fantastic help in reception) The hotel itself is spotlessly clean and in a great location, just a 5 minuet walk from Victoria station and its also within walking distance of all the main attractions that you may want to visit whilst in London. If your not one for walking the bus stop is about 20 meters away and the bus can take you into the centre of London (for just 拢1.40).The value of this hotel is superb, 拢75 we paid for a double room including a well cooked breakfast each. This must be the best value in London 鈥?The rooms are quite small and basic (don鈥檛 expect the Ritz!) but they are comfortable, clean and have everything you may need 鈥?Great shower, Clean Toilet, TV, Double bed, Solid secure doors, and Windows that open. I can also confirm that the fans DO oscillate with the press of a button! THANKS TO ALL AT THE LUNA  SIMONE 鈥?MY WIFE AND I WILL DEFINITELY RETURN!!

<Content>Excellant value and location We stayed here for 5 nights while vacationing in London. The hotel is located within walking distance of Victoria Station, but the 24 bus runs right past the front door which will also take your to Victoria from where you can get a tube or bus to anywhere in London (or the UK). The two brothers who own the hotel are very, very friendly and affable. They provide a very professional level of service and will try to accomodate any reasonable request. The rooms are simply furnished, mostly no frills, but they are perfectly immaculate. Some of the rooms will be cramped for more than one person so be sure to ask for a room to adequately meet the number of people in your party. The hotel is a great value and the location is perfect for touring London on a budget.

<Content>Loved this hotel and neighborhood We loved this small, spotlessly clean hotel. The neighborhood was wonderful, full of interesting restaurants and shops. It was wonderful to be in a residential heighborhood, away from crowds yet so close to central London. Local buses stop right in front of the hotel. The staff gave so much personal attention, beautiful breakfast, and the other guests were quiet and friendly. The room was newly renovated and painted. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. For London the price was very reasonable.

<Content>I'd read such good reviews-- I had such great expectations of this hotel, reviewers from other sites had raved over it. My experience was not so good. I knew there would be no air conditioning, but it was September so I thought OK, it's not going to be hot. But because it was rainy, it was very humid, and the room was stifling: the windows could only be opened a crack as they were barred - we were in the basement. There was a fan but we could not change its direction, and it caused such a draught we could not use it when we went to bed. The room was a really odd shape, long and narrow, quite claustrophobic really. And there were no lifts or porterage, so you you had to hump your suitcases up and down up to 4 sets of stairs unless you were lucky enough to get one of the only 2 rooms we saw on the ground floor. I rated this place as high as this only because it had a great bathroom, everything was spotlessly clean, there was a great breakfast, and the staff were very helpful. For us, it was a big mistake, and no cheaper than the Holiday Inn Express which we found out about later, and where there was a lift, porterage if required, plus all the other amenities you would expect of a Holiday Inn. As well as properly sized rooms I don鈥檛 doubt. The Luna Simone was a long walk from the nearest tube station. There was no food available other than breakfast, and no bar that we could determine. As I said, a big mistake.

<Content>Luna  My wife and stayed at Luna  Simone in London in May (based on the recommendations on this website) and highly recommend staying at this excellent small hotel near Victoria Station. All hotel rooms in London (except the most expensive) are small. That being said, the room was very clean, the bathroom had a fabulous shower, the bed was extremely comfortable (double bed and I'm 6 3 tall), the room was quite, and the owners were very friendly and accomodating. The price was great for London and everything was quite convenient (a short walk to Victoria Station). Our only comment was the breakfast choices were rather limited (we stayed 5 nights): Orange juice or corn flakes for starters;tea or coffee; and 3 main choices were bacon, beans,  toast (what no English sausages!); soft boiled egg with toast; or cold ham and a tomato slice. We had a delightful stay and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Very Accomodating Great budget hotel. Did not encounter any problems. I am a single female traveler and felt very safe at this location. The staff was very nice and polite-always trying to help. Location is close to the Victoria tube and near supermarkets and various restaurants.

<Content>Would definitely come again! My mother  I stayed here for four days in May 2006. It was (hands down) the best hotel we stayed at during our two week trip through Europe! The staff were friendly and VERY helpful! They were always available for tips and advice! The included breakfast was excellent! Starting your day with a hot meal was great! The room was very clean and well-kept. The staff honored our request not to be disturbed (i.e. housekeeping) and they STILL left us fresh towels at our door each day! It was wonderful! I would definately stay there again! We even recommended the hotel to everyone we met! My mother loved it!

<Content>Excellent value for money Clean, comfortable and qiet hotel in a very nice area of London.The room was OK for the price, although rather small. The bathroom is very small but finctional with everything you need. The breakfast is very basic (I'd say poor) but you can get everything you need in the neighborhood.Walking distance from the city centre and conveniently located with the tube.The staff was very friendly.

<Content>Consistency, cleanliness, convenience See below for recent reviews; I won't repeat the same. My daughter and I stayed for 7 nights in May in Luna #2 and were completely satisfied. The correct time for breakfast each day is 7-8:30. We especially liked having both a Sainsbury's and a Tesco market close by. I would stay again if the opportunity ever arises.

<Content>A second home... I always go back I had to make sure I wrote a review about the Luna Simone. I have stayed here about 4 times and each time I have felt so comfortable. This place has everything for the budget traveller (who doesnt want to stay in a dirt pit). The Luna Simone sparkles it is so clean. The bathrooms are absolutely spotless. Sure, there is no lift and your room might be a bit of a trek up the stairs... but the desk staff will go out of their way to take your luggage up for you. That is one of the strengths of this hotel.. the staff. They are some of the friendliest people I have ever met. The brothers and son will do just about anything for you. Once I even asked the son if he could kindly take a photo of my parents and I outside of the hotel and he stood out in traffic to do so!!! The breakfast is delicious as well. Fresh, clean and welcoming. The eggs are great wonderfully served with toast, beans and bacon. I first stayed at the hotel when I arrived in England alone. Feeling totally out of my element (and showing up soaking wet!) the Luna Simone has always provided for me everything that I needed in London. Thats why I keep going back. I am proud to reccomend this hotel to anyone who wants a reliable, SUPER clean, friendly, comfortable and safe place to stay in London. You won't be sorry.

<Content>Great Escape in London My husband and I spent the last four nights of our vacation in the Luna hotel. The hotel is in a great neighborhood and is an easy 15 min. walk from Victoria Station. Although our room was up about six flights of stairs and very tiny - it was extremely confortable and very clean. We did not have a problem with street noise and slept great the entire time. I cannot comment on breakfast as it is only served from 7:30-8am and we never made it downstairs in time. However, there are several coffee shops, restaurants and a grocery store nearby as well as a landerette around the corner. The staff was very friendly and helpful with any questions that we had. As crazy and busy as London can be, we found this to be a convenient, safe and clean getaway at a great price.

<Content>We really felt at home WE really enjoyed our 7 night stay at the Luna  Simone. We have only the highest words of praise for every aspect of the hotel. The best part of life is people and that is true of this hotel too----the staff were really friendly and personable---we feel like we have a home away from home and would love to come and stay at the Luna Simone again.

<Content>We'll definitely stay again. We've just returned from a weekend in London, staying for 2 nights at the Luna  Simone Hotel. Like many others, we chose this hotel based on the reviews here. We can only echo the many positive comments already left.In a nutshell, the hotel is:Great value for money.Spotlessly clean.Run by very friendly and helpful people.Only 5 minutes walk from Pimlico tube.Although only on-street parking, the area seems very safe and quiet and non-residents can park for free in the evenings and all weekends (we got a spot right outside the hotel).We'll no longer waste hours searching for somewhere to stay when we travel to London. This place ticks all the right boxes. In fact, we've already booked for next month.

<Content>Agree with most comments but care re:street noise Just returned from 5 days stay at Luna Simone. Agree with most of the reviews - very helpful staff, breakfast adequate though somewhat repetitive after a few mornings. Very clean and super shower. Rooms are small but we were rarely in it besides sleeping - too much to do. Word of caution - Hotel is on a busy road with traffic lights junction near by and Bus stop outside. There is only single glazing so the traffic noise is bad and we did not sleep too well first night but after that we were so tired from walking all over London it rarely bothered us but it may well be an issue for others. Well pleased overall for cost incurred.

<Content>Fantastic budget hotel! I just returned home from London where I stayed at the Luna  Simone hotel for 12 nights. I loved this hotel! For a budget hotel, it is simply fantastic. I paid 拢40 per night for a small, single room with shared bathroom. I only had to share with 1 other person, and the bathroom was right outside of my room. I never had any problems with needing to use the bathroom at the same time as the other person I was sharing it with. My room had a closet, small desk, sink, towel  toiletry rack, and TV. My room was kept immaculately clean, and towels (you get 2 - 1 medium size, and 1 hand towel) were replaced every day. They also have a kettle in the room, which they kept stocked with tea, coffee, sugar, etc. There is also a safe in the room, which came in handy. The people at the front desk were so friendly, always saying Hello when I came in every night. I only had 2 very minor problems during my stay. My heater wasn't working, but when I went down to the front desk, he gave me a small portable heater which I kept throughout my stay and it worked great! Also, there was a problem 1 night with the phone. I couldn't dial out and my family couldn't dial in. When I mentioned this to the front desk, they were aware of the problem and it was fixed the very next morning. You can tell that they actually care about their customers at this place!Unfortunately, I never did eat breakfast - even though I was there 13 days! I didn't like getting up before 8 am and breakfast ended at 8:30, so I can't comment on it - other than it smelled really good! Overall, I was really happy with my stay at this hotel. I won't even think about staying anywhere else the next time I'm in London. Definately stay here on your next trip!

<Content>Wonderful experience I was very pleasantly surprised when I arrived at the hotel. I had booked from the States, via the Internet, basing my choice on the opinions of others at this site. I was more than pleased with the results. The hotel was walking distance from both Victoria train and coach stations, plus a wide variety of attractions. The neighborhood was quiet and well-kept, yet many types of restaurants were nearby. The hotel itself was immaculately clean, and comfortable. The shower was an American's dream, with full force and hot water. For the modest price, a hot breakfast was included, and I did not have to share the bath, as I had on previous occasions at other moderate hotels. The staff, in this family run business, were most helpful and courteous. In short, I highly recommend this hotel and look forward to returning.

<Content>Clean, quiet, convenient hotel for a great price! We just returned from London, having spent 3 nights at the Luna Simone Hotel. We were pleasantly surprised to find that it lived up to our expectations, and the positive reviews were accurate.The hotel is convenientely located less than 10 minutes to Victoria Station, in a quiet, safe neighborhood that is filled with great restaurants. The hotel is bright and cheerful, and was spotless clean throughout. The staff are friendly and accommodating.Check-in was quick and we were given room #3, on the first floor, toward the back of the hotel, which was what we had requested. The only downside was that the room was at the top of the stairs leading to the breakfast room, so there was noise and footsteps starting at 7:00.Yes, the rooms are small, but we were only there to sleep, so it was adequate for us, with sufficient space for our luggage. Our room was clean, with comfortable twin beds, fresh linens, and new-looking paint on the walls. They even provide extra pillows in the closet. The bathrooms are sparking clean, with new tiles and great showers. Overall, the room is functional, but very basic.The breakfast was adequate and served very quickly. The coffee is powdered, so if you are expecting a great cup of coffee, you'll be disappointed. I'd opt for tea and grab a coffee at Victoria Station.We found plenty of restaurants in the neighborhood, with lots of variety. For a delicious, cheap sandwich, try Delicias de Portugal. We enjoyed Paradise Indian Restaurant. On our last night we had a great meal at Grumbles, right around the corner from the hotel (next to Sole Mio). Grumbles has great food and ambience, but is a little more pricey than some other options (12-15 GBP per entree). We had an appetizer, 2 entrees, a bottle of wine and a dessert and it was about $100 - not too bad for a splurge meal!We also enjoyed several guided walks with London Original Walks (they do a great changing of the guards tour and get you front and center!). We particularly enjoyed the guided Thames Pub Crawl. http://www.walks.com/This hotel is an excellent choice if you want something basic and clean in a good neighborhood without breaking the bank!

<Content>A nice surprise - from my Italian point of view! Just wanted to confirm the previous positive reviews. The LS hotel is a little gem in a very quite street. The building/interiors are traditional English so don't expect modern architecture/5 star fornitures: this looks more like BB and surely much more personality.It takes 10 mins walk from Victoria bus/train station and - despite how noisy Victoria is - the hotel is very relaxing. Bus 24 just in front of the hotel (takes you to/back home from various attractions) and Pimlico/Victoria tube very close.Nice staff and clean rooms. And yes, pack light! The are four floors and no elevator.Our room was not as big as American standards and little room to walk around but once you spent the day walking around London, who cares walking the room!Heating was a little too warm, opening the window a little brought fresh air and problem solved (surprising how clean London is!)

<Content>You get what you read I went to London last weekend, on a 3 night trip and I look, and look, and look in the net for a convenient, cheap, central, clean ensuite bedroom.I choose the luna Simone mainly because of the excellent reviews it had.The reviews posted here are honest and you could trust on it. I got exactly what I expected by the good side. I have no bad comments on it. It is worthy of the money you will pay for.I make my words of all the visitors to this hotel.The staff is kind and helpfull. Congratulations and best luck for the future.I will certainly be back in a near future.

<Content>Great stay, kind wonderful family business - like home My 16 yr old daughter and I just returned from London and Paris. It was our first trip traveling in Euroe without my husband and it was last minute and on a budget. We were a bit nervous. We were delighted to find that Luna  Simone B B is easy to get to - walking distance to Victoria Station, the 24 bus stops at the door (goes to many major attraction and runs all night). We were walking distance from the Tate Modern, Evan Evans tours (great- by the way) the Palace, many wonderful restaurants - all prices. It's in an upscale SW1 neighborhood, but the street has a lot of other reasonable hotels and hostels, so it's good for young people. There were a lot of tours of college students coming as we were going home. The B  B is family owned, passed down to twin brothers, their wives and a son. They are wonderfully friendly kind and obviously like people and enjoy their work. They were helpful, made us feel safe and like we were with family (family we actually like and get along with) When my daughter became ill on Easter they scrambled to help us find an open convenience store to buy necessities. They even stored 2 bags of our stinky laundry when we went to Paris before returning home to their B B. But most importantly was how they reach out to everyone and make them feel welcome and connected.The rooms are remodeled, clean, modern with t.v., nice showers, storage, nice firm beds, coffee and tea makings in the room, wholesome breakfast. It's not the Hilton-- so if you want fancy and super-upscale.. this may not be for you.. but it's the best I have found (3rd trip for me to London) for the size and the money.. and most of all the environment. Personally, I am not looking for the Hilton in Europe- I am looking for a comfortable homey friendly place to wake up and come back to after a hard day touring far from home. The first few nights we were right next to the computer room (free). That worked great for my daughter. On return we were in a bigger lighter room on the second floor with a balcony facing Belgrave (still quiet, but no elevator). So if you are looking for simple, homey convenient location, reasonably priced and family like environment with people who you can actually like and enjoy being with.. this is the place Lisa

<Content>generally good hotel, convenient Stayed here for one night on a trip back to england over easter. The hotel was chosen mainly due to the very positive reviews on Trip advisor.Being english and used to the size of hotel rooms, I didn麓t feel that the room was small, the bed was smaller than at home, but that was no surprise either. Having a private bathroom at this price was fantastic. All in all a good little no frills hotel, though I did feel the breakfast was a bit weak.

<Content>Was just OK London is super-expensive, so for a nice low price you get:-really, really small room and small clean bathroom (with nice pressure in the shower though). Whatever your expectations are for 'small', think smaller.-pretty hard bed-a worn room; not dirty, but scuffs on the walls etc.-tiny TV with a couple of channels-decent, safe location, actually much closer to Pimlico Tube vs. Victoria. You could probably walk to Pimlico, jump on the tube and get to Victoria faster than if you walked directly to the Victoria.-friendly staff-free internet usageI would probably spend an extra $30 and stay at one of the BB's on Ebury next time, mostly because of the size of the room.

<Content>Great disappointment I also agonized over finding a moderately-priced, decent place to briefly stay in London, and was blown away by the positive reviews of this hotel--but stunned in my actual experience, by comparison. On arrival, the individual who checked me in was unfriendly, humorless, impatient, almost surly, and very much less than helpful. My single room (#16) was on the top floor, and required hauling my luggage up eight very steep flights of stairs, with no offer for help by the fellow checking me in. (London may be London, but I have very few expectations for my accomodations, and I had no other experience like this in my entire 16 days in Scotland, where all my moderately-priced guest houses spontaneously offered friendly courtesy and assistance, even when not needed).The room was essentially a compartment, about 6' X 12' with a fairly uncomfortable twin bed, well-worn bedding, a table the size of my small suitcase, a wooden chair, an adequate small closet, and a tiny ledge for phone  lamp by the bed. The room was overwhelmingly hot, and even after shutting off the heater (which is possible, despite a previous review stating otherwise), the window had to remain open with the wall fan on all night, despite winter weather outside. Altogether not very comfortable, and pretty painful to endure the stairs after 2 weeks of strenuous hiking all about the countryside. Tiny bathroom with not enough room to place personal items, but had a good shower with plenty of pressure and no problem with hot water. One bar of soap and minimal ammenities as listed.The included breakfast was average, and speed of service was remarkably quick.Although I was a first-time visitor to London, and this may be a good value as others have stated--I find it hard to agree.

<Content>Luna is Great! My wife and I stayed there for 10 nights in March. It was great. Rooms, yes small by American standards but who cares, were comfortable, organized, and immaculate. Bathrooms (we stayed in two different rooms by our fault, NOT the Luna's)were everything one could need. Great showers. We are palnning a return trip in 2007 and will definetly be staying at the Luna  Simone.

<Content>Luna  LOCATION: In a clean neighborhood, very close to Victoria Station with many wonderful restaurants. Also there is a Tesco supermarket and another nice supermarket (Marks and Spencer?) within a few blocks. We enjoyed our walk to the station and would stop at Cafe Nero for a hot cup of coffee and a sweet. Having the Tesco nearby was wonderful - we purchased chips (crisps) and bottled water to have as snacks while we toured London or to keep in the room. If you have children, this is an important fact, since they get hungry at inconvenient times. We ate dinner at Spicy World (twice - great Pak/Indian food), Seafresh (try the sticky, toffee pudding), and O Sole Mio (great salad and pasta dishes)CLEANLINESS: The room and hotel were very clean. Lots of hot water and water pressure for relaxing showers after walking London all day. AMENITIES: Delicous breakfast of toast, fried eggs, bacon and baked beans or boiled eggs and a bowl of cornflakes. My children are now requesting baked beans for breakfast - who knew? Internet room - okay so it's only a closet with one chair, but if you need to connect it's great. We were able to watch TV in the room, but with the choices of channels it wasn't too great, especially for kids. Yes, their are many flights of stairs, but if you're already prepared to walk London what does it matter if you have a few more steps to your room. I think I lost weight on this trip, actually! If you have to, ask for a room on a lower floor.All in all, I was very impressed with the Luna and Simone hotel. Family friendly staff, clean rooms and fabulous location. I would recommend this hotel for everyone.

<Content>Great place to stay in London! My husband and I recently stayed at the Luna Simone Hotel for 14 nights while visiting London. We had a twin ensuite which was impeccably clean and well furnished. We appreciated the convenience of the large in room safe in our closet. We knew there would be no lift and the four flights of stairs to our room did not bother our middle aged bodies. Every venue in London has stairs so you had better get use to them! They serve a wonderful full English breakfast in a cheery breakfast room. The Luna Simone has a FREE internet station for it's guests to use, what a great convenience! When we arrived for check in, quite wet from a walk in the rain, they handed us our keys and said here, go up to your room and get settled and then come back down to register. One of the staff members, Mark, even carried my suitcase up the stairs for me.Nearby are several nice retaurants and pubs to choose from. Around the corner is a laundrette and several convenience stores. A Sainsbury's grocery store is located a few blocks away. The walk to Pimlico tube station takes about 5 minutes. The walk to Victoria Station is about 10 minutes but there are interesting shops and good cafes along the way.We would definitely stay here again and it was a wonderful value at 拢60 per night. Three cheers to the Desira Family!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Just got back from a 3 night stay at the Luna Simone and have to say it really was a wonderful stay. I stayed in the single with the shared WC. As others have said, the room was small, but folks, its London. Get over it. Though small, it really was very well designed and functional. Had its own sink which made things easy even with the shared WC. And it was VERY clean. Breakfast was pretty good too. Egg, bacon, beans coffee and OJ. How they manage to get my food to me in 15 seconds is beyond me! Would definetly stay here again.P.S. Only one note, i wouldn't recommend using the phone. 1 pound/minute on a call to my friend's UK mobile phone. Ouch.

<Content>Loved the Luna! I read all the reviews carefully before deciding to book my weekend trip with the Luna Simone. Even before I booked the hotel, the staff quickly emailed me back answers to any questions I had. They were very attentive to all our needs. Upon arriving at the Luna, which was as read, a short walk from Victoria Station. I came upon a beautiful exterior of granite steps and emblemed glass. At the front desk appeared the two brothers who gladly checked us in as well as let us get rid of our bags without completing our paperwork yet. This was quite nice as I had just flown in from Boston roughly eight hours before and just wanted to get rid of my bags and rest for a moment. The room was just as others had described, small but roomy enough as well as having a nice remodeled private bathroom. This was the key to the whole room. Good water pressure, not to mention having hot water and a nice flushing system. The bed wasn't the greatest (just a little stiff) but I must say I have had much much worse. It was adequate for the price. We stayed in Room 11 on the right side of the building.We did make it to breakfast the first morning of our stay. They were quite quick about serving us and it was a nice little dining area. This hotel was also near a lot of good restaurants not too badly priced either. We did try one Indian restaurant as well as a chain while we were in the area.All in all I must say I am soooo pleased at this hotel. I was a little nervous as it was my first time not staying in a chain style hotel somewhere but the Luna came through. I will definitely stay here again. Great location, great staff, and clean rooms! Thanks Luna!

<Content>Great Stay in London We searched and searched for a reasonable place to stay in London that was centrally located to the city. Luna  Simone fit the bill. The hotel is close to the Victoria and Pimlico Tube stations, which are both within walking distance to the hotel. Bus 24 also stops near the hotel.The twin brothers who run the hotel are very friendly and accommodative. A hot English breakfast is available, but you also are given a choice. Baked beans, a fried egg, and bacon (which looks more like American country ham) is one breakfast choice. You can also choose ham and tomato, or two boiled eggs. All include toast, tea or coffee, and orange juice or corn flakes. The breakfast room is cheerful and comfortable.Our room was very clean, and the bathroom looked newly remodeled. The room was small; however, we had room to place our luggage and a desk. We had a fan as well as a heater in the room.I highly recommend this place.

<Content>Seriously Flawed My partner and I stayed here March 18, 2006. Our room was up six flights of stairs (nine flights if you ate breakfast on site)- surprise, suprise- there is no elevator. The room was so tiny that two people could not pass each other without turning sideways, and even then you were rubbing against each other. The bed had to be repositioned in order to level it- the floor sagged four inches (no exaggeration) from one side of the room to the other. The heat was on, and no way to turn it off, so we had to sleep with the window wide open, with no screen on the window opening. The furniture was cast offs from the Salvation Army. If this room had been bargain basement pricing, I would not complain, but it was average price. The owners were very nice people, and I think they can not be aware that there are better hotels in the area for the same money. For instance, we stayed at the Best Western Corona, just up the street, for two nights this same week, and the rooms here were absolutely stellar. Very disappointing, given the reviews that I read on this hotel.

<Content>Fine place - steep stairs! Down in London on business and agonised over cheap(ish) accommodation. The previous reviews helped make up my mind, and we took three double rooms for a week.Spotless on arrival and during the stay, excellent showers, friendly and helpful. We were on the top floor, and it was a long way back up after the basement breakfast each day.First choice when next in London.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel!! My daughter and I stayed in this hotel, for our first trip abroad. It was everything and more than we expected. The staff is the best, friendly, helpful and very knowledgable! The rooms, though small by American standards, were very comfortable and well kept. The bathroom was a lovely surprise, with a nice roomy shower stall and sparkling clean! The amenities were nice, down to a coffee/tea maker replenished daily and nice to come back to for a hot cuppa after walking the streets of London until evening. Breakfast was great, freshly prepared and served promptly. It is close to everything and very convenient to both the Pimlico tube station and Victoria Station, where you can catch both the tubes for around London and trains to Gatwick and other areas outside of London, for day trips. (We recommend Salisbury and Stonehenge. We did this trip on our own and saved ourselves quite a bit over the tours offered...and it was easy to navigate!) We have already planned our trip for 2007, including my husband and son this time, and will be staying at the Luna and Simone! Thank you to this lovely family and their staff for making our first trip across the pond one we will treasure forever! P.S. Please feel free to email me with any questions you may have!

<Content>I miss them already!!!! The Luna Simone Hotel was great. We were there for Spring Break '06, and had a wonderful time. The brothers that run that hotel were nice, helpful, funny and hooked us up with some really fun tours. Thank you Peter and I don't remember the other brother's name but everyone was so nice and friendly. The hotel is located near a lot of the attractions and the bus line was right outside the hotel. The rooms are a bit smaller than the hotel rooms here in the states but they are very clean. The breakfast they served every morning was good and it helped to get our day started. They also would also throw in some funny conversation that brighten our day. If I ever go to London again I will stay there no matter what!!! Enjoy!! :)

<Content>Good budget hotel in London This is a good hotel for the price range. London has some of the most expensive hotels in the world, so when you're looking for something on a budget the choices can be very disappointing.The rooms at the Luna and Simone are tiny (at least ours was) but they are clean. Like most small UK budget hotels, there was no elevator, so carrying our baggage up the narrow stairs was a challenge. But the staff are friendly, the location is fine (among the hundreds of budget hotels along Belgrave Road), and if you're not planning to be in your room much because you'll be out exploring London, the value is hard to beat. We were only staying for two nights, so we didn't mind the tiny rooms, but if you have a little more money and are staying for longer you may want to go slightly more upmarket. But at the price this is a hard hotel to beat.

<Content>Perfect low budget hotel We stayed at the Luna  Simone for three nights (3rd-6th Mar) and felt that we had to post a review. As with most of the other reviews we found this hotel excellent for a number of reasons. The staff were unbelievably friendly and helpful. We arrived slightly early yet our room was ready for us to freshen up before departing for the city. We also had a late flight out of London, the guys had no problem with us leaving our luggage in the hotel while we enjoyed our last day in the city in comfort.The rooms are a tad small but more than adequate for regular low maintenance travellers. The powerful shower was fantastic for dusting off the cobwebs in the morning! Unfortunatley we found the breakfast too early for us to enjoy, perhaps breakfast time could be extended slightly to allow for those not-so-early risers.The location was excellent, really quiet street and less than 10 minutes to Pimlico tube station. Our flights were in and out of Gatwick so with Victoria station only about a 12 minute walk away the hotel could not have been better situated.

<Content>A little gem! We spent 4 days in London recently at the Luna  Simone, and could not fault it in any way.London is not generally known for its excellent service, but the hotel staff were most welcoming and friendly, and full of helpful tourist onformation. Our room was smallish, but very well designed. Every space was well utilised, and you didn't keep tripping over things. It was clean, comfortable and with a designer bathroom. And the shower was excellent! The room was quiet, and we didn't hear too much of our neighbours.A large breakfast was included, and as I didn't want a hot English fry-up in the morning, they were happy to offer me a selection of yoghurts as well as the toast and cereal.The location is within walking distance of Victoria Station, and we found it relatively easily although the street numbers were totally confusing, and seemed to jump all over the place. It's most convenient if you're coming from Gatwick, which arrives at Victoria Station. Otherwise from Heathrow, which is where we arrived, you take the tube and change at Hammersmith (you just walk a across a few metres to the next platform).For a 'budget' hotel I am sure it outdoes many of it's far more highly ranked competitors. We'll definitely be back.

<Content>Great value and great staff - clean rooms We stayed 27th February to 1st March and although our room (Number 8) was small it was very clean and the bathroom spotless. The room size probably depends on the exact room as they have to fit the irregular layout of the building.Our front room was not even noisy, although it is on the main street. The furnishings are modest and a little TV is OK with only a rough selection of channels.Internet is available downstairs but not in the room except by wireless which is very expensiveBreakfast is pleasant, as are all the staff, and most helpful. Location is in between Victoria and Pimlico subways, with about 10+ minutes to walk to each, and good local cafes and restaurants in the area. Try The Fishhouse - turn left out of the hotel, 2 streets go right and down past Cafe Nero towards Victoria Station, then on the right - been there for 40 years and good value fresh fish.The location might be a problem in bad weather because of the walk to the station. Taxi to Paddington is GBP10 and there is also a fixed cost minicab fare available from the hotel to Heathrow for GBP38 which is cheaper than the taxi to Paddington plus the Heathrow Express one-way for 2 people.Would I recommend the hotel, and would I return - absolutely! The feeling is personal and the staff delightful and the overall experience very pleasant.

<Content>Excellent Choice! After reading about Luna and Simone on this website, I decided to book a stay from February 24-27, 2006. Two brothers have operated this hotel for almost thirty years. From these owners to the cleaning personnel everyone was friendly, knowledgeable and very welcoming. We arrived at the hotel early, and were able to get to our room early. (I think he could tell that we were exhausted from travel.) The morning breakfast was very good and the room was nicely appointed with attractive facilities. The hotel's location was perfect, being only about two blocks from the Pimlico Tube Station on the Victoria line. With the Tube so close and the bus stop right in front, we were able to get to all of our sight seeing with only a short ride. When we checked out we told the one brother about reading the review on this website, he told us that they do not spend much on advertising, and instead put the money into the hotel and the service. It definitely shows! I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Wonderful service, great price, and a great location. Without a doubt, I will stay there when I return to London in the future.

<Content>Lived up to its reputation i was thinking there was no way this hotel could live up to the reviews on this website but it has been fantastic. Beautiful new clean bathrooms, clean rooms, good service, fantastic breakfast (bacon, eggs, beans, toast etc. You can leave your luggage with them when you arrive and depart, it is close to the tube, its warm and there is free internet in the lobby - you really cant go wrong!

<Content>Perfect location, great value We spent 9 nights in the Luna and Simone Hotel based on the positive reviews on this site. It lived up to our expectations.The Pimlico tube station is a 5 minute walk. We used the Victoria station only when we used the regular rail services for day trips, because the entrance to is on Belgrave Road. The Victoria tube station is on the other side, off Wilton Road, and is a bit farther than Pimlico. We used an internet cafe on Wilton Road which is part of a Subway restaurant.We have stayed in much smaller rooms, and thought the size was fine. We had plenty of room and storage space. The bathroom had a shelf above the toilet to store bath items. The room was always spotless when we returned, and we were messy! Showers are HOT and powerful. Wow. We brought a big bar of soap with us-- recommmended.Our winter rate was 60 GBP, a real bargain. We had room 9 which did not face Belgrave Road. I don't know how noisy a front room would be but Belgrave is not a high traffic street. We made one local telephone call and were not charged for it. When we paid our bill the day before we left, the reception offered to arrange a 5 a.m. wake-up call.I can't comment on the breakfast because we never ate it. We don't like hot breakfasts, and we're vegetarian and don't eat sausages. On Tachbrook Street there is a wonderful bakery and we bought bread and cheese for breakfast. Further up on the street there is a Saintsbury supermarket and on Warwick Way there is a Tesco grocery. We didn't eat at any of the pubs and small restaurants in the area because we had theater tickets every night and ate in the theater area. Restaurants near the hotel include pubs, Indian, Thai, Italian, and French.Belgrave Road is a lovely walk to the tube. There are many small hotels along the street in converted apartment houses. We usually returned to the hotel after 11 p.m. and felt very safe in the area.In Canterbury my husband bought a suit, and we told the salesman about the hotel because he was going to London the next week. He couldn't believe the price we paid. He said he had paid 180 GPB for a hotel recently.Don't hesitate to stay here!

<Content>Nice place for limited budget My experience with this place was very positive. The room was small but clean and comfortable. The location is excellent, close to several major tourist spots and close to public transportation (5-10 mins walk to underground stations and a bus stop (24) right in front of the hotel). For anyone who does not want to spend a fortune staying in London, I strongly recommend this place.

<Content>Look no further! I searched through many other websites before finding this great hotel in Pimlico, central London.This is an excellent hotel in all respects - friendly, clean, comfortable, exceptional value and good location.This family run hotel cares about it's reputation and it shows. The room was spotless, the staff friendly and the breakfast extremely good.We will return again, without hesitation.Chris and Joan, Bedfordshire, England.

<Content>The PLACE to stay when you are in London This is a lovely and full of charme Victorian Hotel.The room I got,although small but cozy, was very clean. The staff is very friendly, kind and helpful. Great location (about 10 min walk from Victoria station and 5 min from Pimlico tube station), decent breakfast.

<Content>So Friendly - Great Location I came to Trip Advisor to find a hotel to stay at for the one night in London before my tour started! The Luna Simone received many great reviews and now we see why. The rooms were clean, roomy  comfortable and the staff was so very friendly! It is a very personable place! We were able to walk to Buckingham palace, to Westminster Abbey  the London Eye. It was located in a lovely section of town with lots of good pubs. Also, the breakfast was excellent  the breakfast room is almost like a visiting place for the guests. It felt more like a Bed  Breakfast atmosphere than a regular hotel!I highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>Was very pleased indeed Stayed there for 8 nights. Room was small but kept very clean and confortable. Having internet access was a bonus. Breakfast was quite good and they had additional items available if you asked -- yogurt, oatmeal, pouched eggs, etc. Staff was very friendly right from the start. Not fancy but so what -- I was out most of the day anyway! Short walk to Victoria tube station and #24 bus right outside door. You'd be hard pressed to find a better value

<Content>Wonderful  My husband and I stayed in a double room at the Luna Simone for 3 nights in Sept. 2005 and we could not have been happier. Staff at the front desk were very friendly and all e-mail inquiries prior to our arrival were answered promptly. The Luna Simone is conveniently located in easy walking distance of Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace, and even Westminster Abbey. For anywhere else in the city - just walk across the street to the bus stop and jump on for anywhere you want to go. The room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom looked like it had been recently updated. Breakfasts in the morning were good. But the best part was that the room cost only 80 GBP per night for our stay - an unbelievable price in the high-priced city of London! We highly recommend the Luna Simone and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Accommodation My husband and I stayed at the hotel in January this year. The hotel is very very clean, the bathroom is very clean, the bed was comfortable, good breakfast, the owners and staff were friendly and helpful, the only negative thing the room was small. The hotel is in a good location, restaurants, supermarket, shops and transport. If we ever came back to London we would definitely stay there again.

<Content>wonderful little hotel in a big city I have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Hotel LunaSimone after a holiday in Morocco. The hotel is small but I have never met such friendly staff , especially the young son of the owners who is normally in the reception area.Nothing was too much trouble for him. Rooms small but with very comfortable beds and extremely clean, which is all you want when you are in London.Perfectly adequate breakfast (even thogh it is served a little too early for those who may want to sleep a bit more) We were within walking distance of Buckingham Palace and in fact on the first day there, we walked from Hotel to the Palace taking in a lot of sights before ending up in Covent Garden.Got a tube back! The second day also walked a lot though going further afield hopped on buses and tubes with a one day travel card.In the evening after going to see a show in Leicester Square, we realised that the no 24 bus which leaves from there dropped us right outside the door of Hotel.FANTASTIC LOCATION and would thoroughly recommend this hotel.Family run ,and it shows with its dedication to please its guests.

<Content>Recommended!!!! Just from the booking you will understand it's a place where people will take care of you. I called directly them and i arrange the staying in minutes. The hotel is really nice, clean, and quiet, at least my room which was 12. Only real disadvantage is the number of steps which divide the hall from my room(72....i counted them), but you get used with it and you'll have no problem. The hotel area is really safe, as you will notice a lot of BMW and Mercedes parked all night long in the street. The position is excellent. Victoria station is only 10 mins walk away and it's very near to ryanair coach bus stop..with lugguage it took no more than a quarter of hour, and we didn't know exactly the way. The breakfast is excellent. Toast and marmalade as you like, nescafe coffee, orange juice, and a choice of bacon,eggs and beans. Definately recommended

<Content>Average Everything about this hotel is average. I didn't find the staff terrribly friendly. Rooms have been cheaply refurbished. Advise against a room on the upper floors unless you want a workout climbing the narrow stairs. Breakfast is limited and hotel is actuially closer to Pimlico than Victoria. Unsure why other travelers give this establishment such rave reviews.Have been to London half a dozen times and first time staying here, won't stay here again.

<Content>Great stay We stayed at the hotel over New Years weekend, 2 adults and 3 kids 8-14 yrs. old . Very clean, quiet and a great location. Breakfast was filling and everyone was friendly. They even helped when I realized I didn't have enough pounds for the cab to the airport at 5AM! Would stay there again in a heartbeat!

<Content>Great B Great BB and location. I would definitely stay again. Some secrets. There are a few rooms on the same level as office so no lugging luggage up stairs. You have to reserve in advance. And, if you pay cash there is a discount. Worth asking about. The shower has the best water pressure in England. Friendly, helpful staff and owners.

<Content>An affordable treasure My friend and I stayed at the Luna  Simone after scouring the internet for a rare (in London) compromise between cost and value. We were delighted with this hotel. It is in a relatively quiet and pretty street, only 10 minutes from Victoria station. There are plenty of shops/pubs/cafes etc within easy walking distance. The rooms are small, and there is no lift, but all is immaculately clean, and the bathrooms are verging on luxury. The staff are helpful and polite, and the breakfasts were fab. We also stayed in a hotel of a similar price in Paddington a few weeks later, and once we were in our room, we tried to get back into the L  S!! Believe me - the only thing the L S falls down in is size - and if that's REALLY important to you, you'll need to fork out lots more money. I'll certainly go there again.

<Content>This is the Place If you are going to London and want a great place to stay at an affordable price then this is the place. I just spent 9 days there on my first trip to london and the staff there is so nice and where very helpful to me. The room was great, perfect for me since i was just using it to sleep and not entertain and the area is really well located to anywhere in London you need to go. Whenever i go back to London this will be the place i stay

<Content>Great Place  We stayed at the Luna and Simone for 4 nights in the beginning of December and this BB definitely lives up to the great reviews on TripAdvisor. Very clean rooms, ample space to move around. The rooms have been recently refurbished and the bathroom/shower newly done up .. and yes, the showers are powerful! The hotel is quite close to Victoria station (5-7minute walk)and has a self service shop right next to it in Denbigh Street, where one can buy food, water and other basic necessities. Sainsbury's is also close by. The breakfast is lovely, especially the egg, bacon and beans option (which is served with toast, coffee/tea and orange juice) and the staff is very friendly and ready to help with any queries. The only thing which might be seen as a disadvantage is that the hotel has no lift, and since we were on the third floor we saw three flights of steps as a bit extra after a long day of sightseeing. But I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a clean, central place in London - at very affordable rates too!

<Content>The Place to Stay Stayed 5 nights. Very clean bedroom with twin beds with ensuite bathroom (shower with HOT water and good water pressure). Good breakfast - eggs, bacon, baked beans, toast, jam and tea was my choice. Very convenient to both Victoria Station and Plimico Station - only about a 5 minute walk to Plimico. A bus also stops right outside the door. Safe, well kep neighbourhood. For the price I don't know if this could be beaten. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Very good hotel My elderly mother and I stayed here for three nights and were given a room with easy access as requested. The room was small but adequate as we only needed a place to sleep. Both bedroom and bathroom very clean and a good flow of nice, hot water. Breakfast was juice, bacon,eggs,baked beans and 2 slices of toast with jam plus tea or coffee and was very promtly served. The young man at reception was very helpful carrying our bags to our rooms and also hailing us a taxi on our last day. The hotel is very close to Victoria train  coach stations. Will stay here again when in London.

<Content>Great value, great location I stayed at the Luna  Simone for five nights in October 2005. After less than desirable experiences with BB hotels in London, this one was a relief. Not only a reasonable price for London but friendly staff and well kept hotel. I had a single room with share facilities although it appeared I was only sharing the toilet/shower with one other person and it was situated conveniently just outside my room. Although a very small room it contained bed, desk, wall cupboard/wardrobe, towel rail, toiletry shelf, sink and tv on the wall. Hotel also appears to have been recently decorated, very spick and span. Breakfast was standard fare but well cooked and presented and the morning staff were very nice and helpful. The hotel also has a great location, handy for tube, coaches and trains ( Victoria )and is walking distance to Buckingham Palace. I would definately return to this hotel.

<Content>Above  Our honeymoon would not have been complete were it not for our stay at the Luna  Simone! Close to the tube station, right around the corner from fantastic restaurants - it is THE place to stay in London! After returning home, we realized we left the USB cable that connects our camera to the computer at the hotel. Luna  Simone's wonderful Mark was quick to offer to ship it back to us.This exceptionally clean, marvelously staffed hotel is a must for anyone visiting London!

<Content>Luna Simone What a Find We were in the UK last month and on our last night in London stayed at the Luna Simone. What a find!!! Very clean and a much larger room than our previous accomadations. There were three of us traveling together and we had a triple bed room on the first floor which would be great for anyone with children and lots of luggage. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Good location too, Belgravia-Westminster. There is a wonderful Italian resteraunt on the corner, O Solo Mio. I would highly recommend this BB to anyone on a budget or not.

<Content>Great Place! We stayed at the Luna Simone for four nights in mid-October, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The small room was nice, the bathroom was superb and the staff was very pleasant and helpful, especially at breakfast! (Watch out for the twins!) The location was easy walking from Victoria Station, and not too far from the tourist treats. We also explored the local restaurants with great success. I would definitely recommend this little hotel to travellers.

<Content>A hotel to fit your needs... My husband  I just spent 3 nights in London. Although climbing 3 flights of stairs to our room was tiring after a busy day of sightseeing, the hotel fit all of our needs. Peter, one of the owners, was always on hand for any information we requested and very friendly. (And when he wasn't there, his employee called him at home to check on a dinner suggestion he had given us!) We came in from Heathrow on the Tube (very easy to use for getting around town) to the Pimlico Station  walked pretty easily to the hotel. We made use of the nearby Victoria Station as well, approx. 10-15 min walk away. Relatively quiet room, but occasional traffic noise. The room was small but the bed was big enough and there was a fan, which we appreciated. The bathroom appeared to have been renovated and was quite clean. They cleaned the room daily. We cannot comment on breakfast, as we never made it down before 8:30 am to check it out. Internet access was available (1 computer). Check out their website, it portrays an accurate portrait of what you are getting for your money. We would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Lost reservation Based on the fantastic reviews on this forum, and the genuinely good value rates offered by the hotel, I did not hesitate in booking a room at this hotel for my upcoming trip to London. I phoned the hotel to enquire about availability for the dates I wanted and the lady at reception told me that the room type I wanted was indeed available for the 2 nights that I requested. I would have happily booked the room over the phone but I was told by the lady at reception that it would be best to book online on the LunaSimone website, using their online reservation form. I told her I would make the online booking in the next 5 minutes, and she asked for my name so that she could make sure that the room would be allocated to me. I was told I would receive an email confirmation of the booking the following day.Having received no confirmation email, I phoned the hotel 4 days later to enquire about my reservation - and to my utter disgust, was told quite plainly that my online reservation had not been received and that there were now no rooms available on those dates. A technical issue this may be - but it is extremely disappointing for a hotel that has received so many rave reviews on this forum. I am now faced with the arduous task of finding another well-rated hotel at such a good price in an ideal location for my trip at such short notice. Highly disappointing all round.

<Content>Convenient Location Good location, 10 to 15 minute walk from Victoria Station, so convenient if you come in on the Gatwick Express as we did. Near a street with many stores including a large grocery store - Sainsbury鈥檚- where you can pick up bread and meat or cheese for a picnic or snack, bottled water, pastries, top up cards for cell phones, etc. Hotel was on a relatively quiet street and very clean. Service was very good when called upon, but not in-your-face. Nothing spectacular or luxurious about this place, but very clean and good accomodations at a good price at a great location.

<Content>Good location and value We stayed at the Luna  Simone in September for a week. We arrived at Victoria Station late at night and were a bit nervous about finding the hotel but the directions from the web site were very good and we made the walk in about 10 minutes. We found the Pimlico tube station was about the same distance in the other direction and the bus stops right in front of and across the street from the hotel all made it a great base for sightseeing.We had room 5 on the Simone side. It's at the first landing so we didn't have to walk up too many stairs like earlier reviewers. We only heard people on the stairs a couple times, but there was a second door on the stairs that could have been closed if it bothered us.The room was on the small side but no smaller than where I've stayed in Manhattan. It was bright, cheery and clean. The bathroom looked recently remodeled and was surprisingly spacious, relatively speaking. Breakfast was the typical fare, I did mix it up as a previous reviewer recommended. We were pleasantly surprised to find the toast hot and buttered unlike our experiences on a previous trip to the UK.We didn't talk much to the owners but they were all very friendly. Overall it was a good experience and we would definitely recommend the Luna  Simone and stay there again.

<Content>Totally satisfied with our choice We stayed at the Luna  Simone for a week in early October '05. We had an extremely quiet (not facing Belgrave Rd.) and clean room. It was very small, but nicely appointed - except for the very hard bed. The bathroom was spotless and had an excellent shower. The staff were all quite friendly and the breakfast was very good. To clear up the earlier controversy about whether it's a full English breakfast or not, you get toast, tea or coffee, your choice of corn flakes or orange juice and (1) eggs, canadian bacon and beans; (2) two eggs or (3) cold tomato and ham. As mentioned previously, there is no elevator. There is high speed internet. The location is fantastic. Interesting, small restaurants abound. The Tate Britain is walking distance. There's a great supermarket halfway to Victoria, which, incidentally, is not the closest Tube station - Pimlico is two blocks away. Also, the #24 bus stops in both directions right outside the hotel. If you're there on a sunny day, try taking this bus all the way to beautiful Hampstead Heath, passing through many tourist attractions and fun neighborhoods on the way. The 24 will also take you within a block of Big Ben, Parliament and Westminster Abbey. It comes about every 5 minutes during the day. Beware - catching it from the immediate vicinity of Victoria back to the hotel is tricky. We'd definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>As Great as all the Reviews Say This hotel deserves the enthusiasm of the other reviewers. The hotel was very clean, the staff extremely helpful and attentive, the breakfast good. The rooms were somewhat small, but very comfortable, clean, and attractively furnished. Location was convenient, in a safe neighborhood with reasonably priced restaurants and charming pubs nearby. Close to metro and train station. Would definately return.

<Content>Not bad for London  Very clean, great breakfast, friendly staff except for the young lad on night shift who was a bit surly. Great location but found room quite noisy from street traffic and adjoining rooms-we were on the second floor facing Belgrave. The only real negative was being told we could not call our own taxi but that the front desk could do it for an exhorbitant fee.

<Content>Great Small Hotel This is a very nice small hotel in an excellent location. The twin room on the main floor was small but adequate. Triple room is much larger if it is available but bathroom is still somewhat small. This place is spotless! Breakfast was juice or cereal, a large quantity of hot toast and jams, ham and a choice of eggs and good hot coffee or tea. Close to lots of restaurants, try Seafresh (Great Eats London) for wonderful fish  chips (10 GBP, about $18.00 US but don't expect any bargains in London). Very helpful staff and 10 minute walk to Victoria Station, my mother and I felt very safe here. Also internet access. I will return.

<Content>Most Amazing Value! Nicest staff I have ever met! What a great little independent hotel. We had lovely triple rooms on bottom floor near breakfast room (family of six) with the cleanest bathroom I have ever had in a hotel. Well organized rooms with lots of hooks, closet space, shelves, etc. Excellent, delicious full breakfast every morning. Six- or seven-minute walk to Pimlico station, slightly longer to Victoria. Definitely lived up to its reviews, and I read hundreds before I booked. Child-friendly (we have four). It was the only hotel that met all my criteria before booking, and it met every single one of my requirements upon arrival with no disappointments. Stay at the Luna  Simone!

<Content>Terrific place. Don't hesitate to stay here. I relied heavily on Trip Advisor reviews in researching/choosing a hotel. The Luna and Simone was one of the few where the accolades were nearly unanimous; I need to add my approbation as well.While the initial walk from Victoria to the hotel seemed long, it was only because we were finding our way. Once established, it became a very easy, pleasant stroll (10 min tops). And there was always the No. 24 bus to whisk you from the hotel to Victoria Station, Westminister, Traflagar, Leicester Square (PERFECT for theatre purposes) and beyond. The tricky part was finding the bus stop BACK from Victoria Station to the hotel (honestly, it was easier to walk!). Tube service is also extremely convenient from Victoria (3 lines). If you're coming in from Gatwick, this is especially an ideal location.The room was a very good value for the location, pleasantly (though not opulently) furnished, of decent-size and immaculate; the room's fan was more than adequate during the heat wave we experienced (and I am very sensitive to heat). The breakfast was always fresh and piping hot; and the staff was friendly, courteous and helpful - especially in helping me find a Weight Watchers meeting in a nearby (but rather hidden) garden apartments' community center. Thanks Mark!I'd wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone and would glady stay at the Luna again.

<Content>Excellent!!! I stayed here for one night in mid August and let me tell you - I wished I stayed here longer! The staff was extremley nice and helpful. The breakfast was exceptionally nice and hot. The rooms were wonderfully sized and so clean. I was on a European trip for 2 and a half months and I must say, out of the 20+ hotels I stayed in all over Europe - this has got to be THE BEST!!!

<Content>Lived up to it's good reviews We had a pleasant 8 night stay at the Luna and Simone Hotel during April-May 2005. Positives include; great safe location - close to bus station, railway station, two tube stations, supermarkets and other food outlets, and theatres; Clean room that was made up every day, large bathroom and shower, helpful friendly staff, and adequate breakfast (not full English - just bacon, eggs, beans, toast and cereal). Negatives include thin curtains that let light in, light that flickered, noise from road, hard bed, hard water pressure in shower, and small room with no ventilation or air conditioning. The positives for us far outweighed the negatives. We would definitely return to this hotel -although not in the Summer months as the lack of airconditioning would be unbearable.Andrew and BronwynChristchurch, New Zealand

<Content>Great for the money My husband and I have stayed at the Luna  Simone three times in the past three years, so we know what to expect. Yes, the rooms are small, but all three times, the beds have been comfortable (we've had an American double and two twins at different times), the bathrooms clean and we certainly appreciated the coffee/tea maker. We found the breakfast ample and the staff polite and extremely helpful. The neighborhood felt safe and the #24 bus stop was right in front. I'll be returning again.

<Content>Great for family Stayed in a quad room, which we found to be quite roomy and comfortable compared to others we've experienced in the UK. The staff was always friendly, helpful, and professional. As with most UK hotels, there's no AC so it gets a big warm in the summer but the room had a huge window and fan that helped a lot (you certainly can't count on these everywhere). Surprise bonus was the little room where you could get DSL internet access on the hotel computer - nice for catching up on email from home, checking the news, or seeing a weather forecast. Location provides easy access to Victoria station, from which you can get anywhere in London or Gatwick Airport easily. It's also an easy walk to Parliament or Buckingham. Great value for a mid-London location.

<Content>Decent, not great The Luna Simone was clean, but (like too many London hotels) somewhat noisy. The room was tiny. Tube connections are fairly close, as is Victoria Station and its many connections. The room rate barely qualifies for the budget category (in my mind), but I guess it's OK for central London. Lots of pubs and small restaurants nearby. Overall, a decent place if not exceptional.

<Content>Clean, cosy, comfortable !!!! Excellent value for money hotel. Clean rooms, cosy and big enough -at least, the triple one in the basement were we stayed. Breakfast is delicious too. The hotel is family-run, and the Desira family, the owners, were extremely kind and helpful to us -especially because we arrived on the terrible day (July, 7th), no tube was available from London Bridge Station, and they didn't mind about our check-in time. It's ten minutes walking from Victoria Station, fifteen to Buckingham Palace, and you have a bus right at the door of the hotel to take you to the main museums. The neighbourhood is simply lovely: it seems a little village inside London, with nice restaurants, supermarkets (I recommend Sainsbury) and pubs (oh, The Constitution, how I miss your beer...)So... who could ask for anything more?

<Content>Don't stay here when it is hot in London. We had the misfortune to stay here during a London heat wave-33C/92F. The small fan could not cool the room. It is difficult to sleep when you are sweating. Even though we had prepaid the room, we left a day early. The nice features of the hotel other reviewers have mentioned cannot offset this one huge shortcoming when it is hot.

<Content>Great value for money! In crazy expensive London, it's hard to find decent, affordable accomodation. Our simple twin room here was small but comfortable - the staff accomodated our request for a quiet back room and it was nice. The breakfast was average. The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of Victoria station, which makes the price even more remarkable!

<Content>Good value, lots of stairs! My husband and I just returned from our trip to London where we stayed at the Luna and Simone hotel for 4 nights, then after a trip up to Scotland, we stayed again at the Luna and Simone for one additional night.Our first and longer stay we were given a room on the 3rd floor, which means 6 flights of stairs to climb. This was funny the first day, annoying the second day, and just made us grumpy by the last few days! We had just done so much walking during the day, that when we finally reached the hotel, getting up the stairs was a hassle. On our last day there, we were given the very closest room on the main floor, which we were so happy about. But, the window is directly at street level, so there was LOTS of noise. The breakfast was also early and forced me out of bet a teensy bit earlier than I wanted, but a decent breakfast, english style.The room was incredibly CLEAN! The shower and bathroom looked brand new and there wasn't even a speck of dust anywhere. Clean sheets, and even the garbage cans were clean! So, this hotel is great if you are looking for a nice, safe location, and super clean rooms. The staff was very helpful as well, someone was always at the front desk ready to help. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for good location, clean rooms with nice service.

<Content>Great B  stayed for 2 nights mid-May. A welcome change from the many BB's I've stayed in over the years -- very clean, updated, large room, TV, coffee making supplies, even a hairdryer. It was well worth the few extra dollars to stay here. Triple are only located on the first and basement floors - ours was in the basement next to the b'fast room. We never heard a sound, not even at b'fast. Very convenient to Victoria Stations. The staff were great! Definitely will stay there in the future.

<Content>Excellent location  We just returned from a stay at Luna Simone and were very pleased. The rooms are small, but standard European from our experience. They are very clean and the bathrooms seem newly renovated. Travelers who don't like or can't do stairs should be aware there is no elevator/lift here. We stayed twice here, once for 3 nights, then on our return to London from Italy, for one more night. The 3 night stay we had requested a quiet room and were given one on the top floor -- 7 flights of stairs, I counted! Not too much of a problem for us, but beware. On the one night, we were on the 2nd floor and it was just as quiet and comfortable.The full breakfast definitely adds to the value as does the location. The #24 bus which stops literally at the front door is a terrific plus. If we couldn't get somewhere on that (and it goes most everywhere we wanted), we walked the 7 minutes to Victoria Station and took the tube or train. This was very convenient as we went in/out of Gatwick and took the Gatwick Express train to Victoria Station. The area seems safe and there are a variety of restaurants nearby.The staff is helpful, and we received a discount for paying cash. We didn't know that was possible but one of the owners suggested it so we went to the ATM and withdrew enough and didn't use the credit card there. Ask if you're interested. We would definitely stay again, no question.

<Content>Excellent Service My wife and I stayed at the Luna  Simone after reading reviews on this site. We stayed for 2 nights and I have to say the service and locatation were both first class. Our room was small but very clean wih a good shower exactly what we needed. The breakfast was excellent (watch the plates their hot!!) as was the service by the family run owners.The location is very convenient for the tube. All in all excellent value for money.

<Content>Just Fantastic I stayed there for 3 nights on my Easter holidays and all I can say is that the place was great. The room was small but not tiny. The bed was very comfortable and everything was kept really clean. The bathroom was small but perfect with a powerful shower. All the tiles had been changed recently and the walls painted (it still smelt of paint). My room was number 9 and was really quiet. Breakfast was very good, you could choose between coffee or tea, orange juice or cereal, fried egg, grilled bacon and baked beens, two boiled eggs or ham and tomato, and also they gave you toast with butter, jam and marmalade.The staff was kind and helpful, always smily. The location was just perfect, very close to Victoria Station in a very nice and quiet neighbourhood. Bus n24 stops opposite the hotel and goes to Westminster, the Parliament, Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square, Tottenham Court (British Museum), Camden Town........Absolutely convenient. There were underground stations five minutes away (Victoria and Pimlico) but the bus was better and not so crowded. There were also plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby. I can recommend a Turkish restaurant in Wilton Road called Mezze (but book in advance if you want to have dinner there as it's quite busy). There was a Sainsbury's supermarket close to the hotel and also a Tesco.I will definitely stay there again!!!!

<Content>Friendly, Comfortable Hotel I stayed at the Luna and Simone hotel in June of 2003, on the advice of a friend. I am glad I did. The hotel is reasonably priced, and for the price, an excellent value. It is located very conveniently near Victoria Station, which allows for easy access to the entire city. The rooms are simple, but not as small as some European hotels, and there is no air condition (there is a fan), but you do not need one for much of the year in London anyways. The bathroom is adequately sized, and the rooms are clean and tidy. The next summer, in july 2004, I stayed at the Park International Hotel (that's another sad story) because I wanted air conditioning, but now I wish I had instead stayed at the Luna and Simone again, especially since it rained most of my stay and was not that hot.Another nice thing about the Luna and Simone is its pleasant staff. The front desk clerk lugged what were very heavy suitcases of mine, up the stairs when I checked in. The breakfast was nice, and there were the most adorable, sweet middle aged twins working there, who along with everyone else, were very helpful and kind. I would definitely stay here again if I return to London.

<Content>good value Just arrived from London for 4 days. This hotel has very good location, good enough triple room, friendly staff, good breakfast. Maybe it was better if they had thicker walls, but you can't have everything, can you? We choosed it because of the reviews in tripadvisor and we are happy that we did it. When we visit London again, this hotel will be our first choice, naturally.

<Content>bacon  good value for money .. 拢75.- incl. cooked breakfast and taxes for 2 people .. quiet room, comfy, no frills, coffee  tea making facility in room, bathroom a bit tiny depending on your size, but CLEAN .. safe in room  tv, no minibar tho, no restaurant inhouse, but pizza on the corner of the road .. walking the stairs did me good .. lol .. no lift .. and now i can admit .. my daughter pinched a few strawberry jams on the last day .. she simply loved them :))))) .. 10 min. walk from victoria station .. 5 min. walk in other direction to tube .. double-decker stops IN FRONT of hotel .. lol .. we took a taxi from victoria (gatwick express from gatwick to victoria) upon arrival (tired, etc.) .. i think the taxi driver felt guilty of taking our money, it was hardly worth the drive !!! they kept our luggage after check out too !!! good value for money .. all you go there for is to sleep anyway .. after a long day in london !!!

<Content>I have always been glad I stayed here After numerous visits to this hotel I am always glad each time I return. It is conveniently located and the area surrounding it is filled with colorful markets and resturants. The brothers who run the hotel are fantastic, and are continually trying to make the place better rather than resting on their laurels. The breakfast is delicious and makes for a good start to the day. I have stayed in several different rooms and have never had a complaint about the facilities and this is the cleanest place I have ever stayed in. Everyone at this hotel makes a great effort to be sure your stay is completely enjoyable and all of your expectations are met. As a side note, about two blocks from this hotel is one of the last Cider Pubs in London called the Chimes. You'll find authentic and delicious English food and the best aged cider on tap. If you plans call for a visit to London you won't find a better value or more enjoyable hotel than the Luna-Simone.

<Content>Wonderful place. My decision for choosing this hotel for a short stay in September was based on the review in the Lonely Planet guide and the reviews on this web site. I was not led astray.Walking up four flights of stairs was a bit of a trial for an asthmatic however the helpfulness of the staff, the room, the location, the breakfasts and the price more than made up for it.I arrived before my room was ready after travelling for 20 hours from Australia - the front desk staff gave me towels and pointed me in the direction of a shower.On leaving, one of the staff stood in the middle of the road and hailed a cab for me.I'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>Better with Age Stayed at the Luna over Thanksgiving (11/25-11/27/2004). Fourth time in over 10 yrs. Entire place has improved greatly over the years; rooms very clean, updated and refreshing, breakfast very adequate, location-one of the best, and overall area has/is progressing into a very safe and enjoyable neighborhood. Will stay there again, but on a lower floor.

<Content>excellent value, good proximity, friendly staff First trip to London in September 2004. Had my choice of hotels in air/lodgeing package. Chose Luna and Simone based on reviews from this site. We were pleased beyond expectations. Very clean and comfortable, and the brothers who are the owners couldn't have been more accommodating. Located near major rail, bus, and underground connections made travel a breeze. Good English breakfast included in moderately priced rate. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London on a budget or those who do not demand five star ammenties.

<Content>Friendly - reasonble price (for London) - but . . . The hotel is a bargain given London's outrageous prices. Rooms are small (but not smaller than most budget European hotels), bathrooms were recently redone, and everything is very clean. It's a 5 minute walk to Victoria station (and the Gatwick Express), and a few minutes more to the Victoria underground station, which will connect you with everything. The staff is unusually friendly and helpful. Seemed genuinely interested in helping me solve tourist problems I'm sure they've heard a thousand times before.Drawbacks: hotel faces a very busy and noisy street. Lots of buses and trucks. And you will hear everything that is happening in the room next door. Our neighbors had a crying baby. If you are a light sleeper, this place will not work for you.

<Content>Simple and lovely My family and I stayed at the Luna-Simone Hotel for a week in November 2004. The hotel is perfect for the traveler who wants clean and simple accomodations. We stayed in 2 rooms, one with 2 single beds facing the street and then a few days later in a triple facing the back. Both rooms were well kept with modern decor and the bathrooms were immaculate. Rooms are snug but with everything you need, comfy beds, lots of towels, extra pillows (in wardrobe), coat hooks, safe, etc..Breakfast was delicious and served in 2 lovely light filled rooms on the lowest level. Staff is terrific, Peter was wonderful and offered excellent suggestions for tours, sites and transportation. The hotel held our bags while we traveled out of London, and staff couldn't have been nicer. Note there is no lift, for higher rooms, (#10, 11 etc.) you will make multiple trips with luggage.NOTE* the Victoria station is approximately a 15 minute walk, Pimlico is much closer, but you will have to transfer to all other lines. Bus #24 stops right in front of the hotel, will take you to Victoria and then continues to Trafalgar and beyond. Once we discovered this bus, we took it every time we left the hotel. It will save your back when transporting luggage to Victoria station.My one complaint: even though signs for no smoking are posted, we were bothered by smoking in the halls. This only happened on 1 night but we had to stuff towels around the door.A wonderful hotel which is highly recommended and an excellent value!

<Content>Absolutely loved The Luna and Simone Hotel! The Luna and Simone Hotel was an exceptional investment; I can't say enough about the quality of the Luna and Simone!!We stayed there for 5 nights and enjoyed every minute AND experienced no hassles whatsoever.The staff is very friendly and helpful, especially with travel suggestions. This hotel offers quad rooms which can be hard to find, and their rates are good.Our (quad) room was comfortable, clean and spacious. All appliances worked properly and it was even better than the picture online. They include breakfast in their price and it is served in a stylish cheery area. It is a satisfying meal and saves you both time and money.The best part is the location: you are a 10 minute walk from Victoria station and the Pimlico tube stop. We took several day trips using Victoria Station and it was invaluable to be so close.You can easily walk to Parliament, Westminster Abby etc. so it is good for tourists interested in these places. The neighborhood is also beautiful and very nice and quiet.

<Content>fantastic hotel! My husband and I just got back from our trip to London and we stayed for 4 nights at this charming hotel. First off I must say that we read tons of hotel reviews prior to our trip to find the most comfortable and affordable hotel, we spent weeks on the subject as it is important for me to come back to a clean and comfortable hotel after a long day. We finally decided on the Luna and Simone after reading reviews on this website and (terrific) reviews in Lonely Planet and other guide books. This hotel is managed by a family and each one of them is kind, warm, friendly, and will always go out of there way to make you feel at home. We were treated beautifully and kindly. Breakfast was excellent, you order something from the menu and then they make it for you so its always fresh, unlike other hotels where breakfast is served like a buffet and the food can stand there long after it was already cooked. The rooms are always clean, the bathrooms are a lot bigger than other budget hotel bathrooms that I have seen, you can shower comfortably and use the bathroom without feeling claustrophobic. THe double bed was in fact a bed, (not like in other hotels where they push two twin beds together). THe room is always tidy and neat and I felt very comfortable in it as it was so very clean. The location is just a 5 minute walk to pimlico station, and there is a bus stop right next to the hotel. THe hotel is located in a very nice looking neighborhood with lots of restaurants and shops nearby.All in all, we had a fantastic stay, and would definitly stay here again. Even if next trip our budget will be bigger, we will still prefer to stay at this hotel than somewhere else as we were so impressed by it.

<Content>Two thumbs up! My wife and I stayed here on our first trip to London. Room and en-suite bathroom with shower, were small, but comfortable, and more than adequate for tourists on the go. Room and hotel were very clean. Great location, less than a ten minute walk from Victoria station, with trains to Gatwick, and the Tube to Heathrow. Within easy walking distance of Westminster, Parliament  Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, etc. Lots of pubs, restaurants, coffee shops nearby. Staff were friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended!

<Content>Good tourist hotel We recently stayed at the Luna Simone while traveling to London. Our room was downstairs near the breakfast area which eliminated any issue with the lack of a lift. I thought this was a perfect level of hotel for people who just need simple, adequate accomodations. We spent most of our time sightseeing and found the convenience of getting to and from the hotel ideal. The owners were very nice and helpful. I would recommend to others traveling on a budget. Additionally, with the weather being cool, we didn't have any issues with the lack of air conditioning, which I could foresee as a problem in the heat.

<Content>I would stay here again! We stayed at the hotel for four nights in September. It was clean, comfortable and the staff were really helpful. It is within walking distance of Victoria station which makes it convenient for those wanting to get around central London. We stayed on the second floor and it was fairly quiet. Our stay here was much more pleasant than our stay at the Holiday Inn near Heathrow Airport.

<Content>A step (or two) up from a hostel We stayed at the Luna for two nights. It is a good little hotel, as one reviewing before us put, if you are a student travelling Europe, looking for a very comfortable alternative to a hostel or on a strict budget (which, especially in London, is important!). However, if you are expecting even Holiday Inn quality, you'd best not stay here. We liked the following things:1) location - the proximity to Victoria Station and Pilimco is excellent. And, there is a bus on the street as well. The area is safe, even at night. Victoria Station and its environs means being close to everything - major attractions and connections to Gatwick and Heathrow. 2) the bathroom was clean3) the breakfast was adequate. It saves you money, so we cannot complain.We disliked the following:1) there is no lift. We were near the top of the flat, and had to drag ourselves, and our bags, up 5 flights of stairs (and down). Not a problem if you are young. However, if you are older or have a disability of some sort, be aware!2) Noise - the walls are pretty thin. And with there being no lift, you can hear people dragging, banging, and pulling their bags down the stairs and bumping into the walls. This was somewhat disruptive through the night.3) The bed. While the sheets had been changed prior to our arrival, they had some stains (think skid marks). The blanket on top of the flat sheet also had some unsightly dirty stains on it that still gives me the shivers when I think about it.4) The smell. The room had a dank smell.In sum, the hotel is more like a student dormitory. If you are budget conscious or looking for a treat from the hostel life, this is a great find. Remember to bring your own toiletries as they only supply a small bar of soap in the bathroom. However, if you are expecting something closer to a hotel, you ought to consider other properties.

<Content>I love this hotel!!! I've stayed at the Luna-Simone four times within the last three years and I love it here! The rooms are affordable, very clean, and tastefully decorated, plus the owners are very polite and helpful. True, the rooms are a bit small with only a wall mounted fan to cool you off, but these are minor obstacles. Also, after a long day of sight-seeing, the last thing you want to do is drag yourself up a flight of stairs...but just chalk it up to extra exercise! I plan to stay here in the future.

<Content>Good value for money Stayed here in September 2004 for 9 days during my trip to London. The rooms are very reasonably priced (for London that is!) and quite comfortable. I had initially reserved a room with a shared bathroom but since none were available, they offered me a room with an ensuite for the same price. The room and the bathroom were both very clean. The English breakfast was basic but quite alright: choice of orange juice or Corn Flakes to start, fried egg with bacon and baked beans, hard boiled eggs or ham and tomato, all served with toast, and coffee (instant) or tea.Staff were very nice and helpful, going out of their way to get your questions answered. Location was fabulous: within walking distance to all the sites (Buckingham, Westminster Abbey...) and very close to Victoria station, making it simple and easy to move around.Only down side was the bed: a bit lumpy and hard. But I would definitely return to this hotel and would recommend to a friend.Note: you might want to book directly through the hotel, this turned out to be cheaper for me.

<Content>A good value and convenient My husband and I stayed here for 5 days in August and found it to be a good choice. We selected it for its convenience to Victoria Station (about 10 minute walk) and price. The staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms are small and basic, no AC but that was not a problem during our stay. They should invest in a few upgrades such as better pillows! The English breakfast was the most basic of any hotel we experienced (instant coffee only). Neighborhood was fine with several restaurants, coffee shops, bars, food shops around.

<Content>Recommend highly The accomodation was perfect for our needs (family of six). The bedrooms and bathrooms were spotless. We had three in each bedroom and had plenty of room. The hotel is close to main attractions and public transport. London was quite warm during our visit, but each room had a fan, which was effective. The staff were brilliant, and helped us with our special needs, above and beyond what we expected. Highly recommended.
