<Content>Clean and central Clean, well run hotel. However, we felt the room was overpriced as it was small and you could hear the lift albeit faintly. We originally had a room overlooking the street - which is far too noisy even with the double glazing and it was right next to the lift. Changed it to one at the back which was much better and enabled us to sleep OK. New Year prices were 200 Euros per night which was very steep given the busy location of the pedestrianized area around it. If you are looking for a more peaceful location - I suggest you look elsewhere.Plus points helpful staff.

<Content>Great hotel, great location Stayed at Hotel DAlbe for several nights it is a great hotel in an excellent location. You are right next to the Seine and walking distance to many major sites, restaurants, bars, cafes and bakeries in abundance right outside the hotel door. There is a great atmosphere around St Michel and Latin Quarter/ St Germaine. Lots of help from the reception on places to eat and directions. The rooms were small but adequate and spotlessly clean. The breakfast room was really lovely and a very good selection. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Very Happy... We showed up at 10 am thinking that we would just leave our bags and check in later. The man at the front desk was very nice, and we were able to check into our room that morning.All of the people at the front desk were considerate. The room was clean. We loved the balcony. The hotel is in a GREAT location! The metro station is just steps away from the hotel. The streets below are busy, so beware of the noise level at night.

<Content>Great Place to Stay This Hotel is in the heart of the Latin Quarter and is close to all attractions. We walked to them all. The room was clean and was serviced everyday and meals were not a problem as you have about 100 places to choose from right at your door. Would certainly stay again

<Content>Good location, nice decor, hot water problems Good points:very very central locationvery nice decor (much better than many hotels I've stayed at in Paris)Breakfast was good enough (with English newspapers as well)Good rate via laterooms.com at 150Euro per night.Bad points:I was on the 6th floor and with the windows open it was noisy, but expect that for central Paris.No air-con. I suspect the rooms will be very hot in the summer.NO WATER in the morning!! This happened twice!Reception greeting on arrival - the guy behind the desk was very miserable. However, other receptionists were very nice.

<Content>Modern, good value - unbeatable location! The location in the busy Latin Quarter is impressive - just 1 minute's walk from the Siene and the nearest metro. The hotel is smart, clean and professional. Room sizes are small, but not untypical for Paris. Good modern bathrooms and showers. No bath in my single room. For a budget hotel (I'm afraid that 鈧?50 a night is budget in Paris) it is fairly unbeatable. If you go for the more expensive rooms I expect you'll be on a higher floor, which I would recommend if you are sensitive to street noise - while the windows are modern and effective, hustle and bussle is all part of staying in the Latin Quarter.

<Content>Sensational Experience!!! Our Paris stay at the Hotel D'Albe was the best 3 weeks of our lives. Other than the magnificent city itself, the Hotel D'Albe, its staff and location were the major contributors to this perfect experience.  Manager Cyrille and her front desk staff (Cecile, Youri, Massi and of course, Alexander) were absolutely superb. They were very friendly, helpful and informative and by the time we had to leave, we felt we had made some Parisian friends. We stayed in corner rooms on the 6th floor (double) and the 4th floor (triple), with the delightful bonus of a glimpse of the Seine from our balconies. Both rooms were modern and bright and more than spacious enough for our needs. We enjoyed the fact that the surrounding area is vibrant and lively and had no problems with noise.  The breakfast room, supervised by the wondeful Sanja, was excellent with plenty of food and drink choices to kick start our days of exploring the wonders of Paris. The hotel's location is ideal. The jewels of the Left Bank as well as the Notre Dame, the Louvre, Tuileries Gardens and so much more are all within an easy walk. If needed, the nearest Metro station is only 20 metres from the front door. Paris and the Hotel D'Albe gave us the experience of a lifetime

<Content>Loved teh hotel d'Albe A small hotel right in the middle of the action in Paris's Latin Quarter. (excellent location). A good fun district, and within walking distance of many major attractions.Some rooms are very small but we were fortunate to get a small so-called 'suite' with room for three (with only two staying). Corridors were amazingly narrow.Beds were very comfortable, and the windows double glazed, mainly for soundproofing from the people crowded streets below. Breakfast dining room not recommended, and it was more fun to eat at the pattisserie right next door.The man on the front desk was very helpful, but a female person was not so good.Recommeded.Geoff H , Noosa, Australia

<Content>Great location! My husband, our 20 year-old son and I spent 5 nights at the Hotel d'Albe at the beginning of September and we shared a triple-bedded corner room. I'd forgotten how small Paris hotel rooms can be , but after I'd got over that, I was really quite pleased with it all. The location was great - although don't stay here if you want peace and quiet! Saturday night was buzzing just outside our room till the early hours, but other nights were much quieter. My son loved it - especially the clubs in rue de la Huchette round the corner and the cafe, le Petit Pont, opposite Notre Dame. My husband and I also loved it, me especially as i had lived in Paris and spent some student days there and I really love this area. With the Seine, Notre Dame etc so close it's an ideal spot. The St Michel metro is just a few metres away, but mainly I advise you to walk as Paris is a great city for that - the Tuilleries gardens, Champs Elysees, St Germain, the Marais are all easy to walk to. Lastly, I found the hotel staff to be friendly and polite and everything was as clean as it should be. Oh yes, my husband had breakfast in the hotel a couple of times and couldn't fault it.

<Content>No Eurostar bad luck not my problem The staff and management of this hotel would not attempt to help my wife and I in any particular way.We were stranded due to a fire in the Euro tunnel and with no flights available and all car ferrys to the continent fully bookedwe were stuck in England.We spoke to the Duty Manager to inform her of our situation and were told that it was not their problem and we would be paying in full for a room we could not use but could be resold.We have also sent several e-mails to the General Manager none of which have been replied to. We would've gladly stayed on another date had this been offered.I dare say that after this review we will receive an e-mail from the G.M with an offer to stay but unfortunately it will be too little too late. As I am a concierge in one of londons top hotels and I know what good service is I will not be staying in this hotel in the future and will not be recommending this hotel to my guests or fellow concierge in London.

<Content>Great stay The hotel was great. It was centrally located and extremely clean. The room was small - but that is to be expected in Europe. What the room lacked in size, it made up in character, cleanliness and recent renovations. The staff was nice as well. For what we paid - you cannot beat it.

<Content>Hotel D'Albe St Michel This is a excellent little hotel with a fantastic staff right in the heart of of it all. I hesitate in writing this as I am not sure I want the secret to get out!! Walking distance to everything. There must be 40 restaurants within 500 meters. There is a bakery right next door with great coffee. I can highly recomend staying here.

<Content>Nice hotel, noisy location We stayed at the Hotel d'Albe in a deluxe room for two nights. The room was very comfortable, with a small balcony that gave us a view of the Seine. The front desk people were polite and professional and spoke passable English. The location can't be beat, with the St. Michel metro and RER right around the corner. There are lots of restaurants and cafes nearby, all filled with people from all over the world. It's a VERY busy neighborhood, so if it's peace and quiet you're looking for, look elsewhere. While the windows seem well soundproofed, in late September the hotels seem to turn off the air/heat systems (this was true in all 3 hotels we stayed in during this visit). The weather was beautiful so we opened the windows to sleep, but the noise from the all-night party-ers in the street made it difficult. Bottom line, while this is a very nice hotel we'll probably stay elsewhere in the future because of the outside noise.

<Content>Beware of this hotel's cancellation policy ! My wife and I were due to stay at this hotel for three days in September, at the end of a tour of Brittany. Whilst in Brittany, my wife got the news that her mum was about to pass away, and we had to cancel our Paris visit and return to England urgently. We phoned the Albe FOUR CLEAR DAYS before our scheduled arrival, to regretfully cancel the booking, and we told them of the circumstances.The employee who took the call said that as we didn't have access to e-mail in Brittany, the cancellation was noted, and a refund of our deposit would be no problem.Following the death and funeral of our mother, we asked the Albe by what means they would refund our 鈧?80 deposit. They were totally adamant that there would be no refund, and I can't now persuade them otherwise. Needless to say, we won't be going there at any time in the future. There are plenty of efficient and friendly hotels in the wonderful Latin quarter, but this doesn't appear to be one of them.

<Content>Albe with atmosphere We stayed at the Albe on the recommendation of our neighbours who had been to Paris the year before. The Hotel is centrally located in the Latin qtr of Paris a couple of stone throws from Notre Dame and within walking distance of most of Paris's attractions  right next door to the Metro and Taxi stands.The rooms are small but very clean, and ours came with with a good sized double bed, two pillows each (unusual) a safe for valuables and a bar fridge with drinks at a reasonable price. The bathroom seemed new and clean. The room was serviced quite well each day and had a small balcony overlooking the Rue de la harpe....a very busy and soon to found out to be noisey location of Paris's latin qtr.The hotel reception area were very help in our enquiries and could speak very good english and made several suggestions about tours and visits, all of which turned out to be quite good.kBreak fast was provided for 10 euros each was typical of continental meals served in a clean and modern cafe style dining room with friendly staff. You only had to walk outside the front of the Hotel to find an abundance of restaurants, either eat in or takeaway, with a variety of food from Japanese, Greek (seems to be popular in this part of Paris), Lebanese and traditional French cuisine.Only complaint was the noise generated outside the Hotel of an evening where street buskers  rap dancers performed almost each evening to load music. Even though we were on the 5th floor it was most noticeable of an evening. Worst still was the bars just around the corner opened to 5am in the morning that attracted a number of young revellers who thought they could sing at 4.30am in the morning. Every morning at 6.30am the local rubbish collection is made outside in the streets which at times woke us up.The pluses were its location, cleaniness and modern facilities, versus getting a good nights sleep. Would recommend anyone staying there to get an inside room away from the street front.Also thought the tariff was a little high though you do pay for location and being right in the middle of everything. Overall happy with the Hotel and wud recommend it to anyone who can stand the noise.

<Content>Htel D'Albe is a mixed bag The hotel is in a great location, but is under construction and there was much pounding. The rooms are very small and cost more than many hotels that include breakfast (it was not included). Some of the staff were somewhat condescending and not helpful. I would not stay there again.

<Content>Loved this Hotel... I had never been to France or even Europe prior to this trip. I had no idea what to expect at all. I did a lot of research and found the reviews to be helpfull. We arrived in Paris and I was in awe, the Albe was a perfect location. The streets aroung the hotel were safe, as I found all of Paris to feel. The direct location of hotel is right on the river sienne, across from the Notre Dame, right in the center of the city. There was good food close by and excellent walking streets, it was definately where the life of the city felt to be. It was extremely loud all night long Saturday night, but the windows did a good job of dampering the noise, however we slept with the windows open. I would highly reccommend to anyone who wants a great location with a lot of action. Will definately stay again.

<Content>Great Hotel! Stayed at the Hotel Albe from July 14th to the 20th. It's in a fantastic location, the staff are amazing and the rooms are very clean. The hotel is right next to the metro and RER - could not have asked for a better experience.

<Content>For Paris, pretty good!! The plus things for this place is one its location, two its price (for Paris that is), three its decor (modern-ish) and four, its house keeping staff! These people worked miracles.The down side was the annoying security measure of leaving keys at the desk on entering and leaving, the room was smaller then expected, and the price (damn Paris is expensive)!!

<Content>Highly recommend We just returned from a 4 night stay and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Paris. The hotel was in a great location with a taxi stand, metro, and RER stations plus the Seine and Notre Dame right around the corner. The decor was tasteful and everything was clean and fresh plus the beds were comfortable - and best of all for the warm days we were there - the air conditioning works very well! The hotel exceeded my expectations, especially for the price paid.

<Content>Great place to stay Great location. With in walking distance of all the great sites. Very nice people at the front desk. Helped with restaurants that were very good. The rooms are very small but that is just Paris. The rooms are clean, the hotel in general was spotless. Breakfast was the best we had in France. Good variety from eggs, cheese, ham, cereal and fruit. Down side is the location in a busy young area. Rooms were quiet enough but the party atmosphere goes on until the wee hours of the morning. Overall, I would definitely stay at the Albe again.

<Content>Ideal Location for first time in Paris We stayed in the Albe Hotel for our recent first time trip to Paris. We had about 5 days to explore the city. We are urban dwellers in our early 30's and our trip goal was to experience urban life in Paris while putting 10,000 miles on our shoes during our short trip. A friend of a friend that has stayed in Paris multiple times and always stays at the Albe recommended the Albe to me.In general, I think it is the absolute ideal location for our needs. As I stated, this was our first time in Paris and the central location could not be better. I tend to obsessively research hotels before I travel and the location relative to the must see sites in Paris is what attracted me to Albe. The Albe is literally just steps into the left bank south of the Ile de la Cite. We saw all of the sites that we could comfortably see in Paris without ever using a cab. We walked and used the metro (subway) for all of our travel. During a random early morning jog I found myself in awe while running through the courtyard in the Louvre at the 7-minute mark.The hotel is on the corner of 2 small streets with lots of foot traffic and is just a block down from a major city street. The streets below the hotel are filled with some small restaurants with pizza, the ubiquitous gyro wraps, Greek fare, etc. There is a great little place just below the hotel, which has nice croissants, pastries, etc., for a French style breakfast. The street below is also home field for the local break dancing crews and random singing groups. Because of this, we could hear some classic 80's breakdancing hits at times during our evening naps. This was mostly nostalgic and entertaining. It was not an actual disturbance for us. The quality of the breakdancing was questionable, but I guess that is for another review. I will try to stay focused here.The hotel decor is modern. The elevator is probably the smallest that I have ever been in, but, like the breakdancers, it was more entertaining than problematic. We stayed in room 640 on the 6th floor. The room was small, but I knew this prior to coming and this was not a problem at all. There is room for the bed, small desk, small wet bar, and TV. There are no drawers, but the closet has shelves for your clothes. The bathroom was adequate size and has a shower with a tub.The hotel staff was always cordial, respectful, and helpful. I would stay here again, if I went back to Paris and wanted an ideally, centrally located, clean place to lay my head in between adventures

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! Myself and my parents stayed at this hotel near the end of April. We only had a short time in Paris so wanted somewhere central where we could see all the sites in a short space of time. The location was brilliant. It was right next to the River Seine and within walking distance of the Notre Dame, Lourve etc. We hardly had to even get a Metro pass for our time there.The hotel itself was really nice. The rooms were small, but good size for a central Paris Hotel. The room and the bathroom were very clean. The shower was powerful and the beds comfy!!!The reception staff were very friendly and helpful with all our questions.The hotel is also next to loads of restaurants so the only problem at dinner was deciding which of the many to go to!We paid for the breakfast there and was pretty standard but worth it for the convience.This was the thrid time I have been to Paris and it was definalty the best place I have stayed so far.

<Content>Paris in the Spring!!! Just returned from a wonderful week in Paris. 17 - 24/5/08. Hotel D'Albe - superb!! So central - walking distance from Notre Dame, La Conciergerie, Saint Chapelle, Sorbonne, Pantheon, Boulevard St Michel etc... The staff were extremely efficient and friendly, especially Cecile and Alexandrou. We unfortunately lost our camera, and the staff did their utmost to help us retrieve it. Rooms compact, but so clean. Beds and towels changed every day, and room fully cleaned daily. Lively nightlife outside, but we heard nothing when we closed the double glazed windows and put on air con. Breakfast in hotel was fine, but the weather was so lovely and there are just so many eateries close by, that we has breakfast alfresco most days- omelette du fromage, fresh juice and bread, croissants, cafe au lait- delicious!! We found a Monoprix supermarket on Boulevard St Michel - excellent French Merlot, under 3 euros - made a very welcome nightcap!! You most definitely will not be disappointed by Hotel D'Albe, and we intend to return on our next visit to Paris.

<Content>Superb location We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Considering how much luggage we had after shopping in London and Italy !! we found this hotel very easy to find and the location was perfect.It is walking distance (something like 80m) from the metro and RER so you can get anywhere very easily.The room was quite good. Breakfast was not included (and the price for breakfast was not worth it) which was fine as downstairs there was a lovely place to buy breakfast.It is located right in the heart of St Michel, there are tonnes of restaurants nearby so was very convenient if we had had a really long day and just wanted to grab something quick for dinner.Since it is right in the heart of everything sometimes it was a little noisy in the night but that didn't bother us too much as we closed the windows and put the aircon on. Also, as per most places in Paris the hotel staff don't speak much English.I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay in it if I were visiting Paris again.

<Content>Great Location Great location. Take the train from CDG exit at St. Michael / Notre Dame and you are less than 2 blocks from the hotel and in the middle of a great pedestrian area! There must be 50 different cafes, brasseries, bars, and take-away food vendors within 4 or 5 blocks.The area is loud at night and I did have a little bit of noise in the room, but not enough to make a rough night鈥檚 sleep. If you are really sensitive you may want to bring along some ear plugs. On the plus side the area is loud at night and there is lots of activity / fun.The rooms are average size (small) for a large European city. But there is plenty of storage and the bathrooms are very clean and modern.We did not try the breakfast at the hotel. There is an artesian bakery attached to the hotel and you can get a coffee and a croissant for much less.The staff at the hotel were nice when we approached them, but they did not go out of their way to say 鈥渂onjour鈥?or greet you in any way.I would definitely stay there again simply due to the cleanliness, the price, and the great location!

<Content>albe treasure First stay at albe was fantastic,we arrived off our flight at the hotel at 9.00am in the morning from australia and the young lady was most understanding and checked us immediatley into a lovely top floor corner triple room which overlooked the front street.We came back to this hotel after ' weeks of travelling and although the room was not as nice as our first stay it was by no means a disappointment.For travellers looking for value for money with the comforts of a very nice clean hotel and a perfect location and nice staff this is one hotel we can fully recommend after staying in a lot of hotels in paris over 4 stays in Paris over 2 years.

<Content>Quiet, clean and well run D鈥橝lbe Hotel is in a great position, no doubt about it. Yards from the Seine, yards from the St Michel Metro/RER, and thus directly linked to Paris CDG airport, surrounded by eateries of all standards and prices, its location is hard to beat.We stayed for 4 nights, including a weekend, and were fortunate enough to get a fifth floor room, with a small balcony no less, which afforded us an unexpected view across the river to the Louvre. The room was very small indeed, not unfamiliar in Paris, but fully equipped and decorated to a high standard in modern style. I wouldn鈥檛 want to stay in a room that size for a fortnight, but if you go to Paris for a weekend and spend so much time in your hotel room that you are worried by its dimensions, then frankly you need to get out more. The bathroom was a very comfortable size and again well equipped. Everything was spotlessly clean and in fully working order.With regards to the issue of street noise 鈥?no problem for us. Excellent double glazing plus our high floor kept out just about all of the noise. It really was astonishingly quiet. I note differences of opinion on the level of noise in other reviews, for which I have a theory. D鈥橝lbe is on the corner of two streets, Rue de la Harpe and (I think) Rue Hachette, in a typically triangular Parisien building. The former street is relatively quiet, whereas the latter is lined with restaurants of the noisy persuasion. If you end up with room on a low floor over the noisy street, you might be in trouble, however good the double glazing. On the other hand, Rue de la Harpe is just sheltered enough to preserve the rooms from the noise. I understand that all rooms bar some singles face one of these two roads. We were lucky, and therefore it was blissfully quiet for the middle of Paris.We didn鈥檛 do breakfast in the hotel: it鈥檚 expensive, and you can get fresh and excellent petit dejeuner at the Restaurant Saint Severin opposite the hotel for far less (and sit outside to boot). Alternatively, if you are off to the Louvre or the Orsay for opening time, try the wonderful La Fregate on the corner of Rue du Bac directly over the river from the Louvre for some proper Paris style.Note that prices in general in Paris now are sky high, especially when coupled with a nasty sterling to Euro rate. It鈥檚 pretty easy to blow 50-100 Euro on dinner, even without wine.Overall, Paris remains wonderful, and we had absolutely no issues with the hotel. Just ask for a high floor, de la Harpe side.

<Content>Great Service!! My husband and I stayed at the Albe for over a week and the location is amazing. A little below what we Americans over 50 years old think of as a 3 star hotel, but the staff were really great (good English), breakfast was good @ $10 Euro, room was very clean and the bathroom roomy and comfy. Room was a bit small but we are from San Francisco and the rooms are small here. I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat.Let me make a small but very important note. We booked a taxi to Gare du Nord for the Chunnel to London. We were cutting it a bit close but the taxi was on time so we got there with no problem. EXCEPT we left my handbag in the taxi! I called the Hotel and explained the situation. They contacted the Taxi company and the driver. He returned the bag to the hotel and the hotel shipped it to us. We didn't lose the camera with our 568 pictures, a full record of our trip. I could replace everything but those pictures.m  r

<Content>Excellant accomodation, perfect location... My sister, mother and I spent a fabulous 4 days at the Hotel Albe. This is a little gem of a boutique establishment, in the most amazing location. The rooms are not huge, but perfectly formed, exactingly clean, modern bathroom again extremely clean and the shower has great water pressure - don't you just hate a trickle when you get in the shower.Other reviews have mentioned noise from outside, but we found the double glazing great at blocking out the buzz from outside. The area is a busy, vibrant area lots of eateries and places to grab a coffee, crepes and even kebabs if that is what you are after. Just a note of warning, the drinks are ridiculously expensive in this area, even more so now that the exchange rate has changed to the Euro advantage. We loved the ambience of the area, and were so excited when we realised that the Notre Dam cathedral is a 5 minute walk away, and were speachless the first night we arrived and went for a walk to find this sight right on our doorstep. Also by the Cathedral is a stop for the Red bus sightseeing tour only 24 euro for two days and certainly a great way to see the city. Also down near the cathedral is also a multitude of boat trips, you can use your 12 euro ticket all day and hop on and off at any of the stops.My sister and mother and I had a great trip, in the most because of our great accomodation in the most amazing location. We will certainly go back, infact we are planning it right now. The staff were friendly, spoke perfect english, and even took our bags for the afternoon on the day we checked out.... I can't speak highly enough about this hotel!

<Content>Perfect for exploring Paris Front desk people are excellent and speak many different languages. Rooms cozy and clean. Great location in the Latin Quarter. The neighborhood has restaurants and taverns galore...some at fairly reasonable prices, so you can easily pop in after a long day of sightseeing. And you are literally one block away from taking a train, subway or bus anywhere in the city and beyond. Would recommend, even though at times, noise from the street did drift in a bit, and the beds were a bit narrow, but that's just an aside for those who care. Enjoy Paris!

<Content>Good Hotel in the Latin Quarter We stayed at the Hotel Albe for two nights with a room on the 4th floor. The room was very clean and modern but quite stuffy (despite turning off all heating appliances). We could not open the window due to street noise, which we could still hear despite the double glazing. Breakfast was quite good (continental with boiled eggs) although could be very busy. No problems with reception but annoying that there was no secure area for luggage (our bags were stored in a corner of the main entrance). Very good price and convenient location but I probably wouldn't choose to stay here again.

<Content>Lovely hotel in the Latin Quarter The Albe is very conveniently situated, whether you come by train or plane via CDG or Orly, in the liveliest part of the Quartier Latin. Rooms are small but very nicely decorated. Staff is extemely friendly, in particular the breakfast lady. Rates are quite acceptable.Some clients seem to complain about the noise but we did not notice it, thanks to the double glazing ... and the fact that it was too cold to open the window.I have been in many hotels in Paris and this one is on the top of my list for price/quality.

<Content>Lovely hotel and great nightly rate. This hotel is on the corner of a buslting street in Paris. Lots of food and very close access to the Metro. Notre Dame is viewable from the corner of the street where the metro is located. We had two rooms and were given one upgraded room. The upgraded room was larger overall and the balcony faced the busy corner that was the front of the hotel. Even though there was some noise in the street a little late at night and early in the morning, with the balcony doors shut it could barely be heard. Rooms were very clean and there was also a patisserie attached to the hotel.

<Content>Location !! Very friendly English speaking staff. Room small - standard for Paris - but had everything required for a weekend stay. Clean and refurbished in a simple modern style. Perfect location next to RER B station St Michel- good for both airports - and in the middle of all the activity you would expect of the Left Bank.. I would stay there again.

<Content>Location of the Albe Hotel was extremely convenient. Had a wonderful stay. The location was so convenient to the Metro, all types of banks, ATMs, restaurants, music, entertainment. We could not have asked for more. We would definitely return.The hotel  staff were very professional and helpful. Despite all previous warnings about the noise level; it really did not bother us. Expect a very tiny elevator -- only one person with two bags will fit. But this was really a very minor inconvenience.

<Content>Great location, in vibrant area! The area around St.Michel/Notre Dame has a vibe unlike any other part of Paris. Everyone has a different objective or assumption of what Paris will be like and for me this area fullfills the ideals I had in my head. The hotel less so, but it is a safe, clean resting place to lay your weary head after a busy Paris-like filled day. Luckily we stayed on the first floor so only made the mistake of using the lift once to take up our luggage. However after having stayed in numerous 3 star hotels in Paris I can assure you this is the norm. Also our 'non-smoking' room was equipped with an ashtray.Otherwise this hotel is a find. I got a winter promotion so feel it was worth the price I paid. The staff in the evening wasn't overly friendly or helpful, but not generally offensive. One tip would be if travelling in a pair and not a couple, you might want to book a twin room instead of a double as sharing the double with my aging mother proved to be a bit close for comfort ;)

<Content>Our 5th stay at the D'Albe Our fith stay at the D'Albe was as always excellent.The only downside was the smell of paint in the freshly decorated rooms.The D'Albe is in an excellent spot if you like to be in the hub of things. Plenty of restaurants on the doorstep, or if you prefer somewhere more intimate it is just ashort stroll over the river where there are many fine restaurants. The R.E.R. from the airport is only a couple of hundred yards from the hotel and the staff as always are friendly and courteous, we shall be back!

<Content>lovely, best position in town, really enjoyed it best position in town, just 2 minutes from the Seine and 4-5 minutes walk from Notre Dame. Beautifull bathrooms, rooms are small, but we were away for all day, so it was big enough just for a sleep. Curtains, carpet, bedlinen clean, nearly new. Staff very friendly, i can suggest it to anyone, we stayed in 8-10 hotels in Paris in the last few years, but THIS IS THE BEST so far. unfortunately we did not take any photos.

<Content>An excellent base for central Paris The hotel was just as expected - excellent in every way. We arrived on the Eurostar into Gare du Nord and then just a few Metro stops to Boulevard St Michel followed by a couple of minutes walk to the hotel. When we first arrived I thought we might have been disturbed by noise at night as the area was so busy but the double glazed windows kept all noise out. (air con available for the summer) Our room on the 2nd floor was small but very recently refurbished and the bed was as comfortable as ours at home! I don't think it would be worth paying for a bigger corner room as you'll want to be out all day visiting Paris. The bathroom had a bath with a shower over it and was large in comparison to the bedroom. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but went to the boulangerie just next door - wonderful pastries. I'd definitely recommend this hotel!

<Content>So-so Pros: Great location, very clean facilities, friendly and helpful staff, way above average breakfast buffet, air-conditioned roomsCons: Tiny-tiny rooms, those facing the street are unbearably noisy at night; thermostat in one of the rooms did not workBottom line: for 150 euro per night per double-room one can do better than this

<Content>Finally found Finally found a central Paris hotel which is reasonably priced, easy to reach from airport and train station by RER and Metro and is run by friendly people. Excellent location at St. Michel - quartier latin, clean, nice rooms, plenty of attractions in walking distance. Will surely stay there again.

<Content>Great for a weekend We stayed in the hotel for two nights for the recent France - Ireland Rugby International.On arrival we were informed that the lift was out of service, our room was on the sixth floor( Noise not an issue but maybe if you are located on the lower floors as the streets are busy below till all hours) and although this did not bother us in the slightest it may have been an issue with other guests.The hotel acknowledged this by giving us free breakfast for the two days, a nice gesture.Breakfast is not an option I would consider if I was paying as it is quite expensive for what you get, best to find a nice Cafe around the area.Other than that the rooms were clean, small but hey your not in Paris to spend it in a bedroom( Only a place to lay your head), and the staff were friendly.Location is central to a lot of attractions and with a Metro  RER stop at St Michel it is ideal for travelling to/from the airport and also to other attractions in the city.Would recommend the hotel and will return again.

<Content>Ticked all the boxes Fantastic location, lovely room larger than any we have stayed in before in Paris, we seem to have scored the best room in the hotel with corner view, wrap around balcony, glimpses of Pont Neuf. Vibrancy, music from buskers below...all faded into peace  quiet when we closed the doors. Having stayed in many different locations, left and right banks, this is our pick for best location, easiest for all sight seeing, RER and metro, and great selection of easy-walk places for dinner. Will be our first choice for our next Paris stay.

<Content>Great Location, Good Hotel This hotel is in a great location. The hotel is nice, but not great. This was our first trip to Paris, so I was not prepared fully for the small size of the room. Our room was nice, but small, not much bigger than a cruise ship room. The walls were a little thin, so we could hear things in the next room. We did not spend alot of time in the room, so the size was not a huge issue.

<Content>Great Little Hotel Stayed here for one night on my way from USA to Africa. Had a 15 hour layover and basically utilized it to lay my bags down, show some friends around town who had never been to Paris before, get a shower and a change of clothes before continuing on. Got there in the morning with three travelling companions and we were allowed to check into our rooms early, which was great. The hotel was doing some repairs on our floor and the lift was not functioning. Not really a big deal, though. Rooms were nice and modern. About the size you would expect in downtown Paris. Bathroom was great; very clean, modern. Location of hotel was fantastic. On the left bank right off St Michel, maybe 50 yards from the Seine. We had a balcony that looked out onto St Germain. I have been to Paris several times and St Germain is my favorite area. Room price was reasonable, and staff was pleasant. I have stayed in smaller, not so nice rooms for much more in Paris. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>A Fantastic Choice! I used TripAdvisor to select this hotel and it was absolutely wonderful. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the staff was helpful, and the location was amazing - Notre Dame and the Louvre were within a 10 minute walk plus an RER and a Metro station were practically outside the hotel's front door. The only bad thing about this hotel is that there's a lot of street noise - but that's to be expected in a busy area.

<Content>Average hotel, great location This hotel is an average three star which has a fantastic location right in the centre of Paris. There is a nice boulangerie outside the hotel. There are loads of restaurants in the vicinity but they are all touristy so I wouldn't recommend any of them. I would agree with the previous posts about the noise on Saturday night but the easy solution to that problem is to just party till 3 and then you'll come home to peace and quiet.

<Content>Great Find Great hotel in super location, right in the middle of all the hustle and bustle. The room was clean and we had a great view. The staff were very friendly.Right beside Notre Dame which made transport very easy to access. You can get the red bus that travels around the city from here. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>It was ok Our initial greeting at reception was quite friendly but on checkout we had different staff who were in fact rude. The breakfast was excellent  the girl who ran the breakfast room was extemely friendly  obliging.The location was excellent - 2 minute walk to the underground  very close to Notre Dame. The rooms were very clean  on the small side but typical for Paris. I feel it was expensive for what it was  I was not impressed by the rude receptionist.

<Content>Lift not working We had 2 kids aged 6 and 2 with us and stayed at the hotel for 2 nights in early Feb. The hotel is a 3 star but the location is rather central. Like most hotels in this city, rooms come in small sizes and of course the lift is almost non-existent or too small to fit more than 2 adults! To be objective, I will list the good and not-so good points.ProsThe reception was friendly and allowed us to keep the baby stroller with them so it won't take up additional space in our room.The heating was efficient and can be adjusted. The bathroom though small had a heater next to the tub/shower. The decor looked clean and modern.The room had ample wardrobe space to keep some of our things. And it had a safe where we kept our documents. The continental breakfast was very satisfying. They had a variety of cereal, cheeses, pastries, bread, yogurt, drinks and ham to choose from. You can also get orange juice, toast, boiled eggs and fruits as well as coffee on request. If you wanted expresso or cafe creme, you can request for that too. They also served hot milk for my son's chocolate. Anyway, I couldn't fault their coffee, it was good stuff.The hotel's location is very central (in Latin Quarter) and near to several metro entrants. Except when you have a stroller... There are tons of restaurants, cafes, bakeries, shops and take-aways in the immediate vicinity, so food is not an issue for those who stay here.The semi pedestrian streets are easy to stroll around and plenty of actions during the weekends and the evenings when the place gets more vibrant.ConsWe had a standard room for 3 and it was on the 4th floor - the view of room faced the unscenic view of the semi-delapidated building directly across the hotel. The lift was under renovation whilst we were there and so the noise of drilling can be heard during the day. But just imagine walking up 4 storeys, it was exhausting and something I'm not accustomed to. NOT good at all.The rooms are hardly sound proof and you can always hear your neighbours come in and out. Never mind that.But what's unbearable is that the street is noisy especially over the weekends and the windows are not sound proof enough from the rowdy activities out there. The noise level didn't die off until about 4am!Would I stay here again? I'm not sure as I suspect the rest of the hotels in paris are not that much better given my requirements for a central location without blowing my budget.

<Content>Woke up to someone having nicked my bag from my room Was meeting some friends from Norway in Paris the first weekend of February. However, they got stuck at the airport due to bad weather, so I had to spend the first night at the hotel alone. As I was alone, I made sure to lock the door and hang the do not disturb-sign on the door before going to bed, as I wanted a good nights sleep.The next morning however, I couldn't find one of my handbags. And the door was slightly open. Ran downstairs to the reception, but they hardly listened to me, refusing to believe that someone could have entered the room while I was sleeping.And first then was I made aware of there being a safe in the room and given a key to it - a bit late isn't it, when your passport, ticket back to London, Ipod and camera is missing?!So we had to spend half a day at the police office reporting the whole thing - our trip obviously didn't start off so well.However, it doesn't stop here. The next morning, me and my friends was going downstairs when one of the girls, half laughing, said that isn't your bag though, is it? pointing at one of the maids carrying a hand bag. Well, it bloody was!!! So I told her I wanted my bag (!), she carried it downstairs to the reception - and apparently it was found where the cleaners keep bed linen and towels. Thank god, my passport and train ticket was still in the bag, but my Ipod and camera wasn't of course.The next day I spoke to the hotel manager when checking out. He did apologize for what had happened (although refused to believe that someone employed at the hotel could have done it - who else could have opened a locked door though - and known I was alone in the room?), and told me that I would get my losses refunded through the hotel's insurance. I sent them the receipts as soon as I got home, but I still haven't heard from them, even after sending follow up e-mails.By all means, the hotel was cute - but it doesn't help much when you get robbed in your room while sleeping.

<Content>Great,Great,Great This was my 3rd time to wonderful paris,Having stayed in the hilton and another bigger hotel,i really wanted to get a different feel to my stay.I booked this hotel on the reviews on this website.And it was great.You couldnt ask for a better spot.So close to everything.Rooms are small,but how much do you stay in your room for!! I really would stay here again and will tell all my friends to do the same.The metro is so close everything is within walkind distance.We went to some great place to eat(on called chez paul) which was amazing.Also if anyone is going to stay in the hotel there is an amazing man who sits outside at night who paints names,he is so so so good and only charges 5euros,i had one done for my son and it is totally out of this world.

<Content>Great hotel - no complaints at all We stayed in this hotel for a long weekend in mid-January for our wedding anniversary. The location is absolutely perfect, on a pedestrian street round the corner from Notre Dame, opposite metro stop St Michel (direct line from Gare du Nord).I chose a special offer on an upgraded room, which was very nice: decent size, nice bathroom, everything perfectly clean.The only downside was the bed was two singles put together, not a double as we had hoped. We gained more space by upgrading, but this meant twin beds sadly.The area is busy at night, which is good if you are nervous about secluded spots in unfamiliar cities. We did not suffer from noise as the previous reviewer did, although there were some street performers during the day and evening. Most activities ceased by midnight, but the occasional shout from passing people could disturb the lighter sleepers, I'm sure.The staff were friendly and helpful, and we couldn't fault the hotel's standards.

<Content>Great location We stayed in the Hotel D'Albe for a nice long weekend 11-14th January 2008. Coming from London on Eurostar it is ideally located on Line 4 of the underground from Paris Norde. Come out the correct gate and it a very short walk to see the Hotel clearly labelled and visible. Rooms are very neat and clean, bathroom very clean. Rooms serviced daily at a high standard. Staff are very courteous and helpful. My first time in Europe I was amazed at the ease with which the recepionist switched from French to English as she greeted me and saw I spoke English. Booked over the Internet with the special proce bookin was swift and clean. Only one night payment required up front, the rest paid upn departure. The Seine was visbile from our third room wndow. Countless restaurants where nearby ranging through all palates and price ranges. The breakfast in D'Albe was a great and substantial start to the day. A few short steps saw one on the bank of the Seine with the islands and Notre Dame a short stroll. On departing they stored luggage for a later pickup.I have always liked to get a fine location near the centre. This certainly fitted it for me at a quite reasonable rate.

<Content>Great little hotel! We booked this hotel on-line and were extremely pleased with the price as well as the location. The staff were very friendly, helpful, and even booked us a very nice dinner at a local French bistro. We plan on staying at the Albe again the next time we are in Paris.

<Content>Great value for money! The location was perfect, right in the heart of the Latin Quarter. The standard of the rooms was excellent, very clean and fresh with no fuss. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the breakfast was great, offering a great variety of choices.I would definately stay there again and recomend the Hotel D'Albe to all my friends.

<Content>Just about perfect for a burst visit to Paris I have had the te pleasure of visiting Paris many times, and have stayed in all manner of hotels and apartment rentals. I have recommended D'Albe St. Michel to my friends for years for its perfect location (Place St. Michel, literally a stone's throw from Notre Dame, and almost atop the St. Michel Metro entrance which serves the same Metro line as Gare du Nord and the RER line for the Eiffel Tower) and its pristine servicable service standards. This is the hotel for any visit that puts a premium on being out and about. D'Albe St. Michel is a fantastic value...almost too good to be true given its location and standards. Sure, teeny tiny rooms (but not abnormally so), and no services (offers a continental breakfast in the lobby, if you somehow find the bakery just outside the hotel's entrance to be too good to experience), and sure it practically anchors the restaurant alley, but there is absolutely no risk in the D'Albe St. Michel. If you want better restaurants, the Metro will wisk you whereever your heart desires, and practically all 4/5/6 Arrondissement restaurants are within a 15-minute walk at most, and most far closer. Sure, you can pay more and get more, but if your time in Paris is to be spent outside of the hotel, you can't do better than D'Albe St. Michel.

<Content>Perfect location Great location. Right beside a metro stop but you can walk to all the central sights. Surrounded by restaurants. As others mention you may wish to take ear plugs if you are easily woken by noise. Contrary to others we were not impressed by downstairs bakery- ok for convenience but produce nowhere as nice as you could get elsewhere- try the markets 5min east along Bld St Germain.Overall would recommend and would return next time in Paris.

<Content>Gorgeous little Gem in Prime location My husband and I have been all over Europe, and by far Paris is one of our favourite cities. We stayed at the Hotel D'albe for 6 nights and had a fantastic time. The hotel is utterly fabulous. It is in a great location in amongst the bussling streets of the latin quarter. There are a plethora of restaurants on your doorstep and the bakery located in the hotel premises is amazing. I highly recommend any baquette or coffee here, sitting on the street watching the Parisien world go by. The rooms are comfortable. As with all european rooms they are small, but how much time would you spend in a room when you are in Paris. The best part is the windows are soundproof so you wont hear anything, but there is nothing better than opening the doors and getting the smell of food wafting in the window, along with the sounds of Parisien streets. The breakfast is great and the best part is the convenience of the hotel. The lourve, and Nortre Dame are a short walk, but if you cant be bothered then jump on the fantastic train system located just outside the hotel. Big thumbs up to this hotel we recommend it to everyone

<Content>location, location This is a great little hotel in a superb location - 150 yards or so from the river and with a lively street below.The hotel is clean and attractive. Rooms are small, but attractive and with all the essentials (take your own kettle though if you like to make a brew).The location is fantastic - the down side is that you're likely to experience noise late evening - so you may want to take ear plugs if this might be an issue for you.Staff are very helpful, they went the extra mile to help us sort out a restautrant for New Year's Eve, and it was no trouble to leave bags on our last day when we were catching a late train.Do watch out for pickpockets in Paris though, one of our party had her Ipod stolen en route to the hotel - not a great introduction to paris!Breakfast in the hotel, or pick up your choice from the excellent boulangerie below.

<Content>Simply Fabulous! (heated towels, great location - what could be better?) While in Paris, I stayed in two different hotels (Hotel Muguet and this one), this being the latter and the better (from 12/12 - 12/14/07). We booked a triple room which came with: 1 double bed, 1 single bed, a flat screen TV (2 English-speaking channels), safe box, and a large-sized-for-Europe bathroom (equipped with standing shower, hair blow dryer and heated towels!!) The only downside to the room is that wireless internet connection is not free. (They sell access cards at the front desk and there is also an internet cafe around the corner from the hotel.) The front-desk folks are extremely nice and helpful!The surrounding area can only be described as perfect! The area is very lively in the evenings and very safe during the day; we did a few morning runs along the River Seine, which is just a stones throw away. Right downstairs from you is a bakery for your morning croissant and coffee. On every street flanking the hotel, around every corner, and across the way are plenty of souvenir and Parisian shops (Etam, Cote a Cote). There are also numerous restaurant choices all around, a French book shop right across the hotel door entrance, and for those aching for a regular sized coffee by American standards, there is even a Starbucks just 2-3 minute walk away (although I preferred the downstairs bakery)!Here is the approximate time/distance it took us to get to various places from this hotel:Notre Dame Cathedral - 5-10 minute walk (cross the bridge and you're practically there) Monmarte (for the Moulin Rouge) - 15-20 minute cab rideGare du Noir - 20 minute cab rideMetro stop - 1 minute walk (Saint-Michel stop)I would absolutely stay at this hotel again and definitely recommend it!

<Content>LOVED this hotel and Paris!!! We LOVED this hotel!! I did a lot of research for a mother daughter trip that my mom and I took to Paris. It was very important to us to stay at hotel that had a good location, clean American bathrooms, and a great ambiance. This hotel is everything we were looking for. We waned to stay where the action was and this area of Paris is full of restaurants, sights, and shops. The hotel is a block of off the river and a few blocks from Notre Dame. It is also a block from the Metro. The hotel is small and very cute and has a great Paris feel. There is a bakery downstairs that is to die for and has the best French pastries. It is a great place for breakfast. We did all of the normal Paris things, but our favorite was just to wander around and look at all of the amazing architecture.You will not be disappointed at this hotel. .

<Content>Lovey hotel This hotel is ideally located, its so central and considering we were in Paris during the strike and needed to walk everywhere it was a godsend! The hotel was lovely and clean, the room was comfortable and tastefully decorated, we even had a little balcony, the bathroom was clean and modern, it was a lovely room, much nicer than expected for the price we paid, the room was not as small as I expected from Parisian hotels, not that we spent much time in it! The staff were very friendly and helpful, particularly with our transport difficulties getting to Beauvais on a Wednesday morning with little or no metro running. The metro stop was only a few steps away from the hotel if we had been able to use it. We had a fantastic few days and were able to find our way around Paris so easily, we were minutes from Notre Dame, the Louvre and Musee D'Orsay. There are also loads of boutiques, restaurants and pubs in the area that are easy to find, the famous Boulevard St Germain (shopping) is a few minutes walk away.

<Content>Great position, typically parisian staff The hotel is in a fantastic position  very close to many of the major sights. Rooms are clean and tidy but quite small - this was expected in Paris. The hotel staff were 'somewhat' helpful but could have been more friendly. I was ill  my husband attempted to order a cup of tea via room service (which they provided a menu) only to be told that they don't actually have room service. He finally got a cup of tea (although they dont have a kettle  heated the water in a microwave)  charged us $5 AUS dollars for the cup of water.Overall we enjoyed our stay at the hotel, and if you are looking for a simple  clean hotel in Paris we would recommend it.

<Content>Fabulous Fabulous location, exactly as described by previous reviews in tripadvisor. Spotless, up to date, wonderful breakfast- I think it is a much better deal than the bakery next door because of the neverending cafe au lait, croissants, pain au chocolat, lovely room and lovely waitress. Our only complaint was the noise late at night ( Friday and Saturday) and since the air conditioning was off . If you wanted some air in the room you had to open the window- when the window was shut , the noise was no problem- Took the RER train right from the airport and walked the 50 yards or less to the hotel- Great for a long weekend Walked to all the museums, le Marais district, etc...

<Content>We loved the A This was not the first time we stayed at the Hotel d'Albe. We returned because it was found to be excellent during a previous stay and this at a prime location (Quartier latin).This time we stayed there during the strikes (metro, opera...). Our previous experience was not only confirmed: excellent location, nice rooms, very good service. On top of that we met very frienly and helpful people, and this starting with a really nice breakfast served with a beautiful smile.We will return, but the preferably without the strikes!

<Content>Wondeful stay in Paris The Albe was a wonderful place to stay if you are on a budget and want to visit Paris. The location is great, definitely within walking distance to many of the major sites and very close to the Metro and RER. The room was clean, comfortable, and a decent size compared to other Parisian hotels I have stayed in. The staff was very friendly and helpful in offering recommendations. If there was anything I can say that was not perfect, it would be the noise on the weekend evenings. It wasn't too bad, but the location gets very busy in the evening, especially weekends, and had our room not been on the top floor it might have been a little more annoying. Overall, this is a great choice and offers a lot for the price.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Location! We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights at the end of October, and would have nothing but positive things to say about the place.Location: Right beside a few metro/RER lines, one of which connects directly to CDG. Right beside the Seine (Notre Dame very close by) and it's walkable to anywhere as far across as the Eiffel Tower. Great (and heaps of them!) restaurants nearby and a lively area at night.Hotel: Small-ish but modern and perfectly clean - everything you could need is there. We had a fourth floor room looking onto the street (as all of their rooms do). Breakfast was available in the hotel (and looked very nice), but we chose to wander to the nearby cafes most mornings.Staff: The staff were very helpful throughout our stay, recommending things to do and times/days to go there.Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone heading to Paris!

<Content>great little hotel We have just returned from Paris where we spent 4 wonderful nights at the hotel D'albe.We first stayed at this hotel in July last year after finding out about it through trip advisor.Last year we had 2 rooms as we were travelling with our 2 teenager daughters. We loved everything about the hotelIt is very central , right near the underground and many restuarants and Paris sights.Despite being in a very noisy area the double glazed windows kept the noise down.The rooms are small but spotlessly clean and very comfortable.The breakfasts were outstanding and run by the most delightful and helpful waitressIn fact all the staff were most helpfulThis year we returned to the hotel in October after our wonderful summer holiday As last time the rooms were clean, breakfast great , staff pleasant BUT no air con . it was explained that as it was not summer it had been turned off. The only problem was that due to the incredible noise outside we could not open the window so the room was unpleasntly stuffyI will return to this hotel but will make sure it is in the summer months when the air con is turned on.

<Content>very cute hotel in latin quarter A very cute no-frills hotel in the heart of the Latin Quarter. Small but tidy rooms. Right above a delicious bakery. Lots of action right out the door--cafes, bakeries, restaurants, and lots of people. I would absolutely recommend this hotel based solely on location. How much time do you spend in the hotel room in Paris anyway?

<Content>Perfect Location! We have just returned from a 6 day stay at the Hotle Albe. We thought that the hotel was ideally located in the Quartier Latin, with loads of atmosphere and ambiance in the area. There is a space just up the road from the hotel where street performers tend to work. There were break dancers and a brilliant guy on a guitar that added a real bohemian buzz to the locality. There are loads of lovely coffee shops and cheap restaurants near the hotel. We were a little disapppointed with our room as we had a twin instead of a double room. We threw down our bags and went for something to eat because we had been on the go for about 6 hours. On returning we asked were there any double rooms but were told that we should have asked to change within the first 15 minutes after booking in. I wasn't really impressed with the tone of the guy at reception, but all the women on reception during the day were lovely. The room was very clean and the girls did a great job keeping it tidy during our stay. Don't go to this hotel if you want a sleep-in in the morning. Ten o clock was the latest we slept with kids playing in the corridor, people having full blown conversations outside our door and people shouting at each other down the hall.Overall, I would stay there again, as the location is ideal and the rooms are guaranteed to be clean.

<Content>Nice hotel. great location! I visit Paris often and this time decided to stay in Latin Quarter. Hotel - very friendly English speaking staffRoom: size is tiny for a 3*, i stayed in a double alone and it was not that bad but for 2 people won't recommendWindows - double glazed open and close properly (not usual for Paris), although was noisy at night as they had street entertainment but not that bad.Aircon - is on top of the door - very wise as usually they tend to be on top of your head.Bathroom - clean, i had shower, working fine and very powerfulTV - good size on the dressing table (and not a tiny one far in the ceiling)There was even a safe and minibar. You can by water and store it there as well as there was some room.Breakfast - cost 10Euros, i didn't take it as i don't like to get up to certain time. Just next door to the hotel is an amazing bakery with some tables outside.Location - convinient for everything, 5 min to any place in the left bank and just across the river is Notre Dame and Hotel De Ville. 10-15 min walk to Louvre and Opera.Night life - all around the hotel you can find never ending restaurants, bars, cafes, cinemas...anything you want, lots of greek restaurants and everything else. Can recommend La Lutece, it is across the road from St.Michel station, steak was excellent as well as very french atmosphere.Tip - now you can rent bicycles everywhere. They have special parking spots all around Paris and you can pick it up at one stop and drop-off on another. No hassle. They are all the same beige colour.

<Content>Best Location My sister and I stayed here for 3 nights and were impressed with the layout and the location. It is so hard to research hotels in a city such as Paris as there are so many to choose from and it takes time to trawl through all reviews. I am glad I picked this hotel. We took a taxi from Gard du Nord (arrived on the Eurostar from Ashford), and then took the Metro back to the station as it was on 1.50 euro each as against 12 euros in the taxi. As written previously the hotel is a stones throw from Notre Dame and about 20mins walk from The Louvre. The metro was easy to use especially if you are used to the London Underground. Would recommend this hotel to anyone. We had a twin no-smoking room on the 4th floor. Breakfast was adequate although not a lot of choice. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Paris, Paris, Paris.... We have just returned from a long weekend in Paris, and we stayed at the Albe Hotel. The location is perfect (or may be impossible better!!) just two steps from the 2 main subways lines (and one goes direct to PCD airport!!), in the middle of the Saint Michel district, and one minute walking from the Notre Dame Cathedral. The room was very clean and big enough to fit 2 adults and two children (triple room in the corner), the staff were really nice and helpful. The breakfast was included, however just average. If your room does not include breakfast, go just round the corner, and you will find lots of patiseries. In summary a great Hotel in a great location.

<Content>Great location This is a great hotel smack in the middle of the latin quarter in Paris. The room was clean, the staff were really sweet and helpful and they were quite happy to speak english when we proved that our french vocabulary only consisted of bonjour and merci... We we're impressed at how quiet the room was, even though its windows faced a busy street. The room was air conditioned, it had a handy safe, the bathroom was small, but clean. We didn't have breakfast included in our package, but had breakfast the morning we were leaving, and even that impressed us. The location is absolutely wonderful (if you do like staying in an area that never sleeps!). There are plenty of restaurants close to the hotel. The street just outside the hotel is a real tourist trap, so we decided to walk a bit further away to find more authentic Paris restaurants. Bld St Germain is really close, as is Bld St Michel, and in the less busy side streets you can find great places to eat. The Notre Dame is just a few minutes away, and the metro stops St Michel and Cluny are just round the corner. The RER train (regional train) connects St Michel to both Charles de Gaulle and Orly Airport, which is really handy. If you think location is important and also value a decent standard hotel, I'd choose this one. Enjoy!

<Content>Would stay again We booked the Albe for two reasons: location and the fact it had a family room (something I found hard to find in Paris). In short, we weren't disappointed. The triple room was spotless, comfortable with good furnishings and flat screen TV. The bathroom was again spotless (a benchmark of hotels I always feel) with good size bath, shower over etc.. Location for us was perfect, right in the heart of the hustle and bustle of the Latin Quarter, walking distrance to lovely bistros and virtually on the Seine by Notre Dame. Short walk to St Michel Metro and RER made it the perfect stop off between Disney and home for the night. Even though our room was on the first floor above the little tea room next to the hotel reception the street noise was barely audible. Would definitely stay again and would recommend for families.

<Content>Great Value  The Hotel D'Albe St Michel was great value for money and a fabulous vacation. We visited the hotel from October 11-21, 2007 and our initial reaction was that the rooms were not unlike a cruise ship...very small, cramped, with tiny hallways leading to the rooms. However we discovered that the rooms were immaculate, and had everything that we needed. We had friends staying at the Ritz during the metro strike  our location was so much easier to walk get to things without transportation that we felt that we lucked out.Coming from North America we are getting used to smoke free enviromnets so if you are challenged with smoke this is not the place for you. We were on a no smoking floor, however I think most Europeans don't care  smoke in whatever room they want so that was likely the only discomfort we experienced as it definately wafted into our room.The front desk staff was so helpful and gave us great suggestions for dinner, shopping etc. The housekeeping staff had to be reminded to leave soap or towels every day but kept the room clean.We would defiantely return to this hotel and would recommend it highly.

<Content>Great find, as central as you can get This hotel is a great little find, right in the centre of Paris. Modern, comfortable and clean, very good value for Paris. Didn't have breakfast at the hotel as there are so many cafes nearby. Lift is a bit small but no other complaints.

<Content>Great location Rooms are small but very clean and recently renovated. The price is very reasonable for the location, and the state of the rooms. Location is superb, only a minute walk from the metro, and you can walk to a lot of the sights. Breakfast is excellent. The staff are incredibly helpful; gave great restaurant recommendations. Only negative would be that i can be a little noisy - however we were staying on the weekend of the Rugby world cup final and as our room was on the street side, there were lots of people around so it may not be like that all the time. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a stay in Paris.

<Content>C'est super! I stayed for four nights with my wife and we both loved Hotel D'Albe. The location is fantastic with easy access to public transport and more cafes and restaurants than you could possibly want within a short walk.The room was nicely furnished in a contemporary style. We were expecting it to be small based on reviews but actually found it to be a fair size by European standards.The staff were fantastic. One member took the time to show me where an iron and ironing board were located and how to use them. The day we left there was a transport strike and the staff went to every effort to ensure we got to the airport.The only warning I can offer is for people who are bothered by street noise. The hotel is in the midst of a very popular area so it is inevitable you will get some street noise.The best recommendation I can give is that I will stay there again when I return to Paris.

<Content>NIce Place Basically read all the previous reviews from past travellers to Paris and the Hotel D'Albe St Michel was very well thought of. We booked a triple corner room with a small balcony. Room was clean, tidy and well-attended. Bathroom was impeccable. Room was small for three adults, but everything in Paris is. Not a drawback, because how much time do you spend in your room anyway? Well located in Paris, across the Seine from Notre Dame. The only thing which may make some people shy away from this hotel was the street noise. It is on the edge of the Latin Quarter which is often depicted as slow and easy-going and sometimes quieter. The hotel is located at a convergence of three streets with tons of restaurants and cafes. A huge gathering place for tourists and Parisians in general. It gets noisy at night with the street performers, revellers and general street noise. It didn't bother us, but I could see where it might for a light sleeper. The staff at the hotel was awesome in helping us. All in all a good place to stay! -Steve in Missouri, USA

We arrived in Paris for the start of our World Cup campaign wondering what our hotel would be like as we had commited to staying there for four seperate weekends. Situated adjacent to the RER B from Charles De Gaulle in a buzzing area of restaraunts and bars. We were greeted by Cecile and Alexandre who were extremely welcoming and helped to make our stay as trouble free as possible. We had our breakfast included in the price but it would be worth paying extra to meet the lovely waitress who serves breakfasts who constantly smiles and can not do enough for you. As we were lucky enough to get to the final, we decided to try and bring out our three daughters, Cecile managed to squeeze and extra bed in a larger room for us when I know the hotel was fully booked and helped our two other daughters find there accomodation, all this inspite of the fact that we had beaten France to get to the final!!! She was a star.I can only glowingly recommend this hotel the staff are great and it is situated within easy reach of all that you would need to make your stay stress free. We will definately return at the earliest opportunity. Do try it you will not be disappointed.

<Content>Nothing special My fiancee and I stayed here last month for a weekend. the room was clean and tiny but otherwise very unremarkable. the elevator can only fit 2 people comfortably (no, we're not obese) and the cables creak loudly as it slowly moves up the floors. wonder how much longer they will last. It's in a good location, yes, but also at the edge of the loudest area of Latin Quarters. Kind of like Bourbon Street. the concierge gave us two recommendation for nearby restaurants but they were both quite expensive even though we asked for moderately priced places, and not all that good. overall decent but I wouldn't go back. next door is an excellent little patisserie.

<Content>great location, very helpfull  What a treat to have Internet right in the hotel. Very helpfull  friendly staff. Size of the room is what you expect for an older building, but clean and not too bad for sound. Very good location. Easy walking distance to the markets and lots of restaurants. Loved the elevator! Also lots of shopping to be done. The Military bands were in town and we caught a number of their performances. Really added to the experience. It is worth walking around the large square at night just to listen to the different street musicians. Would come back and stay at this hotel again.

<Content>No room at the Inn We booked months in advance, paid our deposit and received our conformation but still arrived and had no room. They claimed there was a technical problem and sent us off down the street with our many bags and no help - only directions to another hotel.They said they would have our room the next day, which they did but we should have never returned. The room was average and they made no accommodation for the problems they caused.Find a different hotel.

<Content>Loved Hotel D'Albe What a pleasure doing business with this hotel! Communication via e-mail and in person at the Hotel D'Albe was caring, thorough and efficient from booking to check-out. We even received a thank you note upon our return home! The Hotel D'Albe offers a very peaceful, well run, immaculate establishment. The price was reasonable for a very convenient location within walking distance to most attractions. The neighborhood in the Latin Quarter was lively, fun and safe and only steps to the Metro. You can expect the rooms to be on the small side by American Standards but they are updated, very, very clean, nicely decorated and comfortable. We only wished we could have stayed longer.Employees at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. We appreciated that they were nice enough to hold our luggage before and after check out times and that they helped us find the proper transportation to move four people with luggage to an outlying area of Paris.

<Content>Perfect :) I stayed at the Hotel D'Albe during my last visit to Paris. Let me tell you, I LOVE this hotel. Like many others have said, it is on the smaller side, but for as often as you are in your hotel - who cares?!?!? The employees at the hotel were wonderful and extremely helpful. The hotel is located right in the middle of everything. Great shopping, restaurants, people... what more could you ask for? The room we stayed in even had a view of the bell towers of Notre Dame. It was amazing! I am planning my next trip to Paris and will absolutely be staying at the Hotel D'Albe again.

<Content>Great location, small room Stayed at the Albe for only two days recently after reading the reviews on this website. I must say that I was disappointed with the room as it was at the back of the hotel and was TINY by European standards, which was contrary to the general impressions I got from the reviews.The room was however clean and the bathroom quite large which was great, the location wonderful if you're into restaurants and cool bars as we are.Great for a few days but I wouldn't recommend if staying in Paris for longer than that.

<Content>Great little hotel The hotel staff were extremely helpful and went out of their way to assist us. Our room with double bed had plenty of space for 2 suitcases and room for us to unpack. We could also easily walk around the bed, even though there was a writing desk as well.Everything was clean and comfortable, decor very nice and the room service each day was excellent. We had balcony windows - even with them open it was quiet inside.The bathroom was large enough for the two of us, but the only fault we found was that the shower over the bath only had a half screen so it was almost necessary to shower sitting down to avoid wetting all the bathroom. Location of the hotel was perfect - close to all restaurants, the Seine  Notre Dame, and the metro.We loved our stay here.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Choice Having been asked by our American friends to organise hotel accommadation in Paris, I was concerned to choose well. After reading several reviews on the internet, I selected the Hotel D'Albe and can honestly say that I could not have made a better choice.The hotel location in the Latin Quarter was 'at the heart' of French life and was so convenient for visiting the Notre Damme, Louvre, Pompidou Centre, Pantheon etc.The hotel staff were very helpful and most friendly - the bedrooms were bright, clean, and well furnished - breakfasts were more than adequate.All in all, the Hotel D'Albe surpassed all our expectations, and we would heartily recommend it to anyone and intend to stay there again on our next visit.

<Content>English Tourist in Paris Great location, great bathrooms, 2nd stay in 3 years, mostly refurbished in that time. Staff 'easy come easy go' and relaxed and helpfull. Really good coffee/pastry/ bread shop next door and loads of restaurants just around the corner, some good, some average. No kettle in rooms for late night/early morning coffee (please, for next time).

<Content>Right in the middle of the action-and so close to metros!! This was exactly what I expected. The rooms are not large but spotlessly clean. The showerroom was small but perfect-- Large shower and so fresh and clean. You just walk out the door of the hotel and all life is there-bookshops -boulangerie-restaurants-take away and sit in- felt very safe despite being so lively. Was surprised how quiet the rooms were at night-thought with the street outside being so busy it might be a problem . Would stay again. Just a stroll to Notre Dame-slightly longer to Musee d'Orsay -short stroll to Saint Chapelle( do not miss this--it is breathtaking)

<Content>Great Hotel The hotel is in a great location. Lots to do and see with in minutes walk. The smell of the bakery on the corner in the morning was an added charm. The streets below the hotel are busy with people in the evening but the rooms are sound proofed enough that it wasn't a problem. Great friendly staff and very convenient wi-fi access too.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at the Hotel D'Albe St Michel for two nights in September. The room, although small, was perfectly adaquate for two people. The bathroom was clean, and fresh towels were supplied on our second day. The service at reception was welcoming and they even allowed us to leave our baggage with them on the day of our departure, so that we could take in a few last sights. The location could not be better. Just across the road from the tube station and a 2 minute walk from Notre Dame. We will definitely be back and would reccommed this hotel to our friends and family.

<Content>Excellent Hotel Great Hotel! very clean, perfectly located. We were in a superior room, where the view was to the senna river. The hotel is very closed of metropolitan and RER, and only five minutes (or less) to Notre Dame Cathedral. We are sure that we will repeat this hotel the next time that we come back to Paris. Thanks for all.

<Content>Perfect location I booked a room for me and my sisters at the Albe because the hotel we usually stay at was fully booked. As it turned out, we will be staying at the Albe for future visits. The Junior suite was spacious and the bathroom very nice. The location, around the corner from St.Michel, was perfect. We usually had breakfast at the bakery which is located on the ground floor of the hotel building, very convenient. But on the last day we decided to have breakfast at the hotel, which I can reccommend. The service at the hotel was very friendly and everything succeded our expectations. I would highly reccommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Hotel and Location I always love staying at the Hotel D'Albe. The Location right in the middle of the Latin Quarter is perfect for exploring Paris. You are within walking distance of Notre Dame, the Louvre, and right on the river Seine in the middle of the city. The hotel has great service and the rooms are very nice and reasonably priced.

<Content>When can I return? Although the room was small, it was comfortable and clean. The hotel and the staff were great. I would stay here again in a second.The area is great. There are many restaurants and cafes in the area. It is close to a Metro stop and we made it easily from the hotel to CDG airport.I envy anyone staying here.

<Content>Left Bank Charm The D'Albe hotel was a super way to end our two week vacation to Normandy, for the two nights of September 13th and 14th, 2007 .I picked it because of the great reviews on Trip Advisor and easy to find from the airport where our tour ended. We took the RER from and to the airport and 30 minutes we were in a nice hotel room watching the busy Latin quarter bustle from our window. We had a large room on the first floor with 3 large windows for viewing the streets at night. My husband, who is quite picky, said that our two nights at the D'Albe were one of the highlights of the trip. With the windows closed it was very peaceful and very quiet. A very special thanks to Cecile and the rest of the friendly staff at the D'Albe for making our ending to our France trip enjoyable. Tripadvisor member from the state of Nevada

<Content>Great hotel I have stayed in the Hotel d'Albe several times previously and found it well up to standard. The room was comfortable, the staff pleasant and helpful and the breakfast excellent. My only complaint (a very minor one) was that it was very difficult to take a shower without flooding the bathroom floor as there was no shower curtain or screen at the shower end of the bath. The designer had, for reasons best known to him or her, put the screen at the other end!I should certainly return to the hotel.

<Content>Good hotel in a good position Hotel clean and staff helpful. Perfect position close to Notre Dame, Saint Germain and metro stop. Perfect for a walk or to jog along the Seine. Of course a bit noisy in the evening but not that much. Price is high for low budget travellers but for a couple I think is a good solution.

<Content>Enjoyed the Hotel D'Albe My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 7 nights in the latter part of July after booking the hotel based on comments from this site. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We arrived during the Tour De France and daily I was asking the good people in reception to translate french news paper articles into english to keep in touch. Nothing seemed to be a problem and we thought all staff were very nice.The location of this hotel is fantastic. Close to lots of restaurants and 5 minutes walk from Notre Dame Catherdral with a slow 20 min walk to the Louvre. 15 minutes walk in the opposite direction brings you to Luxumberg Gardens, a nice place to relax after a hard days sight seeing. Even though we arrived in the summer period and there were lots of people in the streets below the noise coming into the room was not an issue. The room was very well air conditioned. I would highly recommend this hotel to any couple looking for a hotel with a boutique feel.Ask for a room on the 5th floor

<Content>Great location The location of the hotel is awesome. There is a bakery right next door to the hotel. Great croissants and crepes. Also, there are ample of restaurants to choose from within the vicinity of the hotel. As the hotel faced a busy street, it was noisy at night and difficult to sleep but we managed to sleep through all that noise.The rooms as per Canadian standards was small but we did find it was not cramped and was still spacious. The bathrooms were very clean except the bathtubs did not have shower curtains. That was a challenge to try and take a shower without getting the bathroom floors flooded.The only complaint I would have is the front desk person (daytime) was very unfriendly and not very helpful. We had asked him for some directions and he was very rude and not helpful at all. However, the lady running the breakfast room was very cheerful and very friendly.I would highly recommend this hotel as the location is in the Latin Quarter.R.Amlani, Edmonton, Canada

<Content>Fantastic location To celebrate 25 years of marriage, my wife and I spent 4 days at the Hotel D'Albe.We selected this hotel after reading reviews on Trip Adviser. We were not dissappointed. The hotel is in a fantastic location right in the middle of the Latin Quater. The hotel is very clean and modern and the staff very courteous and helpful. The only downfall as mentioned in other reviews is the price of the breakfast (13 euro each). We and from what I observed, many others, chose to have breakfast next door at 4 euro each.We enjoyed our stay so much that we plan to bring our children next year. Before we left we asked to see the family rooms which were superb. We will be back next year. Thank you D'Able for a memorable stay.

<Content>A great Hotel We stayed at the Hotel D'Albe for a long weekend to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary. The staff were all very friendly and helpful at all times. We arrived fairly early on the Friday morning (around 10.30am) and the receptionist rang to check that our room was ready. Our double room was so we dumped our suitcases and headed for the Notre Dame which is a 5 minute walk away from the hotel. Our children (16 and 14) had a separate twin room two floors down. The receptionist checked that this would be a satisfactory arrangement before checking us in.The hotel was clean and double glazing kept the street sounds out of the room enabling a quiet night's sleep. There was plenty of wardrobe and luggage space in the room. The reception area was bright and airy and welcoming. The rooms looked as though they were cleaned thoroughly every day.I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in central Paris.

<Content>Great Hotel and location This Hotel is in a brilliant location and is a two minute walk to the Metro. The room that we received was excellent and overlooked the hustle and bustle of the Latin Quarter. The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant.

<Content>Great Central Location My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a week at the end of May. We appreciated the proximity to the St Michel metro stop -- we were able to take the RER directly to and from CDG without station changes or long walks. The rooms are small, which is fairly normal in Paris. The windows are double-glazed and block out sound from the Latin Quarter extremely well. They also swing open so you can bring in the street sounds and fresh air when you'd like. Very clean, nice accommodations. The bathroom was two separate rooms -- one for the toilet and one for the sink and shower. There was no bidet. The shower was fantastic, good pressure, roomy. The front desk staff were always very pleasant. They were quite crisp on occasion but we do not need much help and did not mind at all.

<Content>Excellant Location! This was a terrific Hotel! The location could not have been better-right in the heart of St Michel and close to the Metro. I was worried that it might be noisey, but even when a lot was going on in the street, once the windows were closed you did not hear a thing! Our package included breakfast which was excellant and we were always taken care of by a WONDERFUL woman that was cheerful and so pleasant every morning. The room was perfect; clean, comfortable, good shower. I would absolutely stay there again.

<Content>Superb location but certainly not the best I've been to Paris about 15 times and generally stay in the 5th. The area is lively, though extremely touristy. If you are a first time visitor to Paris, the 5th is recommended. That being said, i've stayed at some really good hotels and some really bad ones in the 5th. I'll put the Albe in the 7/10 range, not the best, certainly not the worst.As for my stay at d'Albe, I decided to give it a try because of an amazing deal I got on the web. I paid a discounted rate for 3 nights and got a 4th night free and a free breakfast every morning. If I was paying full rate (or nearly full rate) I would have been disappointed with my room.Location: Smack dab in the middle of the Latin Quarter. This is good and bad. This is good because you can walk or metro or cab to nearly anywhere quickly. This is bad because d'Albe is located on a pedestrian street. Some cab drivers will drop you off at the front of the hotel. Some will not. Thus, you may have to drag your luggage through crowds to get to the hotel.The lobby: The lobby is very modern and fresh looking.The staff: The staff is friendly enough. They made a reservation for us. Though I had a few problems here and there where the staff would take a smoke break and lock the front hotel door. Thus I had to lounge around out front of the hotel and wait for them to get back to open the door again. This generally happened only later at night (11pm-1am)The room: Small like most of Paris hotels that are not outrageously expensive. It had a safe and a flat panel TV. It had a tiny desk. It had a tiny closet. The room also had a small bathroom. We did not have a tub. We only had a shower stall (i'm American so shower stall is aok). The room looked like it was sort of remodeled recently. Maybe fresher carpet but definitely showing age. The lights flickered a lot. It only had one outlet to charge my phone/camera/computer. The bathroom showed a bit of age. The shower was not as clean as I hoped, a bit of mold here and there. The toilet ran unless you gave it a whack. I also could rarely get consistent hot water in the morning, though hot water flowed freely after 3pm. (I checked with others staying and they had similar problems). The air conditioning worked wonderfully. I could make the room freezing.Breakfast: They get danishes and croissants from the bakery next door so it was all fresh. They had coffee, cheese, some hard boiled eggs and ham. For free it was very nice. For pay, you can walk next door and get a fresh hot danish for a euro or two.Overall, I didn't love it. It was very mediocre. For around the same price, there are a lot of hotels in the area that are nicer. If I got a deal again, i'd probably stay. If I had to pay normal rates, i'd choose elsewhere. I don't quite see the fascination on TA about the hotel.

<Content>Highly recommended I and two other female friends, all in our late twenties, have just returned from a summer trip around France and Italy. We stayed at about 4 hotels during the trip and Hotel D'Albe was undoubtedly the best. The internet booking was easy and the staff were very helpful over email before we arrived. The rooms were a good size given the general size of Parisian hotel rooms, were soundproofed (important in the Latin quarter) with wonderful bathrooms. In general, the hotel was extremely well taken care of. Frankly for the price, both the hotel and its location are phenomenal: you can walk to Notre Dame in 5 minutes and to the Louvre in 15 mins. In summer you can walk over to the Paris Plage then back to your room to change for the evening. Also it had the best breakfast of any of the hotels we stayed at. Highly highly recommend. I am looking forward to staying there when I am next in Paris.

<Content>Cracking hotel. Myself and girlfriend stayed here for the second time this year, we will certainly stay again. The hotel is in a fantastic location with the metro and taxi rank only a stones throw away. It gets very busy around the hotel at night and have never had any problems sleeping, this time we did have a rear facing room (531) so didn't have any noise issues. The rooms are very tidy with an lcd tv, more than enough room for the 2 of us. The air conditioning was a god send when we went because it was very warm. My only minor niggles would be- lets have some English channels on the tv, seems like the only channels apart from (obviously) French channels are German and at breakfast the lovely lady who looks after breakfast clearly needs help in high season. When you come down she offers you orange juice (which should be self service surely) and tea or coffee, the trouble was the tables were covered in dirty plates etc where people had left and it was hard for one person to serve up tea and coffee whilst trying to clear tables, more often than not we'd almost finished when we got our coffee. If anyone asks us to recommend a Paris hotel I would without doubt tell them to go to Hotel D'Albe.

<Content>Great hotel in a lively area Just back from our stay at this hotel. First of all I was very impressed with the room that we had been given (I had read previous reviews mentioning the upper floor rooms with balconies as being the best and asked if it would be possible for us to have one). The views from the corner room on the 5th floor were fantastic and both the room and bathroom were above my expectations.I also found the staff extremely helpful. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel preferring to have brunch in whatever area we were travelling in.I would strongly recommend the restaurant Azabu in the 6th arrondissement. But suggest that you make reservations as we were very lucky to get a table for an hour as the restaurant was fully booked (recommended in Time Out's eating guide to Paris). The food was delicious and the staff were absolutely charming, one word of warning they did not speak English (either French or Japanese).We had a really great time and I would not hesitate to recommend the Hotel D'Albe St Michel to people going to Paris, in fact I have already done so!

<Content>Perfect location Nice Hotel. We stayed for 5 nights. The service was excellent, friendly and helpful staff. It麓s not the last time we stay at this hotel. Perfect location, near the Metro (We didn麓t use the Metro at all, we didn麓t have to.,) walking distance to a lot of Tourist attractions. Nice and clean rooms. We can only say nice things.

<Content>Fabulous location The Hotel had been recommended by my sister and for a girl travelling on her own , it was fantastic.Located in the heart of the Latin Quarter's restaurant district , it was perfect to eat out and walk safely to hotel , even at night .Needed to close window at night tho' cos can be noisy if you are an early to bed person.Breakfast was fabulous and lovely helpful staff.I felt very secure and like I was in a home away from home .Highly recommend it , especially if a female travelling alone , very secure yet allowed freedom to eat out at night in many places around it .R.R.Australia

<Content>Great location. We stayed at the Albe on a 3-day break. It was very clean, the beds were comfortable and our room was a decent size. We could even see the Seine from the window, the hotel being 5 minutes walk from Notre Dame Cathedral. The hotel is in the restaurant area of the left bank, with cheap and moderately priced restaurants from many different cuisines - we ate French, Tunisian and Egyptian. I imagine it could be noisy at weekends but during the week it was fine. It would be an excellent location for younger people, who don't go to bed too early!The hotel is 1 minute from St Michel metro station - with trains from Charles de Gaulle airport every 10 minutes, the journey takes about 40 minutes. The shops of Rue de Rivoli and the Louvre are within an easy walking distance but there are other shops nearby.The hotel has a lift - my only criticism would be that the corridors upstairs are a little narrow and dark. There was a mini bar in the room and a selection of toileteries. The flat screen TV was fine but only a couple of English channels. We didn't use the breakfast room, as there are plenty of cheaper cafes on Boulevard St Michel - but if you want breakfast in bed, then the option is there. It would have been excellent to have coffee/tea making facilities but that is rare in French hotels - however room service is available. The staff were extremely helpful and spoke English. We would definitely recommend it to friends.

<Content>Paris trip Second time we have stayed at Hotel d'Albe. We will come back a third, I'm sure. Just as when you buy a house the three things you look for are location, location and location; how can you beat the location and price of Hotel d'Albe for a trip to Paris? Let me count the ways: 1) Come up out the Metro exit at St. Michel (if you come up out of the right one-there are three to choose from; choose # 2) and walk 100 steps to the hotel! A real plus when you are toting luggage. 2) Looking for a place for breakfast other than the 13 Euro breakfast the hotel offers? Look no further than going out the front door, turn right for ten steps and you have a wonderful little place to grab a croissant or pain au chocolat and espresso quickly (for less than 13 euros). 3) Looking for a place to eat out for lunch or evening and don't want to bother getting back on the Metro to go somewhere? Walk out the front door and you are in the Quartier Latin where you have multitudinous restaurants (maybe 30 or more?) within 1-5 minutes walk. 4) You are less than 5 minutes from Notre Dame, 15 minutes from the Louvre and very centrally located. You'd want to take the tube to go to the Eiffel Tower but the Metro is so close. Also, the RER is close as well and the C train takes you right to Versailles without changing (although the route was slightly different during our July, '07 stay due to construction on a certain section of the Metro).Finally the rooms have always been clean, beds are good and the A/C worked well (at least in our room) unlike some places in Italy we stayed. When we go to Paris we don't hotel shop anymore....

<Content>fantastic! We stayed at Hotel Albe for four nights July 16-20 and were really delighted with the experience. We have two teenagers ages 14 and 16 and they also really liked the hotel. It is a very convenient and lively location, can't get closer to a metro stop than this place, and a short walk over the bridge takes you to St. Chapelle. There is a high concentration of various restaurants so that even the most finicky eater can find something to please them. The price for the quality of the rooms and wonderful front desk people was an excellent value. The front desk people were all very helpful, friendly and tolerated my rusty french but showed no disdain at speaking with me in their fluent english when my vocab ran out. We had two rooms, each with balcony from which we could see the river and the lively street scene below. The only caution would be that we seemed to have a family of elephants staying above us and the walls were not extremely soundproof but we had no trouble at all getting a good nights sleep. The rooms and bathrooms were sparkling clean with thick fluffy towels. We had breakfast at the boulangerie right beside the hotel and I do miss the pain chocolat already! I highly recommend this hotel and would return there if given another vacation opportunity in Paris.

<Content>Hotel d'Albe OOH-LA LA! My wife and I booked our summer vacation trip to Paris and the Hotel d'Albe via the internet without any problems whatsoever. I stayed at the Hotel d' Albe thirty years ago and remembered my stay as a pleasure. The rates were very reasonable. The staff assisted us with making anniversary reservations for lunch at the Eiffel Tower, the Eurostar to London, Open Top Bus Tour and confirmed our return air reservations. I was very impressed with the staff's support and professionalism in every respect. They made every effort to insure our expectations were met. The room was a little small as we expected but the location was the best place from which to start our days. The central air was quiet and worked very well. The dual paned windows insured that the noise of the street never interrupted our sleep. I would recommend the Hotel d'Albe to anyone who likes to travel and desires a Parisian hotel instead of the chain style variety. The Latin Qtr. is the best area to stay in Paris for a vacation because it's always busy; old world streets, lots of places to eat (Rue De Buci area across Place St MIchel seemed to have nicer, more relaxed places to eat with talented street muscians).I'd do my trip exactly as we did it all over again.

<Content>Great Location Small hotel with excellent rooms in the Latin quarter district. Across from Notre-Dame, along the Seine, and close, 800 meters, to the Louvre. Very clean. Next to subway station, direct line from de Gaulle airport.This was my first time in Paris, so I don't have much to compare. But the location was convenient. In the morning went jogging along the Seine down to the Eiffel tower. Fabulous views along the river. Some of the rooms overlook a plaza which gets very crowded and noisy till the early morning hours. Not a problem with the windows closed, but if you want complete peace and quiet ask for a room along a back street.

<Content>Interesting Stay We had one of the best rooms of this hotel. We had a very excellent view on the very lively street. The location was great as well. The only shortcoming was that breakfast was not included although the room was very pricy.

<Content>Great location, terrific staff Not only were we very impressed with this hotel, but so were 2 Parisian clients who got great service when they tried to contact me there. Fabulous location - a very short stroll to the Notre Dame, Sainte Chappele, Conciergerie, etc. Very quiet, with efficient attentive staff. Rooms and bathroom small, but well designed and nicely furnished. A real find.

<Content>Perfect location Location, location, Location! When you're in a big city like Paris you're better off in the path rather than off it because you'll be doing a lot of walking to get to the places you want to get to. Hotel Albe is in a great spot in the Latin Quarter.The hotel has 6 stories. We stayed on the 5th floor. We had a small balcony that provided a great opportunity to sit and watch the crowd at night. Rooms were typically small but modern and clean. A great value for your money.Skip the hotel breakfast. Go outside and get a crepe or pastries. There are many options outside your door. Unfortunately no coffee maker is provided. Skip all the restaurants outside your door when it comes to other meals though. They are all tourist traps. Chances are if in front of the restaurant their are enormous boards showcasing each page of their prix-fixe menu it won't be worth it. Head off the beaten path where you are bound to find some excellent options.If you don't like to walk, the metro station is right outside your door. Also there is a batobus which makes stops along the Seine River to landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. They have day passes. Skip taxis since Paris public transportation system is very easy to navigate. Save yourself some money if you are coming from CDG airport as for 2 euro you can hop on the RER B line to St Michel Station. It only takes about 35 minutes. Also if you are catching a TGV or Eurostar train at Gare Du Nord for your next destination take the #4 train. It's only a few stops and you'll get their in 15 minutes. Oh yeah, and don't worry about the noise at night. The soundproofing is superb!

<Content>Great location, great place I had a most enjoyable stay at hotel d'albe. The receptionist, Cyrile was brilliant, the breakfast lady was excellent, the room was great, facilities good. The only minor issue was the non-availability of tea and coffee in the rooms - but I understand that this is a European thing. Also, there were no British-based TV programs - everything was a little too American. I'd rate the overall experience as excellent.

<Content>Excellent for the price We visit France/Paris 3-4 times per year for business/pleasure staying at various 3-5 star hotels in various areas the Hotel D'Albe rates among the top 10. This trip was with our teenage children [2- 16  18] in their own room  our room both on the 5th. floor. Surprise, our early arrival found the rooms ready  waiting [a first]compared to other hotels. The front desk was cooperative  pleasant. The rooms were cozy  quite adequate with a small balcony for taking in the grea weather [another first]  viewing the action below. The breakfast [included] was substantial  a good start to the day. The lady that served the breakfast was outstanding, friendly, cheerful  extremely efficient combine her efforts with the room maids who brought the rooms back to a civilized environment  this hotel with its location  its joie de vivre rates a return visit.

<Content>Excellent hotel in the heart of Paris This is an excellent hotel situated very close to the Metro / RER and within easy walking distance of the Notre Dame. The room was a reasonable size, very clean and well looked after during our stay. There was a spacious bathroom and a modern flatscreen tv with excellent reception, plus air con.We did not eat in the hotel. There is an excellent patiserrie next door which served lovely coffee, croissants etc at reasonable prices and where you can eat outside and sample Paris streetlife. Unfortunately, could not recommend eating in any resaurants nearby. This area is something of a tourist trap and do not think that you get good quality or good value food in many of these restaurants . Would recommend that you search elsewhere for the legendary Paris cuisine. The area is also pricey for bar drinks etc, however, you cannot really expect otherwise in such a central location.Because of the central location, this is a very busy area at night and can be noisy, although the double galzed windows were very effective.The staff were courteous at all times.Overall, throughly recommend this hotel.

<Content>A beautiful City This was the second time my wife and I had stayed at the hotel. We try to visit Paris each year for the Bastille Day Parade and celebrations and have found the hotel to be well situated for all other attractions as well. An oasis of calm in a vibrant area of Paris we have been well satisfied with our visits and would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others. We will most certainly return.

<Content>Great Location, Highly Recommend this Hotel I used TripAdvisor to choose a hotel, and the good reviews were pretty much on the money. This is a great little hotel in the Latin Quarter with a location that is really hard to beat; one block to Metro, the Seine, can walk to Louvre, Musee D'Orsay (didn't have to, but they were pleasant walks). It isn't the least costly, but for the location and the amenities well worth it. Clean and very modern bathrooms, excellent maid service. The best part about it is the street life you can view from the balcony. Noise is definitely a factor, if you are a light sleeper or picky about noise, choose a room on the top floors or go somewhere else; occasionally there is a hip hop performance going on until 10:00 pm. We had no problem with it, loved being lulled to sleep by a very well paid classical guitar a couple of nights, and thought the buzz of human activity down there was great.

<Content>Nice, clean with perfect location! You could not ask for a better location to explore Paris from! If you like to walk and just enjoy the ambience of Paris, this location is perfect. If you'd rather take the metro to popular attractions, there are three metro stops very close to the hotel, including the train to Versailles. The room was kept very clean and the staff was very nice and spoke English very well. We'd stay here again and would recommend the Albe to all !

<Content>Top hotel stay for Australians Australians, this hotel is perfect. I can't tell you just how pleased we were with this hotel and the locale.Rooms are clean and well kept. beds comfortable. quiet aircon., windows are double glazed. convenient to everything.Better than the photos. there is a small supermarket behind the hotel, and a large Printemps supermarket across square from St Severins.( a 5 minutes walk or less once you have found it, Good food. ). Look for the red 'Printemps' neon sign. There is plenty of street activity around the hotel and both sides of the Place St Michel, and lots of restaurants. There are 2 Banks on the other side of Place St Michel with 24Hr ATMs which take Aust Visa/ Mastercard if you need more money. You can walk to most tourist sites from here, or take the metro. Catch the RER from C de Gaul airport- 4 stops. The Hotel is behind the bookstore with the yellow awning. Take exit 4 from the RER station. I would recommend this to anyone, and will stay here next time. No tea or coffee in rooms but you can get one at the excellent bakery downstairs on the corner. We found the area to be safe ,as Central Police station is just across the bridge over the Seine. D.B Wollongong NSW

<Content>In the Heart of the Latin Quarter The Hotel D'Albe was perfect for us as first time Paris travelers who were out sightseeing most of the day. A relative (and Paris resident) found the hotel for us because of its location, which is in the middle of the Latin Quarter. It was VERY close to the Metro station and many cafes. It was around the corner from the Seine and Notre Dame. It was also walking distance to many other attractions (Pantheon, St. Germain des Pres, Ile de la Cite, Sorbonne) . A drawback to the location is that is is very touristy, so the surrounding restaurants were tacky and catered to tourists (not authentic French) so we didn't eat at any of them. At night, the streets bordering the hotel (which are closed to traffic)were packed with tourists, street performers, musicians and vendors. Fortunately we read Trip Advisor reviews before booking and knew to ask for a high floor. We were on the top floor (6th), and with the double paned windows shut- we were not disturbed.  The room was small, but more than sufficient for our needs. We were able to unpack our clothes and stash our suitcases away. Importantly, it was clean!! We had some issues with the bathroom (the window was broken and to fix it they removed the handle so we couldn't open it; the sink was stopped up- and being a Saturday- no one fixed it. They bailed it out, but it remained clogged until we left on Sunday). The bed was comfortable, and there was a flat screen TV that had 1-2 English speaking channels.The room was airconditioned, and we had a shower (which was not available in all rooms). The concierge (Alexandre) was very helpful with planning our excursion to Giverny/Versailles and some of our evening activities (ie. booking at the Moulin Rouge), as was another gentleman who sat out of view from the front desk but had excellent restaurant suggestions.  Helpful tip: buy your ticket to the Louvre in advance at the Virgin Megastore under the pyramid. It costs one more Euro, but is good for any day and you can enter the museum without waiting on the long line! Another helpful tip: there are nice restaurants on Blvd. St. Germain, off of St. Michel, walking distance from Hotel D'Albe.

<Content>Little Gem in vibey part of Paris This hotel was recommended to us by a family member who had stayed there many times before. It has a lovely feel to it, is very reasonably proced and is in a fantastically vibrant and lively part of Paris. The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were well kept and very comfortable. Only complaint was that our room was not ready for us when we arrived (after check-in time) but staff remedied that by allocating us another room. Would definitely recommend this.

<Content>pleasant boutique hotel We were a party of 3, 2 adults, one teenager. The location of this hotel is central to most sights and activities in the city as expressed in other comments. The hotel staff were all very helpful during our stay. They are diligent with security, which was comforting considering the crowds out at night in the streets directly below. The room was compact, but efficient and very clean. We would most definitely stay here again!

<Content>Location, Location, Location  My wife and I stayed here for 2 days on our way to the Loire Valley. The location is superb - steps away from the Metro  RER, Notre Dame, and the Seine boat tours. The staff was very friendly, letting us check in early on arrival. They even walked me through the Metro station to purchase tickets for the rail system out of Paris. Great dining  good shopping in the vicinity. Wish we'd stayed longer!

<Content>A Great stay at the Albe A very clean well located hotel. Nice newly decorated room with views of the Seine, Notre Dame and Louvre. The room was compact but absolutely fine and the bathroom was very pleasant with good quality fittings. The room was airconditioned which was just as well as the street below is very lively at night, with the windows shut and air con turned on it was not too intrusive. The desk staff were very friendly with none of the surlyness associated with Parisien service. The restaurants nearby are very commercial and we had a disappointing meal locally. Its better to cross the St Michel Boulevard and head futher towards St Germain where you will find the restaurants populated by the French rather than solely by tourists. The boulongerie below the hotel does great croissants and pain au chocolate so head there for breakfast as its pretty cheap. As mentioned by other reviewers its very convenient for the RER which links to the CDG airport. The only gripe is the lack of tea and coffee facilities in the room. Overall an excellent value for money, stylish hotel. I will return.

<Content>Great little hotel! Stayed here for 3 nights in June and had a lovely time. Was in the junior suite which was very clean, had a huge bathroom and 2 plasma tv's! Location is very convenient for first-time visitors as metro station just a minute's walk away. Many restaurants to chose from right at hotel's doorstep, though most are rather touristy. Only downside is the noise factor as restaurants  bars downstairs stay open till 1 or 2am so the noise doesn't die down until then. Would stay again with friends but probably not with older family members looking for a good night's sleep.

<Content>Convenient The room was comfortable and clean. I was surprised that we didn't hear the street noise from our second floor room. The hotel is close to a couple of Metro stations, and mere blocks away from Notre Dame. The staff was pleasant and helpful. My husband wanted to book train tickets (with our american credit card) and there were problems. One of the staff actually went with him to the metro (right around the corner) and showed him exactly what he'd have to do to get the tickets.

<Content>Perfect Pick Paris Perfect location to see Paris, walking distance to Louvre and Notre Dame, and the St. Michel metro stop is a block away. The Hotel was charming in a very modern way. For our family of thee adults, the room was very comfortable. The staff was extremely helpful for tourists who don't speak French- and very patient with us! We would stay there again, and would recommend it to others.

<Content>Great Location Picked the hotel based on location and reviews from this site. It was a great place for our first visit to Paris. Got to the hotel early using the RER directly from CDG to the St Michel station, just a few easy steps from the hotel. Our 4th floor room was already clean and a ready welcome after an long overnight flight from California. The room was clean, a nice size for two and the bathroom was very clean and large, especially the deep tub and shower. Our room was quiet, thanks to the double pane windows even with some construction activity across the street. We took advantage of the bakery downstairs instead of the breakfast in the hotel. Could easly walk to so many places such as the Louvre, Notre Dame, River Seine, all the wonderful streets and restaurants in the Latin Quarter and the Metro just a few steps away. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Very good value great position Small but efficient and comfortable rooms with everything required. Excellent position just around the corner from Notre Dame in the middle of the Latin quarter and a very short walk from St Michel metro. If you are a good walker then the louvre is also in reach.

<Content>perfect location We liked the hotel for its very nice, up-to-date rooms at a very reasonable price. The location is near the RER with direct trains to CDG. The hotel is located on a pedestrianized street which was very active, very full of life, with tourists and students everywhere. The nearby streets were filled with an astounding collection of restaurants and cafes of nearly every cuisine I can think of, from Tibetan to tapas. The hotel is also close to the Metro, but because the street is pedestrian, we had a hard time getting from the Gare de Lyon in a taxi, only because the the cabbie didn't recognize the address. Despite all the activity outside, the room was well soundproofed. The room, while not huge, was more than adequate with comfortable furniture and with a bathroom recently installed and one of the best we've had in France.The only downsides that I could see were very minor. The breakfast was not cheap and we did better eating in cafes. But it is convenient and the hostess was very pleasant. The desk staff was generally helpful with good restaurant recommendations etc., but seemed a little put out by having to reserve us a shuttle to the airport when we left. Maybe I caught the clerk at a bad moment; he certainly came through for us without a hitch.

<Content>Perfect for the price. I found the hotel through Tripadvisor, and I think the positive reviews are accurate. The hotel is on the edge of the Latin Quarter and St. Germain des Pres, so you can easily explore both neighborhoods without getting on the Metro. I stayed in a double room, which I think had plenty of space. The flat screen TV was a nice touch. There was adequate closet space for the clothes I brought as I was there on business for the week. I thought reception was very friendly and professional. In general, I have no complaint with this hotel. If you want the amenities of the Ritz, you will need to spend more money. This is not rocket science. For this price, I believe you would be hard-pressed to find a better hotel in such a prime location.

<Content>Outstanding Location, nice but small rooms Stayed at the Albe two nights in May 2007. The decor is international, modern and very clean. The rooms are small but very clean, well equiped and well cared for. From our room, 210, we could watch the evening street performers. Despite the double glazed windows there was a small amount of street noise. Light sleepers might want to stay on a higher floor. Many reasonably priced restaurants are close by. We stayed two more nights at Henry IV about 2 blocks away. It is also an excellent, slightly better, choice. Henry IV has a soothing, French decor, and larger public areas with Enghish language newspapers. We had a very quiet, no view room. This area is well served by bus and metro lines. Loved the neighborhood.

<Content>Great location The hotel is very well located. My girlfriend and I were able to take the train from the airport to the hotel in 30 minutes without transfer. And the hotel is only one block away from the station. The area is nice and lively, and very close to very thing. It is a 5 to 10 mins walk to Notre Dame. There are many restaurants and people around all the time. The room was small, but very clean and new. We have a view of the Seine River. The receptionists all speak English very well. I will definitely recommend the hotel to anyone.

<Content>Perfect I stayed here with my elderly parents. Even though it was right in the busiest part of the latin quarter, it was so well insulated that none of us could here a thing at night, once the windows were closed. And the crowd of people outside in the evening was well behaved, not like your typical lager louts in England at all!I couldn't fault the place. The staff were efficient and polite, the rooms were well furnished and very clean, with plenty of space. The lift was big enough for us all to get in at once, (just). I loved it, and would definitely go back.

<Content>An excellent hotel in a great location We stayed at the Albe for five nights and were very pleased with the accomodations. The hotel has been renovated and is clean, modern and comfortable. While the rooms are small by US standards, they are well-appointed. The windows are new and double-glazed; a great deal of the street noise is blocked. The staff is patient, helpful and gracious. The best way to establish a relationship with them is to try to use at least some rudimentary French. They respond well to such efforts.The hotel is a block away from Place St Michel and the Seine; a great location in the heart of the action. Perhaps the best feature is the small bakery next door - superb croissants and coffee. We would return to the Albe without hesitation.

<Content>Good Hotel Great Location Location location location - Great location - the train direct from Charles De Gaulle delivers you to a station exit within 50 meters of the door. We were concerned when we heard that Parisian hotels are small small small. This room was perfectly adequate sizewise and from the layout map ours certainly was one of the smaller but had a large bathroom. The room was spotlessly clean and the staff friendly at all times. Another of the good features was the recently installed double glazing which ensured we had the best sleeps of our trip in this hotel. Up between 8 and 8.30 and out the door at about 9 for breakfast next door or one of many cafes in the area. We can advise that room 430 has a view of the Seine.We will be back and hoping that this gem is still available at a reasonable price.

<Content>Hotel D'Able has ideal location  Recommended by an old Paris hand, the Hotel D'Able has a friendly staff, small but clean rooms w modern bath, and an ideal location. Located just outside the St Michel station, you may take trains to/from the airport, Versailles, and all of Paris. The Seine, good food, Notre Dame, and entertainment are nearby. Not cheap, but a consistently good experience.

<Content>Perfect location We just got back from a trip to Paris and Milan. We spent three days in Paris at the Hotel Albe. I picked the hotel from the trip advisor website. The descriptions were very accurate. Hotel Albe is in the St. Germain area and within walking distance to many of the Paris attractions. This area is very lively and noisy. There is always something going on till the wee morning hours.There is a cafe next door which has great pastries for a reasonable price. We did not try the hotel breakfast. There are many other ethnic type cafes, resturants, and shops too. There is even an Internet cafe down the street for those of you who need to be connected for work or pleasure. The hotel does not offer wireless Internet hook-up in the rooms. The hotel room is very clean and neat. They are small but roomy enough. We had a triple room and it was managable to move around and even store our luggage. The bathroom was nice with a shower/bath, however don't plan on standing to take a shower because there is no door just a half class wall and the water tended to spray out onto the floor. There was enough hot water for all three of us and glad to have a hair dryer so we didn't have to pack one of our own.The only drawback from our room was that it was located at the front of the hotel on the 2nd floor. It was noisy at night. However,the noise was part of the experience of staying in this area of Paris. The reception desk was helpful and courteous. I would stay in this hotel again, if we ever go back to Paris.

<Content>Great location, great time! I can't say enough about the great location and proximity to the sites and to the Metro. We arrived at the Paris Nord rail station, and after only 2 RER stops, we stepped out practically in front of the hotel. I would recommend trying to get a room on one of the upper floors because the streets at night can be a little noisy. We were above the fray.The staff was helpful and friendly, and the room, though small, was clean and comfortable.We will definitely stay there again!

<Content>A Haven in the Latin Quarter We just returned from a three night stay at the Albe( myself, my wife and our 5 yr old daughter). The corner room we had on the second floor was lovely with 3 single beds(2 pushed together), a nice clean modern bathroom and a qaint small balcony from which you can just see the Seine.Compared to the price of other central hotels, the Hotel is on par with its solid 3* to 4* rating. Our rate was 209 euros per night booked directly with the hotel.As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel is in a very noisy area, but the room is remarkably soundproof keeping out all but the occasional faint drone of the crowds below. The close proximity to the Metro is a huge bonus. While we certainly enjoyed the buzz of the area, we might choose a quieter location next time simply for a change of scenery.Other than the fact that the air conditioning could have kept the room a little cooler at night and the front desk staff could have been a little warmer, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location This hotel was great value for money as far as location and close proximity to major attractions such as Notre Dame 2-3min away and the Louvre about 10min walk. I stayed here with my two daughters. They too found nightlife very good. St Germain and St Michel is the main intersection and many shops and cafes all around. This is the heart of Paris. With many cafes at your door step!!!!This hotel is located in a small cobblestone street where restuarants cafes and shop are located. Never a dull moment to people watch at your balcony. Every night there was always entertainment at the corner street of St Michel... buskers and break dancers, live singers. The staff spoke very good english and very accommodating too. Jacques was very helpful in recommending restaurants and sights to see. I would definitely stay here again.

We were lucky to get a room on the 5th floor with a small balcony. The rooms were clean and the beds firm and comfy. The staff were always pleasant too. We didn't take breakfast at the hotel, preferring to take a stroll and stop off at one of the lovely cafes, so can't comment on that, although the breakfast room looked nice. I would stay at this hotel again and would recommend it as a good base for a couple of days.

<Content>Great hotel with friendly staff in one of the nicest neighbourhoods of Paris The Albe hotel in the Quartier Latin neighbourhood is a very nice hotel at a super location and with relatively spacious rooms (given it's Paris). Nice atmosphere, both in the hotel and in the surroundings. Lively nightlife (one night when we returned at our hotel, there were thre guys playing guitar and singing with the audience singing alone, Great!) and a lot of things to do (including good eating and drinking at reasonable prices). Would go there again when in paris next time.

<Content>Great Stay We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and were not disappointed. The hotel was clean and the service was friendly. We had booked a superior room at a small extra cost because we had heard that hotel rooms in Paris tend to be very small - this got us an average sized room which was fine. The great thing about this hotel is its location - on a street with restaurants and plenty of atmosphere and in a good area with the Latin Quarter, St Germain  the Seine islands within easy walking distance. Also the metro/RER station is within yards of the hotel with a direct line to CDG airportWe had read the site reviews prior to booking and feel that the number of good reviews are justified, from our experience. We had breakfast in the cafe next door which was a cheaper option than the Hotel breakfast.There are some lovely restaurants within easy walking distance - we didn't use the ones outside the hotel, which appeared to be tourist-oriented but found some slightly futher afield - the Petit Prince in the Rue de Lanneau is worth a visit.

<Content>disappointed with Hotel D'Albe Shabby,small room , very badly in need of re-decoration, corridors also shabby and very tight. Wafer thin walls between bedrooms - very noisy. Reception area very limited. Have stayed in Paris hotels at half the price for twice the value. Great vibrant location v. near Notre Dame. Will never return!!

<Content>Well located, well run hotel! This is the second time we have stayed here and we weren't necessarily fussed after last year when we were in a pokey room at the back of the 1st storey. I'm glad we took the chance and came a second time. We were on the top floor in a reasonably spacious room which was clean and incorporated a flat-screen TV, built-in hair-dryer in the bathroom and a free safe in the room. The hotel's best feature however is the location. Literally 30 seconds walk from the Metro entrance at St Michel (Notre Dame side), which is two stops from Chatelet, a Metro hub from where you can get to most of Paris, you will find everything you need on your doorstep. The Latin-Quarter is rich with restaurants, street-side cafes, bars and take-away eateries. This year instead of the hotel's breakfast we walked next door to the corner cafe where we had the set breakfast of orange juice, coffee and pain au chocolat (I even got some culture on the trip!) at 8 euros for two. This trip we took in the Museum at D'Orsay (eat at the restaurant, top quality at sensible prices), walked from there to the Arc de Triomphe via the gardens at Tuleries and spent a sunny Sunday walking through the Luxembourg Gardens. I want to live for a year in Paris but this weekend will have to do for now, I can always dream.

<Content>Second Time at This Hotel 6 months after our first trip to Paris, we went back again. Stayed at Hotel D'Albe for the second time, and loved it even more.The hotel upgraded us to a nicer room, and all I can say is oh. my. god. It was gorgeous.The most striking thnig was the bathroom, with beautiful tile, mirrors and lighting. The bathroom was quite large by European standards. Even by American standards.And the room itself was great. The hotel was nice enough to lend me a laptop, and I used it to surf the Internet from the comfort of my room. Hotel staff were extremely friendly. Great location, at the edge of the Latin Quarter. I'm so glad I found this hotel.This is the perfect hotel in Paris.

<Content>Expensive, ordinary service Yes, this is a good location, but the hotel itself is nothing special, and, in my view, overpriced for what you get. The staff were not particularly helpful, and the room, while clean, was pretty small, with ridiculously small storage space, no tea or coffee making facilities, not even any shampoo provided (and there was a HIDEOUS painting on the wall)! The breakfast was, at best, mediocre, and we suffered from a ridiculous rule of only one key per room - when I inadvertently went out with the key, my wife was unable to leave the room until I returned because they refused access to another key if she left.The room was also far too cold, and the heating system was inoperative when we wanted to warm it up.For 185 euros a night (including their requirement for a full night's tariff when we arrived at 7.30 am), it's just not good value for mine.

<Content>Good location, service surly After reading all the great reviews of this hotel, we decided to stay here for 4 nights instead of our corporate travel agency's recommendation (Novotel Les Halles). We are here in Paris for business and leisure (with 2 little kids in tow). First the location is awesome, just tremendous (it doesn't hurt that the weather has been wonderful!). Our room on the fifth floor has a cute balcony with a view of the Seine (if you turn your head a bit) and a view of the cafes below. The room itself is 2.5 stars - tight, cramped, average-motel-quality linens/blankets, basic furniture. Bathroom has nice fixtures (Hansgrohe - I just finished a bathroom remodel which explains this observation) and is clean. The Wi-Fi is not free - costs 5Euro for 45 minutes!!! (better hurry up and type). There is only one desk attendant at any one time - so don't expect a porter to help with luggage (they don't offer either). The daytime attendant is nice enough, but sold me a 2-park Disney pass (the other Disney Studios is barely open - everything is in construction) which cost me an extra 30 Euros (The guy gets a 7.5% commission). The night-time attendant is just surly - if you get a nod or a grunt of acknowledgement, you are lucky.Skip the breakfast, the bakery right downstairs is great - it opens at 7am though.If you are a runner, you are in luck, because the Seine is right next to the hotel, and there are some beautiful running paths along the water.

<Content>Great Hotel, Fabulous Location Just returned from another stay at the Hotel D'Albe and once again had a fabulous time. The Hotel had been refurbished since our last visit and looked very tidy indeed. The room whilst being quite small was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. The location of the Hotel is second to none, being only a stone's throw from Notre Dame and a few metres from the St Michel metro station ensuring easy access from the Airport via RER or to any of the wonderful sights of Paris.For those who like to travel round Paris on foot - the main sites are within easy access : Musee d'Orsay, Jardin de Luxembourg or even the Eiffel tower for the fitter walker. Being set in the heart of the vibrant Latin Quarter also means that there are plenty of places to eat and drink of an evening as well as being well placed for just soaking up the atmosphere and watching the many street entertainers around.

<Content>Great Location!!! My daughter and I stayed at the Hotel D'Albe over Easter break. The hotel lived up to all the fastastic reviews. You can't beat the location (right outside of the St. Michel Metro stop). We were able to walk to most attractions. We were also able to take the RER directly to Charles de Gaulle with our luggage right from St. Michel. The rooms were extremely clean and the staff was helpful, but not always accurate when giving local information. The hotel is located on a busy pedestrian street with musicians and singers right outside. We were surprised how quiet our room was when we closed the window. Great soundproofing! I would not hestitate to stay here again.

<Content>Great Location Just returned from a 4 night stay in Paris in the Hotel d'Albe. Whatever downsides this hotel may have, it's location is second to none. You really couldn't ask for a better location and their sound proofed windows really do work!I couldn't say i really have any complaints about the hotel as such. As always in Paris the rooms are compact! Though I have stayed in smaller. I am not sure about the extra price we paid to change from a double to a twin room, given the twin was 2 small single beds pushed together anyway - and there wasn't room to separate them even if you wanted to. Otherwise, the hotel was great and not somewhere you didn't want to go back to at night. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it. Though just remember the pictures do make all hotels look better than they are.

<Content>Great view Wonderful hotel in the center of the latin quarter in Paris. Lots of restaurants sourrounding the hotel.Lots of people in the streets at night, playing music having fun.From our room we could see the Louvre and Seine-river.And there was almost no noice in the room, even at night. Perfect.Excellent bathroom - not very big, but in a very good condition.Great breakfast, and kind service. (A little bit expensive, but it was a buffet, with all you can eat)The Metro and RER train station lies only 25 meters from the hotel.About 200 meters to the Notre Dame Cathedral.We will definately come back another time...

<Content>Very Good Quality/Value I stayed one night at the Hotel d'Albe recently. Overall a very good hotel, from a value/quality perspective. Very clean room, quite small as usual in Paris, but not a problem - very modern amenities, including the nice plasma tv with extra cable channels (e.g. Canal + Sport, allowing me to view the Masters last Saturday, an important consideration!). Nice location, just steps from Notre Dame Cathedral and the nice areas of Quartier Latin to the east and St Germain des Pres to the west.

<Content>Great Hotel especially the location We are three women from Dublin just back from a 3 night stay at the Albe Hotel in Paris and will definitely stay and recommend to all our friends in the future.The hotel although not huge, is very clean and adequate for our needs. The reception staff were extremely helpful in supplying us with directions and also looked after our luggage while we went shopping, as we had a late flight back in the evening. Although the breakfast is not included its worth paying the 鈧?3, as it can be more expensive to eat elsewhere. Carmel, who looked after us in the morning was really pleasant and could not be more helpful.We stayed in room 427 which was one of the bigger rooms. It was spotless and towels and bed linen were changed every day. The bathroom although not huge was and adequate size and looked as if it had been recently refurbished.The best thing about the hotel was the location. It is in the Latin Quarter, which is full of atmosphere both in the afternoon and particularly in the evening. We travelled by RER directly from Charles De Gaulle to the St. Michelle Metro Station which is just 20yards from the Hotel. Due to the convenient location, we used the Metro every day. You can also get the RER train from here to the Palace of Verseilles , it takes about 40 mins. and you can purchase your entrance ticket along with your rail ticket at the station. But be warned, you may still have to queue to get into the Palace. It took us an hour to get in, but the line was moving all the time and the weather was good. The bus stop is also just beside the Metro Station which will bring you over to Galeries LaFayette for some shopping.The Hotel is also just over the bridge from Notre Dame Cathedral. You can get the open deck bus, hop on hop off, which costs 鈧?2 and is valid for two days. Well worth the price and a great idea for getting familiar with the city.It was my third visit to the city and I hope to be back again in a few years. I'll definitely be staying at the Albe Hotel.The only downside was we were unable to check in until 3:00 p.m. However, the staff explained that the previous occupants had a young child, so we did not mind this. They held onto our luggage while we had a coffee and a wander around the area.

<Content>Very Nice This hotel is right in the middle of the Latin Quarter and located easy walking distance to everything. The subway entrance is less than a block. The rooms must have been recently refurbished as they were nicely done and modern. The bathrooms had new fixtures and a tub (which is rare in Europe). We were on the 6th floor and had windows on both sides of the unit for a nice air flow. The staff spoke English. They helped in restaurant reservations and getting a taxi to the airport. Right next to the hotel is a bakery with espresso for your morning wake-up meal. I have stayed in other places in Paris, all over Spain and England. You cannot go wrong here. The rooms are smallish but all the rooms in Europe are smallish unless you want to pay $500.00 a night.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Value Great service, great location, steps away from Metro stop that is on a good line and has direct RER airport service. Price very reasonable. Can't ask for much more. Saw that someone else mentioned noise -- the neighborhood is fairly noisy, but the windows are thick and appear new. Perhaps a recent upgrade -- noise wasn't a problem and room faced the street.

<Content>Great stay at the Hotel D'Albe St. Michel. This hotel was at a great location, about a block from the metro, but was also within walking distance of Notre Dame and great cafes and restaurants. The room was standard size from what I've seen in European cities, but absolutely immaculate, especially the bathroom. The hotel staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay at this hotel again the next time I'm in Paris.

<Content>Great hotel in a great location Very comfortable, above average, welcoming, bright hotel in the perfect spot to visit most of the major sites on foot, or, if you prefer, by metro, or the river bus. The hotel is also ideally placed, just yards from the RER train station, for services direct from Roissey airport, and for some super little bistros with excellent food at great prices.Our room was on the third floor, with unexpected and much enjoyed glimpses of the Seine from the large window. The room was a good size, very clean and fresh with modern decor, fixtures and fittings, quality comfortable beds and bedding and fresh fluffy towels.Breakfast is an optional extra and is taken in a cheery bistro style ground level room where a very pleasant member of staff is on hand to greet and provide beverages whilst you make your leisurely choice of all the usual tasty fresh goodies one would expect of a quality hotel.Having endured a few basic price French hotels in the past we decided to upgrade and felt that Hotel D'Albe provides well over the average in return for a very fair price. We certainly did not get anything like this level of value and comfort for the same price in London. We recommend this hotel and would certainly use it again when we go back to stay in fabulous Paris.

<Content>Albe'back The Hotel D'Albe is a gem of a hotel for a number of reasons. I didn't expect anything special from this 3 star accommodation as it was booked as a last minuite solution for the France v Scotland rugby weekend I had planned.  The location of the hotel is perfect, just around the corner from Notre Dame. The hotel is slightly inset from the main road in a cobbled area within the latin quarter which is quietly bustling during the day with parisian shops, some lovely small cafes and restaurants. The metro is only 20 yards away for all your other sightseeing needs.  On entry to the hotel it was clean and immaculate, with a geniunely friendly welcome. Although small, the room was situated on the top floor and had a separate toilet and washroom. There was ample cupboard space, comfy beds and I was suprised to find a mini fridge that contained a nice selection of beer and bottled water (that was to save me later on) at a relatively cheap price for a minibar. There was also a state of the art flatscreen TV to watch so that I could brush up on the Francais! Not at all bad for a 3 star place and at a fantastic cost for a weekend. Unfortunately it was not such a great rugby experience but with regards to the hotel, all I can say is .........Albe'back!!!!Steven the referee gave France the win

<Content>Good but noisy I have just returned from four days at this hotel,staying in a first floor room. The only thing that spolit our stay was the noise from the street. If we kept our windows closed it was ok, but as the weather was warm we wanted to keep the windows open at night. As it is still officially winter, the heating was on instead of the air conditioning. So we either had to roast at night (even though we turned the heating off) or suffer the noise from the street. Our first night was a Saturday and the noise went on well into 3 am. The street cleaners etc came around at about 5.30 am.I would go back to this hotel as it was as good as the recommendations said (WONDERFUL shower!) but in future I would ask for a quieter room or go when the air conditioning is on!

<Content>Ideal place to stay Ill be honest Im not one to write reviews, but this is an Ideal hotel to stay at if you are looking for a central place. Train station is 30 sec walk and notre dame is a 10 min walk. My fiance and I wanted a clean clean clean place to stay at but we werent looking for anything fancy. We only had 4days to really get to know Paris. Located in the middle of 100's of restaurants and bars we felt that we had chosen the perfect place. I recommened the green line tour buses even if you dont want to listen to their tour guide (earphone thingamagigs) its ideal as a a taxi. For 2 day tickets its around $45euros and for a day its around $40. It runs throught out all major attractions. The hotel staff is friendly. Their is an AWESOME bakery attached to the hotel (cheaper and better than breakfast at hotel) Great place if you are not looking for a RItz.

<Content>Great find I have just returned from a quick, overnight stay with my teenage daughter at this great little hotel in Paris.Having read the reviews, we requested a room with a view and with a bathroom and shower. We had a twin room on the fifth floor, with a wonderful view towards the Seine from a small balcony. The room wasn't large, but plenty big enough for us and had a mini bar, flatscreen tv and safe. The decor was simple and modern, and to our taste. The beds were comfortable.Again, although small (including a shorter length bath), the bathroom was sparklingly clean and modern which for me is more important, with plenty of hot water.The entrance lobby was bright, modern and clean, with some welcoming leather seating and magazines. We arrived early, and the hotel offered to store our bags. Our room was ready by 12.30pm. It was warm in the daytime even in March, but this allowed us to have the windows open. Not sure about how it would be in the heat of the summer (see other reviews). The staff were wonderfully helpful, and gave a very good restaurant recommendation - always a test.We opted for breakfast in the boulangerie next door, as recommended by other reviews. Great idea! Bargain price for a pain au chocolat and cafe americain which you can take away or have sitting down. It was warm enough to sit outside so we didn't want to sit inside in the hotel restaurant. Also saves a few Euros and some space for a long, lunch!Yes, it's not the quietest location, and if you want a peaceful night then choose somewhere else. But we wanted a bit of buzz and got it! My 17 year-old daughter loved the area with its small shops and noisy bars and clubs - even down to the smashing of plates by waiters trying to tempt you into the greek restaurants! It did get a little roudy later on on Saturday night, but we found it amusing and entertaining rather than worrying. Something to sit and watch whilst lingering over a coffee and crepe in the bar on the opposite corner. Lots of street 'performers'. Not sure it would be quite so lively during the week...Also, you're so near so many other places - especially if you don't mind walking - that we agreed the price was very good for the location: right by the Seine, on the edge of St Germain, across the river from Notre Dame and onto les Halles and the Pompidou, and a walk along the river over the Pont Neuf and on to the Louvre. Plus, a direct RER link to Charles de Gaulle airport and elsewhere just a few steps away, a great bonus when you're lugging luggage.We would definitely stay again. Thank you to all those reviewers who helped us make the right decision!

<Content>Good Location - Recommended Stayed 23rd-26th Feb. Good location, close to metro. Notra Dame a few minutes walk away. Loads of restaurants, roadside crepe stalls, Greek food outlets etc. close by. Very lively at night (only downside to the stay was the noise at night ). Breakfast buffet good - this was included in room rate.Room not too large but adequate for a few nights and very clean. Took us ages to get from CDG airport, via the RER underground, to the hotel - we caught the metro on a bad day. For anyone who has never done this trip before, it may help to know that you need to go down to the Departures level in CDG airport (i.e. the ground floor, 1 floor down from arrivals) and then go outside and catch the free shuttle bus to Terminal 3 (the bus was Line 2). The RER metro can be found inside the building at terminal 3 - the ticket to Paris central costs 8.10 euros one way and there are only a couple of ticket offices - hence a massive queue. Or you can be brave and buy a ticket from a machine.

<Content>Central location, spotless room Stayed 6 nights at the Hotel D'Albe and agree with all the positive reviews on Tripadvisor! It was spotless! The bathroom looked like it was brand new, big granite laid shower (but no bathtub) and smart looking rooms with art work and a plasma tv. We stayed on the 2nd floor so it was a bit noisy, especially on the weekend evenings but that was a small price to pay for being in such a central location. We had breakfast included and the woman who works there was the sweetest lady. If I ever go back to Paris I'd stay here again, but I think I'd ask for a higher floor and maybe a room that faces a quieter outlook.

<Content>Value for money Very good location on Place St. Michel. Rooms average in size but clean and well kept. The street noise mentioned by some reviewers could be a concern for older travellers but for me it was not a problem. Good value for money.

<Content>Spot On  Not one to write these types of reviews generally but would liketo leave a few comments on the Hotel D'Albe ( Rue De La Harpe ) as accommodation in city centres can often be hit and miss. Went with my wife and my parents for short break via Eurostar to celebrate my mother's 70th birthday and can only say experience was superb. Staff were very helpful with all travel ,restaurant and river cruise bookings - as said location ideal,premises were very clean and would definitely recommend to any friends/family in the future.

<Content>Albe Back!! Just returned back from another fantastic stay at Hotel D'Albe right in the heart of the Latin Quarter. We discovered the hotel during our last stay in Paris. The Hotel is a stones throw away from St Michel Metro but despite it's central location, right in the heart of 'the biz', the sound proofing is fantastic, although you do tend to spend most of the time with your window open to let in all the fabulous sounds and smells. The staff are very friendly and accommodating and will allow you to muddle your way through your limited French before rescuing you with their far better English!We booked directly with the hotel and as we had stayed before requested a high floor. We were allocated a good sized room on the 5th floor with plasma TV, mini bar and a balcony that had views over the Sienne  it's many bridges - the perfect place to sit with a glass of wine planning our days  nights expeditions. We also had breakfast included in our stay but with the many Boulangeries  Patisseries in and around the area we tended to eat out most of the time. Not to take anything away from the hotel breakfast tho, the breakfast room is very bright  pleasant with a good selection of cereals, toast, cheeses  of course pastries but we would probably leave this out next time.The only down side to our stay was that there was some refurbishment going on in the lower floors and the bumps and bangs could be heard from earlyish morning till early evening, but for the hotel to keep the standard that it has set then these works have to get done at some point and it certainly wasn't enough of a set back to spoil an otherwise flawless stay. We would have no hesitation in recommending Hotel D'Albi and are planning to visit again very soon

<Content>Albe Hotel est parfait! My daughter and I recently returned from our first European trip. The Hotel d'Albe St. Michel is everything we could have hoped for in a Parisian hotel: a cozy room with French doors opening onto a perfect view of the Seine (which is right across the street!); two Metro stations literally steps from the front door; patisserie and creperie right next door; cafes, the Louvre and Notre Dame all in reasonable walking distance.But, really, besides the incredible location, it is their staff that made our trip so memorable. Alexandre was a friendly, helpful, sometimes calming presence at reception. He graciously provided recommendations, directions, assistance.I almost don't want to write such a positive review for fear that the next time I come to Paris the Hotel d'Albe will be booked solid. Yet, I wish them nothing but success. Go. Stay at the Hotel d'Albe. Fall in love with Paris and this adorable little hotel.

<Content>great location loved it We visited for a romantic weekend and is was everything we wanted. ( I am quite fussy) Not overly expensive, excellent location, good breakfast. It was in a busy area and there is a little bit of noise but not bad enough to keep you awake and the location makes up for it. Rooms are a little small but by paris stands they are fine.

<Content>Lived up to the positive reviews I booked this place entirely on the basis of itsTripadvisor feedback, and once again, this community has come up trumps!Excellent hotel and one we will certainly use again. Very convenient for CDG Airport as it right next to St Michel RER lineB station. For the same reason, very convenient for the Stade de France which was our reason for visiting Paris.Getting from the airport to central Paris is really easy - use the ticket machines in the railway stations to buy your tickets and speed things up a little.When you arrive at the Saint Michel station, follow signs to exit 'Place St Michel' to come out right next to the hotel. Look just behind the newspaper kiosk. Rooms were spotless and well furnished ,'compact' in typically Parisian style.Reception staff very friendly and helpful. You need to know that it's in a very lively area but it's also only a short stroll from some real history and terrific culture. Truly super location - virtually on the river and just around the corner from Notre Dame. Great value.

<Content>Perfect Hotel In Paris! We absolutely loved Hotel D'Albe!! Cecilia and the rest of the staff were superb! We couldn't ask for better people to help us with our stay. The breakfast room was just perfect with a great spread for breakfast. The lady in the breakfast room was the nicest. My parents  sister  her husband stayed 1 floor above us which was a bit bigger, but we had a better view. Our 2 young children stayed in our room. Very clean!! I'm usually picky about cleanliness. We were fortuante to get a corner room where you can look up at our room from the outside. Looking out, you can see the Seine River. We were literally 1 minute walk from the corner. The metro is the same, as is the hop on/off bus stop. Being in the Latin Quarter was absolutely the best...very charming and what you think Paris should be. Eating is very reasonable around you and you won't have trouble finding a place. The greek cafe just 2 doors down from the left has awesome gyros and greek salad. A few more doors down, you'll find yummy crepes! I believe the Louvre is 10-15 minute walk. Notre Dame is a 5 minutes walk. The Eiffel Tour might be 1/2 walk, but we took the hop on/off bus. We would love to go to Paris again some day. When that day comes, I hope this hotel is still there.

<Content>Friendly staff, great location We stayed from 30th Dec - 2nd Jan 2007 and had a brilliant time. The rooms were very clean and the rooms were well arranged given that rooms in Paris can be quite small. The staff were very helpful and suggested places to eat and even booked our restaurant for New Years Eve. We had a fantastic meal at Au Jardin and would recommend it to anyone. The restaurant is quite small and intimate and the food and service were both fabulous. The hotel is in a great location for seeing the sights of Paris and with the metro just 100 yards away, you can easily get about.

<Content>OK But Very Noisy Overall, an average hotel. Room and bathroom quite small but very clean. My main complaint is the same as mentioned in the previous review. The comparison to Times Square is very appropriate. The area is very touristy, busy and noisy. The street noise lasts well into the morning hours and the double windows don't keep it out of the front rooms. If you're an average to light sleeper, bring earplugs or make sure you get a back room (although not sure even that will do the trick). Although the price is right for Paris, next time I'll return to a quieter area.

<Content>Not on the 6th floor My wife and I stayed for 5 nights at this centrally located hotel in St-Germain des Pr茅s late Novembre 2006.The location is just fantastic, being close to all major attractions and nightlife.The staff were extremelly helpful and the rooms were very clean.The only negative aspect were the size of the rooms and bathrooms.This hotel has 6 floors and all rooms are mid-size except those on the top floor which are extremelly small.......I mean really small, and the bathroom....................incredibly small.I talked to manager and she told me that all rooms had descent size, except those on the 6th floor.So, if you go, don't book any rooms on the 6th floor.I would certainly stay there again but wouldn't stay on the 6th floor again even if it was free.I also booked my room months in advance and was sincerely hoping to get a much better room.Aside from that, I highly recommand this hotel.BTW, don't bother paying 25 euro for brakefast, as you can get plenty of great brakefast for a fraction of the price just around the corner.Cheers and Bon Voyage.PatP/S: I must also mention that I was extremelly surprised to see how clean the city was and how friendly the French were.I don't know where all the bad reviews comes from about the French but to us, they were just real nice.

<Content>Just back and loved it Just back tonight after spending 5 nights in Paris. Its our first time staying in Paris - have driven through and been through on the train but never actually stopped there. We just loved Paris and thought the Albe was excellent value . Our room was recently re-furbished so everything was fairly new and pristine. We were in a room with 3 beds and 2 flat screen TV's!! It was bigger than I had expected. The bathroom was a good size and had 2 washbasins. A bath with an over the bath shower. The sheets and towels were changed daily. After long days walk the streets of Paris it was great to have a lovely soak in the bath, the shower was also good. The hairdryer wasn't the usual slow hotel type and this was great given that I had forgotten to take mine. There was a free in room safe and a minibar.The hotel staff were very welcoming and pleasant. The room spotlessly clean and well presented.Having read about the breadshop downstairs we decided to skip the 12Euro hotel breakfast and opt for there. This saved us quite a lot over the time we were there. True it is in a very touristy area and if you had had your windows open it may have been a little noisy. However, we slept like logs every night. After a hard days sightseeing, museums and art galleries we were so pleased that we could just walk out of the door and find so many restuarants. We would definately return tp Paris and would definately stay at the Albe. A great little spot that is so easy to get to from the airport, lots of eating places within minutes, easy access to all the main sights and friendly/helpful staff.Missing it already.

<Content>Great hotel and ideal base for exploring Paris We stayed in this hotel for three nights and found it suited our needs completely. The room had everything we needed and the bathroom was spotless. We were on the sixth floor on the Rue de la Huchette side so the view from our window was of the towers of Notre Dame - they looked great at all times of day but my favourite was early morning. The hotel is a few steps from the Metro and RER stops so all of Paris is easily accessible but the Latin Quarter is very interesting in its own right and full of good places to eat and drink. Notre Dame, the Louvre, the Sorbonne and Cluny museum (to name just a few attractions) are within easy walking distance as is the Siene for boat trips or strolls on the banks. I recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to be in a lively part of Paris.(We were never bothered by noise from outside the hotel at any time - closing the windows really does work)

<Content>Great Hotel in a great location Booked this hotel direct after reading reviews on trip advisor. We were not disappointed. The hotel is in one of the best locations in Paris for bars and restaurants. Its ideal after a days sightseeing to have everything you need on the doorstep and not have to wander for miles for somewhere to eat. You are spoilt for choice deciding which restaurant to go for! Some are better value than others, usually the ones that aren't trying to tout for business when you walk past. The hotel itself was very clean, if not a bit basic. However the good location more than made up for any lack of facilities. If you don't intend to spend much time in your room this would be the ideal hotel for you.

<Content>Reasonable hotel for quick stay in Paris My husband and I were in Paris on short notice for a few days and needed somewhere convenient and reasonably priced to stay in. Booked this hotel based on the reviews here. The location is truly fantastic, it's a couple of steps away from the St. Michel metro station and RER B line (which connects to CDG airport). The room was small but within Paris standards, and the bathroom was spotless and completely renovated which was nice. It's very barebones and no frills, there's a small desk and a tiny tv in the room that's it. We had worried about the noise problem being that the Latin quarter is very lively till late at night but the double paned windows were able to block out pretty much everything. I had requested a higher floor in the reservation form and they honored it by giving us a room on the top 6th floor. We could still faintly hear the garbage trucks early in the morning but unless you're a super light sleeper, it shouldn't be a big problem. There was a breakfast room which we didn't use and no restaurant but there are tons of dining options close by in the area so that wasn't a problem for us. For a short stay in Paris this is a good choice.

<Content>Excellent Choice - Great Value Just returned from a 2 night stay at Hotel D'Albe and would thoroughly recommend it. Great location - particularly welcome after struggling on the Metro with two suitcases.We stayed in Room 211 which has the balcony at the front of the hotel where the D'Albe sign is. We were able to stand on the small balcony, sip a glass of wine and soak up the atmosphere of the hustle and bustle below. However, once the windows were shut the double glazing did its job and we slept well on both nights.We received a warm welcome at reception and they did highlight that breakfast was not included in the price (unlike previous reviews). Skip breakfast at the hotel and eat at the cafe next door. Plenty of local restaurants with a wide choice of culinary styles.The rooms were small but clean and were ideal for City Centre touring. The hotel is well situated for visiting the city. Notre Dame is within walking distance, the Metro is close at hand and Open Top bus tours and River trips are available close by.Would recommend this hotel as great value for money. Yes the rooms are compact and bijou but don't stay in your room - there's a wonderful city out there to explore. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Clean  We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with our 5 year old daughter. We had a triple room which was small but adequate and very clean. The room had a minibar which was great for storing drinks / snacks for our daughter. The hotel was a great base to explore Paris and was reasonably priced. We booked through expedia and got breakfast included in the rate. The area is quite lively but we were not bothered by any street noise. This is not somewhere to stay if you are looking for a hotel with atmosphere as there is no hotel bar or restaurant.

<Content>Would happily stay there again! We stayed here for 3 nights. Yes the rooms are small but this is Paris and this being my 4th trip I knew to expect this. The room was very clean, the bathroom was very clean. The location is perfect for doing all you want to do in Paris (Metro stop at Place St Michel) is just round the corner. As for noise, we were on the 6th floor and didn't hear anything from the street when we closed the window. I have been disappointed by Paris hotels before and this is the first that I've stayed in that I would happily go back to or recommend to someone else. You don't go to Paris to spend your time i a hotel room so what more do you want!!!

<Content>Top Notch Staff We stayed at the Hotel D'Albe for one week in September after reading wonderful reviews in TripAdvisor. We arrived before 9 AM and to our great surprise and delight, our room was ready. It was exceptionally clean and well appointed. We had a triple on the sixth floor. We did quite a bit of sight seeing so we were out and about quite early each morning. Upon our return, the housekeeping staff had come and gone. They even folded my daughter's pajamas and placed them under the pillow. The front desk arranged for a taxi and assisted us with directions and information throughout our stay. But what really impressed me was an e-mail I received the day after we left. I unintentionally left without leaving a tip for the housekeeping staff. I felt terrible and e-mailed the hotel with my apologies while assuring them that I would send something immediately. They wrote back saying that a tip was not necessary that just knowing my family and I had had a wonderful stay was more than enough. I would definitely stay here again. They go out of their way to make you feel at home.

<Content>Average rooms and loud location! We prepaid for 2 rooms with whatif at a slightly lower rate than the direct hotel's booking rates. The D'able was fully booked our first nite in Paris so we stayed at the K  K Hotel the one night, which was wonderful !! The triple was bigger than 2 rooms put together at the D'albe plus the fully equipped marble bathroom was huge and the down beds very comfortable. But since we prepaid and couldn't cancel, we moved and regretted it!! As the D'Albe hotel was full the first nite, we ended up on the 2nd floor and our daughter on the 5th floor. The room (102, I think) was tiny and not very well equipped. We wanted non-smoking but settled for opening the window. The partying noise outside went all thru the night and closing the window didn't help much. We moved to a smaller room the next nite to the 5th floor that was fairly quiet with the window closed and the noises outside subsided by 2 AM. for the next 3 nights. The bathrooms are tiny and the foam pillows, cheap sheets and rough blankets were really disappointing after the K  K. Otherwise the hotel was clean and the people polite, but as said in a previous review nothing special. We also preferred the more central location of the K  K and their direct booking special price included a wonderful breakfast.!

<Content>Great central hotel We needed somewhere for a couple of nights in Paris (2 adults and a 6 year old) and were not disappointed. The hotel is a great 3 star hotel; clean, friendly, and perfectly placed close to Notre Dame. It has no bar or restaurant (except for breakfast) but this doesn't matter because it is surrounded by bars and restaurants. We'll be back the next time we have a short stay in Paris.

<Content>Nothing Special Okay, so I wasn't planning on ever really leaving a review about this hotel but here I am looking for another hotel in Paris for our stay this year. Once I saw the raving reviews about this hotel again I had to give my honest opinion so people don't make the same mistake that we did. Needless to say we aren't staying here again. I stayed in this hotel with my husband and son for one night last year on our way to Africa. We chose this hotel based on the reviews in Trip Advisor. I have to say that we were quite disappointed with our room. We had a triple room and of course it was small no surprise there but it was the basics. The staff was very nice and the breakfast was okay. I suppose if you are looking for a no frills budget hotel in the middle of bustling activity, than this place is for you. The location is good, in the heart of the Latin Quarter and minutes from Notre Dame. Yes , the lobby may look nice in the pictures but I have learned that you can't judge a hotel by it's lobby. I am by no means overly critical or snobbish I just expected more I guess. I suppose you get what you pay for and if you want a half way decent room in Paris than you have to pay!!

<Content>Mixed Bag Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel. First, the bad --we read a number of reviews that emphasized soundproof windows; however, the noise from the street still penetrates. Some noises come through more loudly than others, such as, garbage trucks (every other morning at 5 am), police sirens, screaming, shouting, group singing, etc...and a lot of this goes on in the Latin Quarter until about 2-3 a.m. With that said, the windows do keep out approximately 70% of the noise. Without the double thickness, the location would be unbearable. Regarding the individuals at the front desk, some were more pleasant than others. The last morning of our stay, we had an upstairs neighbor that literally stomped around above us making it impossible to sleep (our ceiling was shaking). When I called the front desk at 5:30 am, the attendant stated that she would look into it. Over 30 minutes later, the noise hadn't stopped so I called again only to have her say that she hadn't called the individual yet and that she had departures to take care of. One hour later, the noise had still not subsided, and I called a third time only to have her say that she was checking into it. When we checked out 3.5 hours later, we found out from her that she NEVER contacted the individual above us, and she got angry that we couldn't understand why (the noise stopped approx. 30 minutes before we checked out). She informed me that she had done all she could do and was supposed to do. Also, like too many hotels, the comforters/bedspreads and blankets had not been washed prior to our arrival. We found hair and spots on the bedding.The good news is that the room, with the exception of the blankets and comforters, was very clean. Even though it was small, we had enough space to navigate and store our very large duffel bags/suitcases and other carry-on size bags. The rooom was small, but designed to be very efficient in managing the lack of space. The bathroom was probably the best feature of the room. It was very clean and the shower was wonderful. The beds were comfortable to sleep in and the heating/air conditioning unit was working very nicely. Lastly, the location is priceless, being located between two metro stops, St. Michel and Cluny-Sorbonne. The RER is accessible from both, which makes it amazingly convenient coming to an from the airport let alone any other location in Paris and the suburbs. The bakery/patisserie located beneath the hotel serverd delicious breads, crepes, and coffee. The bonus was having a Haagen-Dazs a stone's through from the hotel. However, I wouldn't advise eating too often in the Latin Quarter because the food really wasn't that great, but you do get what you pay for and most of it was very cheap.

<Content>Great location, but also a loud location. We really liked the location. The hotel is conveniently located on an RER stop and a metro stop. Also, the hotel is in a very lively and vibrant part of the city. Here you'll find small narrow roads and street performers. So, the flip side is that it's often loud. The windows do a pretty good job, but if you're a light sleeper, then this probably isn't the place for you. More than the outside noise, inside hotel noises were worse. Very thin internal walls, which I have found pretty normal for hotels.We found the reception staff to be quite helpful and pleasant. They speak more than sufficient English.Please note that the hotel has one elevator and it is not big enough for more than 2 people and 1 big suitcase. You'll have to walk a lot of stairs.There are plenty of places to eat and drink around the area.The hotel is very, very close to Notre Dame. It's also about a 10 minute walk to the Louve. One day, we even walked all the way to the Eiffel Tower. It's a long walk, but a nice one along the Seine River. We are very big walkers, however.More than anything, we enjoyed the lively attitude in the area.

<Content>Great hotel! just came back from Paris... and LOVED the D'Albe. As posted in other reviews, it truly is all about the location. Yes, the rooms were def on the smaller side, but everything was very clean. the staff was helpful. and were for the most part, friendly. i recommend this hotel for people who do not intend on spending any time in it (even though it was comfortable). the price was very fair for paris. however, i do not recommend this hotel for people who want a large room, or a fancy lobby, as there is just a small desk. this is definitely not a 5-star hotel. the location is very close to Notre Dame and Saint Chapelle. It's in the heart of the latin quarter, which is very touristy... (i recommend not eating dinner here, as the food is much better in the surrounding blocks). it can get a bit loud if you're facing the street. didn't bother us, as we stayed out late, but if you go to sleep before 12 and you have a problem with even the slightest bit of noise, request a room facing the back. we were on the 5th floor, and had a little balcony, which provided a little bit of views. Also, try to book directly with the hotels website... Exclusive-hotels, saved almost $30 a night booking directly through them. also, make sure you let them know whether or not you want the breakfast. it's 12 euro a person, which was definitely too expensive for us, as there is a little bakery downstairs where you can get croissant and coffee for 2 for 7 euro.overall, loved this hotel, and i'm recommending it to everyone i know :)

<Content>Location, location, location Just returned from a few days in Paris staying at this excellent establishment - couldn't fault it. Only a few steps from the metro/RER and just about everything else on the doorstep. Although I'd read Trip Advisor reviews before booking through Expedia I was pleased to find it was all true. Brilliant holiday and when I return to Paris, I shall certainly return to this hotel.

<Content>Great location but that is about it. I must say I only booked this hotel based on reviews from trip advisor and was actually dissapointed. The room albeit very clean was in fact very small and I did not find the reception staff very helpfull. We asked the receptionist for help confirming an excursion by phone and she wouldn't.The location is good if you wish to be in the heart of the latin quarter but quite a distance from the major sights of Eiffel Tower etc.

<Content>A great little hotel at a great location My husband and I spent a week in early September 2006 at the Hotel D'Albe located in the Latin Quarter. The location is superb--close to the Metro, about a 5 minute walk from Notre Dame and about a 20 minute walk to the Louvre. There are many good restaurants within the neighborhood and in particular, an excellent Salon de The right next door with wonderful croissants, pastries and sandwiches. Although the hotel is located right in the heart of the Latin Quarter, the double pane windows and heavy curtains ensure privacy and quiet. The rooms and bathroom were small, but extremely clean. The staff at the front desk were without exception friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Buzzing location, great service We spent one night here on our trip, and this hotel was a great find. The location is superb, in the heart of the latin quarter, which is full of life and character, and we were very happy with the room. Breakfast was very nice and we got a good pot of tea!!! We wouldn't recommend this for those needing early nights and quiet as the area is vibrant and lively until 1-2am. For everyone else it is a great location - right next to St. Michel metro station, with a artisan boulangerie below the hotel, which serves great crepes in the evening! It is a great base for visiting the main tourist attractions and for shopping on Rue de Rivoli. Reception were very helpful and friendly and we enjoyed our stay here.

<Content>Great hotel, in the heart of the Latin Quarter's tourist area My wife and I stayed at the H么tel d鈥橝lbe for six nights in mid-July 2006, during the Paris leg of our honeymoon. We were looking for a nice, clean midrange hotel with air conditioning, located in an interesting part of the city. The Albe delivered nicely on all counts 鈥?we were both very satisfied with our choice.At first we were overwhelmed by the incredible choice of lodging in Paris, but we soon narrowed our focus to the Latin Quarter. We could find little agreement among our guidebooks on the best places to stay, so we decided to rely on TripAdvisor.We started by looking at hotels under 鈧?00, and were attracted to the Carofftel Gobelins (鈧?2) and the Comfort Inn Mouffetard (鈧?0 Internet rate on the hotel chain鈥檚 web site). But since this was our honeymoon and my wife's first trip to Europe, we decided to pay more for air conditioning and upscale decor. We found a deal on a double room on the Paris Charming Hotels web site, which gave us one free night and breakfast for two for the length of our stay. Average price per night worked out to 鈧?26.We found the service to be quite friendly, albeit 鈥減rofessional鈥?rather than 鈥渨arm鈥? Our guest room and adjoining washroom were both small (by North American standards), but very nicely finished. The bed was comfortable, the shower excellent, the air conditioning efficient, and the common areas modern and immaculate. We also liked the fact that the hotel had a minibar fridge that could be used to refrigerate grocery items, and an in-room safe. Be aware, however, that the elevator is typical of many older retrofitted European buildings, which is to say quite small 鈥?you will often find yourself waiting, or taking the stairs.Unlike some other posters, we were very pleased with the breakfast. True, the selection was a bit limited and the pastries merely adequate, but for a continental breakfast the offerings were perfectly reasonable: boiled eggs, toast, jams, pastries, cereal, yogurt, cheese, and meats. The best part was that, since it was a buffet, we could eat as much as we wanted, which often freed us to eat a snack rather than a full lunch later in the day.Access from CDG airport could not have been better. Even with two large suitcases, and two carry-ons, we had no problem getting to the hotel by RER B. Once above ground (use the Blvd. St. Michel exit), the H么tel d鈥橝lbe is a mere stone鈥檚 throw away. The St. Michel station lies on line 4 of the M茅tro, which also happens to be one of the most useful lines in the city in terms of destinations and connections.The only caution we would offer is that the hotel鈥檚 location 鈥?right in the heart of the Latin Quarter鈥檚 tourist restaurant area 鈥?is bustling with street performers and crowds well into the night. Reports from others about early-morning garbage truck noise are also spot-on. We loved the easy access to 脦le Notre Dame and the Seine, and the excellent hotel windows kept out 95% of the noise, but those who prefer a quiet neighbourhood should look elsewhere.

<Content>what a great place wonderful hotel, ideally located beside metro stations. Also very convenient for those who arrive to paris using charles de gualle airport as you just use the RER B line from the airport and you can get off at the hotel door. lots of nightlife and cheap restaurants around the hotel and the staff were very friendly and could all speak good english. the room was great with a view over the streets, nice and clean and we had a wonderful time in Paris.

<Content>Good hotel, brilliant location Just returned from a long weekend in Paris and stayed at this Hotel. I had read all the reviews beforehand and they are absolutely right, it's a little gem. The Hotel is right outside the Metro on a corner in the Latin District. There is an amazing shop next door where we had breakfast every morning sitting outside watching the world go by. It is so good that there were always queues later on in the day and outside you could buy freshly made crepes, ice cream and freshly made baguettes. As mentioned the breakfast was 12 euros and so I can't comment on how good it might have been!The room was clean and well equipped. We had a room on the 5th floor with a good view of the River. One complaint and it is only a small one is that our room was right opposite the lift (yes, it is tiny and only 4 people can get inside at a squash) and the cleaners started work early and would chatter away outside. OK if you are going to go out early but when you wanted a bit of a lie in, not so good!Walk out of the hotel, turn right and in front of you is the amazing sight of the Notre Dame...........wonderful!Staff are helpful and friendly.All in all a lovely hotel in a good location.

<Content>Can't wait to go back Just back from 4 fantastic days at the fabulous D'Albe hotel St.Michel. We had a medium sized room on the fourth floor which included a large modern bathroom. The room was immaculate, small tv with English channels (Including MTV), comfortable double bed, air-conditioning, double wardrobe with full length mirrors, minibar, safety deposit box, large desk and chair, bedside lockers with lamps. The linen and towels were replaced daily. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. Breakfast at 12 euros was steep enough but plentyful and tasty. So many resturants and bars in the area, we couldn't choose! The location was magnificent, we didn't need to use the metro as everything was so close. In the cab on our way to D'Albe the taxi driver commented on the superb tourist location we were staying in (He was spot on!). There was such a fantastic atmosphere surrounding this hotel! I'll be back to Paris and wont be staying anywhere else :)

<Content>Perfect Little Hotel The hotel is located in the Latin Quarter, near the Sorbonne and Notre Dame. I had a non-smoking room on the 2nd floor, which was larger than I expected. I had a double bed, desk, large closet, large bathroom with a tub and a chair in the corner. There was plenty of room for me to walk around and keep my luggage, although I'm on the smaller side and a couple may find it a bit too cozy if they plan to spend a lot of time there. The hotel has air conditioning which I used, not only because it was warm, but because I had to keep my window closed at night - there is a lot of activity outside.The hotel was steps away from the St Michel Metro station, and close to a lot of shopping. There are a large number of cafes, restaurants and bars in the immediate pedetrian only neighbourhood. I was travelling alone and even walking at night I wasn't afraid - the neighbourhood is very vibrant and busy.There is a dining room on the ground floor where there serve breakfast in the morning. it was included in the price I paid on Expedia, so I took advantage of it. Everything was fresh - eggs that you could boil to your liking, cereals, milk, yogurt, ham, cheeses, pastries, bread, croissants, jams, honey, nutella (in cute little individul size serving packets), orange juice, coffee, tea, hot chocolate.... They serve breakfast from 7:30 - 10:30 and I'd recommend going early when its less busy.The hotel was very clean. The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. I was able to check in when I got to the hotel at 9am, which was wonderful. I was able to shower and change before my first day of sightseeing. There is only one elevator and it's small - I used the stairs except when I was carrying bags/luggage.The only word of warning that I have is with respect to the television. The tv (a small one, by the way) had 17 channels, with programs in French, English, German and Italian. At night, a couple of the channels show some movies/programs that you would not want your children (or yourself) to see! Beware if travelling with your kids and if they have their own room.Also, the hotel does have a computer in the lobby with internet access, but it was unavailable during my visit. I was not traveling with a laptop (if I recall, wireless access may be available in the hotel), but there was a huge internet cafe a few blocks away, which was quite reasonable.I highly recomment this hotel if you're looking to stay somewhere and don't need to be grand - great location, good value, very quaint.

<Content>Best location for sightseers in Paris Our family of 5 stayed 8 nights at the Albe from July 12-20. We had two rooms, one twin #105 and one triple #103, both on the first floor above ground level.The biggest advantage of this hotel, as everyone has said, is its central location next to Place St-Michel in the Latin Quarter. We were able to do much of our sightseeing by just walking in one direction and then walking or taking the metro back. We also took the RER to CdG for our flight back, and it was easy since there is no need to switch lines. The adjoining cafe (in fact it is immediately below room #103) is inexpensive and perfect for a quick breakfast. Although cheap restaurants abound, I'd recommend you walk another 10 minutes to the better quality restaurants where you can get excellent prix fixe dinner menus for around 鈧?5.Other pluses: Spacious rooms (for Paris); clean modern bathrooms; great air conditioning in each room, and quiet when the windows are closed; comfortable beds; in-room safes and TV; helpful bilingual front desk staff.Negatives: The street cleaners and garbage men make a racket before 7am; expensive 鈧?2 breakfast; tiny elevator.We heartily recommend this hotel to any visitor to Paris!

<Content>Loved the D'albe St. Michel My girlfiend and I stayed at the Albe St. Michel in late May and early June. This is a great hotel. As you can see from the other posts, the hotel is clean, friendly, etc. On this post I will try to give you an overall feel of the place.  This hotel is located on a mostly pedestrian steet very much in the middle of the Latin Quarter. The street scene in the daytime has many tourist walking in the streets visiting souvenier shops and the many restaurants. The restaurants are very varied from low cost to mid-range featuring cuisine from all over the world. The ambiance of the street is wonderful with cobblestones and most restaurants spilling out on the sidewalks and into the street.  At night the street is alive with people going to dinner, street musicians and performers, and people on an evening stroll. It was never rowdy or overrun with the bad element. We never felt unsafe or like we were in the middle of a keg party. Once inside the hotel room the double-glazed windows made it virtually silent even on the second floor above the street.  You can't beat the location: steps from the metro, 100 yards from the Seine River, and an easy stroll to most attractions on the left bank. We went to many of the cafes and bakeries right beside the hotel and they were outstanding.

<Content>Helped make 40th Birthday Celebraton Special Spent fantastic weekend in heart of city at D'Albe Hotel which came highly recommended by friends  family who had stayed previously. More than lived up to it's press and helped to make a birthday celebration to remember!Clean, well cared for hotel; extremely helpful staff. Ltd noise from due to double glazing and air conditioning in rooms. All rooms are clean and tidy and have good facilities.Breakfast served in small dining area - good selection of food.Located close to all the sights - many within walking distance and close to Seine. Enjoyed using Batobus to get to main sites - no need to rely on Metro. Good travel links incl direct to CDG by RER. Excellent restaurants/cafes close by suiting most budgets. Patesserie below - excellent for takeaway lunches, etc.Already recommended to friends and colleagues  will return again!

<Content>Solid Hotel We spent two nights as a family of four at the Hotel D'Albe in May 2006. The location cannot be beat! It is central to so many sites, restaurants, and shopping. Our room was lovely and had a great view of the Latin Quarter. The staff were very helpful and the hotel was very clean. I have recommended this hotel to friends and family and would definately stay here when in Paris again.

<Content>3rd Stay at Hotel D'Albe and still extremely satisfied This was our third stay at the Hotel D'Albe last week and it didn't disappoint. It's still immaculate with the crispest, whitest sheets, beautiful clean bathroom with thick towels and heater, excellent very helpful desk service and a delicious breakfast served by a cheerful waitress. They now have flat screen tv's in the room and a laptop was available for a small fee.After traveling around Paris on the Metro each day, its wonderful to come up out of the Metro and there is the hotel - just feet away. The location couldn't be better - close to almost everything and if not, there's the convenient Metro, taxi station, and bus stop.We would never stay anywhere else.

<Content>great hotel My husband and I have just returned from europe and really enjoyed our stay at the hotel D'albe in St Michel. We couldn't fault a thing! The room was fairly small, typical in size for Europe, we requested a room with a bath which was a godsend at the end of the day for our tired feet. Cyril at the front desk went over and beyond the call of duty to assist us when ever we had a question.We bought breakfast from the bakery below the hotel and found several great places to eat on the doorstep.The position, cleanliness and staff all made this a great hotel to stay in.

<Content>Great place. Mediocre attitude. We stayed at the hotel from the 25th to the 30th of May, 2006. Well, this was our (my wife, 2 yr old baby and me) intention. We made the reservation 3 months ahead of time and got very good and prompt answers on the email. The night before arriving we posted an email to remind the staff that we're coming the next day late night and we got an OK. However, when arriving at the hotel we were told that there are no rooms for tonight and we were offered a 2 stars hotel for one night. As you may imagine, when it comes after a 5 hrs flight + 1 hour RER + climbing up and down the stairs of the Saint Michel station with a 30Kg suitacase and a baby stroller, all at midnight, we were very disappointed from this. When asking why couldn't they ask someone else coming earlier without a baby to move for the night we got no answer. As we had no other alternatives we moved for the night to the 2 stars hotel. No one offered any help with our lagguage.When arriving next day to the hotel we found a very helpful receptionist and a very friendly kitchen staff. They helped us find our way, sterilize our baby's milk bottle etc. In the weekend the receptionist was changed and the new one's attitude was not as helpful as the first one. She soured her face for every question we had and did not bother to look on the web (she has a free one at the reception desk) for some very basic info we needed.Location of the hotel is good, although it's a bit challenging with a baby stroller (as using the metro is a nightmare). Using the buses to go to the Eiffel Tower was quite cumbersome. Going to the Arch de Triumph is just impossible. Fortunately, on Sunday there is the BalaBus (no one in the hotel knew about it) that has several stops in touristic places (including Arch de Triumph) that made it a direct drive from St Michel.Windows of room are indeed noise proof but be ready to use the AC as it turns the room to be over warmed.The room was not as clean as we expected it to be (linen was not 100% white) but in general the room was ok, even for the 3 of us (don't bring more than one suitcase, though).We expected a bit more from a hotel that is rated among the top 20 hotels in Paris, according to the recommendations in Trip Advisor. We were disappointed.

<Content>It's All True! It鈥檚 all true! Immaculate, good sized rooms (for central Paris!), with quality bathrooms. Good breakfast selection, not limited to croissant  coffee. Stayed on the top floor so sound from the street wasn鈥檛 an issue, but friends who stayed on the 1st floor said the sound-proofing was fine at that level as well. Very helpful concierge and staff generally friendly. As an aside I felt that Parisian service had improve a lot in the last few years, perhaps as a result of competition from other European capitals in the age of cheap air travel.However, the killer is the location. We wasted our 3-day 鈥榁isite鈥?travel passes as so much was in easy walking distance of the hotel 鈥?Notre Dame, Pompidou, Louvre, Les Halles, Luxembourg Gardens and more. In the evening there is a huge choice of cheap to mid-price restaurants and eateries within a few minutes walk, although as others have observed the stylish, up-market restaurants are less prolific. But the caf茅 bar prices in Paris鈥?arghh!

<Content>Right in the middle of it all We (10 of us) have just returned from Paris and I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. With Paris, its all about location. This hotel is very close to a major metro line (St Michael's) and is excellent for getting around all the sights. It has a multitude of restaurants, bars and cafe's on it's doorstep and the food ranges from very cheap to very expensive, and all types of food to choose, from Indian, Chinese, Italian and of course French, depending on what you want.Although the hotel is right where the action is, there is very little problems with noise, if any.Prior to booking, we were looking for a clean hotel with good cooments from previous guests. This hotel met all of our expectations. It was excellent. As always with Paris, the rooms were small, but one of the couples in the group stayed in a room with a balcony and their room was twice the size of the others. The staff were always on hand to help, even trying to book us on a river cruise with only 2 hours notice before we wanted to sail!!The breakfast was excellent quality and plentyful, although cheaper one's were available next door, but with a more limited choice.Would any of us stay there again? Without doubt.

<Content>Very clean, nicely decorated, a modern feel My husband and I stayed at the Hotel D'Albe in October 2005 for a week. The room was very efficient. Close quarters (like everywhere in Paris, I understand), but the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was really top-notch, and we could control the heat/temperature. Everything was very clean, and was kept that way throughout our stay.We did not eat breakfast there - we thought they were pricey. But there's a great bakery next door that seems to be open at all hours, and that became our breakfast spot.The location was fabulous: right off Place St. Michel, very close to the Metro, a block or 2 from Notre Dame, plenty of little places to eat, as long as you didn't want to be fancy, and lots of shopping and people watching. The area is very active at night, and can be noisy from the room, but with the windows closed, the room is soundproof.If you're looking for old-world elegance, this is not your hotel - but if you're looking for a reasonable, classy place in a great location, you can't do better.

<Content>What's not to love about Hotel D'Albe? Our room was spotlessly clean and quite comfortable. Nice little amenities such as a heated towel rack, minibar and terrace. Room, small by American standards (as are virtually all European hotels), is well-configured so there is plenty of space to move around and store belongings. Staff was unfailingly polite. The neighborhood can't be beat for great location to everything. The Metro/RER stop is right on the corner. The best part is the incredible boulangerie (bakery) right underneath the hotel -- delicious pastries and coffee for breakfast, and crepes for late-night munchies. If I'm forced to say anything negative...the neighborhood is a bit noisy at night (but fun), although we couldn't hear anything with the windows closed. The walls are a bit thin as well, so you will know when your neighbors are awake. This hotel is a gem and we can't wait to return.

<Content>Great location, clean and quiet rooms, friendly staff Stayed here for 2 weeks for business. It's a great location - food is available in the restaurants 24/7 - and most of it is cheap, though not much French cuisine. It's extremely close to the St. Michel/Notre Dame metro stop (and RER) as well as within walking distance to many, many museums and sights. For those US travelers who are looking for a place to stay for an extended period of time, this is a great choice. It's not the most French place that you'll stay, but it has a lot of comforts that a US hotel would have - along with a great added bonus: heated racks for your towels! Wireless internet is easy to access and fast as well.

<Content>tres bien! I stayed here a weekend and the hotel is absolutely good! At first the location: very nice, just 'round the corner of the Notre Dame and the Louvre, rue de Rivoli, Centre Pompidu just in walking distance. In the streets around the hotel there are many cheap little restaurants. The metro is just a few steps away. Then hotel itself: nice rooms (for a 3 star hotel it's just good) and a spacious bathroom wich is also clean. Every day enough clean towels. From our window we could see the Notre Dame. The rooms are quit, they're well isolated, I haven't heard anything from outside the room. The beds are also good.The staff is very friendly. There's a little breakfast room with a good breakfastbuffet. I would stay here again without a doubt! Enjoy Paris!

<Content>Albe is a winner Three of us stayed here over new year 2005/06 and were very pleased. We had a corner room which was quite small but had three sets of french windows overlooking the latin quarter. I could see the Seine from my bed!Its not a fancy hotel, but for a very satisfactory, simple, clean  courteous place to stay within this price range, look no further. The bathroom was good, there's a safe in the room, double glazing keeps the noise down despite being right in the thick of the rowdy quarter. Oh, and there's a great bakery downstairs for lazy morning pastries.

<Content>Good choice We chose this hotel from our holiday brochure based on other reviews by Trip Advisor posters. The reviews proved to be very accurate. An excellent location, being just 2 minutes away from St Michel Metro/RER station and 5 minutes from Notre Dame. We used RER line B direct from the airport. The Hotel is modernly furnished and decorated. We were given an excellent room on the 3rd floor. The bathroom was superb 鈥?good bath and shower, nicely tiled and immaculately clean. Our room had a double and single bed, the bed linen was beautifully crisp and white. We also had a view of the Seine at an angle.The double glazing was very effective and cut out the majority of noise (not sirens!) 鈥?the only time we found noise to be a real problem was on late Friday evening and I also found it difficult to sleep once the road cleaners began work early in the morning. However, this was a small price to pay for such a well located hotel. The surrounding streets had a vast choice of restaurants and caf茅s. My husband was particularly drawn to the creperie next to the Hotel Reception. He couldn鈥檛 resist the 鈥楴utella鈥?crepes.Breakfast in the hotel was good, a choice of croissants, cereal, fruit, yoghurts, bread rolls, cheese, ham, boiled eggs and tea, coffee etc. The staff were always helpful, friendly and polite and spoke English if needed.The only time I felt let down, and it seems almost petty to mention it, but once we鈥檇 used up the 2 little bottles of bubble bath and the shoe cleaner sponges (a necessity) provided in our room on arrival, they were not replaced 鈥?we were there 5 nights.Not wishing to end on a negative, I can positively say 鈥?a good choice of hotel for first timers to Paris.

<Content>Location great...hotel ok... In terms of location the hotel is excellent. Right by the St Michel metro (on line 4 from Gare du Nord for those arriving via Eurostar), 5 minutes from Notre Dame, 15-20 mins walk from Louvre, a short hop on the RER to Musee d'Orsay  Tour Eiffel.The hotel is modern in appearance - very clean, functional reception area with bright lights and leather look couches. Other communal areas are clean and well maintained although we can't comment on the breakfast area as we didn't eat there (more of that later). As with most Parisian hotels it is not spacious and the lift is rather small  the stairs/corridors are not wide. We were fine though as we didn't have much luggage and are young and fit! Larger people and/or those with big heavy suitcases might have problems getting up to the bedrooms.Our room was on the 4th floor on the side (facing Rue d'Hauchette). We booked a double with shower (145Euros per night). The room was spotless and with sufficient storage space we didn't really notice the lack of floor space to move around. The bathroom was v clean (nice new white tiling) and the shower was excellent (powerful - not like the pathetic dribble you often get in hotels). There was a hairdryer in the bathroom. Our bed was a standard European double - fine for us but American visitors (plus others who are used to Queen/King sizes) should be prepared for this and perhaps consider booking a twin room (where I believe beds can be pushed together). We had a v small TV which we didn't really use - only 2 English speaking channels (CNN  oddly MSNBC news). There was a small minibar which we didn't use apart from putting our own drinks in there to chill down! We did not have a balcony but had doors which opened fully onto a Juliette balcony (waist high railings). We did not really open them except when we were going out to air the room out. We had aircon which worked very well and was quiet. Rooms have blackout curtains - great for those who get woken up by the early morning sunshine!Other reviewers have commented on the noise from the street below. They are not wrong. We specifically asked for a high room having read the reviews but even on the 4th floor if we opened our balcony doors it was very noisy. With the doors closed you could barely hear a rumble and with the aircon on it was silent. That said I would not want to be any lower  certainly would avoid taking a room on the 1st or 2nd floors.We did not breakfast at the hotel - at 12Euros for a continental breakfast we felt this was a bit of a rip off. There is a nice coffee shop/bakery next to the hotel where you can get fresh pastries for 1-2Euros and coffee.We would not recommend going to any of the restaurants around the hotel - yes they are very busy full of unsuspecting tourists but there are so many better options not very far away. We are from London and would never eat somewhere like Leicester Square - this seems to be the Paris equivalent of there. It is only a short walk to St Germain des Pres where there are much better options, we came across some nice places close to the St Sulpice metro.If you are looking for a central, clean hotel in Paris then we would definitely recommend. It was reasonably priced by Parisian standards and was all you could ask for in a hotel.

<Content>Perfect in every way This hotel is in the most perfect position right at the St Michel station, near Notre Dame, near most things. The hotel is very modern inside with lovely rooms(small but adequate) and clean modern bathrooms. The entrance is very attractive and everything about the hotel is great. Staff were wonderful and the breakfast was excellent. Everything was perfect. Air conditioning worked well and the rooms were very soundproof. It is in the heart of the Latin district. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Fantastic location This recently refurbished hotel is smart, clean and comfortable. Clean modern bathrooms and comfortable beds. Despite being in the heart of the action the sound proofing kept the street noise to a hum and the air conditioning was quiet and effective.Only 20 yards from the RER link to Ch-de-Gaulle and very close to the hopper boat services.Staff friendly and helpful. All spoke good English if your french wasn't up to scratch.Location, location, location.......and comfortable and affordable. We will definatley return.

<Content>Another great stay at the Hotel D'Albe We loved this hotel last year and returned again this year. The same things hold true - immaculate hotel with the crispest, whitest linens, the best location, delicious breakfast, delightful, helpful, and English speaking staff. Its such a pleasure to climb out of the Metro after an exhausting day and see your hotel a few feet away. This is a very lively neighborhood and the people watching while sitting in a very nearby cafe is very entertaining. I recommend this hotel to everyone I talk to and certainly to all the readers here.

<Content>More refurbishment Stayed here for a 4 day break April 2005. Room and en suite bathroom spotless and appeared to be newly refurbished in the style of a mini Novotel. Mini bar and safe in room. Rubbish TV channels! Bathroom with quality fittings; bath and shower plus little extras like tissue box on the wall, heated towel rail, hair dryer etc. Six more rooms currently being refurbished. Balcony over the street. Quite warm at night even in April so could be hot in summer, air conditioning manual with noisy-ish fan. Brilliant location. Narrow streets in surrounding area crammed with Spanish, Italien, Chinese, Thai, Greek restaurants. Tourist fare at fixed price menus from 10 euros. If you want quality French cuisine go elsewhere. However our 10 year old loved the creperie just outside the hotel door!

<Content>Loved the Hotel D'Albe St Michel Great hotel !!! Right in the middle of everything !Size of the room although not spacious , was larger than your average European standardVery clean! Great shower! Centrally located ! Stones throw from the Notre Dame . Metro and RER stations close by. tons of restuarants and cafes right downstairs. Staff spoke English and was somewhat helpful - although kinda snooty- but hey, they are French , right? This was my third time in Paris- and by far the best place I stayed at.Too bad that this trip was marred by the fact that we found ALL the Parisiens to be arrogant and disdainful.

<Content>immaculate hotel, superb location We were at the hotel in early November 04. We chose it because of the good reviews others who had stayed there had written about it. It exceeded our expectations - we were so impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel, particularly the bathroom which was really spotless. All windows are double glazed, so the busy streets below won't keep you awake at night.We were even more impressed with its location - it is surrounded by many bars and restaurants, and we felt safe to walk in the area at night. It is only a few minutes' walk from Notre Dame and the Louvre.We highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in the Latin Quarter.
