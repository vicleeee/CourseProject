<Content>A Buzzing, Smokin' Vibe, but not for all the right reasons The two staff members we encountered when checking in and checking out were pleasant and professional (no sign of the haughty attitude mentioned in a previous review). Our room (I believe it was the largest style available - a Superior Room) was a respectable size for a boutique hotel and nicely appointed, though I don't think was great value for money at $300 per night by any stretch of the imagination. There was a distinct smell of stale cigar smoke in our room, which we found overpowering each time we came back into the room after being out. Worst of all was the constant buzzing of mosquitoes throughout the room and bathroom - we killed ten or so before going out for the night and mentioned the problem to the receptionist, but are still not sure anything was done about it while we were out for the evening because we had the same problem all through the night.The bed was very comfortable, the linen felt luxurious (aside from the squashed mozzies on the sheets), the decor was stylish. the lighting was totally ineffective, the curtains (which look nice) need to be thicker to block out the early-morning sun for guests like us who were out celebrating late), a bathrobe or two in the room would've been a nice touch and a couple more towels (thicker) and toiletries would have been appreciated, The foyer and hallways looked great - the black and white silent movies were very hip. The back entrance of the hotel was littered with rubbish, so needs to be checked and maintained more vigilantly by the staff.We loved the Darlinghurst location and there are great cafes close by. All in all we didn't have a negative experience, but there's still plenty of room for improvement before the Kirketon is deserving of fantastic reviews and offers a stay that is worth the price paid.

<Content>One night only.. I stayed at the Kirketon back in September with my partner - It was his birthday and i wanted to surprise him. Prior to arriving i arranged for some small decorations to be placed in the room as part of the surprise - They had no problems in arranging the room for me. When we arrived we were checked in by a lovely fellow who insisted on carrying the bags up to our room which was on the second floor (as there was no lift). The room we booked was an executive room - (I was informed by reception that a premium or executive would be suitable for 2 people). This room was lovely, nicely set out with plenty of room for moving - It was dark which i assume is one of the main features of the hotel - Including the stairway and halls. The black and white movies playing in the halls were one feature i truely liked along with the mirrors running down the hall. There are not many Boutique hotel like this one around - The friendly staff, cool atmosphere and location would definately bring be back to this hotel.

<Content>Spacious for a compact room I arrived in Sydney early in the morning and was able to get my room immediately prior to normal check in time. Staff was friendly at check in. I had booked a compact room for 135 AUD/night. Compared to hotel rooms in e.g. London this room was actually quite roomy for one person. It had a separate walk in closet with ironing board, mini bar, safe. The batroom was also spacious for a small room. There was plenty of room to open a large suitcase on the floor and still room to walk around the bed, enter/exit room etc. Room was clean with good quality sheets. You could hear some noise from the room next door but it was not disruptive. Drawbacks; no view at all (frosted window and brick wall less than a meter from window). No lift, you have to carry luggage up one or two flights of stairs (staff offered to help with bags). Found small cockroach, but this is Australia so I guess those things are hard to avoid. Overall my impression was that the room was clean and tidy.

<Content>The Kirketon is Amazing! The Kirketon is definitely my preferred hotel in Sydney, the location is great, walking distance to cafes and restaurants. The rooms are stylish, comfortable little abodes, where the Kevin Murphy toiletries are an added special treat. The staff are fantastic to deal with, right from making your booking to checking out. They are professional, courteous and always make me feel welcome. This hip little boutique style hotel will see me returning many more times.

<Content>Not all bad yet not quite the hype either I was looking through the Wallpaper guide to Sydney and found a great description of The Kirketon as a great place for value and style in Sydney. While it was certainly stylish, I could immediately suspect that it was past its prime. Even so - the staff I encountered were very helpful and courteous. Very small base rooms but stylish in a minimalist way. Large wall mirror, built in stereo, bar, and rain shower were good touches but nothing luxurious.We found the location in Darlinghurst just fine and close to the train station and other neighborhood bars. That was good because both the bar and restaurant had recently closed so no luck there. Try the World Bar down the street!We stayed in 3 Eight hotels during our trip. The Cosmopolitan was definitely the best and the Pensione was the worst. IF you want small and cramped and NO style, try that one!

<Content>I'm sorry to have been such an inconvenience! Wow, the idea of a boutique hotel seems so romantic, doesn't it? Away from the mainstream, off the corporate conveyor belt, no loyalty cards or being upsold to spa packages at every opportunity...What boutique seems to translate to - at least with this hotel - is complete lack of service or comfort. In fact, I'd like to apologise to the staff of the Kirketon for being such an inconveniece! Firstly, to the gentleman that checked us in: I so do hope that showing us to our room (no, don't worry about taking our bags - we'll lug them up two flights off stairs ourselves) meant that you didn't miss out on your ebay auction. And I'm truly sorry for being so uninformed to as Sydney geography to even *dare* to ask directions to Oxford street - how silly of me not to bring my TomTom (At rude and aloof receptionist, turn right and walk 200 metres...). Gosh, you'd think I'd walked into the RSL and ask where the beer was.And to cap it off, check out was less than a breeze, where said receptionist does not acknowledge us in the slightest and instead spent his - albeit *very* valuable time - talking with another staff member regarding which staff drinks he wanted to comp off his tab. After dumping the keys on the front desk, the parting salvo from front desk? Hey, what room were you in? But you know what? I'm not sorry for this one... that's just woeful service. If only the heart ache stopped there. Granted, the hotel was being closed for refurbishment the day after we were leaving, but really? That's how you keep up with the times? Who uses a VCR these days? Cavemen? No, apparently the Kirketon's hotel's patrons. I loved the special touches as well - the fact that the VCR was *duct taped* (no joke!) to the underside of the circa 1992 television. I must admit, that I did have a giggle at the HiFi system. Here I was looking for a jack for my iPod, when I should have gone into my attic and brushed off my cassette collection.If only I had read the reviews posted on this site prior to booking. The only thing worse than an establishment that does not acknowledge feedback is an establishment that responds to feedback and does nothing about see management response.Oh well, back to the Hilton for me.Cheers,Chris BP.S. I did forget to mention that we did receive good service. After having our keys disabled since we were 10 minutes late for check out (!), the cleaning lady was lovely and let us in. Or is that just another symptom of the rot that matches the decor?

<Content>Terrible! This hotel is a miserable experience...Firstly the staff are unprofessional, uninformed, and aloof. In one conversation that I overheard the desk staffer was arguing with a guest who had simply requested that a taxi be called...too difficult apparently. This response may have been brought on by the fact that the same guest had just complained about the hotel's wireless internet not functioning properly...Perhaps these people think that haughtiness is hip and cool and a necessary element of the designer/boutique brand experience?The restaurant...is it ever open? I could not get lunch nor breakfast. When I asked at the desk if breakfast was available - at 9am- the answer was ah, like, I dunno, the restaurant looks shut today...but there are cafes across the street!And the room...A single threadbare blanket was not enough to keep me warm, what about another blanket? Or two? As for the music system...eventually I discovered that it had been left on to welcome guests into the room...after I had spent the whole night being kept awake by what I thought was the television from the next room. It's sound quality was so poor, the location of speakers so inappropriate, and the volume which the staff had selected so low, that I could not distinguish it from what I thought was the next room's TV. There really is nothing much to like about this hotel...it is kept relatively clean but, it is tired and desperately in need of an overhaul...both of the building and the management. I note the management response below and wonder if it's author has a real grasp of what is going on at the Kirketon?

<Content>Don't Go We arrived for a romantic night in this boutique hotel. To find a very tired hotel with rooms more like jail cells. The room was bare except for a bed with an old looking blanket. It felt very cold and empty and was veyr dissapointing considering the price. When we talked to the man at reception he told us the rooms as the same as they are on the web and we had seen the pictures there. We would have to pay full price for the night. He made us pay $2 for phone calls to get a room at the fabulous STORRIER hotel around the corner. Was rude and made no attempt to rectify the situation. I would never stay here again nor recommend anyone stay here.

<Content>OK property, but there are better choices for the money My partner  I stayed at both the Kirketon and the Diamant which are owned by Eight Hotels. The Kirketon's website talks about its award winning design, but that is from long ago. The rooms are small, old, and not well maintained. The hotel has no elevator. The day front desk person was very pleasant; however, the evening clerk was lazy and had a negative attitude. I'm sure the Kirketon was one of the first boutique hotels and was a fabulous place once upon a time. The room that we had was gray  gloomy and nothing about it could be described as hip.The Diamant costs about the same as the Kirketon and is new and well staffed. The Diamant ranks as above average. The Kirketon at best, ranks as OK.

<Content>Basic  A very basic hotel in Sydney.Location is convenient for King Cross, Oxford street and restaurants in Victoria street , but about forty minutes walking from The Opera House.Rooms small and bugs in the toilettVery, very noisy at night with its bar playing music too loud ( which I think it is not correct in a hotel). When you arrive it looks a chic-posh-glamourous hotel but after ten minutes in your bedroom you realize it is just a two stars hotel dressed to look a four stars hotelI would not be back

<Content>Great Staff We were only staying 2 nights after arriving in Sydney so we weren't hugely worried about the hotel, we weren't to be disappointed.A good location very stylish.We arrived well before check - in time and the extremely helpfull chap on reception advised us that our room was next to be cleaned and would be ready in an hour - he took our bags for us and recommended the french cafe opposite for breakfast - which is very good. In all a great location for all of sydney and a very comfortable stay.

<Content>Ruined my stay in Sydney ... rude staff, noisy, small drab rooms, poor location My experience at this hotel was appalling from start to finish. The constant music with the thumping bass in the reception and bar area was really loud in my room. And even more annoying, there was never anyone in the bar .. the thumping music was purely for the staff's own pleasureI did mention the above to reception, but he didn't even acknowledge that I had spoken !! The bedroom was tiny, and there wa not enough room to even walk around the bed (had to squeeze by to get to bathroom).The tiny window was frosted up, so couldn't even see out.Its a taxi ride or bit of a walk to town, and its right beside the red light area. Have nothing positive to say about my stay there. Would NEVER stay here again.

<Content>Staff Fantastic Stayed Kirkton for 2 days when first arrived Sydney - the location is diverse I guess you can call it...locals and tourists....Its a 15 min walk to Opera House, location is not the best for beauty but cabs are a plenty and its vibrant. The rooms are quite cool, it does exactly what it says on the tin - boutique at a budget....The showers are fab, the bathrooms great...the rooms I would suggest the executive as standard are small with not much light for the small windows....I stayed in room 333 and it was big, clean and definately worked for a short stay...no luxury reallly but good for the price....The staff are just fantastic, very friendly, helpful and will find you the best room - all in all if you want a cheap base - good location for all the city - I would definately recommend the Kirkton...thanks staff - again you were great!!

<Content>For the young or the deaf I agree with all the other reviewers that the hotel is very well located, has a nice decor and the staff and service are perfect. It's true the standard room is a bit claustrophobic. You only want to be there to sleep and the problem is you can't. Music is blaring from the restaurant downstairs all day and late into the night. Friday is even better : a disco so loud it makes the furniture tremble. We're 50 years old and not night-clubbers so we ended up tired all the time on our holiday to Sydney. We wouldn't go back or recommend it.

<Content>a nice little boutique hotel Actually stayed here in 2003 but couldnt select the date.I stayed here on the recommendation of some australian friends that lived in the Darlinghurst area at the time and I was not disappointed.Some of the rooms a little small, but at the time of the stay it was well maintained and looked after property.The location isnt near the CBD, but it is near Kings Cross and the transport that is available from there...... Theres lots of bars in the area and it is a rather cosmopolitan area where you will see all sorts of sights....Maybe though not the best place for a young family unless the cross has cleaned up its act.All in all though, i would consider staying here again

<Content>Depends what you are looking for We stayed two nights at the beginning and end of our Australian trip. The first time was in a standard room - these are small! - if you have a lot of luggage, this probably isn't for you. Second time we paid extra for a de luxe room - a lttle bigger, but not enormous.Decor is Modernist - lots of black - think W on a budget. Location is convenient - near Kings Cross travel facilities but away from the sleaze and the neighbohoods of Darlinghurst and Paddington in wlking distance. Great coffee shop for breakfast acroos the road. There is a new restaurant in the hotel but we didn't try it - too many other good places to eat in Sydney. There is no elevator but friendly reception staff happy to carry your bags. Overall we liked the Kirketon and thought it was good value for a city hotel but if you're into de luxe, go somewhere else

<Content>funky hip quirky hotel I recently stayed at the Kirketon for 2 nights when on a business trip. the hotel has been refurbished to be very modern, sleek, minimalist in design - but it is not expensive looking - more like clever use of paint, tiles and package furniture.unfortunately you can't park on site - they do have a small number of secure parking spaces available in a nearby carpark (and I saw a number of broken into cars in the streets nearby - so i was glad for the secure parking - even though I had to walk around the block).There is a restuarant/bar next door - unfortunately not open the 2 days I was there so I went out for all meals.The lock on my door was a bit dodgy but the really friendly staff taught me how to slam the door shut to lock it. Although they hadn't taught the cleaners that - but fortunately nothing was missing from room when I came back and discovered the door unlocked.The window blind was broken, the bathroom shelf was too narrow to balance the electric jug or the professional sized hairdryer. the pillows were really uncomfortable - BUT I was in a premium room which was an OK size. I overlooked the street and with double glazing the room was very quiet, the mattress was great, the TV (incl a couple of cable channels) was fine. Great rainforest HUGE showerhead. welcome choccies (yum) nice toiletries. Great placement - right near the Coke sign - one block walk to the action in Kings Cross. 2 blocks to the railway station and buses and taxis readily available. the staff were great - friendly helpful etc. I bought a special package - and thought that price was fair for the quality of the room. I do think their rack rate is HORRIBLY over priced - you could do WAY better in sydney if you have to pay their full price. Great location make it worthwhile.OH and no lift - I had to carry my luggage up 2 flights. OH - and I got free wireless internet as part of my package.

<Content>Great service - small rooms The Kirkton was a nice place to stay. Great location to Oxford Street and Paddington Markets and probably Sydney's best cafes in the near neighborhood.The rooms were a little on the small side, but they were comfortable.The website lists Avedia bathroom products, but they had something else instead (not a biggie).The staff at front desk were so helpful, I'd recommend the Kirkton for them alone!

<Content>Avoid if you are claustrophobic This hotel is reviewed as being fashionable and attractive to the fashionistas and groovy people; however, whilst the hotel staff were friendly and welcoming, the room - although only a standard room - was minute, with no window (well, there was a window, behind a blind - but it was opaque)and a tiny bathroom. This might not count in a 2 or 3 star hotel - in fact, it would be expected - but for a purportedly 4 star establishment, a little more space than just for a bed and a small table ( no matter how nattily the pillows were arranged on the mattress) should really be made somehow more clear. If grooviness is what is needed, then this hotel is for you; however, if you need light, air, and you are in any way claustrophobic, then a standard room at this place needs to be reconsidered. I checked in - and then checked out about 2 hours later, forfeiting my pre-paid account because I just could not stay in a room that was so tiny, or lie on the bed trying to watch a television suspended on a wall at an angle about 85 degrees over my head. I've been to Africa 5 times, and so do not scare easily, but this hotel room was a bridge too far for me. If you cannot handle small spaces, avoid.

<Content>Got what we paid for After a trip around Australia this was our last stop for 4 nights before returning home. The Kirketon is very stylish and we loved the reception and restaurant decor (check out the amazing coffee machine). Staff very friendly and wouldnt let us carry our heavy suitcases up the stairs (there is no lift!) Our room was compact but had everything we needed but we felt it was slightly tired and needed a bit of a touch up. I think what made it feel a bit in need of some TLC, was the old TV  VCR. I couldnt understand why, in this day and age the room had a VCR! surely purchasing DVD's wouldnt be that expensive.  The best part of the hotel is definalty the restaurant. we had a fantastic evening meal on our first night., they do great fresh pizza's and the naan bread selection starter was out of this world.If you are looking for a cheap and chic hotel you can do no wrong here. It is a good 30mins walk to the main sights of sydney but we enjoyed the walk everyday and if our legs couldnt hack it we got a taxi as they are relatively cheap. Not excellent but we got what we paid for.

<Content>Would stay here again Extremely friendly staff, clean room, great location. They give passes to a nearby gym for those who want to work out. The subway is within a few blocks. Plenty of places to eat in all directions. The reviews I had read were pretty good but the overall experience was better than I expected.

<Content>perfect base My boyfriend and I have just returend from a trip to Sydney and really enjoyed our stay at The Kirketon Hotel. If you are looking fora fantastic location to explore Sydney with relaxed Australian style service which is still very professional then this is a great hotel to stay. If you are also on a budget then this boutique hotel is perfect, our room was only 80 euros. It has a really cool design and we loved the area. We will be back

<Content>If you like your hotel to remind you of life on board a submarine... ...then this is the hotel for you. Dark corridors. Narrow, steep stairs and no lift. Rooms painted in gun-metal grey, and bathrooms with black grout. Tired decor yes, chic and modern, no. This place is resting on the laurels of yesteryear.Yes, the reception staff are very pleasant and helpful, that I can say.Beware of the 'double' bed in the rooms ear-marked for single occupancy. They are very right, one person only, as you have to sleep diagonally to fit in the bed (and I am not a giant) precluding anyone else coming to visit you.The remote for the air conditioning in both rooms I visited had to be held up to the unit, obviating all the benefits of a remote control.Thin walls meant that all the horizontal pleasures going on next door could easily be heard.And yes, the mould and missing tiles in 315 are very much still in evidence.Currently, downstairs is a building site.

<Content>Not so trendy anymore!! Stayed at the Kirketon for only one night in June 2007. I live in Sydney and had read heaps of press over the years about the ultra trendy vibe going on at the Kirketon. Decided to stay as saw a cheap last minute rate and my husband and I were dining out that evening in a nearby restaurant ( the Victoria Room - fantastic).Check in was fine, slick no fuss but not friendly. Car park is around the back lane in another building - a bit dingy but the area is reknowned for its urban fringe appeal. Car parking is extra $25 overnight but the car wash across the road from the front entrance does it for $15.No lifts or bell desk so have to drag suitcases up dark, narrow staircase with small steps. On entry into room (303) we were a bit let down. It is tired - not ultra mod trendy. It would have been ultra stylish when it was renovated in 1999 but no work has been done since. Protective seal around door was flapping off, stains on carpet, blanket on bed bobbled and worn, tiles need re-grouting, furniture is scratched and chipped. Light in bath was brown with a rust residue. No DVD only a video and an old TV. Weird music playing when we entered and it comes from radio in the cupboard as it took me ages to find it to turn it off!! Only air con and it would not heat up so room quite cool temperature -wise.Yes there are Aveda amenities but only shampoo, conditioner and body wash no moisturiser which I thought a little cheap. Chocolates on arrival are 2 after dinner mint style chocs.Not much insulation so you can clearly hear what is going on in adjoining rooms and in the corridor.Overall fine, clean and convenient if you are doing an evening in Darlinghurst. It is not cutting edge any longer and I would personally rate it alongside a Holiday Inn or 3 star property. We had an executive ing size room and it was a good size.I disagree with previous reviewer as there are a lot of breakfast places nearby - go to the next street - Victoria St for 2 Sydney instituions, Tropicana and Bar Coluzzi also Bills darlinghurst, le petit creme and a host of others are within a1km radius but you most probably have to know where they are - just ask the desk for a recommendation. Also hotel restaurant re-opens in July 2007.

<Content>Wish I were back there now... Really enjoyed my stay at the Kirketon. It's easy to find, a short distance from the King's Cross station - a quick walk to the restaurants and bars, but far enough away that it's quiet at night. The desk clerk gave me a discounted rate - lower than listed - without my asking. The room was stylish and artfully minimalist - the design used the space subtly and effectively, and there were nice touches like a top-notch stereo system. The bathroom, however, was the exact opposite: opulent and luxurious, with a great shower.Above all, I just enjoyed being in my room whenever I finally arrivedback for the night, and I didn't feel like I paid too much for it.I'd love to stay there again.

<Content>GOOD? Hmmm rethink. Stay there when we were there for our 14days honeymoon. Read plenty of review about it being a funky upbeat boutique hotel. So we decide that on our return from Melbourne that we will stay there instead of Holiday Inn Darling Harbour (where we started our trip). From there we will fly back to our home.Check in - no problem. Cool staff, not really friendly, no smile but professional.There is no carpark so they direct us to a building at the back of the hotel. We were given a room at the 3 rd floor. No Lift!!! My hubby had to carried our big luggage all the way up after check in and all the way down for check out. It was winter, instead of air-con we would like to change it to heater. No luck, hotel staff said that it cannot change from cold air to heater. No way to bring the temperature up. Cold!!Sigh ... no cafe nearby for breakfast. The only good we find is the Salt Restaurant which serves good food.If you are not into King Cross entertainment and fun, I don't see what so good about the place and location.This is what my hubby and I felt about the place.

<Content>Nice but some niggles I first stayed here a couple of years ago and it was pretty much as I remembered, with each room pretty consistent so you always know what to get. So that means the rooms are small and pretty bare, with no window/view, but they're stylishly done (if that makes sense!), look nice and make good use of the space that is available and the bed is comfortable.However, as the management response to an earlier review says, they are planning to update the hotel and going on this last stay of mine, I'd agree that it's needed. And not just replacing the old vcr with dvd player (come on guys, they cost A$50!).I would dispute their claim that there is no mould in the bathrooms - there certainly was mould on the shower curtain in my room (315) which had curled at the bottom as a result. There were loose, broken and missing tiles on the bathroom floor too. Generally the bathrooms are still one of the best things about the rooms - stylish and practical. However, the flush on the toilet was also faulty - the cistern was empty when first I needed to flush and on removing the lid and tinkering to get the water flowing it never actually filled up, so the water constantly ran, meaning I had to tinker again to get it stop and allow me to sleep!I also failed to get the aircon control to work (oh it's a bit difficult you have to point it at a certain angle from the corner of the room was the reply at check-out) but that's no use when you're laying bed. The iron also left dirty marks on the sleeve of the shirt I tried to iron, as no-one had dealt with the dirty mark on the hotplate.I was promised a manager would call me about these issues as none was there at check-out... two days later I'm still waiting.So, if you can get a good rate (I paid A$119) and need somewhere that's stylish but only to lay your head and not to spread out or hang out in the room, then go for it and enjoy the Kirketon.

<Content>Great location - Close to Kings Cross The hotel itself is located in a great spot, close to most anything you could need. I pretty much walked everywhere from here. Trains, taxi's and buses are all close. Many places to eat and markets nearby. When I arrived the kind woman at the desk helped me lug my suitcase up 2 long flights of stairs. (no lift) I don't know how I would have done it without her (and I work out). My room was nice, small but comfortable. There was no walk in closet as I read in one of the other reviews. But when I arrived there was classical music playing on the stereo in the room which was quite nice.The bathroom as grey tiled and with the dim lighting it was hard to see - especially in the shower. I also wish there had been a few hooks to hang things like towels and cosmetic case from. Internet access was available from your room if you had a laptop but it cost additional fees. I think it was $10 a day but can't remember. I took advantage of the use of a gym down the road. You pick up the pass at the front desk, show them at the gym, then drop the pass back at the front desk when you return. The gym was quite adequate and only about 5 blocks away.  Mini bar in the room was crammed with things (for purchase) so if you want to put anything in of your own, you need to remove items and what you put in must be small as it is designed for extra small bottles. The bar/rest. was not open when I was there. When I needed a cab, the staff help hail one for me. Phone messages (all but one) were delivered to me. Everyone was very helpful. All the other places I stayed in Sydney  elsewhere in Australia were more economical but didn't offer the ammenities that the Kirketon had.

<Content>Kirketon A+++++++++ It was my first time in Sydney, and so by extension my first time at the Kirketon Hotel. We stayed there on a recommendation from my parents who'd been there six months earlier and had loved it (this is saying something as they have tremendously high standards).We (my g'f and I) turned up to find the sweetest boutique hotel nestled in a great location in central Sydney. Staff met us with smiling faces and an unnatural willingness to help, anything we wanted to do they would sort for us and even get us a discount in some cases. The rooms were smart, clean and functional and the video library (in reception) was a lifesaver for the long and sleepless nights suffering from jet lag.We didn't manage to try the food in the adjoining restaurant but we did sample the bar menu which was fantastic (I won't even mention the amazing Mojito's which left us barely able to crawl up to our rooms).

<Content>Absolute Quality I stayed at the Kirketon for about a week a few months ago. Having never been to Sydney before, I was delighted to choose a place that was so easy to get to both the city sights and the beach. What I didn't realise is that the Hotel is also minutes away from some of the best pubs and restaurants in the city. The Hotel itself is very modern and stylish without sacrificing comfort for the aesthetics. The room was compact but there was still plenty of space to move around and to store all of our bags and clothes. I particularly liked that the rooms had a walk in closet and CD player. The staff were friendly and helpful, real people instead of the clones that tend to work in those huge hotels. it was a pleasant surprise to be remembered in the morning when we approached the desk. Overall, just a really good Hotel, up there with the best we went to while in Oz.

<Content>Funky Kirketon Rules! This hotel is just too good. A friend recommended we stay here in order to experience the relaxed yet stylish vibe of Darlinghurst - and we were not disappointed. The staff are courteous and considerate; the rooms well appointed and luxurious. The decor is highly-styled and comfortable - you really feel like you're buying into the cool Sydney atmosphere. Area-wise, it's smack bang in the middle of some of the best restaurants and cafes in Sydney and minutes from public transport and the city. Can't say enough to praise The Kirketon - we will definitely try to book up later this Summer when I return to Sydney.

<Content>A home away from home A true retreat in the middle of the hottest neighborhood in Sydney. I stayed at the kirketon in Dec and have to say that it made my trip a delightful pleasure. Aside from the affordable rates the hotel is a stylish hidden gem and the service is up to par for the most discerning traveler. From the comfortable beds to the cool lighting it made me feel like home. To my fellow travelers i advise you to stay and enjoy the kirketon if you want to experience the pulse of sydney's culture from the nightlife, fabulous galleries and best of all the best coffee in sydney across the street at the colluzi bar.

<Content>Better the second time around Stayed at the Kirketon for the first time a couple of years ago when the new management had just taken over and was happy with it then. Now, a couple of years on, I am even more impressed as it has undegone a refurb since the last time I was here, and my stay was even more comfortable.First thing you encounter on arrival apart from the cool and funky lobby, is the really friendly helpful staff. Needed some information on arrival and they were only too happy to help. The position of this hotel is ideal. Right on the edge of the city CBD (1 train stop), walking distance (2 min) to the best restaraunts and bars/clubs in Sydney (Kings Kross) and 10 min walk to Oxfrord Street if fashion is your thing.The Kirketon is fantastic value for money and overall an extremely enjoyable expereince. If you are after a cosy, cool boutique hotel in a great position with really friendly staff and without the attitude, I highly recommend this great Hotel.

<Content>Cool, hip, Unique - Everything Darlinghurst is about My partner and I stayed at the Kirketon for 2 weeks in March. It was our 2nd stay, and as with our previous visit we were not disappointed. The Kirketon has a funky vibe that matches Darlinghurst to a tee. The rooms are beautifully fitted out, with style and comfort in mind. The location of The Kirketon is fantastic, situated on a tree lined street, you are a stones throw away from all the best bars, restaurants and shops in Sydney. The staff are first rate and went out of their way to help us, one night even getting us a take away to have in our room!To sum up - it's a unique hip hotel, in the best location in Sydney for a great price - what is there to complain about?

<Content>5 star?? Maybe 2 Had read about this cool hotel, Traveller's top 50 etc. What a disappointment. Dark, dingy, not clean, no public areas, no lift, although staff did assist with luggage, not one chair you could actually sit on in the stark (=basic) room, although there was an artistic metal contraption that I don't think had ever had anyone's backside on it, and a wooden child-size chair that must have come from a kindergarten.The bed was reasonably comfortable, thank God, as there was nowhere else to sit/rest.Not one shelf/drawer to unpack clothing.Totally impractical. And this was the executive level room.Bathroom basic, putting the shower direct into the ceiling just means that the ceiling is now collapsing with moisture that can't escape. Mouldy grouting around bath. The room smelt of cat urine??? It may have just been the leaking sink, floor constantly wet.Antique carpet, probably a health hazard. No milk for tea/coffee.It is absolute rubbish to pretend that this is 5-star, 2 is more accurate.We have travelled widely and 2-star can be fine if that is what you expect and are paying for, not the case here.A rip-off, hiding behind Sydney's repute for trendiness/quirkiness, which here is just an excuse for lack of maintenance and slovenliness.Never again.

<Content>Visitors from Europe My partner and I, originally from Germany, are living for 1.5 years in Melbourne now! Being used to european standards, we do find it hard to find very good accommodation for a decent price when we do travel in Australia! The Kirketon Design Hotel in Sydney is one of those hotels where we love staying when we come up to Sydney!The Kirketon is refreshingly clean, stylish and stuf is very friendly! It is located in one of the best areas from where you can approach everything easily! Public transport is around the corner!Treat yourself!Sina Velke

<Content>On its way out I stayed here in April and was very disappointed to say the least. I had heard great things about this hotel, that it was kirky, hip and happening. I am from Sydney myself, actually live just around the corner in Paddington, but felt like a special night out. The restaurant in the hotel (I think it was named Salt) has gone bust and I feel that the hotel is on its way too. There was only one staff, he didn't help with the luggage, there is no lift and two sets of stairs. The room was old and tired, although I could see that it used to be hip, bathroom was pretty, but a lot of things just needed replacement. It felt like people smoked in the hotel although it was a non smoking hotel, as advertised. We were trying to arrange a wake up call, but there was nobody at the desk anymore. Beds were good, and we did have a good night sleep, and the location is great I must say. Parking is very difficult or expensive. I would not stay again, but hey I might be a bit of a princess who is used to five star treatment......you are warned.

<Content>Can't wait to visit again We visited the Kirketon Hotel in December last year and had a fantastic time. From the moment we arrived we were given outstanding treatment by the hotel staff. The rooms were lovely - unique, comfortable, stylish and very clean. The shower was amazing, and we were able to use the hotel's range of movies, wireless internet access, and top of the range stereo with surround sound. When we arrived our luggage was taken straight to the room, and when we entered the air conditioning was already on with music in the background.The customer service was brilliant - the hotel staff were friendly and very helpful. They provided local knowledge, recommendations, and advice as well as maps and suggestions of activities. They even booked a haircut for us, and the Sydney harbour bridge climb.We would definately recommend the Kirketon as a fantastic boutique hotel. It made our stay in Sydney enjoyable, and we have never experienced such great customer service.Loved it!!

<Content>Very Central A great spot in an ecclectic part of sydney. Very close to Oxford St shopping and darlinghurst eateries - you will be spoilt for choice! We booked an executive room which was immaculate (however a very interesting venture up the dark stairs). The staff were excellent. Decor somewhat strange from blacked out stairwells to cardboard sculpture on the landings. Once you get past all this the hotel is liveable - not by any standards 5 star more likely 3 star. Airconditioning was a little too warm for a barmy sydney evening and road noise could bother a person expecting a romantic night away. Good for a stop over and its location!

<Content>Past its sell by date We were encouraged to consider this hotel by the 'hype' on their web site, which is overrated. The staff are certainly friendly and helpfull but the decor of the rooms is drab, carpets dirty and furnishings minimal. The bathrooms could do with a good scrub as there is mould everywhere, and we sampled 3 rooms during our two stays. Although there are only two floors the absence of a lift is a hassle with luggage. The day before we arrived the restaurant and bars had closed - a misfortune when the hotel has no control over who runs them. They have no idea when they may re-open. The atmosphere was, therefore, lacking, it is a dark, dreary and dead hotel and I wouldn't recommend it. The location is ok if you like being near Kings Cross....but on the upside the restaurants in Victoria St are fairly good and Bill Grainger's is within walking distance. I understand they have dropped their prices and can see why.

<Content>ignore the bad reports I cannot belive some of the negative reviews posted on this site regarding the kirketon. my partner and ihave stayed here twice and on both occasions found it a really great place to spend some time. the decor is fabulous. a modern delight obviously not to the taste of some who clearly prefer the frills and chintz of so many other so-called top hotels. rooms are clean tidy and functional. the location is brilliant, so close to the action of oxford street, paddington, surry hills etc. great cafes and bars nearby make it our fave place in sydney. we have no connection to this hotal but thoroughly recommend it.

<Content>Excellent value for the price The Kirketon Hotel is an excellent value for the price. Although our room was very small (typical by European standards), it had a walk-in closet with mini bar, and a medium sized bathroom. The style was minimalist, which echoed the d茅cor of the public rooms. There was a stereo/cd player that had classical jazz when we arrived, and a comfortable bed (we had a premium room). I think the room probably could have used a little art on the walls, and I don鈥檛 think we had a clock. The property is very well located about 3 blocks from the King鈥檚 Cross subway stop, and about 4-5 blocks from the caf茅鈥檚, clubs and restaurants of Oxford Street. The staff was very courteous and helpful, especially Adrian who gave us several excellent restaurant recommendations! He also recommended seeing the musical Pricilla Queen of the Desert, which was very fun. The staff arranged getting our tickets, made dinner reservations, provided maps, etc. This very personal attention is what gives the Kirketon an edge over a chain hotel, or a larger property.

<Content>Cool but small We stayed at the Kirketon for business and because we flew to Sydney for a wedding. We stayed there five days. The hotel is slick and minimalist, the staff are friendly and informative and overall the stay was ok. Loved the location. For a more comfortable stay over this amount of time however I would probably aim to get a hotel with larger rooms. If you are by yourself on businesss it would be fine, but I was there with my partner and there is not enough cupboard space for two people. THe bathroom is very narrow also. We had a front room which was great because it had two large windows. If the room didn't have any windows, which some of the room don't I would feel very claustrophobic.THe mini bar is full with a contraption that charges you if you take something out of the fridge. This is a problem because there is no room to put anything else, like water or milk. We aksed the staff if they could remove some items for us each day and they failed to follow through with the request. Our airconditioner was faulty also.These are the main two faults but for the price i thought the Kirketon was fine, however i'll only stay there again if i am in Sydney alone.

<Content>Very average We stayed here for 3 nights in early December when visiting family. We used to live in Sydney so already knew this hotel has a great location, very handy to transport and local cafes (useful bc they don't provide breakfast.) We'd seen pics of the inside, which photographs very well.However the reality is that the designer decor is sadly not wearing that well, many of the rooms are dark and poky (inc ours - allegedly a premium room!), and our bathroom shower was a bit grubby (maybe it's too dark for the cleaners too!) Prices are on the expensive side of average, but don't be fooled that you're getting a designer room - it may have been designer in its day, but sadly it seems now the Kirkton is nothing more than average. We asked to use the wireless broadband which costs $10 a day 鈥?which also seems a bit cheeky when the broadband speed we got was quite slow. We will probably stay elsewhere on our next visit. (if it wasn't for the location we'd definitely stay elsewhere.)

<Content>Great staff, so-so rooms I was prepared having read the previous posts which generally give a pretty accurate picture of the hotel. Yes, the photos on the website are sexy. Yes, the reality is different. But at the same time to find a hotel in Sydney for AUD159 or less is pretty amazing. The rooms I had (had to switch because of noise) were a bit smelly (carpets needed cleaning desperately) and the cleaners did a pretty bad job in general (i.e. not washing the bathroom floor, etc...)The staff was excellent- Adrian in particular was very helpful. One annoying-and deceptive- practice of the hotel- beware- is their agreement with Travelex to charge you in your own currency at an inflated exchange rate. Insist on paying in Australian dollars!!!!! The hotel calls it a convenience...the reality is that your home country will still charge the same foreign currency rate even if it is in your currency...

<Content>Great staff  Stayed in the Kirketon mid November for 3 nights with my wife. The rooms are small, but they are very stylishly appointed. The shower is a fixed dish flush with the ceiling. Although with a severe drought in Sydney, you鈥檒l have to resist the temptation to stay under the downpour too long. My better half loved the complimentary Aveda products on offer in the bathroomLocation is great to enjoy cafes  bars. Stanley St. is just a short stroll away for a great selection of restaurants.Prior to arriving at the hotel, my bag went missing with my airline. The staff could not have been more accommodating in assisting in getting it back and also offered advice on where to eat/drink etc.Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Not what I expected My partner and I stayed here recently, having booked two nights online at A$175 per night. The hotel was self rated on the travel website as being 5 star and we made the mistake of expecting a 5 star boutique hotel. That it is not. At a significantly cheaper rate and as a 3 star hotel it may be ok value. At this rate it is a rip-off.The room was small and had a slightly grubby feel to it. The combination of no window and minimalist decor gave it the feel of a prison cell. Worst of all was the airconditioning, which for some reason didn't want to move from its ultra cold setting. After a night of huddling together to keep warm, we decided to check out, forfeit the next night and find somewhere else.The staff was helpful and friendly and offered us another room. We declined - the problem was more one of mismatched expectations. I went there expecting something a la the Hudson in New York and instead found something more like a country motel with no windows and nothing on the walls. Don't pay too much, don't expect too much and you will be fine. Otherwise, prepare to feel ripped off.

<Content>I am Planning to stay agian I am in the process of planning a trip back to Sydney this November after a fantastic trip last year.I am writing a review now after seeing the bad review given by another visitor, totally wrong i might add.The hotel was excellent, superb location close to pretty much every where, we walked to everything in Sydney (not always back though) Kings Cross right next door, loads of excellent restaurants and bars a few minues away, and the tube if your feeling tired.The hotel is exeptionally clean, smart and well planned. Yes it is small but we fitted everything in and moved about quite freely in a standard room, the bathroom, well what can you say, wish i had one at home. A point to make is that i travelled 30 hours door to door to see Sydney so was out with my wife a lot, If you go to Sydney to stay in a hotel room then maybe you need to go else where.The staff were really helpful and polite, The only problem we had was late night noise from another room (from the great stereos in each room) it was obviously a party so we left it til very late but then asked staff to sort out. It was sorted in minutes, enough said as far as i am concerned. I will definitly be going back and recommend it to everyone, Ignore ignorant reviewers. By the way the Bar and restaurant weren't finished when we were there so can't wait to see what it's like now, better i assume.

<Content>HAD AN AWESOME STAY i HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF TIMES AT THE KIRKETON AND ALWAYS HAD A GREAT STAY.The staff is superb and so helpful!they are young and enthusiastic. It is easy to feel welcome there.The rooms are quite small, but they have more than you need.And the beds are awesome. you can sleep like a king.Unfirtunately they don#t have a view but who would like to sit inside the room while there is so much going on outside, especially in this area?!I've also never had a shower like that.the bathrooms are small as well,but the shower is an excuse!could shower for ages...another reason to go there is the restaurant.With its stylish interior the kirketon is especially for young people or for those who feel young!A big plus is the multilingual staff! french,german,english...

<Content>Good hotel - great location. Overpriced though. My friend and I stayed at the Kirketon for a quick weekend girly getaway to Sydney. Nice exterior, very trendy. Location was really handy. We booked an Executive room, which was lucky, because that wasn't huge. But it was fine. Bathrooms were nice, shower was delicious. We like the stereo being the in the room. Bit dissapointing to open our hotel window and be overlooking cooling vents and airconditioners and nothing else. No lift, so you have to clamber up the stairs but that's okay. No room service, but there is a fantastic place just through the other side of the road called Morgans. Really nice. Mini-bar was super-dooper expensive, even by hotel standards.I would stay there again, but would try to find a cheaper rate than $189 pn for exec room, as that was probably overpriced and we could've got a fancier hotel for just slightly more money if we'd booked on Wotif. Again, can't fault the location.Recommend, but know what you're getting.

<Content>Excellent stay We had an excellent stay at The Kirketon. Good clean rooms, nice and quiet and enjoyed being within walking distance of both the city and local neighbourhood restaurants. We enjoyed a few drinks in the bar too and would definitely stay again.

<Content>Minute Urban chic Overall disappointing claustraphobic hotel. Decor is urban chic and Aveda products are a nice touch but this does not make up for dark viewless rooms we (2 couples) booked. Hauling luggage up two floors after a 14 hour flight is not what we expected. Staff are friendly and rooms are clean, to be fair

<Content>getting tired now I've stayed in the Kirketon 4 or 5 times but think this time may be my last. Nothing has changed and therein lies the problem. In a fast moving city such as Sydney then you need to be improving all the time just to keep up and sadly the Kirketon is in need of some overdue TLC. From the scuffed walls to the broken window to the dirty grout in the bathroom tiles it was clear our room had seen better days. Add to this the constant noise from the restaurant refurb, even during the Easter holidays, and I was glad to the weather was so nice and we didn't have to spend much time in the room itself.If they spend some money on bringing the place back up to scratch then I may give it another go but in future I'll stay across the road at the Darlo Bar for half the price.

<Content>dreadful for sydney Having travelled extensively over the past year staying at hotels and hostels from Raffles to basic hostels this hotel has to rate as the most overpriced and overrated hotels I have ever stayed in.We were only made aware that there was extensive refurbishment work being carried out to the restaurant and bar by a discreetly placed letter in an unaddressed envelope in our room after checking in and being directed to our very small superior room. The drilling and banging noise began at 8am, I called reception to enquire if they could hold the work off until at least 9am but they could not hear me over the racket.On check out I informed them of my displeasure but the receptionist just shrugged his shoulders.There are much nicer, quieter, reasonably priced hotels around the area.

<Content>Friendly, Central, Clean, Compact and Bijou Would generally agree with most of the comments, so I guess it boils down to personal preferences. Personally? We thought it was very nice. The Kirketon is situated at the nicer end of Kings Cross, on a one-way street, about 2mins walk from the big Neon Coco Cola sign in the heart of the district. We thought that it was in the nicer end personally. The Hotel Lobby is small and just of the main street. we were greeted by very polite and very friendly staff. They took the time to make us feel genuinely welcome. Nothing was too much trouble, and they carried our (heavy) suitcases up three flights of stairs. The Hotel is fairly modern in design, but just starting to get slightly jaded and in need of freshening up. The Hallways are a little dark, with discreet lighting, which I quite liked. The Room we had was small, but very nicely decorated. It was all very clean, and the bed was comfortable. There was a small walk-in wadrobe, with a stereo, mini-bar and safe. The bathroom was (guess what?) small, with a lovely walk-in shower (one of those ones with a BIG shower head that makes you feel more like its raining on you. There is so much to see and do in Sydney, that we hardly spent anytime in the room, so the fact that it was small didnt bother us. The only reason we could not justify a rating of excellent was the fact that it was small, and in need of a new lick of paint here and there (We were told that they were giving the restaurant a make-over). If you have already booked, or are thinking of booking, dont get anxious staying here. Its fine. really!!In the evening, there are loads of lovely places to eat if you explore areas away from Kings Cross (which was too seedy for our taste), and in the morning there are lots of lovely coffee bars, so we booked room only, and were glad we did. There are also plenty of convenience shops so getting snacks, and drinks for the room were not a problem.Overall, we would not have any qualms about going there again.

<Content>Modern, clean, central, yet small Pluses:Great location. Darlinghurst is a young, fun, area with great restaurants and shops.Near train /subway stop.Modern room wtih good A/C, great bathroom and shower, sleek, urban, nice decor and styleFriendly staffInternet high speed accessnice bed and pillows.TV hangs from above like in a hopsital.Minuses:small. Hard for two adults to really unpack and move around.we lived 1/2 our of suitcases, and 1/2 we could put in closet.No view at all. The windows overlook bridk bulding.they have nice window shade design to hide it all, but you have no idea if it is day or night or what the weather is like.At the time of writing, restaurant under construction as well as bar.No lobby. Just a small table and sort of day bed.Feel free to email me for more details, or for details about my trip to Sydney.where to go, where to eat, tips, etc.

<Content>incredibly small Ok, it's clean, in a trendy position, and has friendly staff. Unfortunately, the rooms are incredibly small and I stayed in a room at the front of the building - one of the bigger rooms apparently. Due to the purpose of my trip, I had to spend a lot of time in the room and I very much got cabin fever. Intolerable. I've travelled to NYC and stayed in much larger rooms!!! The plus side - the expensive but amazing restaurant. One of Sydney's finest.

<Content>Good value but a little scruffy Stayed here in January 2006 for 2 nights. I had to move from the original room which was located at the back of the hotel due to the horrendous noise created by the construction of their new restaurant - this woke me at 8am. I was subseqently moved to a much larger, much quieter room at the front of the hotel overlooking the street. As mentioned in a previous review the rooms although nice could do with a lick of paint. Probably do better for the price.

<Content>What a disappointment! This once stylish hotel is now looking tatty and dated and desperately in need of a lick of paint and some new furnishings. Initially they couldn't find our booking and the restaurant - Salt and the bar - Fix were both closed for renovations. Perhaps we could have been told this upon booking?!?! The location is central but is that enough?

<Content>ideal for a basic getaway As long as you don't expect 5 star standard, this hotel will satisfy. Excellent sound-proofing on windows and quiet accomodation in a noisy area.It doesn't have all the extra facilities of the upmarket hotels (ie: no room service over xmas - new year!!?), and no restaurant in service for now. It does offer excellent value, and sometimes professional service. Make the most of the surrounding cafes etc.

<Content>Amazing boutique hotel This small hotel is one of the best deals going around. The staff was helpful and it is perfectly located for food, night life, drink and tourist activities. Definately has a young vibe. I dropped my bags off before check in and went walking around the city, when I returned 5 hours later they have my bags already in my room with great down tempo music playing when I walked in. I would highly recommend this hotel. It's clean, inexpensive, centrally located, all with a great staff.

<Content>Great Value Lets just put things into perspective. You get what you pay for. Having visited Sydney more times than I can count and stayed in all manner of hotels with varied star ratings, I can honestly say I liked the Kirketon very much.I had a Standard Room and yes it was small but stylish nonethless. The bathroom was particularly interesting with creative lighting. Having a cd player, video and walk in wardrobe was also nice. Lobby is small and the bar and restaurant are currently closed which is no bother cause you are in Sydney's best dining precinct. Staff were fantastic. Friendly and well informed. For what they are charging you cannot beat it.

<Content>Friendly service in the middle of the city Care and consideration of guests above and beyong the call of duty in the heart of Sydney. Imaginative friendly staff that can think outside the square. Well done Kirketon!

<Content>stay elsewhere Cheap furnishings, bad neighborhood, all form with no substance. Because I rely heavily on these ratings for my hotel choices, I'm following up on this one. No axe to grind. No great expectations. I would rather stay at a YMCA.

<Content>We loved the Kirketon... it was fantastic My boyfriend and I stayed there for a long weekend at the end of April. We actually had an excellent stay: gorgeous hotel, wonderful staff and fantastic location.We're indebted to Adrian for allowing us to check in immediately after our flight from the States (at 9 AM!), which was extremely appreciated. (Their staff even lugged our four huge bags up the stairs while we were out for breakfast, much to our surprise...) The hotel's design is very sleek and hip throughout, which we found refreshing. The location is great, within easy walking distance of lots of wonderful neighborhoods.I'm sort of baffled by some of the other reviews... Not only did we get daily maid service (and we were in a standard room), they even gave us add'l Aveda products (the mint shampoo is brilliant!) when we had mentioned how much we enjoyed them.Overall, we highly recommend it, for a hip place with great stay to stay in a cool neighborhood...

<Content>hip  A must reccommend!!!!Gorgeous intimate hotel where the staff are sublime in chararcter and always prepared to help with a smile.My husband and I stayed for three nights and on each night we asked to upgrade however the hotel is apparantly always full so be prepared and the book the room type you want early.The hotel's rates are very reasonable which is why we booked and I assume why the hotel would be in such high demand.
