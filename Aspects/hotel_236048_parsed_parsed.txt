<Content>Will Stay Here Next Time Close to a tram stop. Walkable distance to the Van Gogh Museum. Clean, comfortable rooms. Beautiful decorations. Very friendly staff. Bathroom was a bit small. Thanks for making my stay in Amsterdam memorable!

<Content>Hmmm? Not a great place to stay, not good value for money either! My oppinion IT'S NOT WORTH IT! ...Booked through hoteliers.com, booked a double room, paid a lot of money to stay, got there and man at reception said we had booked a twin room instead of double. we produced paperwork confirmation of our booking, so then he tried to tell us that even though it said double it was actually a twin room. checking in time was 12, he told us to come back at 1. when we got back he showed us to a room which was obviously a single room with an extra bed squeezed into it as the bathroom door couldn't properly open or close. and there wa only a single beadstead atached to the wall. the kettle was fixed to the wall directly above the bed which was not really safe and was proven later that evening when my girlfriend burnt her arm on the steam off the kettle getting into bed throught the tight bathroom door. i also in the struggle to get in the bathroom scraged my leg quite badly. next morning i had to again complain and ask for a refund to go elsewhere, they eventually moved us to a propper double room. my advice is if going here do NOT pay in advance, they will try and rip you off. i paid æ‹¢265euro's for two nights of inconvenience. if you want this book a hostel instead and save yourself the money and inconvenience of coming here.

<Content>Not a bad stay in Amsterdam. Altas hotel has a great location. A quiet part of of the city next to the Vondelpark and easy access to the city centre and attractions. A tram stop is very near by which makes it easy to get around the city. The hotel staff was very pleasant and were more than willing to help. The hotel is lovely and the room was nice and tidy but i did find that the bathroom was a bit outdated, cold and dimmly lit. Our room wasn't a huge room but it suited the two of us fine. We've paid less for better rooms in the pass but we did visit Amsterdam during a long weekend and the location was worth it.

<Content>Comfortable little hotel with great staff and location We spent 3 nights at the Atlas and didn't experience any problems at the hotel. The staff was very helpful, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go (we enjoy walking), and it was close to the trolly line if we decided not to walk. Our room was near the kitchen so it was a little loud in the mornings, but we took earplugs and were able to sleep through it. We would stay here again.

<Content>Good choice, a bit off the beaten path, and a bit of charm I spent 2 nights at the Atlas. It is a very solid 3 star hotel. The Atlas is not pretentious. It is quiet and personal. What the Atlas especially has going for it is the place itself and the location. It is a lovely converted mansion, I think, and it is literally a few meters walk from Vondelpark. Kind of a wow location in a very upscale residential neighborhood with charming early 20th century homes and apartment buildings around it. My room was top floor, in the front, so under a gabled roof, probably the former attic, so I had a bit of a view of the street. There are rooms down to the basement. My room was small, but that's Amsterdam for you. I have been to that city several times and smaller rooms are usually the case. It had a tight but complete bathroom with lots of hot water. The colors in the room tended to orange, but that's not a big deal. The room felt homey and it had a flat screen TV. The bed was supremely comfortable. I didn't try the breakfast, because there was a nice cafe-bar a minute away.I found the staff very helpful when I asked for transportation information. The girl on the desk pulled out maps, found schedules on the internet, and so forth. Quite a nice surprise.You think the Atlas is out of the way, but it is 50 meters from the #2 tram stop which takes you right into the center of Amsterdam in under 10 minutes, and it is no more than a 10 minute walk to the Van Gogh Museum (and another few to the Rijksmuseum. The only drawback in location is that trams stop around midnight so you need a taxi to get back late in the night. And the night rates start at a ridiculously high 7.50 euros.

<Content>Great location near park, museums, great room and value After leaving a subpar hotel for my needs I happened across the Atlas, whereupon the wonderful Dennis took great care of me. I was thrilled to get a nice room with a double bed, flat screen tv and internet in the room (a keyboard, 8 euros/day)! Quiet, great location just off the Vondelpark, which I love waking and walking in each morning and evening. Thanks Dennis and team!

<Content>Great little hotel The atlas is agreat hotel ina lovely Area of Amsterdam. Location is amazing, close enough but still in a lovely neighbourhood. Easily reached to the Central Sation by tram and for the slighlty more keen by walking only about 15 minutes away and only 5 minutes by foot from the Leidseplan. 2 minutes from the van Gogh museum and the amazing shopping street rivalling New Bond street for top designers. The hotel itself is very quaint. Great staff, rooms are small but perfectly adequate and clean and comfortable. Great breakfast. Really cannot beat it.

<Content>Quaint. Excellent Location. Would return. I too booked the Atlas Hotel after reading reviews on this invaluable website. We booked 2 double rooms from 8th - 10th December. Emailed the hotel in advance for directions from airport and received a prompt, informative response. Location is excellent. 10 minutes from Central Station by tram (no. 2) which stops literally less than 1 minute from the hotel. The hotel itself is quirky and quaint as I think has already been mentioned on this site. The lady on reception was lovely, she was only new but very nice and gave us maps and list of sights to see. The rooms themselves were spotless although extremely small, particularly the bathroom. A painting was clearly hanging off the wall in the bedroom, a very simple thing that could easily be sorted. Also the bathroom door didn't close properly. OK, so maybe I'm nit picking a little but 130Euro per night for a double room EXCLUDING breakfast is a bit steep for what we got. I know Amsterdam is a very populour destination but this is not city centre location and is only a 3* (if even that). In saying that, the Atlas Hotel really has something special, although I can't quite figure out what it is. I would definitely return again.Oh, beware of a 'tourist tax' whatever that is. éˆ§?.50 per person on our hotel bill all tourists have to pay apparently? Anyway, I didn't argue, I was too 'relaxed' to care :)

<Content>Lovely Hotel I came to Amsterdam for a nice city break with my boyfriend. Having read other reviews i booked Atlas. On our arrival we were greated by a very helpful member of staff. Our room was big enough for the 2 of us, not huge but not small. The bathroom was very clean and had shampoo etc ready in waiting. The shower is great, lots of hot water and very powerful. Locations is great, its away from all the hustle and bustle but very easily assessable. Its is right near the Von Gogh Museum and Vondel Park. You can get trams 2 and 5 to the Van Gogh Museum and get off and walk, but the number 2 drops you right off outside the hotel, all you need to do is get off 1 stop after the Van Gogh Museum and its right across from the stop.

<Content>Idea for a book We went to the Atlas as friends had booked in and like us were running in the Amsterdam Marathon/Half Marathon. We decided that we would write a book 'Quirky hotels we have stayed in' and start with this one. Hotel was ok, decor was a bit purple and more than a little like being trapped in a Mark Rothko canvas - a bit claustrophobic after a while. Hot water in the bathroom was VERY hot so be warned. Also having lugged my hairdryer all the way there, as the website said there was only one available at reception, I discovered one in the bathroom. Ho - hum.Also the owner's dog lives there, reasonably enough, but this combined with smoking was not entirely pleasant from my point of view. Smoking in confined spaces has only been prohibited in Britain since July 2007 - how quickly we adjust and become intolerant! At least I have.Upside is that the hotel is really handy for the trams (trusty old Number 2 tram will take you to Centraal Station and all points in between), some nice bars and restaurants. Don't miss the Cafe Luxembourg on Spui. Darlings, it is the only place to see and be seen, it has a non - smoking conservatory where the beautiful people sit. They always made me sit in the back - were they trying to tell me something?!Also any trip to Amsterdam would not be complete without a trip to the Rijksmuseum (2 stops on the Number 2) sadly still half closed for refurbishment and the Anne Frank Huis. This latter is a bargain at only E7.50, approx æ‹¢5, ish, sorry there is no translation for those of you who work in $.Go out of the hotel, turn left and you will be in the Vondelpark in less than a minute. Feed the ducks, go for a run or just sit in one of the coffee shops and watch everyone else exercise!

<Content>Quaint, quiet The Atlas has a lot going for it. It is very Ducth and in a great location. The tram runs from almost in front of the hotel and it is within walking distance of many of the sights. The back yard of the hotel is literally Volenpark. It is a beautiful park for walking and just kicking back. The only complaint that we had was they cordially invited us to have breakfast without telling us it was nine euros for each person. It was a great breakfast but not worth nine euros....

<Content>The Atlas was great! After reading many reviews of Amsterdam hotels, we stayed at the Atlas in June, 2007 just before a cruise to Norway. This is in a three story early 1900's building which has a quaint curving staircase as well as a small elevator.While our room was small (slanted roof over the double bed), it was very adequate for our stay, and we did have a flat screen TV. The location was very convenient to the trams and the museums. The staff were very friendly and very helpful (for example, found a taxi to the dock and negotiated the price.) I thought this was a very good value, especially compared to prices at some of the other hotels.This is in a residential district, and the hotel was quiet. Vondel Park is nearby, it is huge and is a nice place during the day, but there was a young man who was probably on drugs who went around intimidating tourists (including us), so I would not go there in the evening. (You don't have to go there to get other places.)

<Content>Loved this place Just stayed there for five nights in late September. Wonderfully quiet and in a residential neighborhood near museums andConcertgebouw. Tram to Central Station to catch trainto airport is less than one-half block away.Was quiet enough to sleep with a window open and a fan running for white noise.Room was small, but nicely decorated. Great flat screen TV, immaculate bathroom with tons of really hot water. Breakfast was great as well. At 9 Euros it's a deal. Staff was unfailingly helpful and polite.-Washington, D.C. visitor

<Content>Great location Stayed here for 4 nights in June '06. The room was an ok size but the bathroom was quite small. The bed was right below a sloping roof so banged my head a few times when sitting up. The room had a flatscreen tv in it. The hotel was in a great location , near the park although when we were there the entrrace closest to the hotel was blocked off for building purposes. the tram stop was right opposit the hotel which was excellent. The breakfast room was very small and cramped. We went for breakfast 1 morning - what a wrong decision - do not go for breakfast!! There was nothing there to eat!! What a waste of money, we basically had a cup of tea then had to go and get something elsewhere.The staff were friendly and the small lounge area was quite comfortable in front of the check in desk. Dont think i would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>VEry dutch Visited Amsterdam for 6 nights in May. Atlas was ideal for us (two couples). The trams are frequent and only one block away, but you can easily walk to most museum sights if you prefer. It was a pleasure to be in the quiet neighbor after a sigtseeing day. Plenty of local restaurants and pubs in easy walking. Property backs up to the huge city park as well. Rooms are smaller than in the US, but this is Europe you know. 24 hour desk/concierge were very helpful. Beds were comfortable and breakfast was good. Nice gated garden for an afternoon drink. Gives a good flavor of the locals. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great neighborhood and v convenient I stayed at Atlas Hotel during my stay at Amsterdam fr April 5 to April 9. Love the location and the peace and quiet. V easy to get around because Tram 2 is 1 min outside the hotel and the Van Gogh and Rijkmuseum are just 1/2 tram stops away. The rooms are small but v well equipped with a flat panel TV and high speed internet. The only problem we had was that the elevator did not work and stairs are pretty steep so it's quite tough to get down the stairs. The staff are all very friendly and efficient. Will stay there again if I visit Amsterdam

<Content>Good location but... I have just returned from a three-day visit to Amsterdam for the purpose of visiting the Van Gogh Museum and the Rijksmuseum. The Atlas Hotel is ideally located for visiting these great art institutions as well as the Concertgebouw. It is also a minute walk from a tram stop, so you can easily get to Leidseplein, Dam, Central Station, etc. However, I had some reservations about the hotel itself. First, this is one of the few hotels I have ever stayed in where a hair dryer is not available. When I was having a shower, the water would suddenly turn ice cold. The bath room, though clean, had a faintly unpleasant smell. The coffee at breakfast was lukewarm. All relatively small things maybe, but it is those small things that make your stay at a hotel pleasant or not.

<Content>Nice hotel in a wonderful neighborhood The Atlas is a small hotel just 50 meters from both the Vondelpark and from a tramline, so it is perfect as a base for an Amsterdam visit. Far enough away from the noisy all-night parties that you can get some sleep, but close enough that you can walk for 5 minutes and get whatever you want (or get on a tram and be in the center in 15 minutes). I stayed in Rm 313, at the top, overlooking the street. A very small room (I had reserved a deluxe room, but my guess is that didn't change what room I got) with two single beds and a small desk and TV, phone. Not luxurious, but for about 125 Euro not a bad deal in a capital city. The staff was friendly and helpful and everything was clean and tidy. My only issues were with the wireless Internet (didn't work, and really a trivial problem) and, much more importantly, no air conditioning. My room was at the top and during a few days of heat it was just unpleasantly warm. I would recommend this hotel for a budget-oriented traveler who wants a very good location and a problem-free stay, but not during the hottest of summer months. Otherwise, I would definitely go back.

<Content>Very pleasantly surprised, highly recommend this one! This hotel was a real treat. The desk staff was very friendly- the receptionist actually took us up to our room to settle us in. The presence of an elevator, although only large enough for 3 people max, was a real bonus in a city where it's uncommon to come across an elevator. We had a triple room and the beds were very. very comfortable. The room was clean and cozy with a lovely view. This hotel is a bit of a distance from the city center, but a tram runs right past the hotel and we did in fact walk from the city center on two occasions. This hotel had a real charming atmosphere and I look forward to staying with Atlas Hotel during my next visit to Amsterdam.

<Content>Got what I paid for Being my first time in Amsterdam, I insisted in staying at a hotel that is not a large chain to get a feel for the city. The hotel location is good, near the tram and Vondelpark, and museums. Since Amsterdam is easy accessible via tram, the hotel location is just fine.The rooms are very small, and you can hear everything that goes on in the hotel because of the thin walls. The hotel is also inexpensive, so I guess that I got what I paid for. The breakfast is completely Dutch - breads with cheese and meat, so be prepared if you aren't used to it. Next time in Amsterdam, I will choose a different hotel because the Atlas is nothing special, just decent.

<Content>Pleasant and Quiet I've been staying at the Atlas for several years during visits to the RAI exhibition each year. I've found it quiet and clean with pleasant staff. Advance booking is harder during exhibitions as the parent compamy AMS sells of the rooms in advance to the RAI Hotel booking service. I can walk to the RAI from here or in to town, about 25 minutes either direction.

<Content>Would not stay there again I chose the Atlas because it was inexpensive and located outside of the main tourist area. When I had stayed at the Krasnapolsky I was kept awake by noise from the street and I didn't want that to happen again. The streets around the Atlas are indeed very quiet at night. However, since the walls and doors are paper-thin it doesn't matter. We heard every move the other guests made, the plumbing, etc. Thank goodness I had earplugs with me (and even then, I could hear doors slamming). Perhaps the rooms upstairs are better.Our double was quite small, the beds too hard, the pillows too big and it smelled of mold and mildew. I actually had an allergic reaction to the mold. There were also two spiders in the room when we arrived. However, the bathroom was very clean and there was plenty of hot water.The breakfast was large and tasty. Unfortunately, the staff sat right outside the little breakfast room, smoking and speaking (yelling, actually) so loudly that I should have brought my earplugs with me there as well.They also messed up on our bill.So, despite the pleasant but noisy staff and reasonable price, no I would not stay there again.

<Content>Welcoming and Warm I stayed at the atlas during the Christmas Holidays. I chose the Atlas for it's location which is a couple blocks from the museums and close to everywhere by tram. The staff was courteous and capable and each day of my stay I felt more and more like staying there forever.They'll bring you a tosti wheneveryou need one.My room was a good size and the bed was comfortable. I'd defintely stay there again.

<Content>Wonderful Ambience Located on Vondel Park near the museum plein is the lovely Atlas Hotel. Having spent a number of vacations in Amsterdam, with some stays as long as a month at a time I finally found the perfect hotel for both my wife and myself. The Atlas is clean, comfortable, and very freindly. The structure itself is charming, quiet, and well located. Above all the staff is first rate and adds just the right ambience to the Amsterdam vacation. I highly recommend the Atlas Hotel.
