<Content>duomo at your doorstep. My second time staying at this hotel, we paid 450 euro for 5 nights two adults and a child so i consider that i got value for money. The hotel may be considered more a three star plus so do not go with a four star expectation. Regarding the drain like smell i do not think it as bad as expressed in previous reviews. I stayed in the hotel in november so it may be more unpleasant in the summer months, however keep in mind that florence does suffer from sewage odour. Breakfast is pretty basic but quiet satisfaying for hotels in italy maybe slightly basic for a four star. Location is great, close to all sights and the amazing duomo is just down the street.Staff were helpful and always gave good advice and helpful information.

<Content>Great Location - Very Happy with Everything! I recently stayed at Hotel Fenice Palace while in Florence and found it to be Excellent! The room was clean and modern, I had a window that opened (not common in Australia), large comfortable bed, flat screen TV with cable. The Hotel Staff were polite and helpful, and it was in an excellent location close to the Duomo and other attractions. I booked through a discount hotel website and got a great price on this hotel. The only downside would be that breakfast was not included. I would definately recommend this hotel, and would stay again if in Florence.

<Content>Needs some work 6 of us stayed at the Fenice Palace June 17-19. We booked this hotel due to it's great location and on that note we were not dissapointed. Very close to the Duomo and the Ponte Vecchio but Florence is a great walking city anyway.I must say the street noise in our second floor rooms made sleep almost impossible and the air conditioning was weak and noisy, not acceptable for the prices we paid. Bathroom in our room (209 I think) was very basic with a miserable shower and hardly enough room to turn around. I know it's Europe but a shower stall would be much better than a flimsy curtain that sticks to you and allows water to drench the floor every time you bathe.Staff was generally pleasant and tolerant of my weak attempts at Italian. Check in and check out were painless and efficient. I just wish our complaints about the AC had at least been met with empathy.I think there are probably better hotels available but as this was our first trip to Italia I have no idea where they are. We will travel here again because it is a wonderful city. We will stay elsewhere however.Ciao!

<Content>Liked the location, thats about all! We stayed here for a week in June. The location of the hotel is excellent,being central and is within easy walking distance of most of the major attractions. We found the staff helpful and the service prompt. The room was cleaned daily, the linen and towels clean and of a good standard.   Problems, there were several, 1. The room was noisy - due to the hotels location, it is an Italian city.2. The air-conditioning was obtrusive, especially at night.3. The hotel corridors occasionally smelled of drains,although this was far from uncommon in Florence. 4. The bedroom needed repainting and the plastering repaired.5. The en-suite bathroom was small, some of the fittings were cracked and the toilet seat did not fit the pan.6. The shower rose had 2 positions, waist level and out of reach!7. Breakfast food was not up to 4* standard, we have had much better food and choice in 2* accommodation.8. The coffee machine in the breakfast room confused everyone, no matter what nationality, and was certainly not up to Italian coffee standards as far as taste was concerned.9. Generally, the hotel was some what faded and in need of redecoration. Would we stay there again? Probably - but only because of the location and it would need to be considerably cheaper, we booked through Thomsons, other agents may of course have lower rates.

<Content>Location is not everything Shocked at the 'not caring attitude' of the staff and management. During our stay it got quite warn and needed to put the aircondition on BUT it was not yet June so the A/C doesn't work!! It seems that the rates one pays in May do not include aircondition!! Great location but inside all sucks.

<Content>BeE Warned - Don't Let The Location Override The Condition I am shocked that this hotel carries a 4 star rating!!! This rating has made me question the formula used for all Italian hotels in general. To call it a cesspit is being kind !!! The carpets are badly stained, dirty and threadbare. The rooms are dark, dingy and the toilet seats don't even fit the pan !!! The list is endless. Worse still is the dank dirty smell in the corridors.I realise that this is an ancient city but there is no excuse for blatant misrepresentation. It is an insult and a con to expect guests to stay in what they are lead to believe is a 4 **** hotel. One of rooms used by my party had a huge gaping hole in the wall by the bed with electrical wires exposed!! Unbelieveable !! Adding insult to injury the ceiling was also leaking !!!The staff seemed unfazed by other guests complaints giving the distinct impression that they had heard it all before and there was no motivation to correct problems as guests would be staying there for short periods only.The whole place is shabby, grubby, dingy and tacky. Avoid it if you can. If you can't because it is already included in your itinerary, ask your travel agent to be moved to a different hotel.

<Content>Right in the middle of things The Duomo is virtually the centre of Florence and the hotel is only a few metres away from it so you never get lost getting back, just follow the signs for the Duomo! The hotel may not be in the first flush of youth but it was very clean, the bed was comfortable and the staff were both friendly and helpful, giving worthwhile advice on eating out and prebooking museums etc. Our room was on the first floor and was spacious with a comfortable bed(extra pillows supplied within minutes) and a good size bathroom. There was a safe, a minibar and fully functioning flat screen tv. Because of the central location there is a bit of noise during the night even with the windows closed (it is air conditioned) but that comes with the location. The hotel catering is basically breakfast only but you can get a coffee or a drink in the evening at the little bar. During the day there are plenty of places nearby to snack or drink. If you are fit and don't have too much baggage you can walk to the Central station, you don't need a taxi but it is about 7 euros if you do.

<Author>anlaby1976
<Content>Well located, not as bad as other reviews make out My friend and I booked a trip to Florence and wished to stay in a centrally located hotel. The one we were booked into was the Fenice Palace. Having read some of the reviews we were very concerned that the hotel may not be too nice. However, we were pleasantly surprised. It is extremely convenient for all the sights and only about 7 or 8 minutes walk from the SMN train station. On arrival a very apologetic receptionist advised that the lift was being dismantled as someone had dropped something which had rolled through the small gap near the doors. However, she instructed the porter to carry our suitcases up to our room, which was unfortunately on the fourth floor. We made it up the stairs without too much difficulty, although we were somewhat out of breath being two middle aged ladies. It was worth it though, our room overlooked the entrance to the San Lorenz market and the view was very pleasant. The room was perfectly acceptable and the bathroom was clean and tidy. Yes, if we had wanted a bath we would have had a wait as the tap was rather slow, but getting a hot shower was not a problem. A big plus was that the hairdryer, unlike in many hotels, was quite powerful and fitted the bill. We did not purchase anything from the minibar, but noted that the prices were also quite reasonable if we had have wanted to. By the time we had unpacked.showered and changed the lift was working again, but we managed to walk downstairs. The carpet was somewhat shabby, but there was no damp smell or anything like that. We had a good night's sleep, but the location of the hotel does mean it is a little noisy and light sleepers may have difficulties. We were shattered so slept the sleep of the dead anyway. Breakfast was served in the basement restaurant, which was a little warm, but the food was fine. There was a good choice of items and no one would need to leave feeling hungry. We found all of the staff very helpful and nothing was a problem, if you needed something a polite request was all that was required. I would have no problem recommending this hotel to friends and colleagues, I am not sure what the rate is, as we booked a package, but our total weekend, using a budget airline, cost 拢250 each, from Leeds Bradford Airport in Yorkshire, UK. We found the rail fare from the airport, via Pisa Centrale, to Florence was much less expensive than in the UK and, also, eating out was very reasonable. Museum fees were not extortionate and all in all we had an extremely enjoyable time. The only thing we would do differently, having the experience of hindsight, would be to split our stay between Florence and Pisa, as we took the train to Pisa and back one day during our stay, whereas if we had made Pisa a separate overnight stay, we would have saved a couple of hours sitting on a train.

<Content>DO NOT STAY HERE (POSSIBLE FOOD POISINING) When we left our shabby, smelly hotel room to go for breakfast, we found flies in the rotten fruit bowl at the buffet table, which can carry food poisining bacteria, warm yogurt which contain bacteria unless chilled, and awful grey and brown scrambled egg. The thing that got us, is that this hotel claims to have four stars. The flooors were filthy, carpets worn and tired, and the walls were stained and badly needed a coat of paint. We will never be back.

<Content>Yuck We had the misfortune to stay at this hotel for one night during our visit to Florence. We knew we were in for a rough night's stay when the staff on the front desk were so unfriendly. Some of the key highlights were as follows:- Stained carpets throughout the hotel- Towels and bed linen that stank of vinegar (even when fresh ones requested)- View from our room window was a brick wall about 2m away making the room very dark, dingy and claustrophobic- Very noisy room, could hear every move made and word spoken by our neighbours, and our air conditioning sounded like a tractor- Fridge didn't work- Paint peeling off the ceiling, damaged mirror and generally very aged and unattractive decor throughout the roomWould we stay here again? Clearly not and certainly would not recommend it to anyone else, despite of it's convenient location which is about all it has going for it.

<Content>Dirty Smelly Hotel This hotel should be avoided if at all possible. We only stayed in it, as we had to leave an even worse one, the Old Florence Inn, which is also a complete fraud. The Tourist office gave us the impression that this was the only hotel available as there was a massive conference in town.The first room we saw stank of cigaretter smoke and the bathroom was dirty with even the looking glass showing its age. The second room we settled for, had wallpaper peeling off everywhere and the holes in the ceiling were filled with tissue paper!!! The corridors stank and the elevators had broken down. The only good thing about the hotel was one friendly check in clerk and a decent breakfast. What is the amazing about this terrible hotel is that it is in a fantastic location in a world famous place. What are the owners thinking they are doing letting a valuable asset like this going to rot? I would love to see the owners respond to this comment.

<Content>Great Hotel, Fantastic Concierge What a way to experience Florence for the very first time.We traveled SF to Paris, Paris to Rome, then transferred to the trainstation and took the train to Florence. Arrived early evening into Florence, and a short walk from the train station to the hotel.Suffice it to say, we were tired and hungry. Concierge was able to recommend a restaurant that was a short walk from the hotel, which was more that appreciated after spending eighteen hours seated. Restaurant was fantastic, home cooked Tuscan fare. Ended up eating most evenings at this restaurant.Nothing compares to waking up the first morning, opening the shutters to a clear blue crisp spring morning, looking left and seeing the Baptistry down the street, and looking right and seeing the Medici palace.Was able to walk to everything, no need for taxi鈥檚 in this town. After speaking with the concierge about what places we wanted to see, they also gave recommendations on sights not in the guidebooks and they were able to make reservations for the Uffizi and other sites for us. Saved us a lot of time not in lines.Overall, a very pleasant experience and looking forward to staying with them again March 2008.

<Content>No way 4 star and smelt of drains This hotel is the worst we have ever stayed in in years of travelling. It stank in the hall areas. The room was shabby and far too hot. On complaining of the heat we were told to leave the door open as the air conditioning would not be operational until June 1st. The breakfast was a disgrace. We felt sorry for most of the staff who tried their best in impossible circumstances. This hotel woud not rate a star at all were it not for the location which is certainly central, as evidenced by the traffic fumes and noise constantly passing by. Stay away at all costs!!

<Content>New Year's Crackers! The +: - Central location. Certainly the best spot to visit most of major city's attractions, close enough to train and bus station, really nice to walk around.- Nice staff, nice breafast (standard criterias), quiet hotel... The -:- A bit rusty around the edge, paper walls, paintings, faded colors in the rooms, our warm water in the shower was very weak... A FOUR Star Hotel should have higher standards.- Noisy! Of course, we stayed around New Year's Eve, so no big deal, but try and avoid the rooms close to the main street, or the one on the left of the hotel, it's really not quiet.Overall: you get a nice place to stay, not too expensive if booked in advance, but it's no palace, and not for the light sleepers...Anyways, Florence is to be seen over and over...

<Content>Quite one of the worst hotels in Florence Smelt dirty on entering and was in fact filthy throughout the corridors and our bedroom was quite unacceptably dirty. Worn carpets, dirty curtains and bedspreads. The bathroom was extremely tired-looking with cracked tiles and damaged tile grouting round the bath. The whole place wants a complete make-over. To cap it all the over- cooked part of the breakfast was inedible. Definitely not 4 star - probably a poor 1star if any.

<Content>Great value and free breakfast Booked on Venere in 2002. Venere is a great website for booking European hotels because the prices are quoted in Euros or the respective currency and after the exchange rate, it costs much less than Expedia or any American websites.Fantastic location - I can't stress this enough. It is 2 blocks away from the Duomo which is the center of town. Good restaurants nearby and very alive. Free continental breakfast was good enough for me and lasted me until 3:00 pm. The central location made it very easy to go to the hotel to use the restroom after sightseeing or just unpacking souvenirs. Clean enough room and slightly larger than your average European hotel. Small by American standards of course. (God bless America!)The problems are that the street noise is very loud and do keep you up a bit. Other than that, the lighting is good and the bathroom is clean. Great value.

<Content>Smelled like baby diapers This place smelled like used baby diapers as soon as you entered the lobby and didn't improve as you were in the hallways or in the rooms.  The first room we were in, was supposed to be air-conditioned, but was hot. They put us in a different room, but it wasn't much better. The lobby staff were unhelpful, and unpleasant, especially the young female concierge.

<Content>Good room, Great Location! From some of the reviews I have read, I cannot believe I stayed at the same hotel as the writers! A friend and I stayed at the Fenice Palace for two nights early in May. This was not our first choice of hotel, but we would definitely book the Fenice Palace again and have recommended it to friends. Despite our early arrival that day we were able to check in promptly. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. Our room was clean and quite satisfactory. A double room, it contained two double beds, the only Italian hotel we stayed in with this feature! The bathroom was clean, large enough and had a bath as well as shower. We overlooked Via Martelli, so it was slightly noisy, but not a problem. It was fabulous to look left from our balcony and see the battistero!

I have recommened them to numerous friends who were equally satisfied.The rooms adequate if not huge, but then who stays in their room in the beautiful city of Florence ?!!

<Content>How did this dump get four stars? This hotel represented the low point of our entire trip. We stayed at four-star hotels all over Italy, and they were either good or very good. This place was absolutely horrible! The rickety elevator took us to our smelly hallway. The carpeting was filthy and disgusting, and our room was dark, musty, and depressing. The bed felt like a wooden plank, and the bathroom almost defies description. It was long and narrow, so that you almost had to walk sideways from the toilet to the sink and tub. The shower was ridiculous - located on the long wall over the tub instead of the end wall, and the water actually went right through the shower curtain onto the bathroom floor. Even the public computer in the lobby was gross, as the keyboard was dirty and greasy. We could not wait to get out of there and continue to be baffled by the four-star rating. Do not stay there!!

<Content>Great value for money We stayed 6 nights early Sept and were very pleased with our accomodation for the price we paid, the location couldn't be beaten. We took a taxi from the train station it only cost Eur 8. Staff at reception were friendly. Just a couple of mins walk to Duomo. Double glazed windows kept out any street noise. A supermarket is just a 5min walk away. Breakfast was very good overall, compared to other hotels on our trip. We had no problems and I would recommend this hotel since it has now been refurbished.

<Content>Rough Accomidations in a Fabulous Location! We got home from Italy less than 12 hours ago, and I feel the need to report back on this hotel first. We'll start with the good... 1. LOCATION couldn't have been better. We were a block from the Doumo, the Accademia, great shopping, and three short blocks from the Train Terminal, where many of the day tours started/ended. At night, head toward the Uffizi (abuot 3-4 blocks past the Duomo) and there is non-stop street entertainers, musicians, tourists...very cool stuff! There is a tourist information center across the street (and to the left of the main entrance, facing the street). The neighborhood is ridiculously beautiful and fun, especially for a first time Florence visitor. 2. CONSIERGE was nice, for the most part (pardon one man dropping the F bomb in front of our party just once). Spoke english, and were helpful with most of our requirements (see #3 in Bad)3. BREAKFAST, although not 4-star, was still quite good. Get there early if there are tour groups in the hotel, as it filled up quickly. We aimed anytime before 8, and had no problems.Now the bad (this starts as soon as you get to your floor). 1. HALLS smell dirty (sometimes like the sewage system) and are usually FILLED with laundry carts, vacuums, the maids' cart (seemed to be there the whole time...even at night).2. BEWARE OF THE EMERGENCY EXITS! We stayed on the second floor and accidentally tried to get downstairs using the emergency exit stairs...they were blocked with mattresses, carts, garbage, etc! Please hope there is truly no emergency there!3. OUR ROOM (119) was dark, smelled strongly of urine (which we complained about to the consierge and it never got taken care of), the decor had not been updated since the early 70s (it seemed). The bathroom was dirty (esp. the floor), our box of tissues was never replaced when empty (when we got there). The linens' cleanliness was questionable (go back to urine smell). I really felt uncomfortable staying in our room.OVERALL, this hotel is hit-or-miss. Our companions' room (117) was much brighter, didn't smell like urine, and seemed to have been cleaned much better than ours! I wouldn't go back, but I'd still look for a hotel in this neighborhood!

<Content>Great location, hot room, rock hard bed We stayed at the Fenice Palace at the beginning of the month. On the plus side the location couldn't be better if you want to be close to the Duomo, we also found the desk to be very helpful. Unfortunetly the room was hot with poor air conditioning and the bed was hard as a rock (not a good thing).

<Content>Worst Hotel we stayed at in Italy We were in Italy this summer for 2 weeks and basically started in Lake Como and ended in Amalfi. We stayed at 8 different hotels while there and all had a 4 star rating. Most of the hotels were okay, but the Fenice Palace was terrible. I was so glad that we only stayed there for one night. The rooms are smelly, dark, old, moldy. The beds are small and the comforters are disgusting. The showers aren't great either. The water would go all over the floor everytime we took a shower. The rest of the hotel is not much to get excited about either. Everything looks worn and in need of major repair/renovation. Definitely do not stay here if you are driving in Italy. We had the hardest time getting to it, because it is so close to the Duomo. We had to valet park which was not only pricey but inconvenient. The morning we left we ended up waiting 45 min for our car. I don't think I have ever stayed at a hotel this bad before. Maybe a motel, but not a hotel and definitely not one with a 4 star rating. If I ever go back to Florence, I would stay on the outskirts of the city. The city is small enough that it is easy to get to the tourist area. I can't believe anyone gave this hotel a good rating.

<Content>No palace here The Fenice Palace Hotel is located only a few minutes walk from the famous Duomo and so is the ideal place from which to conduct expenditions into Florence. However, we entirely agree with other previous guests who were disappointed with the standard of the hotel. Our room was acceptable (clean and airconditioned) , but certaintly not 4 star standard. Although we liked the staff, we are particularly disgusted with the standard of the breakfast service. One morning, we hate to wait for a table to become available, and then could get no service. Everything in the buffet gives the impression of having been done on the cheap: bad cornflakes, watered down juice, stale rolls, poor coffee. All of this must be improved in order to avoid a complete boycott by international guests.

<Content>Convenient and Comfortable The hotel is extremely convenient and within 100 yards of the Duomo and street market. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms, we had two, were large by European standards and despite a dated interior the rooms were comfortable and very functional. The bathrooms were all large, had hairdryers and electrical outlets that accepted 110V. The double rooms had two twin sized beds. The breakfast was excellent with great service.

<Content>Quaint I was disappointed after reading the other reviews. I stumbled in to this hotel after the first hotel we planned to stay at was closed. So here I was I was traveling with two year old twins and a nanny on Christmas Eve and no place to stay! The staff was more than accommodating and helpful. I loved the old style hotel to begin with, I guess if you want modern this hotel isn't for you. I felt at home and relaxed there. The rooms that we stayed in were fine. I loved the fact that they had bathtubs!! A rarity in Italy. We moved to a larger apartment on the second day which provided a separate sleeping room for our nanny. The only complaint I had was that the apartment, being up on the top floor, would get a little warm at night. No problems with the elevators while we were there, I thought the braiding was a novel idea, I liked it. Breakfast and bar were fine. My children loved the staff and cried when we had to leave. Location of the hotel was great, walking distance to most of the attractions that we wanted to see, restaurants that were close and shopping markets all around us. LOVED IT.

<Content>Better give this one a miss DO NOT STAY HERE! We booked this '4 star' Hotel for a single night stay in Florence. I would rate it as a 2 star hotel - I don't know who they paid to get the 4 star rating, but I wouldn't trust it. The food was awful, the staff indifferent. The bedroom was the sort that had you wondering whether they charged by the hour. The only thing going for the hotel is its central location, which turned out to be a drawback as the locals seemd to be racing their scooters around the hotel all night.

<Content>Four star? We stayed at the four star Fenice Palace in March 2003 and were absolutely baffled as to how this place managed to achieve a four star rating.Rooms and bathrooms were really unattractive. The brochure said that the place had undergone refurbishment recently but our room looked as though it hadn't been touched since the 70s. Every panel of wallpaper was peeling. Bathroom was cramped (v. little room between the basin and the toilet, which made for interesting experiences). And despite the fact that cleaning staff visited our room on a daily basis - evidenced by the fact that the beds were made - there was something on the floor (which we never did manage to identify but it looked sort of like food) from the day we arrived to the day we left (6 nights). Completely agree with the other reviewer's assessment of the lifts - unbelievable. Not to mention the fact that we were almost squashed countless times by the doors. The only thing that vaguely went a small way towards saving this place was the fact that the staff seemed quite friendly, but that was it. Overall the hotel was very disappointing and we would not stay there again.

<Content>A great disappointment I was very disappointed with our stay at what was supposed to be a four star hotel. The wall paper was peeling away from the wall, the duvet smelt less than freshly laundered, the 4* twin room contained two single beds puched so close together they might as well have been one double, and there was only an inch between the wall and the front of the toilet) which meant it had to be sat on sideways). Our biggest complaint about the room though, was that it was impossible to get any sleep during the night, as the hotel backed onto a very noisy street. Breakfast was also not of a 4* standard. At most points during our night and a half stay, either one of the two lifts broke down. Glue was clearly visible inside the lift, where it had been used to tack some braiding onto what appeared to be and only slightly harder than cardboard surface (which had dents in it). We were able to notice so much about the lift, as we were trapped in it for some time, and the hotel staff were unapologetic about either the room or our bad experience with the lift. We moved to a 2* hotel, which turned out to be a lot more comfortable.
