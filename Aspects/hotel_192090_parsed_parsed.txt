<Content>Great hotel in a very nice area One would have to agree with all the other good reviews. This hotel is very nice. We had a very comfortable room on the top floor overlooking a quiet road. The setting was perfect.The hotel itself is a small walking distance to the 'Tube' and Hyde ParkThe staff were friendly and helpful and any request was promptly attended to.We will definately stay here again.

<Content>Probably my favourite hotel in London I stayed here a number of times throughout 2008.On each occasion I have been very impressed.Good things;- Nice Rooms- Excellent attentive staff who always strive to be helpful- Good flat screen TVs- Near the tube - about half way between Gloucester Road and Earls Court- Comfortable beds- Nice bathrooms- A 24-hour supermarket a few minutes walk away.A couple of downsides;- Breakfast (especially if you only have the buffet) is just okay- The street which the hotel is on can look a little downbeat at times, but you only have to walk along it for about a minuteI tended to book well in advance using the hotels website to get a good rate. The money was non-refundable but it was a good deal.

<Content>Great value for money Stayed for 5 nights at Parkcity. Location is an easy walk to tub and a supermarket is right behind the hotel, but on a quiet street of Kensington. Concierge is helpful. Although the room is on the smaller side, but nicely layout. Shower pressure and bathroom amenities are nice.

<Content>excellent hotel - loved it Lovely hotel, attentive and very helpful staff. Helped us with the luggage as courtesy, not for the tip !. Lovely room, deluxe on an autumn break deal. Breakfast fresh pastries, fruit. etc lovely relaxing breakfast - could not fault. beautiful bathroom. The service from all staff concerned was faultless.No noise or traffic noise problems at all, nice and quiet.Lovely blackout curtains, gets extra brownie points from me for that !I could go on, but really a very lovely stay.We booked more just for a place to stay, and ended up enhancing our time in London. Found this via tripadvisor reviews, so thought i should contribute back.Would recommend it highly, would look forward to using again on any future stay in london.

<Content>A little gem We stayed in a deluxe room at the Parkcity on December 12th. We booked the Winter Warmer deal which was a reduced promotional rate which included a buffet breakfast.The room was average size for a London hotel and very warm and inviting. There was Frette linen in the room and a Bose sound system. There were plenty of free channels on the tv and films available to purchase should you wish to. You could also access the internet through the tv but it was quite pricey (æ‹¢9 I think). The bathroom was lovely, it had a big bath with a monsoon shower and Molton Brown toiletries.The bed was lovely, the pillows were so soft and I had a brilliant night's sleep with next to no noise. We came back from our night out to find the bed turned down for us, chocolates on the pillows and a bottle of mineral water which was a lovely touch. The buffet breakfast was great, they brought freshly made toast to the table if you requested it and had a wide selection of foods to choose from. It would suit travellers from any country as there was something to please everybody. All in all we had an excellent stay, felt very welcome and would definitely go there again.

<Content>Lovely birthday weekend at Parkcity Just returned from a fabulous weekend in London for my birthday when we stayed at the Parkcity. It's a lovely hotel -spacious, quiet room, really comfy bed and loved the monsoon shower! Staff very friendly and efficient and the breakfast was delicious. Good location, quiet area and near to the tube - wouldn 't hesitate to recommend it and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Nice hotel with excellent service We stayed at The Park City hotel in London, Kensington for 4 nights this December. I did a lot of research before choosing this hotel since hotels in London seem to be quite expensive compared to what you get in terms of room size, breakfast included etc. Travelling in Asia we have stayed at hotels like Mandarin Oriental in Singapore and expect at lot from a hotel with comparable rates.We found this hotel to have good value for money, still it isn't a budget hotel. Our standard room cost 145 pounds/night, including english breakfast. The rooms are wellsized, clean and modern. The staff were attentive and helpful. There is no restaurant at night at the hotel, but 24 hour room-service and also lighter meals in the bar. The area has some good restaurants within 5-10 minutes walking distance ( The L restaurant has good tapas and Khans of Kensington served good indian food). The nearest subway station (we think) is Earls Court from which the Piccadilly line runs reaching the most central places of London within a couple of stops.

<Content>Parkcity - Great base We booked the Parkcity after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. We arrived on a friday afternoon approx 1 oclock . We were told that our room would be ready at 3pm.The reception explained where all the sites were that we wanted to see.He showed us on a map which we got to keep, as it was our first time in london .Then we went for a walk down to Harrods approx 20 mins from the Parkcity . When we got back ,we were able to checked into our room.The room was on the second floor and was impressive,a lot better than i expected . There was even heating and A/C controls for the room . It was finished to a high standard and looked to be done in the last couple of years . We went out to a West end show and when we came back there was a birthday cake in the room for my wife and a small card ,which i thought was a nice tuch because i never requested it . The hotel is appox 8 mins walk from Glouster road station on the picidilly/district line .We booked room only ,the cooked breakfast was æ‹¢18pp ,which i thought was a bit steep , we went to a patisery / Cafe opposite the Glouster road station and had breakfast for æ‹¢20 for the two of us . There is a small bar in the back of the hotel called Rubys bar for a quite drink or a snack.The staff were very helpful,you even got the bed covers turned down at 8pm by the maid ! When we checked out we were wanting to go to Mademe Tussauds and they kept the bags for us in a room until our flight at 6pm .This was a great base for us in london , it was my wifes first time there ,and her 30th birthday .It met all our expectations and more .We will be using it again when we return to london .

<Content>Perfect for 3 adults traveling together We were three adults (mom and two children in their 20s) traveling together, which is tough to accommodate, especially for a reasonable price. We stayed in a ParkCity executive suite (a step up from Deluxe) and had a large double bed with a roll-in twin size bed. The room was very spacious, although shaped like a train car (advantage: bathroom was at far end). The windows open and let in the fresh air and even bird songs - quiet neighborhood, good location. The decor is not exactly cozy, and the recessed ceiling lights are piercing, but there was plenty of space for 3 people and their luggage. Flat screen TV, internet access 9 pounds per day.The bath/shower was new to me - it had high sides that are not easy to climb over if you are a certain age. Hotel provides chocolate truffles when you sign in and a bottle of complementary water. Restaurant for breakfast is located downstairs - food was overpriced but OK. Behind the hotel there is a grocery store - very handy for snacks and forgotten items. Walked down the street and ate at an Indian restaurant (many establishments to choose from).

<Content>Recommended LocationWithin 25/30 mins walk or 5/10 by taxi you can get to Earls court exhibition, Albert Hall, Harrods, VA, Kensington shops, St James' palace. Cromell hospital 2 mins walk.Very quiet as it is in a residential area behind Cromwell road, we could sleep with the window open which is very unusual for a city.5/8 mins to nearest tube.Supermarket (24hrs) with a Starbucks 2 mins walk. The few restaurants nearby did not look too inviting, we did not try any apart from the coffee shop.InsideAn old building that has been converted to a modern pale wood decor that we found very pleasant. Our room was very well equiped and very high quality. Bose radio, Frette linen, Molton Brown soaps. Nice curtains/chairs.Comfortable and large bed. Good shower. Plent of heat/cool from the aircon.The whole hotel sparkles, i have never seen anything cleaner.StaffVery welcoming and helpful at all times.RestaurantWe did not eat there so cannot comment.

<Content>Great Hotel, but avoid the bar We stayed at the hotel for a saturday night in November, and our room rate was much reduced from their 'normal' one.Everything about the hotel was very good, professional staff, comfortable room with all mod cons, and nice quiet location just off the Cromwell road and about 5-10 minutes walk from the underground.The only reason it doesn't get 5/5 is the bar prices - we paid more than æ‹¢7 each for a bottle of beer. Best to find a pub or bar in Earls Court or Gloucester Road.

<Content>Quiet street  Great service (Elvis took great, detailed care of us). Felt we got our money's worth. Room was small but clean. Quiet and safe street near the Underground and a local Sainsbury made sight-seeing convenient. Wish we had more time to explore the neighborhood cafes and nearby shopping. Can't put my finger on it, but while the room was clean and had all the amenities we needed, it just didn't feel cozy. There was a coldness about the room, even when the heat was on. This was not a problem because we spent so little time in the room, but definitely an overall impression I got.

<Content>Its Really Great! i stayed at the parkcity on the 20th and the 21st of november, and we were greeted by the super friednyl staff. Especially the bell boy, who went the extra mile to point out to me where the nearest tube station was.i love the molton brown toiletries! (: and it has a really great location as well, just walk staright down the road and you reach the gloucester road station.If you have enough time to spare you can even walk down to harrods as well.Alothough, my stat at the parkcity was short. But i have thoroughly enjoyed myself! (:thank you tripadvisor! (:

<Content>Loved the Park City My wife and I stayed for one night on Friday 28th November and loved the hotel. The hotel is extremely welcoming and was spotless. Arriving by taxi we were met by the concierge who took our bags and directed us to reception. All the staff were courteous, professional and dealt with any request. They were a credit to the management / owners. Our bedroom had a very comfortable 'kingsize' bed and all the room / bathroom facilities were excellent. Our party of seven (only my wife and I were staying at the hotel) descended on the bar after having dinner elsewhere (I have posted a report on the Foxtrot Oscar restaurant) and the bar manager served a range of different drinks and cocktails which were superb. I cannot comment on the breakfast as were travelling on the Eurostar to Paris and breakfast was included in the tickets. This hotel is ideally located for the Kensington / Hyde Park area and we would not hesitate in returning.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed one night for a party. Great hotel - staff were excellent and very obliging. We booked through the hotel website which has loads of options. Particularly liked the late checkout option (2pm) as we were up quite late... They do use feather duvets and pillows so if , like me, you're allergic you'll need to mention it. They were very good about changing the bedding but I was a bit embarassed about not mentioning it when I booked... The English breakfast is a buffet, with only the eggs being cooked fresh - only negative point...

<Content>Can see why it is so highly rated Not boasting but my mum, now 89, was being awarded an MBE for services to Oxfam, 46 years. We needed a hotel close to Buckingham Palace that would not break the bank!!!We read all the reviews of this hotel on Tripadvisor and thought it looked good, that was an understatement. It was not the cheapest in the area but you kinda get what you pay for. So here we go.1. We needed three rooms together or close to each other as we had teenagers and an 89 year old to keep an eye on (party animal). They could not guarantee this at time of booking but on arrival they gave us 210, 212, and 214. You canéˆ¥æª› really get much closer than that. 210 and 210 were interconnecting so mum had some company and we were close at hand if there were any problems.2. We arrived at the hotel early after a flight from Belfast, they told us it would be unlikely the rooms would be ready at 10.00am, but they had got one ready so mum could have a nap and we had somewhere to leave the luggage, simply put, excellent customer service.3. The staff, particularly Richard (asst mgr), Rachid (front desk) and Paolo (in Rubys), wow. So friendly, so attentive, and just so nice to my mum, she felt so at ease the minute she arrived. They fixed a small problem with one of the TV's in 3 minutes, again perfect customer service.4. The location for us was perfect, perhaps not ideal for everyone but only 6 minutes from Earls Court Tube, and 10 minutes up to Kensington High Street (tube, loads of shops and restauarnts). I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will use it again the next time we are in London.Enjoy!!!

<Content>Don"t Stay Anywhere Else After searching for a decent hotel in Kensington, London, we decided that we would stay at the Parkcity hotel. From the moment we arrived until we left the service and the hotel could not be faulted. The hotel itself is set amongst some beautiful terrace houses, has been recently refurbished (very very stylish and modern) and is really well positioned close to Gloucester Road Station (5min walk), Kensington Gardens (15 min walk) and High Street, Kensington (15 min walk) not too mention restaurants, Sainbury's, cafe's and the most beautiful french patissere opposite the tube station. There is also a starbucks opposite the station for all the USA travellers. The hotel is located off Cromwell Road in a residential area so the room was very very quiet. The hotel is immaculate and exceeded all of our expectations. We thought it was such value for money. Firstly the staff were so nice and after 30 hours of flying it was comforting to know we were going to be well looked after. Although our room wasn't ready when we arrived (at 8am) they allowed us to shower, change and store our luggage while we went off and explored London. After arriving back they were courteous, had our room ready, bags and all, and set us up with some biscuits, tea and fresh bottled water. The room was beautiful, king size bed, enormous bathroom, very modern and very very comfortable. I cannot speak highly enough of this hotel and for $AU230 a night it was a bargain.

<Content>5-star service We have stayed five nights in Parkcity in early November. The hotel is situated on a quiet street, about 5-10 minutes walk to Earls Court tube station. Room is neat and tidy, with molton brown toiletries. I am deeply impressed by the 5-star customer service of the hotel. All staff at the reception counter, concierge and restaurant always wear a smile and are ready to offer assistance at all times.Also recommended is a chinese restaurant named Dragon Palace on Earls Court Road, just opposite to Earls Count station and next to Subway. I come from Hong Kong and would say that the dishes are of high quality with reasonable price.

<Content>Great hotel We stayed at the Parkcity from Oct. 25 to Nov. 1, room 103, and had a great stay. The room was very clean, with a king size bed, a small table and chairs. The room was spacious and modern with a spotless bathroom. The staff was very nice and helpful. Our room was beside the elevator and we didn't hear anything, In fact, it was so quiet, that we felt like we were the only guests in the hotel. Situed on a quiet street, 10 min. from the Gloucester road tube and near grocery stores, shopping area and restaurants. We would go back without any hesitation.We highly recommend this hotel. Overall : good price for London, very clean, modern and quiet, good size room, very nice and friendly staff.

<Content>Love the ParkCity! The ParkCity is truly a gem on a fantastic quiet street! We stayed there for 4 nights in early November and found the hotel to be a great value in a perfect location. It was very quiet, clean and comfortable. The rooms aren't huge, but I wouldn't call them small. I am very picky about cleanliness and our room met my standards. The bathroom is very special, with a nice deep bathtub, rain shower head and hand held shower head. I felt like I was at home!The staff was very friendly and helpful. The first night we got there, we asked for a coffeemaker and they brought up a tray with a selection of teas, instant coffee, sugars, creamers, an electric kettle, cups, saucers and spoons. It had everything we needed to make morning coffee and evening tea for our whole stay.Our TV wasn't tuning in to the CNN channel, so we called and they sent someone up to fix it. (We were there during the election and really wanted to watch the results on a U.S. TV channel.)We were offered turn-down service every night and when we told them it was unnecessary, they would give us the chocolates. Very sweet.We booked through their website and were able to get an early bird special and pre-pay for the high speed internet at a discount from the standard æ‹¢9.99.I loved this hotel and would love to keep it a secret, but I like it so much that it deserves a good review. I will definitely stay there every time I am in London.

<Content>Still a gem of a hotel I stayed at the Parkcity for one night in October for a theatre trip. My second stay at Parkcity, this time I chose a Deluxe room on the front of the hotel. There were a few advantages to the standard rooms - more spacious and airy, lovely big bed, and we got breakfast delivered to the room on a trolley rather than a tray (not sure if this was related to the room choice or not!). This was a fantastic second stay, for the price it's superb. So many hotels in London are so naff - this is a real gem.We did have a slight problem with the heating - the aircon/heating system in the rooms is quite old and when the weather starts to cool they apparently sometimes have problems with the heating coming back on. But after a call to reception, 30 minutes later our heating was repaired and fully functioning. Fantastic response as I've come to expect at Parkcity.

<Content>Great hotel in convenient location Stayed at the ParkCity overnight on a weekend. Good, clean  modern hotel. Check in and out was efficient and the staff were very pleasant during my stay.Stayed in Room 15 - a standard double room. Room wasn't massive but a good enough size, well set out and furnished. Double bed was comfy with decent linen. The room had many facilities - mini bar; hairdryer; safe; BOSE CD / radio; LCD TV. The only thing missing was tea and coffee making facilities.Room also had chair, table and desk. Bathroom was impeccably clean with a good powerful shower over the bath. Nice touches were the evening turn down, lovely molton brown toiletries and a free newspaper in the morning. Location wise - it's very convenient to wherever you want to go in London. Nearest tube station is Gloucester Road. I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>You can easily pay more for a room in London and get none of the above My wife and I loved the clean, comfortable and good sized rooms. The quite South Kensington location was only a 5 minute walk to the tube station and 10 minutes from Kensington High Street and the Natural History and V  A museum. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the bed was comfy. Highly recommended.

<Content>Nice hotel, some issues with temperature We wish that there was a 3 1/2 star rating because this hotel seems to be right in between 3 and 4 stars. The hotel has a great location, the rooms are nice with a modern decor, the prices are reasonable for London, and manager was very helpful but a few minor issues with some of the other staff.The few issues keeping this hotel from getting 4 stars. We had a terrible time adjusting the temperature even after calling the front desk. We were told that the heat and cool takes 15-20 minutes to kick in, which would be too long anyway, but in fact it never cooled off and we had to leave windows open which presented some noise problems during the night. We were also overcharged for some wine delivered to the room which was corrected promptly once we called. All that said, we would recommend this hotel with the caveats above.

<Content>Loved Parkcity Hotel. My husband and I travelled around Europe for our honeymoon in July/August 08 and stayed at the Parkcity hotel, from 17-21 July. We landed in London following a 15 hour flight and were pretty tired and weren't looking our best, but we were very impressed as we stepped into this classy hotel and were escorted to our room (#308). The room was larger than we had anticpiated, the bed was so comfortable and we had a view out over the street. The service we received from all the staff there was excellent, particularly Elvis who went out of his way to make us feel welcome. On our last day there, he recommended we visit Regent's Park, which was amazing. Each day we were there we either walked or caught the underground to get around, the hotel is in a heaps good location. We would definately recommend the Parkcity hotel, we had such a memorable stay there. Jess  Allan from Australia.

<Content>Quiet and convenient A nice quiet hotel in a good London neighborhood. A little out of the way, but still convenient to all major London attractions via the tube.My wife and I stayed for three nights in a standard room. It was comfortable and not as small as I expected for a London hotel room. We found the room to be exceptionally clean. The staff were also quite helpful. The only problem we encountered was a lack of heat from the central unit on our first night which was remedied by space heaters. The central unit was fixed the next day.I would recommend this hotel and would certainly stay there again.

<Content>The Parkcity? FABULOUS!! My wife and I celebrated our 15th anniversary with a trip to Europe. Our first stop was in London and we stayed for one evening prior to flying to our next stop.The room at the Parkcity was as we expected. Reading all the previous reviews on numerous hotels in London had prepared us for smaller rooms which are simply furnished. The pictures in previous posts are entirely accurate. Simple, clean and 'cozy'.The location is very close to the underground station. Maybe a 5-10 minute walk and easy to find. It is down a side street and as such, had very limited street noise.The staff were absolutely EXCELLENT! They were very helpful in assisting us to locate nearby sites. Their recommendation for dinner (a local pub, Britannia) was perfect. They were also instrumental in helping us to navigate the bus system and helping us secure transportation to Stansted airport the next morning (we needed to leave at 4:30 am!). Elvis, in particular, was cheerful and knowledgeable. This is the attentive care we all search for when visiting a foreign country.We will definitely stay here in the future. We did not have any difficulties with inappropriate charges. The hotel is FABULOUS. Thank you.

<Content>Wonderful Place to Stay This is a wonderful new hotel if you are coming to London for a vacation. It is in a quiet, safe neighborhood that is close to the underground. There is a grocery store that is even closer (with a Starbucks). There are many neighborhood restaurants, as well as one in the hotel. The hotel also has the internet and a gym. We were happy with the size and cleanliness of the room and the bathroom. The staff was also very helpful. We will stay here again.

<Content>Never Again..... Well, having stayed at this Hotel twice before, after reading rave reviews about the place, we found that is was VERY expensive for what it offers, and really does not offer good value for money at all, BUT, having been given a Virgin  Classic Break  for Xmas, we decided to give the place another chance...... BIG MISTAKE....... Arriving on a Friday afternoon, after a long journey from Wales, the reception insisted I HAD to swipe my Credit Card ASAP to avoid the Hotel being ripped off by Customers.Really makes you feel welcome when you have already paid Months in advance I can assure you.... Then to add insult to injury, they put æ‹¢100 on my Credit Card, which was debited at once, and I am STILL trying to get it back from them. So my advice to anyone reading this and staying at the Park City Hotel is, do NOT give them your Credit Card details on arrival, as they WILL try and claim it from your account immediatelly.Be Careful Folks, this Hotel, does not respect your Credit Card limit at all. It can leave you short of money if they do this to everyone.... So, on to our stay.... We had paid for a  Welcome Pack  which was not in the room when we arrived, and we had to phone up for it, on 3 occasions, took them about 2 Hours to sort that one out, by which time we about to go out, so a total waste of time and money indeed, and it ended up in the rubbish bin, the next Day.... No sign of Tea and Coffee facilities in the room, so once again we had to phone reception for this basic facility, and we then got a broken kettle, after a wait of about an Hour, we then phoned reception ( AGAIN ) and were told there was not another kettle available at the moment, BUT, as a gesture of goodwill ( SERIOUSLY ) they would send us a jug of hot water, and they DID,and then the waiter expected a tip too, he stood there for a while holding his hand out !!!! As you can probably guess, this was not a nice stay for us, so we just got out of the place on Friday evening, went to our Concert at the 02 Arena, came back in the evening, slept in the large uncomfortable bed, had breakfast in the morning and got out of the Hotel early on Saturday afternoon, after checking with reception that we would NOT be charged for anything on our stay. I asked for the reciept that was swiped on my Credit Card when we arrived, but was told everything was fine, and it had been cancelled. We actually did not spend a penny in the place, as we did not think they deserved our custom, but are now engaged in a battle of wits, trying to get our æ‹¢100 back... Personally,after our recent experience, I would advise you to avoid this Hotel at all costs, but if you DO stay here, check your Bill with a scrutinous eye.....As a footnote to this, I have now spoken to the Managers at length about our stay there, and WHY they debit your Credit Card on arrival, and have since been informed they usually put a æ‹¢50 charge for every night you stay there. Which just puts salt in the wound as far as we are concerned, We only stayed ONE night, yet they charged us for TWO.......Lucky we didn't stay a week then, as my Card would have had æ‹¢350 on it, when I got home.......We will certainly not be staying here again, thats a certainty...

<Content>OK for a short term stay My wife and I stayed the night of Sept. 11th. While we certainly had no complaints and found it overall a decent value in a location we rather liked, there's nothing special about this hotel. The room was rather utilitarian: basic and somewhat charmless. But the beds were comfortable and the space adequate. And I'd certainly be remiss if I didn't give the staff a decided thumbs up. They were uniformly friendly and very professional. Would I return? Probably yes, since our rate of $280.50 included not only VAT but breakfast as well. As I said, fair value for the money. Also not to be overlooked, we found it quiet. A most important consideration for me. H.W.Hallman Denver, Colorado

<Content>Very disappointed This was our second stay in the hotel as our previous visit was so comfortable. However, we were very disappointed by our allocated room during this visit, room 16 (under the stairs on the ground floor). The air-con system in the room did not function. Even at maximum strength, no cold air was produced despite the fans operating. Room 16 has its windows permanently locked. This meant that my partner and I were left to stew in an unpleasantly hot room all night with absolutely no ventilation. Reception offered a solution to the faulty air-con problem, but their suggestion failed to fix it. Secondly, the TV system in the room was not functioning when we arrived, and wasn't fixed until 11am.I wrote to the manager with my complaints and mentioned them to reception, but I've not had the courtesy of a reply. Very poor for such a nice hotel in an excellent location!

<Content>Exactly what we hoped for Just back from a long weekend at the Parkcity. Great staff! Super little place. Pretty convenient for tourists with the 74 bus at the end of the road and 5-6 mins walk to Gloucester Road (Picadilly Line e.g. to and from Heathrow) underground station. Decent breakfast included in our deal. Only criticism at all was no coffee/tea tray in room. Almost made up for by extra nice bedclothes, Bose radio, LG flat screen and superior hairdryer. Also Moulton Brown goodies in the bathroom

<Content>Lovely, lovely, lovely! First off, I lost my mobile phone as soon as we arrived in London. It fell out in the taxi and got lost forever. The hotel was really proactive in trying to help me. What else can I say? This hotel is a gem!!!!!! Wonderful, caring staff in an excellent location - very close to two tube stations and finally, a comfortable bed!!!!!!! The room was clean and lovely. The hotel is beautiful and quaint. There's nothing more to say.... I LOVE YOU, PARKCITY! Thank you for an amazing stay!

<Content>A Hidden Gem!! A real hidden Gem! - Stayed one saturday night in August for an overnight event in London. I must say the location is very convenient, being in Kensington and right on the door step for all its local museums etc - but tucked away nicely in a quiet location so that waking up on a Sunday morning in peace and quiet was lovely. Room was superb and good size. Bed was so comfortable it was a shame to get out of it - but the room service breakfast was out of this world so that helped! All in all a fabulous hotel and well worth getting off the main roads of Kensington to find it. Top place!

<Content>2nd visit This is our 2nd visit to the hotel. We were there for a night out in London just before we get married. They upgraded the room and gave us a bottle of wine, which was a lovely gesture.The room was great,small but clean and smelt lovely, I love the shower and molten brown products.The English breakfast was good, could have been a bit hotter, but overall I do like this place a lot and will come back again no doubt in the future.Did not try the bar this time as we had early evening plans but on my last visit they had somebody playing the piano.

<Content>6 Nights at the ParkCity As with everyone else it seems, I picked the ParkCity based on the reviews on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed. I traveled to London with my wife and two daughters (ages 8 and 15). We booked a special package, called the Summer Sensation Package (or something like that). Each deluxe room was 165bp's per night per room including VAT, and a continental breakfast for each person each morning. We booked two rooms, and they were the only hotel I checked with that would confirm and guaranty that the rooms would be connecting (rooms 108 and 110). We were also given coupons for 4 drinks in the bar. I also booked high speed internet access in advance for 6.50bp's per day, relatively cheap for London. Saved about 3pounds per day by prebooking. Still no wireless though!The location is ideal. The neighborhood is totally safe, and we never felt uneasy no matter what the day or night. A grocery store is a 2 minute walk away, and many restaurants and other services are within a 10 minute walk. We frequented the Earls Court Tube station, which is less than a 10 minute walk through very nice neighborhoods. From that Tube station, all of London is a short journey away. It seemed much nicer than the Gloucester Road station. The hotel itself is very nice, and very different from a chain hotel like the Marriott, or Holiday Inn, in my opinion. Very much more English, which I can't really explain. The lobby is immaculate. The little bar is just OK; very much a quiet little place. In fact, the whole hotel is VERY quiet. We kidded that we seemed to be the only people in the entire place! It would have been nice to have a bit more interaction with some other guests, but I'll take the peace and quiet any day. The rooms were decent: probably about the size of a normal US hotel room. Bathrooms were very nice as were the beds. The air conditioning in our rooms was very quiet and COLD. One nuisance is the light switches on the outside of the bathrooms. Our rooms were right next to the lift, but we never were bothered by that. Windows opened as well for some fresh air. We never made it down to the restaurant, Lessandro's, for breakfast. We always had our free continental breakfast via room service, which was always delivered promptly at the time we requested the previous evening. I was expecting Lessandro's to have a dinner menu, which they did not, so you have to go out for lunch's and dinners. This was fine with us, but the first night we would have rather had room service. The continental breakfast was really good; fresh rolls/toast/croissants; yogurt; coffee/tea; cereals; fruit plate. Very filling and delivered to your room if you'd like! Regularly 13.50bp's per person...A couple of restaurants we tried in the area included Bella Vista (on Cromwell); il Borgo (on Glouchester); and the a chinese place, The Dragon, I believe, near the Earls Court Tube. All were excellent! We also tried Giraffe on Kensington High, but weren't impressed. The service at this hotel is decent, not exceptional. Everyone is friendly, and they execute well, but there is something missing. Not sure what it is. This wasn't a big deal, as we don't require alot of hand holding and really spent a minimal amount of time in our rooms. And there wasn't alot that we needed anyway. I would recommend getting a car from Heathrow, as I can't imagine lugging our luggage through the Tube and then to the hotel (my ladies pack alot of stuff). We used Londonheathrowcars.com; about half the price than the hotel's car service and they did a good job and were reliable. Still about $90 USD each way though.Checking out was a breeze. The bill was perfect with no surprises. All in all, a great home base for exploring London. Not cheap if you are getting two rooms, but a good alternative that gave the kids their own place, and us parents some privacy too!

<Content>Why would you stay Anywhere Else? My wife and I have just stayed at the Parkcity Hotel in Kensington. This place is a real find! firstly on check in, we were upgraded from standard room to a Delux! The hotel is very very stylish, the staff are polite efficient and somewhat stylish also. We were taken to our room by the concierge who showed us the various things in the room, the Safe, TV (flatscreen) and the air con.Our room was fantastic!! The bed was huge and the bedding wonderful. Being in the bed was like having a huge hug.Everything about this place was and is superb. The staff did all they could to make our night's stay fantastic.The breakfast was vast and really good quality, served downstairs in a stylish dinning area. We asked for a taxi and where whisked in to a mercedes with a sharp dressed driver who took us to our retsuarant in Buckingham Palace Road in no time.Really stay here it is fantastic, clean, stylish, peacful and most of all honest and elegant. you would be mad not too.

<Content>Perfect London Accomodation! We thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Parkcity Hotel. Our room was beautiful, the bathroom spacious, and the fridge and safe added perks. We had stayed at the nearby Ashburn Hotel over New Year's, but some negative reviews caused me to look elsewhere for this trip. Personally, I loved the Ashburn too, but the Parkcity was a nicer hotel. Benefits of the Ashburn: free breakfast, free movie channels, a turndown gift on the pillow, and free champagne nightly. (although some of these things may have been part of the holiday package deal). Benefits of the Parkcity: great location, near Earl's Court with lots of food choices, working air-conditioning, huge tub/shower, fridge with room for our own items, and quiet location. We love London, and having a pleasant place to stay makes it all the better.

<Content>Nice hotel in a great location We found this hotel in Trip Advisor. It was located in our favorite area of town, so when we read all the great reviews we booked a couple of nights. We were not disapointed. Near two tube stations on a quiet side road, this was a very nice hotel. Service was pleasant and helpful. We had a slight problem in our bathroom and within minutes of calling the front desk the concierge knocked on our door and proceeded to fix the problem himself. The room was clean and modern, but on the small side. However, in this case, size did not matter. There was enough room to relax (the bed was very comfortable-quite important in our view for any hotel stay.) Besides, we were in London to viist the city and not to hang around in our room. The air conditioning worked fine.The price was reasonable for London and for that area. We are already planning our next visit to London and we will be staying at this hotel again. No hesitation. Michel and Judy

<Content>Maybe it's just me, but... OK, from the majority of reviews here, this place is loved my many. I cannot for the life of me work out why.No need to explain the hotel itself, as this has been covered well by other reviewers. And yes, it is a nice, quiet location. And that's it.The room (their best suite) was decidedly small for the price, even by London standards. The furniture was clean but cheap, with the sofa being particularly poor.The staff (I only spoke with the chaps on reception) provided an adequate service in a not terribly interested manner.I can only assume that I'm missing something that so many other see clearly. That, or not all these other reviews are quite what they seem.

<Content>A second great stay at Parkcity After a first great stay at the Parkcity earlier in the year I was keen to return and not disappointed. The service was exceptional and the staff friendly and helpful. Small details like a welcome back were appreciated. The hotel is clean and well furnished with a bit of luxury. The breakfast at æ‹¢10 per head particularly good value. We were offered eggs cooked too order, beautifully presented and a meal in themselves.Another bonus is the pleasant 10 - 15 minute walk to Kensington High Street with a good range of shops and restaurants.I shall certainly stay again in the future.

<Content>Superb find in a lovely safe area of London I believe in staying at a hotel twice before reviewing it. This is surely one the most friendly but excellent quality hotels in which to stay in horribly expensive London - where most hotels don't care about service and quality - unless you're lucky enough to afford the Savoy or similar. ( I've also done that but they can be quite intimidating and pompous!!) This hotel provides everything one can ask for in an overnight stay, good unpretentious service, excellent beds with good linen, spotlessly clean and well-equipped bathrooms, and very well-cooked breakfast. Unfortunately, parking has to be at local NCP which adds to cost if you take a car. However, the walking distance to local restaurants is a bonus (no cabs required).Would not hesitate to stay again.

<Content>Great hotel....Great value ! We stayed here for one night as it was within walking distance of the Albert HallThis really is a great hotel. We had a de luxe room which was just perfect. Very spacious, spotless, beautifully furnished, fabulous bed and nice touches such as Bose radio/CD and Molton Brown toiletries, and all for a very reasonable price in London terms.Front desk and staff were both helpful and pleasant and the piano bar was great to come back to for a nice cocktail accompanied by some very pleasant piano music.Breakfast was also very nice and included in our web special deal.Hotel is only a short walk from a couple of tube stations and some nice pubs / restaurants.In short this is really great hotel, and certainly one of the best City hotels we have stayed in and will definitely stay here again.

<Content>This hotel was as terrific as we'd hoped My husband and I just returned from a week's stay at the ParkCity which we selected based upon the previous reviews and proximity to the Imperial College of London where he had meetings over several days. Check in was efficient and the desk staff very helpful. We booked a deluxe room and found it large in comparison to the many European hotels we've frequented. As others have mentioned, the air conditioning wasn't great and wasn't sufficient for the hot weather we encountered. The hotel immediately provided a fan which made an incredible difference. When I asked about using the mini refrigerator in the room without being charged, hotel staff was glad to remove its contents immediately. We were then able to fill it with fruit, water and whatever else we picked up from Sainsbury, a 24 hour market just around the corner.The bed itself was very comfortable... this hotel uses Frette sheets and robes. They unfailingly replenished the toiletries every day. There was also turn down service with chocolates on the pillows each night. A local newspaper was delivered to the door every day and USA Today is available in the lobby each day. The hotel itself is on a quiet street with little noise but close enough to both the Earl's Court and Gloucester street tube stops. Earl's Court is a little closer but we used both tube stops several times. From a location perspective, walking to Kensington High street was about a 10 minute walk through pleasant neighborhoods. We had breakfast, not included in the room rate, at the hotel at least 2 times although we never saw more than one other individual or couple there on the mornings we ate there. The food and service were fine but relatively expensive. We found another restaurant; Kensington Square a much more enjoyable option. This restaurant...just a couple of blocks from Kensington High street, serves breakfast late, has outside tables which face a lovely garden and great food/service. We had breakfast there twice.Overall, this hotel was a terrific value in every aspect...service, room size, amenities, location. We would definitely look to the ParkCity again if we needed to stay in that part of London in the future.

<Content>A backwater gem We booked this hotel for its location - to be close to the Albert Hall as we were attending the Proms. We were not to be disappointed. On arrival we were shown to the room by a highly knowledgeable concierge who took us through all we needed to know. A slight hiccup occured with the room - no fault of the hotel chain and we moved to an even better room, slickly and with absolutely no inconvenience to ourselves. Well done to the reception staff who were always in control, putting the customer first.The room was excellent, huge comfortable bed, lots of wardrobe /storage space, monsoon shower, super toiletries, black out curtains and an area in which to eat separately. Room service was above average. The corridors for some obscure reason are incredibly warm but this isn't an issue in your air conditioned room - quiet air conditioning at that! The hotel is situated in a quiet back water of Kensington and it's well worth looking closely at street maps to avoid walking along the busy Cromwell Road.All the major museums are close by, also the Tube - Gloucester Station. For families on budgets there are all the usual supermarkets close by to avoid high costs of eating out.If you are up for a high market evening out try the Mandarin Oriental Bar in Knightsbridge - pricey but service on another scale, excellent food and even better drinks, cocktails. Great Evening In all we would stay at this hotel again ? Without hesitation.

<Content>Excellent stay Stayed here for one night and wish we could have stayed longer. The location is a bit off the beaten path, but easy walking distance to the tube and all sorts of shops and amenities. Not cheap, but very good value for the price.This was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in - I wish I could take it home with me! The truffles on our pillows didn't hurt either...Very nice bath with Molton Brown toiletries.Friendly/helpful staff.We would definitely stay again.

<Content>Brilliant as always Am reluctant to write this as I want to keep this place a secret. However, these people deserve to be recognised for the job they do. The hotel is spotless clean. The service is impeccable and each individual is eager to go just that little bit further in order to fulfil any requirement. We are regular guests here and have not had a bad experience yet. Highly recommended. We will keep coming back.

<Content>Very Swanky !! My husband an I went for a romantic weekend away for 2 nights and it was fantastic. We arrived and we had our bags carried to the room. The room was small but very very clean and tidy and the bathroom was stunning. Lovely toiletries as well ! The room was tidied twice each day and chocolate on the pillows which was a lovely touch. The breakfast was great and the staff very helpful. All in all a very nice stay nothing bad to say about it at all. Not too pricey either which was a nice surprise!

<Content>Wonderful! My boyfriend and I stayed here for a night before our early-morning flight to Iceland. I have to admit I felt a little spoiled. The Concierge was very nice (the blonde-ish guy with glasses, not the woman however), he helped us check in, helped with the bags, even let us check in two hours early which was a relief from a 'long' train ride there from Manchester.We took advantage of the bath tub, nice and roomy and the bubble bath soap that was provided was nice. We walked around London, grabbed some dinner at the MS, and went back and ate in the hotel. In the morning the Concierge was kind enough to call us a car (not a cab, but a Mercedes) and again helped us with our bags and wished us a safe trip. Since we didn't get a chance to see Big Ben and Parliament while we were there, the driver actually took us past them on the way to the airport just so we could get a quick snapshot. So nice!The Parkcity is in a wonderful and safe location, close to pretty much everything. It's actually quite luxurious, to be honest.Short distance to Soho from there.The beds are heaven, I swear I fell asleep within seconds.Everything was sparkling clean, nice view from the windows, safe, good lighting....wonderful service.what more can I say, great night! Hope to return!

<Content>Great hotel This is an excellent hotel. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were great. Stylish and comfortable. We had a free upgrade to a suite and we had so many rooms we were a bit disappointed we were only booked for one night and so had no time to use the sitting room, dining room and kitchenette!! Breakfast was good too. Parkcity is not that cheap but in London you have to pay for space so I felt we had value for money and would happily stay here again.

<Content>Simply the Best I stayed in the hotel with my partner just for one night last weekend in room 101, to attend an early breakfast meeting in Kensington. Until one month ago I was not familiar with this hotel until I read the top ten London hotels on this site.This hotel is one of the best kept secrets in London.Comfortable bed and a sound night's sleep. The air conditioning was the quietest we have ever experienced.Frette linen on the beds and the hotel is in a very quiet location just off the Cromwell Road, a short walk from Gloucester Road tube station.We had two rounds of drinks in the Ruby's bar followed by a cheeseburger and club sandwich. Breakfast the next morning was good value with a full buffet and my favourite Eggs Benedict on the a la carte dishes.Friendly staff and great value for money.

<Content>Very pleasant, but surprised it was rated number one in London. Excellent modern clean room with plenty of space. Great breakfast and delightfully friendly staff. Some way out of central London and although close to Kensington, you are still a good walk (in the rain) from an underground station. The hotel is small and despite an agreeable back garden patio, would not be a place I would wish to spend an evening (a requirement if you have two children sleeping upstairs).Location in London is key. I thought this hotel was wonderful, but it was too far from downtown to make it my hotel of choice. Management, donéˆ¥æª› drastically change anything. What you do, you do well.

<Content>Excellent stay - staff helped make it ! Stayed here 14th - 16th July. Booked direct with hotel on line and got an excellent pre paid rate. All staff were excellent and cheerful, even offering to take photos for us before we left for a garden party. We used the hotel car service twice, which was a little more expensive than black cab, but then again you got a private driven mercedes for this. Nice if you are going somewhere special or want a little more comfort. Car turned up on the dot when requested and very smart car and driver.Rooms were excellent. Me and hubby had a deluxe room which had more space than standard but the standard rooms our mums had were both lovely. Breakfast was excellent with lots of variety and bar was comfortable with an outside sitting area if weather nice. Food and drink are london prices but if you wanted there is a 24/7 sainsbury just around the corner for anything from sandwiches to bottles of wine etc. Tube station a short walk and only a few stops to all areas of interest. No parking at the hotel but a secure parking site nearby.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Value We stayed at ParkCity Hotel for a 4-day vacation in London. Location is great, most sightseeing spots are within a 20 - 30 minutes metro ride. We actually chose to take the metro from Heathrow airport to the Hotel, and took about 30 minutes. I think it's actually a good option, instead of spending at least 40 pounds on the taxi if you don't have a lot of luggage. (train tickets are about 4 pounds /pp).The bed is extremely comfortable, the whole accommodation experience was excellent. We asked the iron/ironing board and was able to keep it in our room for the entire stay. The only thing I have to say is, when you walk from the metro station to the hotel, you will see at least 7 -8 hotels that are closer to the station, and you will start asking yourself the question that why didn't you book one of those hotels that are even closer to the train station? But, I do really enjoy the boutique hotel experience of ParkCity, so I think I will book it again in the future.The other thing I will recommend is to ask whether your room is going to be next to the elevator, because mine was. It is a little bit noisy when the elevator goes up and down, while you are trying to sleep.

<Content>Great Stay As described by many. 7 minute from Picadilly line which is convenient to Westend theater, national galleries and palace. As traffic is terrible in London due to much construction it is important that a hotel is convenient to tube. Walk to Victoria Albert. Very quiet. Great concierge staff. Taxi service a bit expensive (over 20 pounds) if you stay past midnight in town. But we had a great, relaxed vist.

<Content>Really clean, good service Stayed in London July 4-10 to sight-see. The Park City was our hotel the entire time. We were very happy, and would gladly stay here again if it was just the two of us. Great location, close to the museums, and sub stops (Earl's Court and Gloucester). The #74 bus route has a stop at the end of the street the hotel is on, and is very convenient to ride to Hyde Park/museums/Baker St, etc. It's great sometimes to catch the bus when you don't feel like walking the extra blocks to the Underground station. Sainsbury's grocery (like Kroger's in US) was just a five-minute walk away, and since there was a small fridge in the room, we bought soft drinks/water at the grocery to have during the day. The neighborhood the hotel is in is quiet, and seemed safe. The hotel itself has a very helpful concierge staff, nice lounge/waiting area, and delivers the London paper every morning to your room. They also have copies of USA Today in the hotel lobby, which is nice. They have a business center, but we didn't use it, as there was an inexpensive Internet Cafe about a block away which cost a little less to use. Our room was standard and small compared to US standards, but apparently that's to be expected in London hotels, and since there's so much to see/do, who wants to stay in the room anyway? Our room had about a foot of space on either side of the bed, one small round table with two chairs, a desk with a chair, a closet with a safe inside, and a nice sized bathroom with an extra-large shower head and large tub. There was not much room to walk around, most of the floor space was taken with the bed, desk, table, closet, etc. All the furniture was sleek and looked new, with clean simple lines. The water in the bathroom was always hot, and the bed in the room was queen-sized, super soft and comfortable with lots of pillows. They kept the room spotless, and had free turn-down service every afternoon. It was a little stuffy/warm in the hall outside the room, but the temperature in the room was always comfortable. There is a lift (elevator) to get to the higher floors. We payed about $150 US per night, and felt it was a good deal. There is a movie cinema close by that shows the latest US movies, and a post office right across the street from the Earl's Court tube station if you want to mail postcards home. One note of caution. We asked for a wake-up call the day we were leaving, and received one, but it was thirty minutes later than we asked for...not a big deal, but you might want to bring your own alarm clock.

<Content>Parkcity - Great neighborhood; great hotel We stayed at the Park City - London in early July 2008. It is about a ten minute walk from the Gloucester Road tube station, 10-15 minutes from the Earls Court station.The neighborhood is excellent, nice quiet residential area in Kensington. The staff is excellent. Our room was relatively small, but the price/quality relationship for London was excellent. Internet is 6.50 pounds per day if booked with the room. It's 9.99 pounds per day at the hotel. expensive but less than most London hotels.I'd highly recommend the hotel and will stay there again without hesitation.

<Content>could not ask for better After much research via trip advisor (which I always use and has never failed me in the past) I booked two deluxe rooms for myself, my 2 sisters and mother at Parkcity .We had booked 2 deluxe rooms and were due to see 'Wicked' this being our first time in London. On arrival, inclusive of very polite attentive staff we were informed that our room wasn,t quite ready ,we very happily centered ourselves in the bar and had a refreshing drink ,very shortly we were informed that our room was ready and that we had also been upgraded,. To our amazement and pleasure the upgrade wasn't just to a better room.It was to a whole house!! 3 bedrooms 4 toilets and living ,dining and kitchen rooms.Everything was fabulous , I would be hard pushed to find a better place to stay in London, Park City xx

<Content>Great Boutique Hotel My husband and I stayed at the ParkCity June 27th to July 5th and had a wonderful stay. The hotel is in a quiet residential area close to tube stations, has very clean and spacious rooms and bathrooms. And above all, excellent customer service by all staff at the hotel. Probably the best service we have ever experienced and we travel quite a bit and stay in 4-5 star hotels. Also, we had a third person stay with us for a few nights and the hotel brought in an extra roll away bed for a nominal charge. Most hotels in London would not accomodate this request when I looked around. Plus, most rooms in London are quite small. The hotel recommended a great thai restaurant called the Blue Lagoon that we went to twice and highly recommend!

<Content>A good experience We just spend six nights at the Parkcity while touring London. The hotel is very modern, clean and comfortable. Rooms are small, which was expected in London. It is conveniently located near the Gloucester subway station and was adjacent to a Sainsbury's grocery store. The staff was friendly, but most struggled with the English language. We had a problem with the airconditioning, but the staff moved us to a different room at our request. Overall a very good experience.

<Content>Loved the Park City I booked this hotel online last spring. After the reservation I wrote twice asking about a car rental and also asking about the bed size in our room. The hotel staff was very responsive to these e-mails and throughout our 2 day stay in June all the employees were just wonderful. Our room was clean and the bed comfortable. We loved the location and will stay in this excellent hotel next time we are in London. Highly recommend.

<Content>Great Value, Enjoyed Stay Enjoyed stay at this hotel and plan to book again in a month when I return. As a five star business traveller, I've unfortunately grown accustomed to certain amenities so I have my share of balanced reviews on TripAdvisor. We stayed here on pleasure and thought it to be a great value, and I've stayed in more than seven london hotels. Around $300 USD with a spacious room, modern styling and furniture. Compared to what you get in the Hyde Park and Kensington areas, a closet pretty much, this is a good value. As a pleasure traveller, the neighborhood is a quieter one and a ten minute walk to the underground, which is nice stroll after dinner or what not. Recommended!

<Content>lovely hotel My fiance and I stayed in the Parckcity for a week, its a lovely hotel comfortable and clean. We stayed in a standard room, it had a nice big bed but the trade off is slightly less floor room as our room wasn't the largest. Not really a problem as most of the day is spent sight seeing. Bathroom was up a couple of stairs (not a problem for us as we're in our twenties) the highlight is the kettle head shower, so refreshing and invigorating! There was an excellent continental buffet breakfast included in the room price. The staff were at all times courteous and friendly. The hotel is in walking distance of both earls court and glouster road tube stations so is an excellent base for sightseeing, and as the picadilly line crosses both these stations its really easy to get there from heathrow. There is a number of restaurants and fast food outlets within walking distance and also a restaurant in the hotel although we didnt avail of it.

<Content>Terrific I recently stayed at the Park City Hotel due to the terrific feedback from the Trip Advisor website.On our arrival we weren't to be dissapointed with its easy access to all London's main attractions.We booked a Super-Delux room which was massive for London Standards , the room being very nicely decorated and very homelyThe beds were the biggest and most comfortable i think i/ve ever had the pleasure to sleep in.All the staff were more than helpfull regarding trip etc.We ordered a breakfast which although was a little expensive once it arrived we decided it was more than worth and could probabley have fed a small army.All in all we have a terrific stay and will return

<Content>Great boutique hotel in Kensignton Lovely location in Kensington. Has all the facilities you'd expect from a much more expensive hotel, and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is close to two train stations, so this made getting around very easy. And is within 5 to 10 mins walking distance of High St, Kensington - great for shopping!

<Content>Not that Good!!! My husband and me stayed 4 nights in this hotel in June. The bed is fine and the room is spacious. The hotel is not close to any undergournd station. Also, this is a very noisy hotel, we could hear clearly whenever someone passing by the corridor (with luggages or not)and talking during the mid-nights for the next door!The staff is not helpful and impolite, they are not responsive at all. When we came back at 12am, the hotel is locked and probably the staff was sleeping so they opened door for us after 5-6 mins after we rang. So horrible, they would wake you up suddenly at 6.30am for collecting sth in our room (we hanged do not disturb tag outside the room already!!!)We emailed them for the room request before, such as want a quiet room for honeymoon trip and requested extra towels. The hotel simply ignore our requests, as if they never receive our email! Finally when you checked out, they put the mini bar water fee inside the bill but obviously we didnt open the refrigerator for anything in the 4 nights. so please check your bill carefully when you checking-out.Afterall, I think it's the worst hotel during our trip to 6 countires in Europe. The poor attitude of Parkcity is not tolerable. very bad experience for us indeed.

<Content>Fantastic place for the price For the second time in the span of about four weeks I'll be visiting London on business. And for the second time I booked my hotel stay at the Parkcity. As others have mentioned, the hotel is situated at a clean and relatively quiet location in Kensington. It's within a short walking distance from Hyde Park and the Natural History Museum. The staff are friendly and a pleasure to chat. I was suitably impressed with my previous stay at the Parkcity and will be so again in early July.

<Content>Even better than the reviews say! I planned my first trip to London for months, researching hotels with great care. We stayed in Parkcity Hotel our last night in London only because the first few nights my 16 year old niece and I wanted a more central location to see the Trooping of the Colour festivities. Parkcity is a little out of the way of central London, but you can take a cab in for about 10 GBP or take the subway.Parkcity was everything the great reviews say and more. First, it was the most immaculately clean hotel I have ever stayed in. From the moment you enter the bright lobby you are impressed by the sense of perfect order and high standards.We were greeted warmly by front desk staff who speedily checked us in. An elegantly dressed young man took our luggage and escorted us to our rooms, taking time to point out the features of each room and showing us how to use the TV. Even the elevator was exceptional, very modern with a voice system announcing the floor you are going to.I had chosen a superior king room and it was huge by UK standards and large by American standards. It was on 2nd floor and had a big bay window area with lovely drapes I could open to reveal a pleasing view of the residential street in front of the hotel. Bed was the most comfortable I ever slept in with a lovely soft duvet cover. Excellent minibar and also mineral water provided bedside. Flat screen TV was great and easy to use.The bathroom was as incredibly clean as everything else with a big rain shower, large tub and nice toiletries. The towels were big and very soft! Had continential breakfast delivered -- no butter was provided but otherwise excellent. Even little details like the light switches -- unusually designed small metal switches so you could control all the lighting from your bed -- were delightful.One little quibble was that when we asked the front desk to call us a taxi to take us to Horse Guards, they called a private car instead without letting us know in advance. This was more expensive than a regular cab would have been. It was comfortable, with a knowledgeable driver, classical music playing, and newspapers provided for us during the drive. But if you want a cab, be sure to tell them clearly you want a regular public taxi, not the private car unless you want to pay more.We booked online for the nonrefundable discount rate too which was a terrific deal. I would return to the Parkcity in an instant and recommend it to everyone.

<Content>Really Nice Hotel Just back from a 2 night stay at the Parkcity Hotel, London. We booked the hotel based on the good reviews on tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. There were 3 of us travelling together and it is quite difficult to get a treble room. The hotel gave us a Deluxe Double with a roll away bed for 3rd person. The room was really nice - bed extremely comfortable. The bathroom was upstairs which was unusual but meant the bed room felt bigger. There was a huge wardrobe and safe. Location was excellent - 10mins walk to Kensington High street. We used Gloucester Road tube (10 mins walk) for getting in/out of central London and also for our train to Heathrow. Hotel staff were very friendly and extremely courteous. The concierge was excellent and nothing was too much trouble. They had maps, directions etc for getting around London. We did not eat in the Hotel as we had a room only rate, and felt æ‹¢18 a bit steep for full breakfast - so I can't comment on food or drink. We had hoped to have a cocktail in the bar, but we got back from our show around 11pm and it was pretty dead so we didn't bother. Would stay there again - location is idea if you want to be in a nice safe area but still close enough to get to all the action.

<Content>fantastic bed Firm, wonderful large bed with perfectly low down pillows and so-soft Frett linen!! I was in heaven. The room was very quiet and very clean. We had a great walk in the neighborhood and felt safe. The only complaint was that we were cold before going to sleep and the heat didn't help matters. They gave us a space heater and we were fine. The staff was very nice.

<Content>Highly recommended! This is NOT a luxury hotel...but it is pretty darn nice. The location was perfect- in a safe, beautiful residential neighborhood yet extremely accessible to lots of good restaurants and all of the sights. The staff was courteous and helpful and the rooms were fabulous to go home to every night. We had a standard sized room which wasn't very big by American standards, but plenty big enough for my mom and I. There wasn't tons of closet space, but we managed to unpack everything into the drawers provided. The decorations were simple and tasteful (looks just like the pictures)...and the flat screen TV and Bose radio were a nice touch. The beds were VERY comfortable and the AC worked well. The bathrooms were very large and had plenty of counter and shelf space.Given the cost of London hotels, this is a wonderful place to stay!BTW-- we used the National Express Dot to Dot shuttle service to get to and from the hotel. Maximum of 3 parties on the shuttle, so it's convenient- but MUCH cheaper than a cab. Book in advance at their web site.

<Content>Brilliant We stayed there from 5-8 June and had a great time.The front of the house service is everything you can hope for. I didn't have a question they couldn't answer or an issue they couldn't help resolve. Absolutely perfect.The standard rooms are quite big and luxurious, and was cleaned nicely even though we are quite messy.The only downside is the continental breakfast buffet which was lacking some and should really be included in the room price. But there are lots of places within a few minutes walk that serves great breakfasts so that was no big deal.

<Content>Nice Hotel, quite area We spent 3 nights for a pleasure trip to London. Well located in Kensington. Hotel staff were friendly, knowledgeable and willing to help. Room was quite large by European standards. Very modern, comfortable and well furnished. Hotel is located on a quiet residential street. It is a 5-10 minute walk to shopping and restaurants. Short walk to museums and Hyde Park and tour bus stop. Booked directly through the hotel website with an earlybird prepaid room. Rate seems well below other hotels of comparable quality and location. No problems with booking. We did not buy breakfast with our room package, however some room packages include breakfast. The breakfast area was very nice and clean. The breakfast presentation looked great. A la Carte breakfast is very expensive (as is everything in London), so if breakfast is important to you, try to include it in your room rate, it might be a better deal. Would have no reservation about staying here again.
