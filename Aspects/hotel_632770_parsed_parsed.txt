<Content>Best Hotel in Amsterdam My husband and I stayed at Fusion Suites the beginning of November on a stop over trip on our way to Tanzania. I found out about Fusion Suites through Trip Advisor and was impressed by the reviews. Let me say this... The reviews are absolutely correct! This place is like a gem! Alex and Sharmila are two amazing people who made us feel right at home. We stayed in one of the upgraded suites and were so amazed at the space for the cost of what the room was. Usually while traveling throughout Europe we have noticed that the rooms are unusually small. This is not the case at Fusion Suites. The decor is perfection! It looked like a spread out of Domino magazine. The breakfast was superb! We were literally stuffed every morning we were there. The location was also great as well. Right across the street from Vondel Park as well as within walking distance to the museums and a little more of walking distance to the Dam Square. This is an authentic, locally owned hotel that should not be missed. If you are planning a trip to Amsterdam, you will not go wrong with Fusion Suites.

<Content>Personal and Friendly We stayed for two nights and Alex and Sharmila were the perfect hosts. Everything about Fusion Suites is of a very high standard and we were made to be feel very welcome during our short stay. The location was perfect with Fusion Suites being close enough to all the main attractions whilst maintaining an air of calm in its residency.This will be the place I will stay whenever I come to Amsterdam from now on because evrything about it is so personal, friendly and of exceptional quality.Thankyou once again to Alex and Sharmila.Kind regards,Simon.Stayed Fri Nov 21st to Sun Nov 23rd 2008.

<Content>As Fabulous as all the Reviews Report! Just returned from a brief trip to Europe that started in the City Centre and I decided on the way 'out' I would like to experience something a bit smaller and personal. I could not have asked for anything better. I spent the final day of my journey solo and Alex and Sharmila could not have been more helpful. They suggested a fabulous place close by for dinner as well as some sight seeing tips. The room was fantastic - not your typical European tiny room! Large, tastefully decorated rooms w/ special touches including fresh flowers in both the bedroom and bath. The visit felt more like spending time in a friend's lovely home than a hotel or BB. Breakfast was fabulous too. I especially enjoyed talking with Sharmila about some of her own travel experiences. The whole experience left me wanting to return to Amsterdam soon! Any return trip to Amsterdam will definitely include Fusion Suites Number 40.

<Content>Was not disappointed After doing much research on the internet to see where to stay in Amsterdam, I decided to trust the reviews on tripadvisor and picked this hotel.Amsterdam seems to have a shortage of nice hotels, so I was very much looking forward to my stay here.Our flight was arriving from HK around 7 am in the morning and I therefore requested for an early checkup. To my pleasant surprise, when we arrived at the door at the door, we were informed that the room was ready.The room is nice. Not spectacular but very nice. Sharmila, the hostess here is also very nice - very friendly and tries to ensure that you are comfortable in your stay. She also serves a very deliciious breakfast, which is included in the price. The room comes with internet access (with PC), which is great.The only slight problem one might have in staying here is the lack of freedom feeling - i.e. you are at someone's house (andindeed you are) and you need to be sure you treat everything with respect. In bigger hotels, you would feel much more incognito, while here, there's always the need to do small talk with both the owners and the other guests here (seems like they are all americans).Overall, i've enjoyed my stay here but my husband who doenst like talking to strangers probably finds it a bit overwhelming wiht the need to make small talk with everyone

<Content>charming and worth every penny After reading 10+ reviews of this adorable boutique hotel, my husband and I booked a room. At $265/night with the dollar sinking daily against the euro, it was a big decision, but our theory is that the first 1-2 nights of your trip and more importantly the LAST 2-3 nights of a long trip should be in a beautiful space that will leave you with great memories. Alex  Sharmila greet you like you are friends, cook breakfast for you personally in their giant kitchen every AM...and it's not a BB experience where you have to entertain the eccentric BB owner. These poeple are cool, young, hip, live in the building and know how to leave you your personal space. HUGE, to ceiling, windows let in fresh air, we had a giant canopy bed and a crystal chandelier. Withing 30 minutes of checking in, Sharmila arrived in our room with a chilled bottle of good champagne. What a nice touch. Deep bathrubs to unwind after 5-10 miles of walking in Amstermad every day. We would recommend this place to anyone....just a few blocks from 2 best musuems in Amsterdam (Rijksmusuem  Van Gogh) and 10 minute walk to city center....we NEVER used a tram and were not tired. Quiet street in a professional neighborhood so great for sleeping. After 14 days in Euorpe, from Paris to French Riveria to Koln German to Amsterdam, this was one of our best stops! Book this place, the rooms go fast!Margy  Amo JuddCleveland, Ohio USA

<Content>Just perfect I agree with everything previous reviewers have written about the hotel. We stayed for two nights, and really enjoyed everything: the spacious and uniquely decorated room, excellent breakfast, hospitality, and the location, which is indeed perfect for exploring the city. The prices are reasonable in comparison with other hotels, and Fusion Suites 40 provides a really unique experience. One caution: if you arrive by car. parking is available in a nearby garage (3 minutes walking distance) , but very expensive at 48 Euro overnight.

<Content>Great location and personal service This hotel is excellent. It is located perfectly for all activities. It is easy to get to. Catch the tram number 1 and 10 mins later you are there. Museums are 5 mins away. You can walk everywhere. The rooms are large and comfortable. The hosts are great and provide wonderful fresh breakfasts of pancakes, fruits, meats, cheeses, pastries, cereals, eggs, bacon, I could go on but may run out of space! Your room will be immaculate with fresh flowers, drinks and snacks. You will be able to get advice on where to go and what to see. You will get great restaurant recommendations. Read all the other reviews - they are all true. If we return to Amsterdam, we would stay here.

<Content>Wow this was good We had read the positive reviews before we booked and we weren't disappointed. We stayed 3 nights. Great location for getting around and on a quiet street. Very spacious suite, beautifully decorated and a beautiful bathroom with a clawfoot tub. Our room had a computer with Internet hookup which was useful to have. When we arrived back from a day of sightseeing, Sharmila and Alex had left us a bottle of champagne to enjoy. Sharmila's breakfast is incredible - crepes, meats, cheeses, fruit salad, yogurt, breads and croissants, cereal and she offered to make eggs! Fresh flowers everywhere including our room and bathroom. Sharmila really goes above and beyond in terms of caring for her guests and she has an eye for detail. She gave us great restaurant recommendations. We had to leave at 5:00 a.m. to catch our flight home and she was up to ensure our taxi arrived (which it didn't and she followed up).

<Content>Worth Going to Amsterdam Just For This Hotel Every positive review of this hotel is justified because this little gem of hospitality is unparalleled in Amsterdam and is definitely one of the best hotels in Europe.The property is a charming Dutch mansion, similar to many you'll see in postcards, or movies. Located centrally (I mean, REALLY centrally), this hotel is a great base of operations for any excursion you want to take while in Amsterdam. World-class shopping is two blocks away, Amsterdam's biggest park is accross the street and you are really in one of the best neighborhoods in town. Food? Great, eclectic restaurants abound. Just ask your hosts, Alex and Sharmila, who as a couple, operate this hotel as if you were visiting them at their home. You will be spoiled rotten by these two, who are just about the nicest, most accommodating people you'll meet. The property only has 4-5 rooms, and given their surging popularity, you'll need to book early. But the price is reasonable, even cheap, for what you get. Aside from attentive, personalized service from the aforementioned couple who seem to really enjoy hospitality, you'll get a big room by any standards (especially Europe), tall ceilings, a bigger bathroom than some Ritz-Carlton/Four Seasons properties, Old-World claw-foot tubs, mini bar, Wi-Fi, desktop computer, plasma TV, great phone rates, safe, big closet, fresh flowers every day, and a welcome bottle of champagne. Also included is an ample breakfast prepared fresh every morning and consisting of cereals, pastries, yogurts, fruit salads, cold cuts, cheeses, various coffees (you have to try the cappuccino) and eggs. If you are lucky, Sharmila may make you the pooftwaffles (I am sure this is not what they are called), which are dollar-sized pancakes, laced with Grand Marnier and powdered sugar. Worth the calories.My wife and I have stayed there three times already, the last time for seven days. It felt like a second home to us and we felt like our hosts put a lot of personal effort into making sure that we were comfortable. We will be back, but in the interim, the least we can do is spread the word. Sid and Yesenia

<Content>Great place, great staff! I stayed here for 2 nights on my way to Italy with another guy friend. It was a very pleasant place to stay and the greeting upon arrival was very appealing. They accomodated the request of another bed in the room right away. The room was clean and beautiful in its old charm with updates. Alex was an excellent host and great cook. I will stay there again next time I'm in Amsterdam. The location is great, an easy walk to almost anything.

<Content>Excellent Hotel, Lovely Hosts We have just returned from a fantastic weekend in Amsterdam, staying at the Fusion Suites, Number 40. Although I have read previous reviews nothing prepares you for the complete 'Wow' factor when you first go into your room (We had Room No 1). Our room was massive, tastefully decorated with many personal touches that you just wouldn't get in your standard chain hotels. There were fresh flowers not only in the room but also in the bathroom. The owners Alex and Sharmila are really friendly and you feel more like you are stopping with friends than in a hotel. They are very helpful and are more than happy to explain where to go in Amsterdam, which for us really helped as we were only there for a short time. Sharmila's breakfast's are out of this world with everything you can wish for there on the table! I would say that this is the best hotel/BB I have stayed at anywhere in the world and we have already booked to stay there again next year. To sum up if you want somewhere special with real attention to detail and a friendly atmosphere then this is the place.

<Content>Wonderful hotel and hosts! We stayed at Fusion Suites 40 for 3 nights in March 2008, in a 'classic suite' and had the most wonderful experience. Shamila and Alex are charming and friendly hosts. They're so helpful and will assist you with whatever wishes you may have. The hotel is decorated in a modern and elegant fashion. Our room (suite 2) was very big and furnished to a high standard, complete with DVD player, flat screen TV and a computer with free internet access. The personal touches are also worth mentioning. There were no less than 3 vases with roses in our room and bathroom and we were given a bottle of champagne on the house (for stays of 3 nights and longer). Because this hotel has only 4 rooms, you very much feel like you are staying with friends! The location is perfect. Close to the city centre, but far enough from bars and pubs as to not be disturbed by noise.Shamila prepares the most amazing breakfast every morning, at the time of your choice.You cannot fault this hotel. It's pricey, but worth every Euro. We'll be back!

<Content>Amazing - A perfect place to stay!!! IF ONLY EVERY COUNTRY HAD A FUSION SUITES NUMBER 40!!! Everything is perfect from the beautifully decorated suites to the delicious breakfast served fresh each morning. We come from NYC so our expectations for hotels is extremely high and Fusion Suites lived up to it in every way. The neighborhood is gorgeous and is situated just far enough away from the center of the city to get away from the hustle and bustle at the end of the night but close enough to be in walking distance of everything. I still miss the breakfast each morning and the baths taken each night. This hotel (although I would consider it a high end bed  breakfast) exudes luxury.

<Content>not a hotel... The good part is the location, new rooms and relatively freindly stuff.But, there are too many buts for this hotel:1. Rooms are very very small, even though I order the executive rooms2. It is a butique hotel. it means you will wait for breakfast, sometimes wait outside till someone will come to the reception and open the door, etc.3. When we checked in, there was a half empty bottle of water in the mini bar (!!)4. When we checked out, I asked to pay in 3 payments (trust me, with the bill you will need it ;-)). they said ok, i signed 3 times, and when i got back home i saw that all payments were taken immedately... G. when i called they say there is no policy of payments....Too much money for this hotel.This review is the subjective opinion

<Content>Lovely small hotel, charming hosts We stayed here as a family for three nights in mid February 2008 and took two rooms - a grand suite and a classic suite. The property is a beautiful tall building in a quiet part of the museum quarter of Amsterdam. Rooms are large and comfortable with computers and free internet access. Sharmila and Alex (the owners) are very gracious and charming hosts.It is an easy walk to the centre of Amsterdam from this property so an ideal position to visit all the sights. Anne Frank's house is very moving to visit and certainly should be seen. We booked tickets online before we went and saved ourselves a considerable wait in the queue.Breakfast is taken in the large kitchen on the ground floor of the house and Sharmila is on hand to whip you up any kind of eggs you like, along with assorted delicious pastries, pancakes, fruit salad, cold meat and cheese - a feast!A nice touch was being able to help ourselves to drinks from the mini bar (as we were staying for three nights) and the complimentary bottle of bubbly that was left for us on our last night. Also when we left the children were given some lovely china ornaments as a memento of their visit.

<Content>Perfect weekend break This is a perfect place to stay for a weekend away. Alex and Sharmila were amazing hosts providing a lovely relaxed atomsphere, a fantastic breakfast and amazing serivce. They kindly organised two great places for dinner on each night and gave good recommendations about places to visit. Our room was beautiful and had everything we needed including a computer that gave access to the internet which was really useful. Our flight didn't leave until 9.00pm and we were able to keep the room until we left at 6.00pm.We found this place on tripadvisor and were not disappointed this place was great.....believe all the good reviews

<Content>Home from Home As many couples and travellers have mentioned before us, The Fusion Suites are out of this world.Upon arrival Alex meet us, and showed us to our Suite (3), 5 mins later he brought our bags to our room and then proceeded to show us around, everything was perfect from the fresh flowers to the beautiful decor. Then to our utter surprise he brought us a bottle (standard size, NOT small size) of very good qualilty champagne, the perfect start to a romantic birthday present for my future wife.Our stay was wonderful, nothing was too much trouble for our hosts, and as many have said before us, the breakfasts are outstanding.How anyone can find fault with the Fusion Suites is beyond us, my partner and I have stayed in many hotels through out the world both on pleasure on on business, as we both travel a great deal. This hotel rates in our top 10, are very close second to our number 1. which would have to be Azulik on the Yucutan Peninsular in Mexico.Thank you Fusion for a wonderful time xxP.S If anyone reads this that is into Jazz, you really must go to Cafe Alto in the Leidseplein, the web address is www.jazz-cafe-alto.nl. The place is buzzing with great people and outstanding music!

<Content>Awesome Stay This is one AWESOME place to stay in Amsterdam. You can have all the big hotels you want when it comes to us we like these type places. Yes its more like being in someone's house than in a regular hotel but that is its charm. My girlfriend and I loved it. The hotel is very charming as she said. I like the comfortable beds and good hot showers. Also we liked the location.We would surely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a more intimate experience in Amsterdam. They have a wonderful breakfast to start the day and the owners will attend to every need. They were like very helpful with info on the city and all the museums. They also helped us use the trams and busses to get around and that made up for the cost of the room. The cost is a little more than we usually spend on a hotel but it was well worth it/

<Content>perfect in every way My husband and I stayed here just after Christmas. We had a wonderful time. This hotel is just fabulous. From the moment we arrived to when we left Alex and Shamilla could not have done more to make are stay as pleasant as possible. The rooms are large and beautifully decorated. I never thought that the walls were paper thin, we never heard anything. Breakfast as everyone says is just delicious and so much choice.Alex and Shamilla are so willing to give advice and directions and booked us a super restaurant called Bickens.If you are visiting Amsterdam for the first time this is a great place to stay as you are close to all the Museums, trams and nightlife.We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

<Content>Not what I expected I too, as other have done, have to stress that this is not a Hotel but someone's house and the floors are paper thin and you can hear every footstep which kept me awake both nights. The room was lovely but I have stayed in better for the same money and our bathroom was tired and worn (the shower door was even cracked). Alex and Sharmila were lovely and very helpful but after we got charged for the bottle of champagne we were told in our room was for our wedding anniversary I left very disappointed. I emailed them afterwards to explain that we thought the bottle was complementary but I didn't get a reply. This review is not 'sour grapes' but an honest point of view for others who might feel the same way I do.

<Content>PERFECT- STAY HERE IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT! I cannot say too much more than all of the other RAVE reviews on this site. I will add that this place really is #1 for a reason. It is an experiential place to stay, and you are truly right in the middle of everything that you could possibly want to do.I took a tour of Europe staying at lots of 5 star hotels, and I will add that this place took the prize. You WILL NOT find a better place to stay. Go here and enjoy, I had the time of my life.

<Content>Fantastic We stayed at Fusion Suites for 3 nights over New Year. I can honestly say that without a doubt, this is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in! We have travelled quite a bit and stayed in some fantastic hotels across the world but I have never come across any thing quite like this.We stayed in room number 1. ( Grand Suite ) The room was decorated very luxuriously with a fabulous four poster bed. The attention to detail was unbelievable! The room had tea and coffee making facilities, free mini bar and free internet access. On our second night we came back to a complimentary bottle of champagne... a lovely touch! ( The fresh flowers throughout the rooms were beautiful also)As for the breakfasts... what can I say! I dont think any hotel could ever compete with these. The breakfasts consisted of a wide selection of foods and if by any chance there was nothing there that you wanted, Sharmila was more than happy to cook you something else. The pancakes were unbelievable. Id go back to Fusion Suites just for those!!The location was perfect also. Right by the museums with just a short walk to Dam Square. I really cannot say anything negative about Fusion Suites and would recommend this place to anyone. Unless you are the type of person who would pick faults in anything and everything, I will guarantee that this will be one of the best, if not the best hotel you have stayed in.I will definitely be going back!I would just like to thank Alex and Sharmila again for a making our stay in Amsterdam the most memorable one and we look forward to seeing you again soon.

<Content>Wonderful B Stayed for 5 nights at the Fusion Suites and had a wonderful time. The facilities are fantastic - the bed comfortable, lots of space. The bathroom had a separate whirlpool tub and a rainforest showehead which I really loved. The computer in the room was wonderful (free internet is such a rarity) and the free drinks in the minibar was great. The location was pretty good and everything in fairly easy walking distance. If you want to go to the major museums this place is extremely convenient!The breakfasts were fantastic and the hosts will cook you anything you want. I miss the pancakes/crepes even now as I am writing this review. I found the owners - husband and wife - to be super helpful. They were willing to look up restaurant reviews in Dutch on the internet so you could get the real scoop on a restaurant you heard about. They would make reservations or help you navigate any number of places. While the price may look a little steeper when you first look at the website you should realize that the price includes everything - breakfast, tax, internet, mini-bar so the value is fantastic.If you insist on having room service at 3 in the morning or want the big hotel experience don't stay here. If you are bothered by having to share one large table in the kitchen with guests from one of the other 3 rooms don't stay here. If on the other hand you like meeting new people from around the world breakfast is a lot of fun. I recommend this place without hesitation. I stay in some of the top hotels in the world on business and on a personal trip really loved the Fusion Suites. So far this will be the top place I have reviewed!

<Content>This place is fantastic!! This place is better than a hotel, its expensive but what isn't if you want to stay somewhere nice! The design of the whole place is beautiful, the hosts are friendly and helpful. The location is great, away from all the noise but still only a 5minute walk from the centre of town. Vondel Park is across the road, and you can take a tram everywhere. Stay here, stop looking!

<Content>Not a hotel The rooms are big and nicely decorated, and this is a different experience than the typical hotel. Sharmila and her husband had great recommendations for a reastaurant the first night (Chang - i, I believe), all in all they were extremely helpful. When reading the reviews here on this page I think it must be stressed that the Fusion Suites is not a hotel, it is rooms let out in someones home. The walls between our room and the next were paperthin, and personally I think I prefer to stay in larger hotels. We had breakfast in the kitchen, a breakfast that was very nice, but it felt akward to sit in someones kitchen, and also the room wasnt very big, so we would have had to share the table with other guests if they came down at the same time. Also I think the rooms were a bit pricey, considering it is more a luxurious hostel than a hotel.

<Content>FusionHeaven What makes this a fantastic place to stay is the warmth and genuineness of the hosts. Nothing is too much trouble. Sharmilla deserves special mention. We had been on the road and wanted a close by good meal. She discussed the alternatives, made the booking. Always thinking about thier guests. Subject to budget go for the suites they are fab and are worth it. Also the minibar. i.e non- alcoholic drinks are free and the wireless system works well. The breakfast is a highlight, food is great, conversation is simulating and there is something to be said for sitting in the kitchen of a HOME having a cup of tea or coffee having your food cooked to order.

<Content>Loved it - couldnt have been better what a great place - Sharmila and Alex couldn't have been more helpful and accomodating, from lending us a map, to booking restaurants and helping us get to the start for the marathon (and putting champagne in the room to celebrate after!). in a great location with lovely shops and restaurants nearby.

<Content>Home away from Home If you are tired of another same old hotel room then this is the place to stay. The breakfast was worth the stay by itself, it is convient to all attractions and a great base to explore this beautiful city. I don't normally rate hotels but felt that fellow travelers need to know about Fusion Suites 40.

<Content>Charming Stay in Amsterdam Our stay with Sharmila and Alex was absolutely lovely. The room was beautiful and quite comfortable. The bathroom was absolutely fantastic. Great care was taken with the decorating of the entire hotel. And many needs were anticipated. Breakfasts were wonderful and plentiful. And our hosts could not have been more charming. They made my birthday special and added even more to our memories of Amsterdam.I cannot wait to return.

<Content>Incomparable Hospitality I booked the Grand Suite (or at least I think thats what its called), for my wedding proposal on Mar. of this year. I contacted the owners (Sharmila and Alex) directly and informed them that I was planning to propose while staying there. Everything was absolutely perfect in this amazing hotel. The room was beautiful, everything I had expected from the pictures and much more. It was filled with roses and beautifully decorated. I has asked Sharmila if it was possible to order an in-room dinner during the night of our stay - to my surprise she offered to cook the dinner herself (for a very reasonable price). The food was exquisite and very tasty! The morning breakfast was also great and a nice intimate room that feels like that eating at home. To summarize, my experince in this hotel was perfect - the hospitality, the rooms, the food were absolutely the best ever. Thanks for everything Sharmila and Alex!

<Content>We LOVE Fusion Suites Number 40! We can't say enough about our wonderful stay at Fusion Suites! Alex and Sharmila were gracious, friendly and very accomidating hosts. They took whatever steps necessary to help us feel comfortable during our stay, from recommending restaurants in the area to providing maps for our travels. Sharmila's breakfast, located in the cozy, flower-filled kitchen, was absolutely delicious!!!The room in which we stayed was tastefully decorated. The bed was very very comfy, and the bathroom spacious. Internet access was available from the computer in the room. How mcuh more convenient can you get?!?!The location of Fusion Suites was perfect. It's located only a short walk from the downtown area, the Museumplein, Vondelpark, and the shopping district.In all, we would definitely stay at Fusions again. In fact, we're looking forward to it!

<Content>Fantastic, relaxing stay We have just come back from a fantastic long weekend break at the Fusion Suites and cannot rate this beautiful, relaxing, classy, boutique hotel more highly. Alex and Shamila welcome you into a peaceful and homely setting and offer a flexibility of service that you won't find anywhere else. Our room was simply stunning and a great size. Breakfast was a cosy affair in the kitchen and served in a welcoming, unobtrusive manner. Both check-in and check-out were based around our times and there was no hint that we may be inconveniencing anyone by leaving at 5p.m.The hotel's location is superbly set, near to the Van Gogh museum and two roads down from the shopping street in Amsterdam. If you a hire a bike from the many bike hire shops around the city a long weekend is certainly enough time to take in the many sites and sounds of such a diverse and cultural place. We would highly recommend a stay in this hotel in order to set you up for a fantastic exploration around such a beautiful city; a trip to the Fusion Suites and Amsterdam is a must!

<Content>Absolutely Brilliant Just returned from a short stay at Fusion Suite Number 40. Alex and Sharmila are perfect hosts and made our stay something special. The room was beautiful and the Sabon fragrance so wonderful I took some home! I would definately recommend it to anyone looking for something different from the general run of the mill hotel.

<Content>Beautiful place, perfect location We stayed at Fusion Suites for 7 nights (just came back 2 days ago) with our 2 kids (10 and 8 yrs. old) on our stop in Amsterdam after traveling around Scandinavia. Alex and Sharmila run a beautiful place, perfectly located, just minutes from the Vondelpark and the main museaums in the city. We got the Grand Suite and were gladly surprised to see the size of the room (big, comfortable and nicely furnished). Breakfast was served in the kitchen (so cozy) according to our schedule in the morning (we started at 8:30am and then changed it to 9:30am, afterall, we're on vacation) and the food was yummy: fresh fruit salad, fresly squeezed orange juice, homemade pancakes, organic yogurt, eggs, assortment of breads, cheese, cold cuts. The kids loved the pancakes, thin and tasty.Their recommendations on restaurants was very good (nice Indonesian, Thai, fish, etc.) and Sharmila even made the effort to find us a babysitter for an evening out. And AnnMarie (babysitter) was very nice and she even spoke Spanish! So the kids were happy.We always try to avoid the big chain hotels and prefer to stay at boutique hotels, it makes the experience more personal and private. And definitely Fusion Suites was the perfect place to stay in Amsterdam. So we highly recommend it and wish you will appreciate it as much as we did.

<Content>Perfection After reading all the positive comments I suppose we were sceptical about how this place would live up to expectations. The reality was perfection at every level.Alex and Sharmila are perfect hosts and made our anniversary stay something special. Our suite was simply gorgeous with lots of room and a spa bath. The rooms are part of a private house and breakfast was a real treat, served in the kitchen with Sharmila cooking eggs to order to compliment the huge array of cold meats etc.Location is great. On a quiet street walking distance to the Leidesplein which although a real tourist trap is the heart of the city. The Reiksmuseum is just round the quarter as is the classy shopping street. We had no qualms about parking on the street outside the hotel although there is secure parking a short distance away.We ate at Bichen on Alex's guidance and this modern bistro just round the corner offered a fantastic range of meat and fish and was tourist free zone full of locals.Staying at The Fusion Suites was a unique experience and we will definitely return.

<Content>Simply brilliant! Sadly a one night stay experience. Best hotel in Amsterdam although calling it a hotel is short selling Fusion Suites. Agree with all previous reviews. The rooms are brilliant and the Sabon room fragrance super. Hosts were delightful. Surely to be repeated for a longer stay. Not for typical hazy Amsterdam weekend trips. Brilliant location.

<Content>Perfect romantic getaway Stayed for just 2 nights, 31/05/07 - 02/06/07 for our first wedding anniversery. The location could'nt have been better. Just 5 mins away from the hustle  bustle from the busy square, were there are lots of outside cafes  bars. Enter the street where Fusion Suites is located  it is a beautiful tree lined quiet street. Vondel park two mins away.Great place to stay as all transport links are so easily assessible, meaning you get to see lots in a short space of time.The suites where beautiful, very clean,  loveingly maintained by the owners, who truly could'nt be more welcoming  helpful.We had a wonderful time  would love to return.

<Content>Heaven on Earth All the reasons to choose a Bed  Breakfast. Just arrived back from a weekend break in Amsterdam and had booked Fusion Suites as a treat for my wife for her birthday and our annivesary. Belive me she was on cloud 9. Better than a 5-star hotel is what sums up the beautiful Fusion Suites in Amsterdam! We loved everything about it 鈥?from the wonderful, freshly-cooked breakfasts to the fabulous suites, the location and the ever-so-charming hosts, Sharmila and Alex. They made our stay very special and made us feel so very welcome鈥ould recommend anyone visiting Amsterdam to stay with them...miss most the yummy pancakes every morning! If in amsterdam do yourself a favour and stay at fusion suites - you will not be disappointed. Thank you so much Sharmila and Alex for making our weekend extra extra special.Dharmesh  Mili

<Content>A luxury experience This is a luxury experience that makes you feel at home, but home could never be like this. Breakfast is a cornocopia served by Alex with the relaxed hospitality that seems to be the natural disposition of everyone in this easy going city of cyclists. If you want the perfect dinner to match this experience try to make a reservation at Van Vlaanderen telephone 020 622 8292 where food and hospitality merge so seemlessly to create an experience that is a taste of heaven.

<Content>Great time at the Fusion Suites We stayed at the grand suite over the May bank holiday, and had an absolutely wonderful time. The room was really big and comfortable, plus beautifully done up. More importantly our hosts, Sharmila and Alex were very friendly. We felt more like staying with friends at home rather than being in a posh hotel (which it certainly was). We had very good home cooked breakfast by Sharmila, and what a spread it was too. The room was so nice that we almost had to tear ourselves away from it every day, having to remind ourselves that we were there to see Amsterdam. And the location of Fusion Suites was extremely convenient, practically walking distance to every attraction in the city.Would we go back to Fusion Suites? Most definitely!!!

<Content>A truly special wonderful place - a real gem and a great price to add We stayed at the Fusion Suites for 6 days in May. I read the reviews on Tripadvisor and immediately booked with them. We had a wonderful experience from the moment we arrived until the time we left. It really is everything the other reviews have said. Our room was beautiful, clean and larger than any European hotel room I鈥檝e ever stayed in. We stayed in one of the Grand Suites and had more space than we knew what to do with. Bed was super comfortable with a special type of mattress 鈥?not a Tempurpedic but even more confortable. Linens were great 鈥?all toiletries were provided (L鈥橭ccitane). It鈥檚 the little touches that made our stay wonderful. Fresh flowers in the room. Beautiful furniture and wall furnishings. A wonderful breakfast in their beautiful kitchen every morning 鈥?delicious with variety and fresh fresh everything. (I still think about the wonderful breakfasts!) The room had a desktop computer and fax but we never used it. I had my laptop and it was wonderful using the wireless connection as an alternative. The location is in my opinion perfect 鈥?close to the museums, walking distance to everything else including Anne Frank House. It is in a very nice part of town and the street it is on is picture perfect. The only time we needed a taxi was when we arrived and left. Many trams are close by if one feels the need. Sharmila and Alex were wonderful and helped us with any questions that we had. I would absolutely stay there again the next time I am in Amsterdam.

<Content>Perfection Sharmila and Alex are wonderful hosts. We truly felt like guests in their home during our stay the second week of May. The room was immaculate, comfortable and very spacious. I do a lot of homework before booking accomodations for our trips. Believe me, we were not disappointed with this choice. The Suites are in a very nice neighborhood and Amsterdam is very walkable. There is a little Italian restaurant within a 3 minute walk of the Suites which Sharmila recommended. We loved it. Do yourself a favor and stay here. You will not regret it.

<Content>perfect i absolutely loved this place ... it really is the best of all worlds ... great furnishings (you would have them in your home) ... great food (abundance of) ... great company, insight ... and you get all this while being able to maintain a tremendous amount of privacy ... the owners couldn't do enough for us ... recommended and made reservation in a restaurant (they gave local opinion of highly rated zagat restaurant - not worth it) ... organized airport runs ... best yet ... they greeted us at the door ... you must be xyz ... my favorite stays in the world are five star boutique hotels ... this was better ...

<Content>If only all hotels were like Fusion Suites Just come back from a truly wonderful long weekend in Amsterdam. What an amazing city! We spent the whole trip wandering and cycling around in the beautiful spring sunshine. It was bliss. Our trip was made absolutely perfect by our stay at Fusion Suites40. We booked the hotel based on the fantastic reviews on this site, and all we can do is echo what's already been said. Our room was huge, and beautifully decorated, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Sharmila and Alex, who own the hotel, were helpful and charming and did everything they could to help us. Breakfast was a real treat every morning, with something different on the menu every day. And Sharmila even presented us with a perfectly chilled bottle of champagne to complete the hotel's thoughtful hospitality. It was a really great place and we'd go back in a second. Many thanks to other Tripadvisor reviewers for their recommendation.

<Content>This hotel is immaculate We chose this hotel because of the reviews on TripAdvisor, hoping for the best. We had never been to Amsterdam before, although we have travelled throughout much of Europe staying at 5 star hotels. Well, we got much more than we could have ever hoped for! The hotel is immaculate, quiet, with friendly and accommodating staff. We booked 2 rooms, each very spacious and immaculately clean. The double pane windows kept out the street noise, and afforded a view into the garden or nearby neighborhood. There is free internet access in each room. L'Occitane amenities (my husband's favorites), and a bed....oh the bed!We highly recommend this bed and breakfast retreat and hope you enjoy it as much as we did. I guess when you think that something sounds too good to be true...well, it is.

<Content>Fabulous, family-run hotel Stayed for three nights. Wonderful hotel, with only four rooms. Each room is immaculate, with no expense spared on the quality of the decorations. My bed was so comfortable I had a really hard time dragging myself out to go to work!The d茅cor is very traditional, but everything is brand new. I'm assuming the hotel has been very recently renovated, which must have cost a fortune. My bathroom was all black and white marble tiles, and a reproduction roll-top bath. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to try it out.Facilities in the room include wireless Internet, and my room actually had a PC in it. I think the other rooms do too. By the way, my room was huge for a European hotel. It was as large as a typical US King Size room. The windows have secondary double glazing, so even though my room overlooked a fairly busy side street, I didn't notice any noise.My bathroom was a separate room, which was also huge. All of the fittings were top quality. The shower pressure wasn't great, but to be honest it wasn't much worse than other European hotels. I've certainly had worse in Hiltons and Sheratons - especially in London!Individual coffee machine in the room. Not just a kettle and instant coffee, but a cartridge style espresso machine. Amazing! There was a safe in the wardrobe for your valuables, plus hair dryer, iron, and various other odds and ends. They also provided a pair of slippers!On my floor there were only two rooms, and there was a small, shared kitchen between the two with a fridge, microwave, and sink. I didn't check if there were plates and silverware, but there may well have been. I'm sure the owners would provide some anyway. Might be useful if you're staying for a long time and get fed up of restaurant food.Breakfast is around a single, large table (remember only 4 rooms), and you can make requests for specific meals (within reason) if you ask ahead. Endless coffee, and freshly squeezed orange juice. I suppose you might not feel completely comfortable if you're the shy, retiring type. But we actually stayed there as a group and took all 4 rooms anyway. Think of it as a great way to meet new people!By the way, I don't know if they provide any meal other than breakfast. You can always ask I suppose, but we found dozens of great restaurants were only 5-10 minutes walk away. Check out the Solo restaurant near the concert hall, for example.The location is reasonably central, I don't know Amsterdam that well, but it was an easy 10 minute walk to the concert hall square, for example. When you're there, check out the houses down the street that are each modelled after a particular country style (Spain, Russia, etc.) it's cute.The staff are very friendly and really can't do enough for you. Very attentive. Like most Dutch people they speak perfect English, and probably speak half a dozen other languages too.If you're fed up of faceless, chain hotels and want to try out something a bit more personal, this hotel is highly recommended. In fact, even if you're not fed up of chain hotels, stay there anyway because this is a true quality hotel experience! I will definitely be staying there again next time I go to Holland.Cheers,Geoff

<Content>Don't Miss this gorgeous hotel From the moment we arrived on May 1st to a warm welcome from Alex and Sharmila right up to our departure the Fusion Suites was a totally relaxing and happy experience.Breakfast - or rather break FEAST - which is taken in their spotlessly clean and sparkling kitchen,was beyond delicious with a wide selection of cereals, meats, cheeses, fruits and juices together with a variety of teas and coffees all freshly made before your eyes whlist you sit round the table and chat with other guests or Alex and Sharmila.Our room (#1) - again absolutely spotless - was decorated in understated opulence and contained the worlds most comfortable bed. The L'Occitaine toiletries were a blissful treat for the senses and if that were not enough the fresh flowers in the room ( we had delphiniums and peonies) made it just perfect to 'come home to' at the end of a hard days sight seeing.Both Alex and Sharmila are a fund of information and endlessly charming and helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them to help make their guests stay as perfect as possible.In a city noted for its gem trade, this place is a diamond!

<Content>A relaxing, luxurious stay I just came back from 6 nights stay at this lovely boutique hotel in Amsterdam. Sharmila and Alex were so hospitable -- they anticipated all my needs and made my stay in Amsterdam truly relaxing and made me feel completely pampered!This property is located within minutes of fabulous shopping, museums, music venues, and, if you feel like it, the entertainment area of Leidseplein. Sharmila and Alex were truly lovely, everything was perfect about my beautiful room (decorated in absolute perfect taste), and I will definitely miss Sharmila's breakfasts in the morning!

<Content>My home in Amsterdam My work takes me to Amsterdam twice a year for the last few years. I stay 2-4 weeks, therefore it is very important for me to stay in a place where I will feel like home. I am fortunate to discover the Fusion suites (formerly 鈥渘umber 40鈥?. I just cannot say enough about the wonderful atmosphere, beautifully decorated rooms and the WARM hospitality of the owners Sharmila and Alex of the Fusion suites. It is a gem located close to the museum district, the Vondel Park and the most popular shopping street PC Hooftstrasse. It is a 5min walks from the Leidsaplane where there are many good restaurants and tram routes available. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious, spotlessly clean and individually decorated. Every room has a huge bed with the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on, comfortable sitting area with a comfy sofa and chair, study desk with your own computer and the internet access/fax machine, TV, CD/DVD player and a coffee machine to make you feel at home. The breakfast is provided in the warm atmosphere of the beautifully decorated kitchen. Sharmila makes sure you have everything you need for the breakfast; baked goods, meats, cheeses, yogurts, eggs, cereals, fresh fruits and morning beverages. At Fusion suites I feel like home and with Sharmila and Alex, I truly feel like I am visiting friends. Fusion suites was the best kept secret in Amsterdam, but I guess not anymore :-). I highly recommend it.

<Content>HIghly recommended... We have just returned from a 4 night Easter break at Fusion Suites No.40. From the moment we contacted the owners via email, we were made to feel very welcome and were already looking forward to our stay. The location is perfect, less than 5 mins from Museumplein and on the edge of Vondelpark. Our room was one of the Grand Suites on the top floor, very tastefully decorated and furnished, and had a new bathroom including a jacuzzi bath  huge rainshower. Sharmila  Alex welcomed us with a chilled bottle of champagne, just the way to start any holiday!Breakfast was perfect and as well as lovely pastries, meats  cheeses, there was something a little special on offer every morning.We would definitely recommend  urge any of our friends to stay here. As an example of the owner's thoughtfulness, when we checked out and left our luggage for safe keeping, we said to take care with a half bottle of wine we were saving for our long wait at the airport. When we arrived back later that day to to collect our luggage, we were given a couple of plastic wineglasses. That's the sort of personal touch that makes Fusion Suites unique.We had a great stay in Amsterdam (first visit for me) and walked and walked, the best way of seeing this beautiful city. Although the canal bus is pretty good too and very relaxing. [I would recommend buying a day pass which is valid until 12 midday the following day; also prebook your ticket for the Anne Frank museum if that's on your list as you can avoid the long queues - good places for both of these is at the information booth on Leidesplein only 5 mins from the hotel].In summary - great location, great house  great owners.
