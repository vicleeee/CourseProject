<Content>It doesn't get any better! Stayed 2 nights here on my first ever trip to New Orleans and it was fabulous! From the second we walked through the door, the staff outdid themselves. Our room was great, clean, comfy, just perfect. I think they were having a problem with the a.c. while we were there because we got a call from the front desk asking if we were cool enough and letting us know they were working on it. We even had them take photos of us in the hotel lobby before we went out for the evening and we got some great restaurant recommendations also. And they called a cab for us both nights we were there. The location couldn't be any better for the french quarter. Unfortunately, we never made it downstairs for breakfast in time (we stayed out pretty late and couldn't wake up that early!) We did use the free internet though and that worked fine. I will definitely stay here again the next time I visit N.O.

<Content>Hello Miss Ireen, how can I help you? This was an incredible experience. I'm a frequent traveller, not extremely demanding, but as I travel on my own,I like some personal contact, when I arrive in a hotel. This was it ! Upon arrival, coming from an exhausting sailing course in Key West, I was asked by the frontdesk, if I would like a free upgrade. I got a nice room with queensize bed, kitchenette and living room with a second tv. All that for not 100USD a night. Next morning, I was welcomed by Stanley Mascair, general manager at the frontdesk, with a nice : 'Goodmorning Miss Ireen, how can I help you?' I told him, I didn't come to New Orleans to only see the French Quarter, I wanted also to see the areas hit by Katharina. One of his helps hurried to get me a brochure and helped me make a good choice. I saw the 9th ward, in a small bus , with an excellent guide. I was knocked off my socks by the scale of the devastation and the grim future of the ones who lived here. But I'm glad I saw it with my own eyes. When I returned to the hotel, I was asked again, how it was, if they could do anything for me. I told about my big bag of laundry. No problem,we can take care of it or there is a washer and dryer on the sixth floor. For no money, I had all my laundy clean and dry.. Never forget Mr Baba, who came by as I was at the washer. I asked for a basket or big plastic bag. No worry, Baba will take care of that. He came back with two giant bags. I had no change, to give him a tip. He said: No worry, Baba is here to help you.Isn't this really nice! I was enchanted. This has become so rare in our world of chain hotels, where no one really cares.I told Mr Mascair about my satisfaction. He is in this business for ages and his aim is to tell everyone working for him, how inportant it is to make a guest feel at home. He and his staff gets from me a ***** ! If you travel to New Orleans, get there. It's only one block from Canal Street and the Streetcar. It's a quiet and friendly oasis!Highly recommended!

<Content>Perfect stay for a work trip Dear potential Customers,I stayed at the Quality Inn and Suites Downtown New Orleans for 5 days in November 2008, and my experience was satisfactory. The place is convenient located to most of New Orleans attractions and businesses. It is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. Provided breakfast was abundant and nice, even though the choice was limited.I stayed in a queen room, which had a little kitchen corner (fridge, microwave, sink, and coffee machine). Far from allowing you proper cooking the kitchen corner comes handy for late/early breakfasts and those meals when you cannot be bothered with going to a restaurant (plenty of food stores open 24 hrs in the area). The separate living space in the room (sofa, armchair, coffee table and extra television) made the accommodation suitable for long working stays, which become uncomfortable in a pocky room.Finally, the main criticism: the price. I was charged $190 per night, excluding taxes, service charges, etc. It is frankly too much for the service that they provide, but if your company pays.......

<Content>Great hotel near the French Quarter Very professional, friendly and helpful staff in this clean, all-comfort hotel. Had a great 5-day stay here and can recommend this hotel without hesitation. Although the downtown area is quiet at night, you're just 1 minute walk from Canal street which is always busy, and 5 minutes from the west side of Bourbon street in the French Quarter. Modern hotel with all the amenities though nothing very New Orleans about it. Not the best option if you're looking for local charm but otherwise excellent.

<Content>Fantastic Perfectly located on a quiet street in the Financial and within very short walking distance of ALL the sites of this charming city. GREAT customer service (Stanley at reception particularly excellent). Free internet and immaculate rooms sealed the deal. Only downside is the complimetary breakfast which was not great but this was a minor point. would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Experience and a Bargain, Too We stayed at the Quality Inn for 3 nights and it was excellent in every way! The reviews we read on TripAdvisor were accurate. Our room on the 3rd floor was nice and a good value for the price. The location was perfect - 2 blocks from the French Quarter and the streetcar line.The General Manager, Stanley Mascair, and Janell at the front desk, took care of us personally with info. about the city and recommendations and maps for sightseeing.The breakfast is very good and was more than just continental. There were eggs, sausage and grits in addition to the usual waffles, cereal, fruit, etc.

<Content>Big Easy Weekend What a great weekend. My wife and i met my cousin and his wife here for the weekend. When we arrived the was a nice gentleman that helped us with our luggage and where and how to park. When checking in at the front, what a wonderful experience, from the General Manager. His name is Mr Stanley. He was very helpful and knowledgable. Every time we came back to the hotel or down from our room, he made the point to call me by name and say hello. I dont know how he does it . We are looking forward to another long weekend in New Orleans, and we will be staying here again, it is like staying with family. Thanks again Mr Stanley, you and your staff are truly remarkable in this day and age of little or no customer service, yall are a welcome breath of fresh air.

<Content>Awesome customer service Stayed at the Quality Inn and Suites for a week in September 2008 on business. The customer service at this hotel exceeded any I have received at any other Choice Hotel property (and I have stayed at hundreds). The folks working the front desk are incredibly friendly and helpful. The rooms are nice and well kept. Upon checking in I was immediately upgraded to a suite without asking and at no extra charge. I would definitely stay at this property again and would recommend it to anyone. I paid $89 per night for a room and service that was easily worth double that.

<Content>Extremely accomodating staff July 3-6, 2008 - The staff at this hotel made our stay a warm memory. We booked this hotel just a few days before our stay for a spontaneous trip to the Big Easy. All they had available were smoking rooms but we took it. When we arrived, I mentioned to the night manager that I would have rather have a non-smoking room. Even though the hotel was full he went through room after room until he found a way to rearrange getting us a non-smoking room for the first night. He said to see the day manager the next day for possible switching the other nights. The next am as soon as I gave the manger my name, he told me he was able to work some more switching and we could keep our non-smoking sweet room at the rate of a regular. The staff was amazing - always there with baggage help, driving directions and suggestions for sight seeing, making sure we were aware of the Fourth of July fireworks show at the river, making waffles for the guests at breakfast to saving waiting in line at the waffle maker- anything they could do to be helpful. We had a great stay and i would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Very good quality Vs. price Nice hotel in a nice location. Very close from the town action and from the street car stops.Breakfast was OK, taking into account that was included in the price (we've paid 80$/night).After staying the first night in a room just besides the elevator, on next day we were moved to a more distant room to avoid the elevator's noise. Stanley, as already mentioned, is very helpful and very friendly and the 5th point is entirely for him (otherwise I would have rated as a 4)!We'd definetely go back if we go again to New Orleans.

<Content>Great service!! I was considering relocating to NOLA so I was checking out the housing situation  stayed @ the Quality Inn for almost a week. The manager and staff were truly OUTSTANDING!!I had a king room, which had a kitchen area, consisting of a sink, small refrigerator  plenty of cupboard space. I would probably recommend the suites for 2+ people, because they are definitely larger but for 1 person, this was great! At one point during my stay, the A/C wasn't working properly in my room, and the manager offered to upgrade me to a suite for as long as necessary. The A/C was fixed w/in a few hours and I opted to go back to my room, so I wouldn't have to move all of my stuff. I actually enjoyed my stay here a lot better than some of the bigger name, pricier hotels, such as the Hilton Riverside  Homewood Suites.As for location, you are very close to Bourbon St., Canal St. as well as the street cars that run along Canal St.  St. Charles. The breakfast in the morning is limited but adequate. As someone who spent most of my time out, it was perfect to come back to a place where the staff knew my name  would call me on my cell phone if I needed any dinner or late night recommendations. I would definitely return to this hotel!

<Content>Very nice location - great service staff Obviously, this motel is a great place. I just wanted to add that the front desk folks are the best I've ever encountered. We needed to store our luggage the morning of our check in and it was not a problem whatsoever. Mr. Stanley, as mentioned, is super friendly. The location isn't in a shady area as a previous poster claimed. We felt perfectly safe walking back from the Vampire tour we took in the French Quarter! :)

<Content>Good Value  To contradict the last review, we are in our 60's and never felt unsafe in this area of New Orleans.It's a great location just minutes from the French Quarter and the main stopping place for the Streeet Car to the Garden District.We were lucky to get an upgrade from the very efficient manager (Stanley), he loves the Hornets! and he can also advise on eating places etc.Also all of the staff were effective and friendly and the rooms were very clean.he hotel advertises a Continental Breakfast, it's more than that, Bacon, Eggs, Waffeles, Yoghurt, frest Fruit, orange Coffee, etc. etc. it is very good.Only one slight problem, if the people in the next room have an early shower, you can hear the shower running.

<Content>Superb staff and excellent value! My husband and I arrived in New Orleans on Wednesday 4/23/08 for the first weekend of Jazz Fest. As we drove up to the hotel we became a bit concerned. The hotel is located in the business district and it quiets down after 5pm. We walked in to be greeted by a very warm and helpful staff. Everyone was super helpful in helping us to navigate the city. Once we were settled in, we set out on foot to explore our surroundings. We walked a short distance up to Canal street where we found many shops and things to check out. The hotel is not in the middle of all the action, but for the money, you can't beat it. The walk is not bad at all. The parking deck is (diagonally) across the street. We parked our car and never got back in until time to leave. We were able to walk to the French Quarter and took the street car to the fair grounds. If you plan to spend your time out sight seeing and taking tours, this is a great hotel. However, if you plan to sit in your room and view the action from your hotel room, you will want to go with another hotel. Thanks again to the staff at Quality Inn. You guys are really great!!

<Content>Great hotel, great location! This hotel is a 5 minute walk from the french quarter and a perfect base for exploring the surrouding area on foot. For the price, it is great value considering the location.Staff were very friendly, polite and a pleasure to deal with. The manager on duty was terrific and offered to upgrade us to a suite for no extra charge. He also gave us a discount on the parking fee ($14 a day).Our room was clean, spacious and had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and we had two TVs, a fridge, microwave and a safe. Full cable and wi-fi was also great.Breakfast was great and the staff were so nice that they kept the breakfast area open half an hour longer than usual. It included coffee, juice, cereal, fruit, yoghurt, bagels, grits, eggs and alternated between breakfast burritos or sausage biscuits. The breakfast area is large, clean and bright with a view of the street. We were overall very happy with our stay. For the price, you cant beat it in that area! The great staff, clean rooms and perfect location made our stay in New Orleans a pleasure. We'd stay here again on our next visit.

<Content>Perfectly fine and acceptable I was very pleased with the Quality Inn Downtown. My 17-year old son and I stayed for 2 nights in February while visiting Tulane on a college visit. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the 2 Queen beds room we were in included one private bedroom with a door which gave each us privacy and each of us our own TV. Beyond that the rooms were clean, beds comfortable and the bathroom was fine. We also had a frig, microwave and a safe in an area outside the bathroom located between the two bedrooms. And all of this for just over $100 a night with easy access to the French Quarter and the St. Charles Streetcar. Finally the breakfast they offer has a variety of the usual things including the ubiquitos waffle maker but I enjoyed that they also had scrambled eggs and a couple of other hot things. And the staff was quite friendly and helpful.

<Content>Quiet, nice staff I stayed here over the MLK Holiday and foud the hotel nice, clean, and resonable affordable. I paid around $80 per night over a holiday weekend.The rooms are not large but about meduim size as for hotel rooms. You get a large TV with cable (HBO), a desk, a fridge, and in some rooms a sofa.There is a 24-hour Walgreens one block away, on Canal Street, where you can buy grocieries for the microwave.If you are buying liquor, then you should take the St. Charles streetcar from downtown out to a Rite Aid were you can buy it for 1/2 the price they sell it in Downtown liquor stores and even more cheaper than the price in bars.The free breakfast was not very good. They have a waffle maker but only syrup for topping. Many Choice hotels now serve strawberry toppings, but not this hotel. THey provide microwavable bacon/sausage biscuits that are not tasty at all. But then again, it is free, and since there are so many places to eat in New Orleans at a decent rate it hardly matters.Even though the manager claimed that breakfast usually runs a little longer than than the announced ending time, I noticed that the housekeepers started putting things up exactly on the minute. In fact they were somewhat rude about it. Partly I think this is a result of the people (many from other countries, it seems) who now work in New Orleans hotels because native New Orleaneans have left since Katrina. In the past i am sure staying in the breakfast area after the official time would have been no problem, but things seem to have changed!The desk staff and management were top noch! They all spoke to you when you arrived at the hotel, but were quick about checking you in, and more than glad to help you with directions.The French Quarter is only 2 block from the hotel. For the price you will be happy to have stayed here. You get all the things you need in a comfortable setting. Save your money for the French Quarter by staying here. Plus the staff really act as if they are glad you are there.

<Content>Nice Property, Good Location  Spent three nights at the Quality Inn  Suites for the Sugar Bowl. We loved it and highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to New Orleans. The hotel was in a very convenient location within walking distance to Bourbon Street and the Superdome. Lots of shops and restaurants nearby. I booked this room on Quikbooks for $144/night which was a very good price considering most comparable hotels were full or charging over $230 because of the Sugar Bowl and New Years Eve. The Manager, Stanley was working at the Front Desk when we arrived and gave us an upgrade to a suite. He called me and my wife by our names thereafter; a very nice touch. All the staff was very friendly and helpful.I almost exclusively use Priceline to book my rooms but nothing was available when I began planning this trip. But even after rooms became available on Priceline for ~$100/night for 4* hotels, I decided to stick with this reservation and I'm confident that I made the right choice. The parking was only $17/night and a decent breakfast was included.

<Content>Excellent Stay My wife and I stayed in the hotel for two nights in early October.The general manager Stanley was working the front desk, a really pleasant man and very helpful and a credit to the Quality hotels. We presented him with the Roomsaver discount voucher which he took with no problem. The room was clean,bright and in good condition, better than some we have stayed in. Breakfast was very good, more than adequate. Location very good for city center considering price, a bit iffy at night [cheap cab ride to town]The only slight down side is that the car park is across the road[12 dollars 24 hours] but what the heck your on holiday. All in all great place as long as they stay competitive on price.

<Content>A great deal October 9 and 10 The staff at this hotel cannot be beat! They greeted us as if old friends, upgraded our king room to a suite with no extra cost and were full of information to make our trip more pleasant. Suite was spacious, very clean and quiet. $17 daily parking fee was waived for one day. Continental breakfast was expansive...including scrambled eggs and microwaveable sausage sandwiches....plus the usual cereal, fruit, pastries, etc. Our bill for two days was $220 including taxes and parking.

<Content>Quality for the price Booked thru Hotel.com for a quaranteed low price for 2 nights with free self parking in the next block. Were there to see a preseason football game at the Superdome. Arrived 1/2 hour prior to check in time but was able to check in since the room was ready. Staff were friendly and helpful. Upgraded at no extra cost from a queen to king size room since one was available. Room was on the small size but clean and had plenty of towels, a small microwave and fridge. Within easy 20 minute walk to superdome. Free average continental breakfast.

<Content>Great Quality Stay Very nice hotel located basically two blocks from Bourbon Street. The management and staff at this hotel are of high quality. When I drove up to the front door to register, the manager greeted me to give me the needed instructions on how to proceed. Because of availability I was upgraded to a suite for the same price of a regular room. Best service I've had at a hotel from the time I drove up until it was time to leave in a very long time. Very clean rooms. Very clean hotel.

<Content>Great room, great staff Stayed 1 night, having previously been at the O'Keefe Plaza hotel (almost next door, which was terrible!!)Very friendly staff who all went out of their way to be friendly and helpful, particulary Stanley on front desk who was so nice to us. Even the night-time security man was talkative and helpful.Our room was comfortable and clean, with good beds and bathroom. They had put bottles of mineral water and local made crisps (potato chips) on the beds which was a nice touch.Good location - just 10 minutes to the French Quarter and in a safe neighbourhood. Parking was at a garage across the street which felt quite secure. Altogether a great stay. Very good value for money. I've stayed at the main Marriott in New Orleans before, and considering that this was half the price, it was twice as good.

<Content>Wonderful stay at the Quality Inn We stayed at the Quality Inn  Suites on O鈥橩eefe Ave. for two nights in April. Our experience at this hotel was wonderful. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the room was clean and spacious, and the location was great. The hotel is only about 2 blocks from Canal Street, and within a 15 minute walk of Jackson Square. It鈥檚 also convenient to the Freret bus line, which runs to Uptown. My only note of caution is that while it鈥檚 a quick and safe walk during the daytime, you shouldn鈥檛 try to walk between the hotel and the Quarter at night. There are plenty of taxis to be had though, and it鈥檚 a cheap fare.

<Content>Best Deal in New Orleans This hotel is a wonderful bargain. It's just short walk from the large convention hotels and probably half the price. My convention was at the Sheritan, which charges $209 plus tax. The Quality Inn was less than $100 a night including tax, and this is for a room with one kingsided bed (I am on my own) a small fridge,and a small microwave. The room is solid and quiet, if small. It isn't all plastic. Even if I'd had the money to waste on the Sheridan, I'd prefer being here because there were no crowds, traffic jams at the elevators, etc. It's price is low because it's just a little bit outside of the convention area, but not enough to make a differenceor to make walking dangerous. It's just a block off Canal, opposite the upper part of the French Quarter. There's a Sub Station next door (it's hard to find good cheap food in N.O.), and a wonderful Sikh Indian restaurant (Tandoori something...) just half a block away near Canal which is never crowded (unlike the F.Q. restaurants, even the dumps.) The manager let me check in very early (I arrived at 11:30 am and check in is at 3 pm, and he's presently letting me stay over a few hours because I have a late flight.. If the hotel were full, I'm sure that wouldn't happen, but they're really working to get business--good service, very polite and helpful. I'd suggest booking through the hotel, not Hotel.com, which shows a higher price than I paid.

<Content>Good for the price, could be closer to CC. I stayed there for 5 nights just during a large convention and conference event. The hotel itself was clean, and I personally enjoyed the privacy that the mini-suit gave me and my colleague. We actually paid for one room, but had two separate rooms. The breakfast was quite nice. There were bread, jam, yogurt, coffee, fruits and other things every morning. The staff were nice and friendly. The location was OK, however if you are there for he convention center look for somewhere closer. It was a short walk to the Burbon street however. There is an advantage for this place compared to Holiday inn, and that is, it is quieter. The city had not fully recovered from the hurricane yet, so some overall shortcomings were expectable including the transportation and security.

<Content>Exemplary Service Our work group spent a week there and we are so grateful for the staff's hospitality. These folks couldn't have treated us better! They were gracious, wise and helpful beyond expectations. The rooms were great and the breakfast a treat but the attitude of the staff made the stay for us. They took good care of a mixed group raging from 14-70 years of age. We'll be back.

<Content>Great value and service Great value and location. We travel a lot and the entire staff at this hotel was among the most friendly and helpful we have encountered. From the front desk, to security to housekeeping, everyone made a point to make sure we were happy with our stay. Our room was advertised as a small queen, and it was very small, but quiet and very well furnished with a desk, frig. and micorwave. It was also very clean. Larger rooms were available, but we don't spend much time in the room. The continental breakfast was above average for Quality Inns with hot and cold cereal, sausage muffins, egg burritos, fruit, juice and yogurt in a roomy lobby area. If you don't mind walking a little, this hotel is only four blocks from the French Quarter, and an easy half-mile walk to the Superdome.

<Content>Good Location and Friendly Staff The hotel is located near the mid-upper end of Canal St  O'keefe, just 2 blocks from the nearest street car station. The check-in  cleaning staff are very friendly. Originally booked for a King superior room but was upgraded to a Queen Suite. The free breakfast is one of the best I've ever eaten. It has sausage, burrito, full spread of muffins  bread, jucies, etc. The hotel does not have a parking facility but you can get a parking tag from the hotel for $17 a day to park at a multi-story carpark adjacent to it. The multi-story carpark is a little run-down  not fully lighted. So if you are coming late at night (after 10pm), be careful. Upon check-out, you need to drive your car to the front of the hotel  return the parking tag! The hotel is about 5 blocks from French Qtr Bourbon Street. Tulane Medical Center is about 5 blocks north of the hotel.

<Content>Worked for us just fine!!! We stayed here 2 nights week after Christmas, 2006. No real complaints. Staff was very accomodating for our earlier than normal check-in and even gave us a suite - yes, a real one with doors and everything ;) We found the hotel very convenient for the Commercial Business District - walking distance for sure - and even the French Quarter and Riverwalk Mall as well. When the streetcars get back up to full operation, for folks who enjoy walking, you're just a good stretch of the legs from anything you want to do. If it's raining or walking's not in the cards, then you're only 2 blocks tops from the Canal Street  St Charles streetcars and cabs could easily and quickly whisk you anywhere you need to go.Remember our stay was post-Katrina, but as long as there's construction activity going on, the hotel could use some updating. But, honestly, who comes to The Big Easy to hang around their hotel anyway. For the money, this place offers a clean, comfortable, quiet sleepin' spot. Their free breakfast was on par with the Astor Crowne Plaza too (neither were extravagant, but you get my point).We were pleased.

<Content>Outstanding staff. We have stayed at the Quality Inn  Suites, located on O'Keefe Street numerous times. We have always received outstanding service from each staff member. The hotel is in an excellent location and we will be back as soon as it is back up and operating. We are hoping that we can celebrate New Year's eve in New Orleans and in this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel We spent 5 nights at this hotel and were impressed with the staff (very friendly and professional), the room (wet bar, microwave, mini-fridge) and the included breakfast (waffle machines, fresh orange juice, all kinds of pastry).Very close to the French Quarter (or whatever is left of it, now).

<Content>It was OK..... 5 of us just came back NOLA... we stayed at the hotel 3 nights it was ok. The staff was great the room was clean. One thing i did not like was the walls need some paint in the room. Their was some sort of stain on the bedspread( I always bring my own sheets). The rooms had two rooms each with it's own TV, bathroom was in the middle. O the toilet did not work at 1st but was fixed within 5 min of the call down to the front desk. We loved the location.Over all we would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>run away and stay somewhere safer staff was okay as long as you tipped really well, rooms are small not a suite as advertised! I kept missing things from my room like changem earrings etc. I did 't report it b/c I read the other reviews sayin don't bother! I did not feel safe with all te honeless people asking for money when we tried to go anywhere. I don;t think I will stay here again!

<Content>Many Greats! Great staff. Great location. Great room.We stayed here during the Jazz Fest and couldn't have asked for a better location. As others have said, this hotel is only a few blocks from all of the action--which is far enough away to keep things quiet(er), but close enough to get to the French Quarter by foot.The staff was exceptional. They were one of the most helpful and friendliest staffs we've ever encountered. The room was very clean and very comfortable. Sounds like different suites have different features--ours was definitely two rooms, separated by a door. Each had its own TV.Not much more we can say--other than we'd stay there again in a second.

<Content>Don't stay here They advertise this as a suite, but it's really a large motel room.  There is a half-wall seperating the bedroom from the living room (no door). The only TV is in the bedroom. Not good for a couple where one wants to sleep late and the other wants to read or watch TV. Lighting is poor in the living room and there are no windows for extra light in the living room.Reservation was for a king non-smoking room. Upon arrival we were told they didn't have king beds and we would have to settle for two doubles. Non-smoking rooms were not available. The hot tub was broken and so was one of the two elevators which resulted in long waits.The morning breakfast was the same every day and way too small for the size of the hotel. Staff was poorly informed and morning newspapers didn't arrive until after 8:30 each day.Bottom line - we moved to a different hotel and had much better acommodations and service.
