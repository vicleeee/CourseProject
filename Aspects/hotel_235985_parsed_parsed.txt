<Content>Great place, A few minor hiccups Hotel Porta Faenza is situated right in the heart of Florence, walkable to all the major attractions of the city as well as the train station. However, it was a bit tricky to find as you have to understand the utterly bizarre numbering system for street addresses in Florence (businesses in Black, homes in Red, or the other way around, I forget 鈥?and two unrelated sets of numbers, Google Maps even puts it in the wrong place) 鈥?and we found the wrong #77 and had to call the hotel to be redirected. However, this wasn鈥檛 a very big deal and once we got there we were very pleased with the superb staff (exceptionally good English speakers, very US tourist friendly) who helped us immensely as we got oriented to the city. The room was very clean, very cozy and nicely decorated 鈥?oh, and internet access was free, a rare treat. The bathroom was lovely as well, though the water, it seemed, was 鈥渉ard water,鈥?with a bit of a sulfuric smell. It wasn鈥檛 overwhelming, but if you鈥檙e sensitive to that, it鈥檚 certainly noticeable/worth mentioning. The other problem was that the shower was small and leaky and I realized too late that it caused me to flood the bathroom! We soaked up the water with our remaining towels, and went about our day. We were bummed out when we came back and saw that no one had cleaned the room! We called the front desk and asked for more towels (the bathroom was dry by now but we had no towels left) 鈥?and they gladly brought them and seemed very surprised and distressed that our room had not been serviced, so I can鈥檛 imagine this is a regular occurrence. We were only there the two nights, so I鈥檓 sure they would have taken care of it the next day if we had been staying longer. The breakfast buffet was generous and delicious. Overall we had a great time in Florence and enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Porta Faenza, despite the hiccups which I can only imagine are the product of a relatively new hotel (I think??) getting the kinks worked out. All that said, I鈥檇 still recommend it pretty highly if you鈥檙e looking for a reasonably priced place to stay that鈥檚 in the center of everything, and has the feel, if not the finesse, of a higher-priced place.

<Content>What a find! We just got home from a trip to Italy, booking rooms in Venice and Florence based on Trip Advisor reviews. This Florence hotel certainly lived up to its great reviews. The location, a couple of blocks from the train station and a 15 minute ride from the airport, is excellent. The neighbourhood offers great shopping, restaurants and major tourist attractions within a 5 - 10 minute walk. The hotel staff were wonderful, upgrading our room at no cost since the hotel wasn't fully booked, and recommending excellent restaurants. The hotel is clean, the breakfast is adequate and the room and the bathroom were lovely. The bed was so comfortable we didn't want to get up in the morning.We will definitely stay at Porta Faenza Hotel again when we go back to Florence.

<Content>Porta Faenza, a little gem ! Great little hotel. We moved from it's sister hotel, the Alba because it was noisy but found this hotel really good. Location was excellent, 5 mins from the station and 10 mins from the Duomo. Our room was large, adequately furnished and quiet. There was satellite TV inc BBC and CNN but not Sky and a fridge and safe. The only negative was the bathroom which was rather small.The front desk staff were very helpful and provided us with a great tip for a restaurant just 30 yards away, Enzo  Pierro - we had a fantastic meal and the restaurant was busy, mostly with italians - always a good sign.The complimentary continental breakfast was adequate to set you up for the day.We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and would stay again.

<Content>Great Hotel!!! Great Hotel in the walking distance to all of the major attractions. Very nice, clean room. Stuff is very friendly and helpfull. We found out about parking on the second day. The first night was rip off because nobody tell us that hotel has contract with a parking on the next street. We arrived late at night. I thing that it's a great hotel for that price.

<Content>Great hotel with helpful staff The staff at this hotel treated us very nicely! We arrived by train early morning (6:30am) and obv our room was not available for us. We were so tired that we just sat on the sofa in the lobby waiting for our room. The first room that became available was at 8am and the staff were really quick to prepare it for us. It was of decent size, large bed, and extremely clean. We were very happy. We stayed in florence for 2 nightsThe location of the hotel is very good - about a 4 minute walk from the train station. Florence is meant to be on your feet so you can walk to any of the tourist sights or restaurants from the hotel. The staff was also helpful in recommending good places to eat. Breakfast at the hotel had a variety of choices and was very good. We spent approximately 75euros/night and found it well worth it!We only had two full days in florence and the second day we took a tour of tuscany with a company called best of tuscany tours - it cost 80euros a person and was well worth it! We went to Siena  San Gimignano  Pisa. We stopped at this tuscan farm for lunch and it was one of the best authentic meals we had - great wine as well! The guides were all very friendly and informative and i felt we had adequate time in each location. Overall, the tour was 12 hours long and I would definitely recommend it. We were able to see a lot more in a shorter period of time and was quite happy with our stay overall in florence.

<Content>Wonderful Stay! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Porta Faenza. The staff at the reception were extremely helpful and spoke excellent English. They also booked up our visit to the Uffizi for us via the hotel's website. We would certainly advise this as the queues are monumental! Our room was very spacious with a lovely big walk-in shower plus a separate bath.The room was kept immaculately clean, with fresh towels each day. Our room, 303, had a lovely balcony looking over the roof-tops at the back of the building. Great for a welcome rest after sight-seeing! We really enjoyed the breakfast with its excellent variety. The restaurant, Pietro and Enza, to the right as you exit the hotel, was especially good with cheerful staff and excellent food. It's probably best to pop in and book a table as it fills up very quickly. The Nerone slightly further along is very good too.The Guelfa in Via Guelfa is also worth a visit.For a really good map of where the hotel is, just go to Google maps and put in the name of the hotel. We did not find any trouble in locating it unlike the previous reviewer! We would certainly recommend the Porta Faenza!

<Content>Disappointed I first had trouble finding the hotel as the hotel website had a link to google which put the hotel on the south side of the intersection when it should be on the north side. I noticed that the link has been fixed now.The bed was small and the bathroom was beat up. The staff at front desk didn't speak English and needed to seek help from another staff (who was pleasant). I had a 500 Euro bill and I asked front desk to break it but they didn't have any cash.Overall, my disappointment was mainly due to the condition of the room, but may be that is what I get for the price, which is low in European standards. I paid higher for rooms in Rome and Venice and naturally, those accomodation was better than this one.

<Content>What a find! I booked this hotel based on all the great reviews on TripAdvisor - and was not disappointed! We originally were only going to stay 2 nights but changed to 4 at the last minute and were so happy! Porta Faenza is in a GREAT location if you want to explore Florence. A great home base to start from - everything is within walking distance - I think the farthest we walked was like 15 minutes. Easy walk from the train station. Hotel staff was always very friendly and accomodating. Room was large, comfortable and had everything we needed. Very quiet and peaceful. Breakfast was good - meat, cheese, yogurt, fresh fruit, pastries, cereal, etc. A couple good restaurants within 150 feet of the front door. Free internet, but you have to get a code for 2 hours at a time which is kind of a pain sometimes. (We needed to work a little unfortunately, and also used our computer to do more research on local activities.) Highly recommend this hotel - you will not be sorry! Also - if you are active - do Per's Bike Tours! Best thing we did on our vacation - beautiful bike tour through the hills of Tuscany - absolutely amazing. Duomo is a must-see, as is Accademia - David is breathtaking! Can't wait to get back to Florence!!

<Content>Porta Faenza My husband and I stayed for three nights at the Hotel Porta Faenza. It was very pleasant. The staff was helpful, the rooms we very adequate (hard wood floors, updated bathroom, flat screen tv, etc.). The breakfast that was provided was very filling and offered a decent amount of variety. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Florence area. It is a short walk from the train station (no need to get a taxi or take public transport). It was quiet in the evening and just out of the hustle and bustle of the busier roads.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights and thought it was a very nice hotel. The people at the front desk were helpful, the breakfast was good, and the room was large and nicely decorated. It also has an excellent location. The only problem was that the bed was not super comfortable (and rather than being a large bed it was two twins pushed together). However, this seemed to be a trend in Italy and we did not find better beds at any of the other hotels we stayed at.

<Content>Nice but cannot recommend as enthusiastically as others Porta Faenza's website and staff contact (via email) are excellent. The Trip Advisor reviews are extremely enthusiastic. So I had high expectations, but frankly the reality did not fully meet my expectations, especially at 150 Euro/night. Having said that, there are several good things about PF: location is ideal. I had no idea how touristy Florence would be (even in mid-September), and I really liked being able to retreat to a more residential neighborhood ... but one still close to the train station and rental car offices.Our room (#306) was extremely large, and the cleanliness was impeccable. The furnishings were quite spare (bedspread like a sheet of paper), but the size was nice.The breakfast is generous and good.Definitely ask the hotel staff to book museum tickets. They did this so quickly and efficiently -- a far better way to go than paying the various websites an extra fee to book tickets.Overally, you can't go wrong - I just think it wasn't a spectacular value.

<Content>Good Htoel We stayed here for one night on two week trip to Tuscany. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. There is free internet access in the lobby and the breakfast buffet was great. The room was a little small but was clean. The room had satellite TV (including BBC world) and the bathroom was nearly was big massive. The location is very central and there are 5 minutes walk from the Duomo. Only paid 70 Euro, which was a bargain considering the level of the accommodation.

<Content>Great place to stay! We stayed 2 nights in Florence at Porta Faenza. This place is worth every penny! Here is why:- Location: Very close (3 min. walk) to the Central Train Station without being in a dangerous area.- Staff: Extremely helpful and recommends great restaurants.- Room: Good size, courtyard facing rooms are very quiet, bathroom is clean, TV is available and most of all, they have AC.- Breakfast: Lots of food, cereal, breads, cakes, cold cuts, cheeses, fruits, etc.- Internet: Access is free and available until midnight.- Luggage keep: You can leave your stuff there even after you check-out if you plan on visiting the city for the afternoon.All in all, GREAT place to be staying at while in Florence!

<Content>Wonderful holiday We have just returned from a delightful holiday in Florence. The hotel was a small local hotel with very high standards. Our room was very spacious with high ceiling and beautiful wooden floor. We had 2 large shuttered windows over-looking a courtyard. The bathroom had an over-bath shower,basin, toilet and bidet, with blue and white wall-tiles and terracotta floor. The plumbing worked well. Air-conditioning was efficient (we had to turn it off at night as we got too chilly) and as the outside temperature was over 80 degrees we were glad of it! The rooms were thoroughly cleaned every day of our 8 day stay and were immaculate.The desk staff were all very pleasant and glad to answer any queries. They had tickets for the local open-top bus tours and checked train times for us when we asked about day trips to Rome. They stamped and posted post-cards for us and marked all possible places of interest on a complimentary local map.Breakfast was in two pleasant rooms with plenty of space to move around. There were cereals, breads (various types), cheese, ham, jams, yoghurts, pastries, fruit in syrup and fresh fruit, plus a choice of fruit juices. There was only one staff member looking after breakfasts but she was always smiley and remembered our choice of drinks after the first morning. There was a choice of teas, hot chocolate (very good) and coffees including cappucino.The hotel is ideally placed close to the main railway station but down a quiet side-street. The easiest way to get to it is to leave by the east (side) exit of Santa Maria Novella Station and cross on the zebra crossings. Walk right past McDonalds and shops and turn left at the first main road Via Nazionale. Continue straight on past Via Fiume and at the next junction turn left onto Via Faenza. The hotel is about 5 mins walk. We recommend the Ice-cream from the right-hand corner of Via Faenza. They have a huge choice of flavours and are cheaper than the place on the left corner, starting at only 1.30 euros. San Lorenzo market is vast and has lots of choice in leather goods, glass and scarves. The churches in Florence are all beautiful with white, green and pink marble with an abundance of paintings and sculpture. The church of Santa Maria Novella (near the station) was our favourite. Ponte Vecchio was heaving with people and we felt too hot to be hustled round and didn't linger, but a walk along the River Arno was very pleasant. We recommend the bus-tour which we caught near the station (just beyond the zebra-crossing mentioned earlier) for getting an initial look at the city. It has two routes and we did them both. One took us out into the hills to the beautiful village of Fiesole which was home to many English artists and writers in years gone by. There is an abundance of small cafe/restuarants and we had lovely meals every evening for around 20 euros(for 2 of us). Unfortunately the nearest place, Enzio and Pietros which we had seen recommendations for on this website, was closed for holidays. We went by train to Pisa for a day and found the whole area around the tower very impressive. Many of the local shops etc were also closed for holidays! The fare from Pisa to Florence was only 5.60 euros (single) which we thought was very good for a journey of about 90mins. We also travelled by Eurostar to Rome for a day which cost 76 euros (return) and took about 1hour 40mins.We had a lovely holiday and would recommend Florence to anyone who loves beautiful buildings and works of art. Also good for a more relaxed pace of life and fine food.

<Content>Great stay in Florence, Italy My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Porta Faenza Hotel in Florence in April of this year. The hotel is on a quiet street close to everything. We had a front room and the room was very quiet. The people at the hotel were exceptionally nice and helpful. The hotel has a great breakfast room and internet connection. We ate at a restaurant right down the street and had great meals. We had rented an apartment in Rome, and although we enjoyed our stay, we realize now that when you travel to a new place it is nice to stay in a hotel with a staff that can help you find your way around. We thought this hotel was way above its rating and was an excellent choice in Florence. The hotel is near the train station and we walked to the hotel after arriving from Rome. Very convenient to everything.

<Content>Nice stay in Porta Faenza We had a nice time in Porta Faenza Florence. Location is very nice. We could walk from the SMN train station and to all major sites. Very close to Duomo Church, Piazza della Signoria and Ponte Vecchio. Front desk personel was very helpful and kind. They have a PC in the lobby with free internet access. Room and bathroom were nice and clean. They could improve the breakfast which wasn't very good. Overall, we had a very good time there and would come back.

<Content>Ideal hotel close to train station, tourist sites, inexpensive restaurants This is a really nice hotel - more than a bed and breakfast that my girlfriend and I expected. Room was relatively spacious, clean-clean-clean. Nice firm queen-size bed as we requested. Air conditioning great. Bathroom also -- nice thick towels.Very helpful staff - my girlfriend broke a wheel on her suitcase on the cobblestone street, and the desk person marked the map where she could find replacements at different prices and qualities. Late at night, the desk clerk saw me leaving with a bag of laundry and directed me to a nicer laundry a bit farther but indeed cleaner.Just down the block is a great little restaurant Nerone that we mistook at first for a pizza counter, but inside it was a lovely full restaurant with reasonably priced dishes to die for. And a Chinese-run grocery that will custom-make delicious sandwiches for you for less than the paninis available everywhere (and cokes for 58 cents vs. 3+ euros elsewhere!)The breakfast is really fine, a notch above the ordinary BB fare.The only downside was the wireless internet died shortly after we arrived on Friday, and summers in Italy, that meant it was down until Monday, when we left for Siena.

<Content>Great Place!! First of i have no idea why this is a 3 star hotel, i thought that it was really nice. It's located 5 minutes walk from Santa Marie Novella Train Station, there are plenty of shops nearby. The resturant at the top if the street especially is really nice. We had one room and two beds, the rooms were big, we had TV, Shower/bath everything you need. There really wasn't anything negative about the hotel, except the fact that not understanding their streets etc it took us a while to find the hotel but other than that everyting was good.

<Content>Average place Location is close to the train station which is convenient, but the hotel is a bit off the beaten path for all the shops and restaurants. Just a few blocks walk to where the action is, no big deal.I was there with two other sets of travelers. The first room I was put in was a walk in closet that they crammed a bed into. The bathroom was not clean. I complained endlessly until they moved me to a bigger room, they charged me 20 Euros more a night which was fine. Once in the bigger room it was much better. Singles, book yourself a double and pay the extra money its well worth it.The breakfast was good, plenty of hot coffee and fresh pastries. They could have used some more nutritious food, like better fresh fruit, but it was adequate.The internet service was intermittant. You have to get a password from the desk and when the printer ran out of ink the night staff couldn't be bothered to walk into the office to get more ink or print out the password on the regular computer, something which the day staff immediately took care of. The internet service was extremely slow, if you have to do anything important better to walk up the block to an internet cafe and pay for it.

<Content>viva Porta Very nice reasonably priced hotel within short walk to everything you would want to see. AC worked great- important because it was pretty warm the time we visited Italy. Nice front desk, close cafes and trattorias, short walk to train- all in all a really good stay!

<Content>Great hotel, great price What can I say? It was an amazing experience. The room was large by European standards. Everything was impeccably clean. We requested (and got) a small balcony. The staff was knowledgeable and had wonderful recommendations for outstanding restaurants. Americans will probably find the pillows uncomfortable, but they are better at this hotel than in most of Europe. Breakfast was a feast; as large a continental breakfast as I have seen. The location was amazing, right in the center of everything. I know the city pretty well and when we booked the hotel, I did not expect it to be near as nice as it is, given the amazing location and reasonable price, but this is a true deal.

<Content>Great stay at Porta Faenza We were pleasantly surprised at the size of our room at P.F. We stayed for 5 days in April '08, and it was clean, spacious and very well priced for the room. Breakfast was good with great cappucinos. The location was convenient being near the train station, but a short walk to some sights. The staff was very friendly and there was access to a computer in the lobby which was very useful.

<Content>Wonderful place to stay This hotel was great! It was clean, nicely decorated, the front desk was well serviced, wonderful breakfast including coffee and cappuccino, and had internet access. The front desk also gave great recommendations for dinner. The room was very spacious, had wood floors, a digital safe, and high ceilings. It was in easy walking distance to everything. This establishment is a joy and a good value for your money!

<Content>A real gem of a hotel! Staying at this Hotel was truly the highlight of our trip to Florence. It was very close to the train station, but yet the neighborhood was very nice. I recommend heading east out of the train station, and not out the front main entrance. Head out towards where the bus station is on a small side street, then turn right on Via Faenza you can't miss it on the right hand side. It is at most a five minute walk. Also on the small side street to the back of the hotel is where you will find a mini market, and the laundrymat. We were traveling as a large party of 10, and bookked two quadruple rooms and one double. All the rooms were large, very clean, and with superior linens. The towels were the some of the nicest we could ever hope for, and we were given plenty of towels, and there was a chest with extra blankets, everything very clean and fresh smelling. There was a good safe in the room, and all three of our rooms had a very nice tub/shower combination, plus an extra shower. The hotel was not noisy, and it had a lift. The staff was very professional and pleasant. Alberto was especially helpful to my father as he lost his cell phone and Alberto helped him out the best he could. They also called a taxi for us so we could go to the Uffizi museum and the Accademia, and they did the reservations for us ahead of time to cut down on the lines. The breakfast was the best we had in Italy, with plenty of fresh fruit, delicious breads and pastries, cereals, juices, yogurt. They made you to order your capuccino, and for the children fresh hot chocolate made with real chocolate, not powdered chocolate. At the front desk they have a small bar where you can get a glass of wine or cup of tea in the evening. We had the best dinner at Enzo and Piero which was just a few doors down, and a great pizzeria also a few doors down, and pastries and gelato on the corner. Around a block and a half away was the laundromat where we were able to wash our clothes. The San Lorenzo market was just across the the main street and a short walk. Highly recommend this market it is where we found the best prices. We were so happy we picked this hotel, all the family loved it and hope to come back one day.

<Content>Great deal I stayed at Porta Faenza while attending a conference at the Fortezza da Basso. The choice worked out great.1) Location. It was the closest hotel to the conference site. It was very close to the train and bus station (easy to walk). It was very close to all the major attractions. The restaurant Enzo e Piero on the same block is a good choice for meals. I also found a supermarket about four blocks away.2) Price. Better than the deals the conference had worked out with other hotels and very reasonable even considering I am coming from the US.3) Quiet. The room was very quiet. I heard very little from other rooms (although I may have been lucky with the other guests). I slept very well.4) Clean. Spotless room and they cleaned it very well every day.5) Staff. Very pleasant, helpful, smiling, and all spoke English. 6) Internet access. Wireless access. Just go to the front desk and tell them for how long you need access. They give you a temporary username and password and off you go. No extra charges for this.7) Good breakfast. While there weren't any hot food choices, there were croissants, other breads, four choices of cereal, yogurt, cake (excellent), deli meats, cheese, juice, milk, and a couple of other things I can't remember. And you can get tea or a capuccino, and the lady that services the tables remembers what you like.If you haven't been to Europe much, the room is very small by US standards, the bathroom doesn't have a bath tub (only a shower), there were no drawers, and the closet was very small. But this is not unlike what I have found elsewhere in Europe, especially in a location with older buildings. The bed was actually large.

<Content>Fantastic Find! Highly Recommend What a great place! My boyfriend and I stayed here at the end of March, 2008. Breakfast was included, a nice mix of cereal, fruit, pastries and coffee. Also, our room was really nice and clean, beautiful big bathroom with a tub! Also we had a little private balcony to relax on! The hotel is really nicely located, a couple blocks from the train station and a couple blocks from the central market. Staff was friendly and helpful. We walked everywhere, no problem! I would totally stay here again, by far one of my favorite spots in Europe.

<Content>What A Gem !!! This was our cheapest stay But probably our most enjoyable! The price was a steal (70 Euro a night)  we informed the hotel that we were on our honeymoon. They were very helpful, courteous, informative  welcoming. They Upgraded us. Our room was beautiful, homey, and spacious. The view wasnt great but florence is a pretty packed city  we dont know if ANYPLACE in Florence has a view. They had free internet  our room came with breakfast-italian style. The Hotel is a small building because its a converted 19th Century Home. But it is immaculately clean  well kept . Gave us a feeling of old italy- with the service  pleasantries of today. Wouldnt trade it in for a more expensive place in florence even if given a choice! We LOVED it  would Definitely go back if the opportunity presents itself.

<Content>Lovely, Lovely hotel When I arrived here midweek after lugging my suitcase around the Eurostar and train station, I was surprised to see how close the hotel was from the train station! I could literally roll my unwieldy suitcase to it within 15 mins. And the best part - you don't hear any of the traffic noise once in the hotel. The front desk was great and they have free wi-fi access here, as well as a computer and printer in the lobby for guests - very convenient.The room was so nice, with a big bathroom, a flat screen TV (which I never watched, but it was still nice to have) and a little balcony to relax on when the weather is nice. Alas, the weather was not nice when I was there but it was still nice to know that it was an option!The rooms were clean and bright, the hotel was within walking distance of the Duomo and the main train station, there were plenty of restaurants about and the atmosphere was friendly.Great place, not too pricey for a one or two night stay. Will definitely come back when next in Florence!

<Content>Lived Up to Expectations Porta Faenza lived up to the favourable reviews we read in Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed.Excellent location, easy walking distance from the Florence train station. Clean rooms small but adequate rooms with all necessary facilities. Good continental breakfast with a reasonable amount of choice. Very helpful desk staff. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Avoid! We stayed here for one night.A few things:1) We were put in a smaller room due to them being overbooked.2) The room had bed bugs. My wife and I both had bites on our legs and arms.3) The room stank of smoke and stale air.4) The room was tiny and the bed was not a queen as we reserved.When we tried to change the room or get a discount for our troubles, we were told that it wasn't possible. The front desk woman didn't try to address our concerns. Basically, she just defended the cleanliness of her room and told the bed was a queen.Avoid at all costs.

<Content>Charming staff The reviews on Tripadvisor persuaded us to choose this hotel and we were not disappointed. Even after a long and tiring journey, it was easy to drag our bag from the railway station to the Porta Faenza. Once inside we were kindly welcomed and immediately felt at home. The room (at the back opening on to a courtyard) was small but extremely quiet. The bathroom was a good size and well equipped. In the morning the breakfast, which included fresh fruit, was all we could have wished for.The position of the hotel is ideal. The Via Faenza is not busy but it is in easy walking distance of all the artistic and architectural attractions that we wanted to see. In the evening there is a good choice of restaurants a few minutes away.The staff, from the chamber maids to the management, were very friendly and extremely helpful, charming in fact. We stayed four nights and would use this hotel again. We felt it represented very good value for money and we liked its atmosphere.

<Content>A great deal for the price We stayed 4 nights at this very reasonable rate hotel in Florence.It's about 3 blocks from the Train Station so it's very easy to roll your luggage there. The hotel is clean, a large bed, great breakfast that's included and the hotel staff went out of their way to help us. The staff speak english. (they booked reservations us for tours in the Wine Country and helped us reserve a car)There are many wonderful restaurants within a couple of blocks of this hotel, which is always nice after you've been out exploring the city all day.When we go back, we will stay here again.

<Content>Great Florence Hotel My wife and i just got back from a 5-night stay at the Hotel Porta Faenza for our honeymoon. We had a great time in Florence and thought the hotel was great for a 3* in Florence. The hotel is not 'luxury', nor does it claim to be as a 3*, but for the price, proximity to attractions and the train station, this was a very friendly, clean, and decent hotel. They gave us Room 303, which has a large balcony with a few chairs. However, we were unable to use it because it was freezing in Florence the week we were there. If you stay when it is warm, request this room. The room size, however, is a bit smaller than some of the others, but you do get the balcony.The staff was very helpful and friendly. They assisted with contacting the airport to recover my wife's lost luggage. They also booked museums and a great Chianti area wine tour with CAF Tours. They also popped open a bottle of vino for us.The breakfast was decent. Nothing hot, but I believe that is how europeans serve breakfast. There was a good selection of cheeses, meats, and pastries, juices, and coffee.Our only issues with the hotel were that there was no clock or alarm clock in the room (though they did give us wakeup calls), not having an alarm clock made me nervous. I did discover towards the end of the week that you could set the TV to turn on automatically at a specific time. Also, the bed was not the most comfortable, but I dont' think many are in Florence unless you pay a few hundred more for the Westin or similar.The hotel also provides free internet access in the lobby.Thanks Porta Faenza for a great honeymoon.

<Content>Great Hotel in Florence Was greatful to find this hotel, after such a disaster with lodging in Rome.This place was surprisingly very nice and clean, with what seemed to be all newly refurbished rooms, and new bathroom fixtures.I really enjoyed my stay, and concur with all of the positive reviews. If I ever return to Italy, I think I'd like to station myself in Florence at Hotel Faenza, and make day trips around Italy from this location.Finding the hotel from the train station could be a challenge, but stick with the maps and ask around. Italians are very friendly and eager to help out.

<Content>What a find! Found this hotel reviewed favourably on several sites, so booked with confidence. Requested, and was given the room with the balcony, Sooo sweet! (Room 303). Just a street away from the bus and railway station - ideal!The staff were extremely polite, helpful and interested in our outings every day. Spotless rooms, daily change of all linen, beautifully clean bathroom. The breakfast offered loads of choice and was plentiful. Lovely lady overseeing all the arrangements.So much to see and do in Florence, so make sure that your stay is topped off by choosing this gem of a hotel. We would certainly recommend it to anyone. Arrivederchi!

<Content>Central location We had two nights here recently and were very impressed by the hotel and Firenze in general. Our room wasn't large but very comfortable with a small balcony that actually overlooked the glass ceiling of the lobby area!! Breakfast was adequate and the capuccinos excellent. All the staff were excellent and very helpful. We had trouble finding the hotel especially as we drove into Firenze from the Tuscan countryside and had to find parking. There were many roadworks which made it more difficult. After eventually finding a parking garage and dragging our bags quite some considerable distance, we found out that the hotel has a garage quite close by. Our fault for not checking. The hotel is ideally situated close to many of the major tourist attractions and Firenze is very easy to get around on foot. You will go into sensory overload with all the amazing art and architecture. Don't forget to visit the original statue of David by Michelangelo which resides in the Gallerie dell'Academia - my favourite attraction by far.

<Content>Excellent hotel The Porta Faenza is an ideal base for exploring the sights of Florence - a 5 minute walk from the train station, 10 minutes to the Duomo, 15 to the Uffizi and 20 to the Pitti Palace. The central market and various trattoria are all close by. Desk staff were friendly and very helpful. The room we were given for the first night of our 4 night stay was unpleasant - dark (no windows), double bed (we had requested a king), no bedside tables, etc., but when we asked to be moved on the second day, the hotel obliged and gave us a lovely room on the 3rd floor. Highly recommended.

<Content>We enjoyed the stay Stayed for 8 days (too long for Florence - overload of sights). Our room was large with a standard sized bathroom complete with bath and shower. Large twin beds with very firm mattresses and pillows. Linen sheets changed every day! Towels beautiful fluffy white and lots of them. Flat screen tv with BBC world and CNN together with italian and french channels. Breakfast good for Italy depends on needs - cereals, bread, yoghurts, fresh fruit (whole), cheeses ham crossants, fruit juices, fresh coffee and tea. Ver friendly and accommodating staff. Location very good for the station and fairly easy to reach all sights. Guide books run down the area as dubious but we did not find a problem. (the top graded hotel in tripadvisor is in a very depressing area).We had problems finding hotel so these directions may be helpful. Exit station at the east end of the concourse i.e platforms to the north, cross over the extreme north side of the bus station immediately adjacent train station and then cross main road via Val Fonda and carry on the in same direction (passed some blue busses in a mini bus station) along a back street via Bernardo Cennini (100 yds) unitil you reach a T junction with Via Faenza, turn right and the hotel is about 100 yds on the right. See previous reviews for suggested restaurants in area although an additional one would be Il Contadino on Via Paluzzulo 71r. Fixed price menu for lunch and dinner mainly locals - no written menu, the owner reads it out - 3 courses 鈧?0.50 total for two including wine and coffee 鈧?5 simply prepared but as good as other restaurants. For a break from Florence's constant traffic noise try Lucca for the day, walled city with plenty to look at with peace thrown in. Try Paris restaurant fixed price menu near the Palazzo Pfanner.

<Content>Great location and value The Porta Faenza is in great location and considering we paid 900 Euros for 5 nights in the heart of Firenze, it's almost hard to complain. Its two blocks from the train station and in the heart of the old city.The room was defnitely large and comfortable with nice furnishings.The bathroom was small but well designed in typical European fashion. I guess one must be objective in these reviews. To be critical, but it was mostly comical to us, the showerhead was one of those handheld-type shower heads that adjusts up/down a long pole. When the pole would get wet and warm, the mechanism would slowly, slowly work its way down during the course of the shower. For me, I deal with these type of situations. I mean, here I am on vacation in a beautiful country, perhaps the main cradle of Western civilization, the last thing I am going to do is get upset about something like this or complain and demand to have it repaired!! Forget it, I am heading to see some sights, drink some grappa and have fun! However, I do know people that would be really upset about this and would probably complain daily and harangue the staff about this. The staff were absolutely friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was great -- maybe the best capuccino that I ever had.

<Content>Don't think I'd go back to this hotel Booked this hotel, as I always do, based on Trip Advisor comments. However, similar to comments from 'rusman2112', the hotel was busy the weekend we arrived and our room was very small, hardly any room to move; dark and dingy with no view. We were disappointed; totally agree that the hotel is quite hard to find. The hotel could have been improved with a bar where you could sit and have a drink after a day's sightseeing in Florence (which was beautiful). This is a hard one to judge because obviously from other reviews it all depends on what kind of room you are given. I usually review quite highly as i am rarely disappointed, but I wouldn't go back to this hotel.

<Content>Loved this hotel Just returned from two days at this hotel, and wished it had been longer. Our room was on the top floor with a terrace, although we had only booked a standard room. The bathroom was huge (the shower would fit at least 3 people!!). Location is perfect, five minutes from the train station and easy walking distance from all the main attractions.Breakfast was very varied, and trattoria Enzo  Piero two doors away is excellent for dinner, though you may need to wait if you have not reserved a table.We would definitely return to Florence and to this hotel.

<Content>Great hotel! We have just returned from six days in Florence and stayed at the Hotel Porta Faenza. I would highly recommend this hotel. It was situated within walking distance of most of the major tourist places, and very close to the station which serves as a good base for visiting Pisa, Lucca, Rome etc.There are plenty of Trattorias/pizzarias close by and an indoor food market surrounded by outdoor market stalls selling clothes, crafts etc. Our room was a double and we found it to be a good size, clean, comfortable and with tasteful decor. The Michaelangelo prints were a nice touch! Breakfast was great with a good selection. The coffee was fab. We found the staff to be polite and very helpful. We would definately book this Hotel again if we are lucky enough to return to Florence and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there.

<Content>Good value and good location We had two nights here in Sept 07. The hotel was fine, room a little small and with 2 weeks' worth of luggage somewhat cramped! That said, it was clean, and the bed was quite comfortable. The staff were helpful and spoke good English, just as well as my Italian is less than basic.Breakfast was OK, nothing stellar but enough variety and quantity. The location was excellent, but we did have some problems finding it and I would strongly advise against driving into Florence - Italian drivers in general and Florentines in particular are spectacularly bad drivers. I have lived in Jakarta and Bangkok where the standards are pretty low but these idiots make Bangkok taxi drivers look good! Some guy managed to run into the back of my car while I was stationary in a queue of traffic which was not the best of introductions to Florence!As other reviewers have noted, the hotel is walking distance from the main bus and railway stations and about 10 mins from the Duomo so overall good location.50m from the hotel is a great Trattoria called Enzo e Pierro, recommended to us by a friend who has lived in Italy 20 years, and I am happy to pass on the recommendation. Great food, great service.

<Content>Fantastic location, good hotel We stayed here for two nights on Aug 29/30th 2007 based on all the great reviews on this site and it was great! This hotel is a few minutes walk from the train station and a few minutes to some great cafes, shops and sights. There was free internet all day (you just have to get a password from the front desk), the complimentary breakfast buffet was great, there鈥檚 a safety deposit box in the room. Yes, the beds are two twins pushed together but we found that at 9 of the 10 hotels we stayed at throughout our trip. The only issue we had was that our room (# 111) had a musty stale smell to it which lingered on our night clothes for a few days after (we kept our suitcase closed the rest of the time) and was facing the street so it was a bit noisy in the morning, but otherwise this hotel is great value, great location and very helpful staff (they even have baggage storage if you鈥檙e not leaving until later on in the day!). Would definitely recommend and stay again!

<Content>Excellent hotel and wonderful staff We visited Florence for 5 days in August 2007 and we were really pleased that we chose this hotel (thanks to the reviews we found on Trip Advisor). First, the location is very good: close to the train station and short walks to all the major attractions. Second, the rooms, and hotel in general, is very clean and well maintained. Third, the breakfast had a good selection and even if you came in late they would still welcome you and server great cappuccinos! Never felt rush even if was past the closing time. Last, but the most important, the staff was very friendly and polite. I had an accident in Florence and broke my arm and the people at the hotel offered to help me with anything I needed. They were really wonderful! We had great experience with this hotel and will definitely stay there again on our next visit to Florence.

<Content>Ideal base to explore Tuscany We enjoyed our stay in Florence, and the location of the hotel close to the train station was very helpful.The rooms in Europe are quite small in general, but we had a room with a small balcony overlooking the neighbouring roofs, and a nice bathroom which has both a good size bath and separate shower cubicle.The hotel has been sympathetically restored or coverted from its original state and there are some very nice decorative touches which have been kept, such as a well, and other antiques on display.It is less than 10 minutes to the train station from the hotel which is a big plus, and in the evening there are lots of local restaurants dotted the small roads of the hotel. Once exceptional one is the trattoria at the end of Via Faenza.We took the open top bus tour on our first day, taking in all the major sights. The bus operators give you headphones which are plugged in to your selected language channel and the recorded tour guide explains what is significant to the surroundings as you travel around the city.We also had a day horse riding which was fantastic. It may seem a little expensive at around 105 euro each, but it was worth every penny. The day starts around 10am and you are collected next to the train station. The drive is around 45 mins to the riding school and after a short introduction to riding basics; you are put on a horse and set off towards the countryside. In our group there was about 6 people and none of us really had any experience, but the horses all knew exactly what to do and where to go anyway, and we had 2 guides with us too so they needed little encouragement from us! The ride was more strenuous that we had thought, so after a couple of hours riding through forests, fields and sunflowers, we were happy to return to base. Once there, we dismounted and were given some local wine and fruit to relax with. There was also the option to swim in the pool, but we were more interested in the wine! After we finished, they took us to a local agri-tourisme villa and we walked around the vineyard, olive grove and herb gardens. After this we went to a local castle and were given half an hour to wander around before meeting in a restaurant in the castle courtyard. Once there we were treated to a selection of wines to taste, and a delicious 3 course meal made from local produce. We returned home around 4.30pm, and had a thoroughly enjoyable day, well worth the money! Just look up Centro Ippico Agrifoglio on google or hostelworld.

<Content>Beautiful Porta Faenza Hotel For our third anniversary, my husband and I chose to travel around Italy by train. This is also the reason we chose the Hotel Porta Faenza. This hotel is conveniently located just a short walk from the train station. When we arrived, the lady at the front desk gave us a warm and friendly greeting. We were very happy with our room which had two comfortable beds and high ceilings. My husband was most impressed with the speakers in the bathroom which allowed him to not miss a minute of BBC World News. The room was clean and had a large ensuite bathroom which was very nice. In the morning before we left to go exploring, we went downstairs and had a nice continental breakfast which was included in the price of our room. We were both very happy with our three night stay at the Hotel Porta Faenza and highly recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>Enjoyed our Stay at Porta Faenza My wife, myself and two friends arrived in Florence by train and after some initial disorientation (we did that everywhere) found the hotel to be a reasonable walk even with our rolling luggage. The staff were helpful and courteous and our room small but adequate. We were not bothered by street noise (although there were some inconsiderate guests with loud voices in the halls) and we were pleased to find free internet access. The hotel was within walking distance of everything we wished to see and with a call in advance to the hotel they arranged reserved entry to the Academia and other galleries. There was a surcharge for this but we were told when we booked and had no complaints. Overall we all were very pleased with our stay and would have no hesitation at all in recommending it or staying there on a return trip.

<Content>Floored by Florence We (wife, three children - 23, 21 and 17 and me) began our Italian holiday in Florence at the Hotel Porta Faenza. A short walk from the train we found the hotel's entrance on a quaint street that had a number of indoor/outdoor establishements serving meals and libations.The front desk staff was welcoming and helpful and remained so regardless of who manned the desk. Breakfast was ver good and was probably the best of three hotels we visited in Italy. Meats were good, fruit was good and cereal and bread offerings were fine. All that we could have expected. Service was always friendly.Rooms were actually more spacious than I had expected and the air conditioning worked perfectly. That was key, given the 95 degree temperature outside.Hotel is well-located for a family that tends to walk or use public transportation as it was just a few blocks from the train station and, in the other direction, just a short wak to the Duomo and other sights. This was a great way to start our vacation in Italy and we sould gladly return to the Hotel Porta Faenza in the future.

<Content>Great Hotel. Excellent Location Read reviews about this hotel on tripadvisor.comall are true.hotel is 5 min walk from train station (very important) and is within walking distance to all major attractions.Rooms are small yet very clean. Nothing like taking a good shower after a long day of site seeing. Staff is very warm and helpful.When comapring other 3 stars hotels in Europe, this hotel is a real bargain.Ask for a quite room if you do not like the street noise, and you will only hear your partner's snoring..Highly reccomended (this is not a paid adverstisement...)Important tip - you can write the hotel to pre-order tickets for the musuems and they will happliy do it for you - at no extra charge

<Content>Beware of the bus driver A well-placed hotel in a quiet location close to the rail and bus stations - but a word of warning about local buses. The driver won't ask you to pay as you get on, there is no visible ticket or change machine and no signs explaining the ticket system - but if you haven't already bought a ticket, insist on paying at the start of the journey. We had run for a bus back to the hotel from San Spirito and at the terminus, we went up to the driver with purse in hand to pay our fare - only to be told we owed him an on-the-spot fine of 90 Euros (about 拢63).. for two passengers travelling without a ticket. All attempts to reason with him failed and he became so aggressive I insisted the police were called to sort things out. He marched us into the railway police station where the row continued - and was compounded by the fact that we'd handed in our passports at the hotel desk on check-in and hadn't got them back before we launched out sightseeing, so we were in even more trouble for having no ID. We stood our ground and insisted any fines would have to be sent to our home addresses and the Police agreed to that. Nothing has arrived in the post so far....

<Content>Great hotel, good value for money This hotel is close to the main train station of Florence, approx 5 mins walk and about 10 -15 mins to main city centre.We were pleasantly surprised by our room, the high ceiling had lovely wooden beams and the room was spacious. Bathroom was clean. Breakfast was ok - we didn't bother getting up for it after the first morning!There are several good restaurants within walking distance and all the main tourist attractions are close by.An extra benefit of the hotel is that they have free internet access which is great for that lastminute research or online check inIf you're looking for a hotel that is great value for money, then definitely go for this one!

<Content>A very comfortable hotel Booked based on previous Trip Advisor comments. As I have now come to expect these comments prove very helpful !The hotel is very convieniently situated near the main railway station, which was great for us as we did day trips to Pisa and Rome. Hotel is in a back street 5 minutes from the station, although first impressions from the outside are prehaps not that promising the room was superb and above average I would have expected. The room we had on the 3rd floor has obviously been tastefully modernised and refurbished fairly recently with good quality finsishes. The double glazing was very effective in cutting out noise from the street restaurant down the road and early morning barrows ! Air-conditioning was welcome and the ensuite very plush. Breakfast was a reasonable selection on continental style with the limited selection of fresh fruit being the only reservation. Staff were pleasant and helpful. Computer with internet access available in foyer for free in the mornings. Overall can recommend as an exxcellent base for exploring the city or by rail to further afiekd

<Content>Good Choice We stayed three nights in June. Room 303 (I believe). It was nice sized, modern and clean as was the bathroom also. There was a balcony. No real view but very nice for afternoon/evening wine. Alberto was an excellent member of the staff who was friendly and efficient. The location is only a few blocks from the train station and about 10-15 minute easy stroll from Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio, etc. Good overall value. Definitely pleased and would recommend.

<Content>Good Hotel. My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in June/2007.The location is very good indeed. It is about 3 minutes walking from the train station, 7 minutes from the Duomo and no more than 10 minutes from Uffizi Gallery.The room was okay, although a bit small. It was fairly clean, and air-conditioned, which is great for Florence's summer. Breakfast was very good.The staff spoke good english, which is always a bonus. There is a computer with free internet access for guests.

<Content>Exactly what others have said... I stayed at Porta Faenza for three nights in early June. After a long trip there, the hotel was exactly what we had expected based on the reviews read here before booking. The location was perfect, about a block or two from the train station, and a 10-15 minute walk to all of the major attractions. The road itself, Via Faenza, has its own charm and immediately reminds any traveler why they came to Italy to begin with. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and quiet. Free internet access, great breakfasts, and most important, a very helpful and friendly staff that is more than willing to help you out if you need it. I will stay there again on my next visit to Florence.

<Content>very enjoyable stay at the hotel porta faenza I was very happy with this hotel. It is clean, nicely decorated and most importantly...air conditioned! (an air conditioner that you can actually feel unlike everywhere else in Florence)....The location of the hotel iwas excellent....very close to the station and very close to the attractions... overall, I was very pleased.

<Content>okay location, nice staff, okay room I guess for a three star hotel this is fine, but I've become accustomed to four star hotels so I was disappointed with Porta Faenza. The shower is tiny! I could barely fit and I am a small female. My husband was banging around in the shower everyday because it was so small. Forget about shaving your legs! On another note, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the location was convenient, and the breakfast was sufficient.

<Content>Wonderful experience! I read a lot of reviews before booking over Easter weekend April 6-9, 2007 and ended up making two reservations: one at Porta Faenza and one at Santa Maria Novella. I ultimately decided to try Porta Faenza and am so very glad I did. The hotel is located to the left (quiet part of Via Faenza) off Via Nationale from the train station.The room was huge and very clean with a very nice bath and tub. My husband was particularly happy that the room was quiet, yet sunny. There was free internet in the lobby and the breakfast was as much as one could want. The hotel staff couldn't have been nicer and were extremely friendly and helpful. There was a trattoria down the street that had great food, and a nice bar on the corner that had happy hour drinks and free appetizers.I honestly can't think of a single negative and would stay there again in a minute. It was close to everything, including the San Lorenzo street market and terrific in all ways.

<Content>Quaint, cute and comfortable We stayed at the Porta Faenza for 4 nights at the end of March 2007. We chose the hotel based on feedback from Tripadvisor. One of the reasons we chose this hotel was that we were advised not to get a hotel on a busy road in Florence, and, when we got to Florence, we realized that this was good advice! The Porta Faenza is on a side street off a busy street close to the main station. We took a train into Florence from Venice, and easily managed the 10 minute walk from the station with our luggage.The hotel is very, very quaint. We found all the people working at the front desk to be knowledgable, friendly and very helpful. They recommended restaurants, made reservations, and were always cheerful and welcoming. A great service offered by the hotel was a computer with free internet access in the lobby area.Our room was small with little space to unpack our clothes, but it was comfortable. It had two large windows which overlooked a quiet parking area - not very pretty, but nice to have some fresh air! The bathroom was small, but had everything we needed (including a towel warmer which was great for drying laundry!).Breakfasts were fine. They offered the usual Italian choice of cold meats, cheese, croissants, pastries, cereal, etc. The choice was not as extensive as the hotels we stayed in in Milan or Venice, but it was adequate.The location was fine, although it was a little far from the 'action' (the Duomo, the Ponte Vecchio, etc.) We enjoyed walking so it was not a problem for us, but if one does not enjoy exploring, you may want to stay a little closer to the river. As mentioned earlier, the location was perfect for proximity to the station or the Mercato Centrale (Central Market). Florence is a fairly small city, so nothing is really too far!If we were to return to Florence, we would stay at his hotel again. While nothing fancy, it was clean, comfortable and very quaint!

<Content>Nice little hotel This is a nice, friendly, well run little hotel. It's location is great, only a couple of minutes walk to the central train station and 5 minutes from the centre of Florence. One word of warning; if you get a room overlooking the street ask to be moved to another room as we got very little sleep on our 1st night due to traffic/general noise. Having said this, when we asked to be moved the next morning it was sorted out with no fuss and we were able to view the alternative room before we moved to make sure it was ok for us.Rooms are not huge but have all that you need for a few days stay and given some of the prices that you can pay for a hotel room in Florence I thought that this was very good value for money.

<Content>Loved Porta Faenza We ended up at Porta Faenza because it was part of a travel package through Air France. Will definitely stay here again, as the location was perfect, centrally located, near the train  bus station,  within walking distance to the duomo, and other attractions. The restaurant Pizzaria Navone is just steps away. Upon leaving the hotel, go to your right  you're there! We loved this place, unique  eclectic, great food, and reasonable prices. One night we tried two types of pizza, which was delicious, and then another evening we tried the filet mignon with pepper sauce, which was absolutely fabulous. The hotel also has internet access with free PC use just off the lobby. The elevator is small, but beats not having one, like many hotels in Europe. The breakfast, which was included in our package, was very substantial, and everything was fresh. We loved the granola/museli, which tasted like it was homemade. Front desk staff spoke English and were friendly  helpful. It was raining,  they loaned us some huge umbrellas to use. Little things like this leave a lasting impression.

<Content>Loved the Porta Faenza We loved our stay at the Porta Faenza. It was very clean and had incredibly helpful staff who went above and beyond. The location is great - it's close to so many of the things you want to do in Florence, very close to great restaurants and a 5 minute walk to the train station. There was a great cafe just up the street that was perfect for breakfast: served great coffee and brioche, was inexpensive (about 6 Euros total for 2 adults) and was quick if you needed it to be but also had tables for those who wanted to linger. We would definitely stay here again. In fact, we probably wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in Florence!

<Content>Absolutely first class Absolutely superb 3 star located 5 mins from the station and 5 mins from the Duomo. Can't praise it highly enough. Stayed in Room 1 - supposedly a single but with a double bed and huge for the price. I would urge anyone visiting Florence to check this place out. No point paying through the roof when this place does the job for half the price.

<Content>WONDERFUL March 2-4, 07 My family and I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and booked a quad. The room was spacious, clean and the staff was extremely friendly. They had a nice breakfast and free internet. The location was wonderful near the train station and we walked from the train station to the hotel w/ our luggage. It is also very near the Duomo and the Bell Tower and restaurants. This is a true gem in Florence!! I would highly rec. this hotel

<Content>Very bad service We were booked into this hotel through Expedia, we booked in November for our trip in March.When we arrived we were told the hotel was fully booked, and that they had booked us in another one and would call us a cab. That was it no apology, no explaination, nothing.We would have argued, but we decided that if that is how they treated their customers we didnt want to stay there anyway, and we would take our chances with the new hotel - The hotel Alba which was lovely, stay there instead.

<Content>Great little hotel Charming hotel, in a good central point and good value for money, 5 minute walk from Terravision bus drop off at station. Bathroom small but ok (shower 70cm sq). Everywhere clean, good selection at breakfast, friendly and helpful staff. Coffee from reception fantastic, freshly made for E1.00. A few other drinks also reasonable prices. Free internet in lobby very convenient. Trattoria Nerone 100 metres from hotel good food  value for money.Sightseeing buses do not run very frequently in Feb. Check them out if you're pushed for time. We got the No 12 bus to Piazza le Michelangelo instead - great views. Runs every 15 mins.

<Content>Great Hotel I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Helpful staff, nice rooms, perks (free internet in lobby, great breakfast)...very accommodating. We stayed here with a 7 months old, and they provided hot water to warm a bottle, crib etc. The area was very centrally located, though maybe not as nice as some of the others, though I would definitely stay here again!

<Content>Bed was Best Just got back from 5 nights in Florence staying at the Porta Faenza. We booked this hotel after reading all the rave reviews on Trip Advisor. Ideal location if travelling by public transport but you could never find it driving yourself.( Who would want to?)Have to say that it was one of the noisiest hotels we have ever stayed in - unfortunate to get room 101 at the front of the hotel - do other travellers to Florence agree that -forget the bikes, the dogs or the ambulances- the noisiest sound is the sound of cases being wheeled along medieval streets! Anyway bathroom flooded first night which staff soon solved; breakfast was adequate but very boring - particularly on day 5. The staff were pleasant and very,very helpful and the towels were all changed every day. But the best thing was the bed! One of the largest and definitely one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in - certainly in the marriott class. So, great for 2-3 days exploring, reputation is well deserved but if offered Room 101 consign it to Room 101!Bob

<Content>Great hotel I was greatly encouraged by the reviews so booked two nights here. The staff we encountered were very helpful and friendly. Our room was lovely with plenty of character. This is the quietest hotel room I have ever had - we didn't even hear anyone else on our floor. The breakfast was adequate and the location was very central - it didn't take long to work out short cuts though the back streets! With cases, it took just over 5 minutes from the train station. The trains run every 20 minutes from Pisa to Florence and takes 60 - 90 minutes, depending on whether you get the fast one or not.This hotel is well worth a visit - we will definitely be returning in the near future.

<Content>Great budget hotel Our stay at this hotel was booked thru go-today.com and turned out that it was a nice place to stay. Nothing extra special about the rooms, but comfortable and clean. The location and the staff make this a good place to stay. It is close to the train station, markets, and sites. The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable about their city, helpful with booking tours or advice on where to eat, and sympathetic with troubles I encountered with the Bank of Toscana, a bank I do not recommend using their atm or any other services. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again if I get the chance to return to Florence.

<Content>Pleasant stay at Porta Faenza Our family spent Thanksgiving week at the Porta Faenza. There were four of us including my husband and two adult children. We had a quadruple room which was very large and immaculate. The bathroom was spacious  newly remodeled. The towels were big  fluffy. The location was convenient and close to the train station. We visited several other cities via train. The Hotel Staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very good providing numerous cold choices, fresh fruits  beverages. The free internet service was a plus. I would return to the Porta Faenza and recommend it to other families etc.MargeWarwick, NY

<Content>Best hotel on our trip! By the far the best hotel we stayed at in Italy! Extremely charming, cute decor but all of the modern amenities. Our room was HUGE for a European hotel - 2 twin beds and a day bed and lots of space to move around. Large bathroom as well. Free internet access for guests in the lobby and a decent breakfast in the mornings. Very friendly, hepful staff.Also a great location, close to the train station and maybe a 5-7 minute walk to the Duomo and only about 10 minutes to the Uffizi.Only possible complaint I could come up with is they still have very antiquated hairdryers in the bathrooms, which was somewhat baffling considering how modern everything else was (they even had electronic keycards for the rooms, which you don't see often in European hotels).

<Content>Great location, great value .Stayed four nights at Porta Fanza in October 2006, the location is fantastic; quiet side street with virtually no traffic. Two minutes from railway station (but we never heard a train) and only five to fifteen minutes walk to all the major attraction. Room was clean, well equipped (small safe, TV, mini bar) and spacious with clean bedding every day. We even had a balcony (Room 303) although views were not special! There were no hot drink facilities in the room and no real lounge area, other than that we couldn't fault hotel or its staff. The nearest restaurant is well worth trying: Enzo  Pietro, for excellent value rustic Italian food and good house wine. Also, you must try Rabone, in the central covered market for lunch. Great food for just a few Euro among the friendly locals. Brilliant

<Content>Nice We were on our way to Sardenia so were only in Florence for one night. This place was perfect. Location was within easy walking distance to sights and restaurants. Room was clean; also, it was large for Italian standards although shower stall was rather small. It's within a few blocks of train station so easily walked to from there. We flew in; taxi was ~25 euros from Florence airport. Definitely, would stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel was a great place to stay. Room was small but nice and very clean, although smelled of mothballs when we first arrived. Hotel staff was very friendly and had good english skills. The hotel is very close to the train station, about a 10 minute walk. You will get water all over the floor from the shower. Just reserve a towel for the clean up. Not that you will be spending much time in the room, but the TV has no channels in English. The website advertises a bar, but its really just a few bottles and some beers behind the front desk. Dont think you'll have a spot to enjoy a cocktail before going out for the evening.The hotel is also central to all the sites and is located near some good places to eat. Try the restaurant Narvone. Good pizza and has a nice family vibe. Also try the coffee shop at the corner (walk out the front door and make a right) has excellent espresso and great pastries and sandwiches. Hotel breakfast was ok, plenty to get you going in the morning. However we ended up at the coffee shop at the corner most mornings. Overall, an excellent stay and highly recommended.

<Content>Excellent accommodations! We chose this hotel based on the reviews here and couldn't have been happier with our decision. We stayed at the Porta Faenza in Mid-august with our 8 and 12 year old. The hotel has a great central location, but is still in a quiet area. We could and did walk all over the entire city with no problems and no complaints from the little ones. It was extremely convenient since we arrived and left by train as it is very close to the station. Florence was our favorite part of our Rome/Florence/Venice trip this summer. The staff were courteous, breakfast adequate (no hot foods, but still plenty of delicious items to fill you up) and it was a nice treat to have the free interent desk in the lobby.  There was some street noise early in the morning, but we found that in every city and not sure if that's entirely avoidable anywhere as people always seemed to be rolling carts. The prices was very reasonable and the room very spacious.  Our favorite restaurant was a few doors down - Pizzeria Navone and we went back there a few times. The prices were better then tourity restaurants and the food was delicoius and fresh.  We walked around day and night and felt very safe. We rented a car one day and took a tour of Wine Country, and Siena. It was our favorite part of the trip.  We had a wonderful stay and lots of fond memories of Porta Faenza.

<Content>Porta Faenza - No need to look elsewhere The first thing we were really happy about with this hotel was the location - literally less that 5 minutes walk from th train station and only 5 minutes to the main shopping and tourist destinations. Staff were very friendly - room was quiet large compared to others we stayed in. Staff more than happy to offer suggestions and advice on where to go and what to do. Breakfast was adequate and more than we really needed. Bathroom had lots of room and shower space was quiet large compared to others we had in italy. This is a really nice hotel in a great spot with a good feel to it - I have already recommended it to friends heading to florence - which by the way is an amazing city that 2 nights was just not enough in. We were there in the middle of summer and while it was very hot and uncomfortable outside the Air conditioning in the room made it more than comfortable inside. If you are looking for a great florence hotel for a reasonable price I strongly recommend you contact Hotel Porta Faenza

<Content>Great hotel close to the centre of Florence Very nice, friendly hotel in a side street a few hundred metres from the centre of Florence. Stayed there as a family of five. Our room was light airy and clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Being a small hotel there were not lots of facilities, but there was a bar, a parking garage just round the corner (very useful in Florence)and an internet PC in the lobby for the use of guests. Everywhere was only a short walk away and we had a lovely four days in the hotel at a very reasonable rate. Would recommend

<Content>wonderful stay family of 5 from NJ, USA We stayed 4 nights in August. Very helpul and friendly front desk. Great location next to train station. We found we could walk everywhere, even The Ponte Vecchio. Breakfast was very good, delicious coffee. We loved the well near the computer (great for the kids). Lots of stores and restaurants close by, staff recommened a wonderful restaurant just down the block. The shower door is not very efficient, so be careful in the bathroom!

<Content>We call it the "Floodin' Faenza" We spent 4 nights at PF and had a great stay overall. It was near the train station (which was handy for day trips) and the market where we bought all our cool loot. There are also 2 good restaurants just feet away. The staff was always very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was good and our room was clean. Our only issues were that it was tough to get our room cool enough and the bathroom flooded like crazy everytime we took a shower. I mean CRAZY! The way the shower was designed it was impossible to keep the floor dry. We reported this to the front desk but nothing changed. Oh well. We just used all the towels to dry the floor after we showered every morning (I mean ALL the towels).

<Content>Our Home in Florence... We stayed in Florence four nights, in July 2006--two rooms--here at this charming small hotel. It is two small buildings joined together, with a nice breakfast room tucked just beyond the reception area, with a handy (gratis) internet desk right there too. Our rooms were very nice, scrupulously clean and air conditioned which was a joy in this very hot summer weather. Our two teenaged children actually had a larger twin room assigned to them than our double, the first night, and when we asked, the staff very quickly helped by giving us a similar sized room for the remainder of our stay, at the original rate. The hotel is just a short walk from the train station, a welcome haven at the end of our train trip to Florence. The location is perfect for exploring and shopping on foot. The hotel is not far from the Medici Chapel, and then not far beyond that, an easy walk to the Duomo, Palazzo Vecchio, Santa Croce and the incomparable Vivoli's, etc. We walked everywhere in Florence and found it doable, except when we took the bus up to San Mineato al Monte (you must do that for the views and for the monks singing vespers--but here is a hint not in the guidebooks, don't go down into the crypt to hear vespers unless you plan to worship as well as listen. If you are there to simply listen, stay up on the main level of the sanctuary). Oh and by the way the Ristorante Michelangelo up on that hill has great views and good food at surprisingly low prices.But, just steps from the hotel is the real gem of a restaurant, called Enzo and Pietro鈥攔un by the same family since 1932. Go there the first night and chances are you will go there every night. One other food note, when you want to have a nice al fresco in town dinner with a townscape view, go to the restaurant that you will find to the left, if you face the Palazzo Vecchio and the copy of the David statue. We had a good dinner there (we had the famous Florentine steak and pasta) for very reasonable prices, and glasses filled with...ICE! Unlike the other restaurants in that Piazza which will charge you an arm and a leg just for a Coke Lite.Do comparison shop if you go to the marts around Santa Croce--we found some marvelous shoes and handbags and the prices do run from bargains to pricey. We went back to the shops with the bargains and were glad we did.Let the folks at the front desk make your museum reservations for you. You do want to see the David and you do want to go to see the Leondardos and the view of the Ponte Vecchio at the Uffizi. It is filled with wonders, but it is a maze to get out of...

<Content>Great location, Huge room This was a great hotel on a good street. Very close (walking distance to the train station), but did not hear any noise at all in the room. We walked everywhere without any problems. Hotel staff was very friendly and breakfast had a huge selection. Our room was the biggest room I've ever seen in Europe. Would definetely stay here again.

<Content>Free Beer! About the only thing that would make this place better value would be free beer. Altough they did have free web access! We stayed at Porta Faenza in April with our three teenage children and it was fabulous. Great central location and we had one room for the five of us (not easy in Europe). The room, on the first floor was great, had lots of space, a big bathroom and very comfy beds. Staff are great and could even recommend an after hours pharmacy for a daughter with an eye complaint. We were driving (don't know why Italian drivers have a bad reputation - I found them great!) and used the Hotel's private car park which was just up the end of the street. Breakfast was great (lots to eat - and healthy too) and the choice of local restaurants was mouth wateringly supurb. We'll be back - thanks guys!

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed at the Porta Faenza on our honeymoon last July and we absolutely loved it. The rooms were immaculate and tastefully decorated and the safe in the closet was a lovely perk as was the free internet access. We would certainly stay there again.

<Content>Noisy Room Stayed at Porta Faenza 3 nights in florence with my wife. The bottom floor room in which we stayed is underneath a private apartment and the people that lived there kept me from getting any sleep due to constant noise and rumblings, at night and in the morning. The room also had alot of insects in the bathtub and slugs on the patio. One man at the front desk was helpful although with directions and stuff, but the women there was rude.

<Content>Well priced, good location The hotel is very conveniently placed on a quiet street close to the train station. It's a 5 minute walk to the Duomo and about 15 to the Ponte Vecchio. The hotel was clean and the rooms (we had 2 doubles and a triple) were very presentable. Worth noting, the third bed was a full size single and very comfortable! The reception staff were always very pleasant and helpful. Also, prior to our arrival, they had pre-booked museums and restaurants for us. Looking at the prices of hotels generally in Florence, I thought that the Porta Faenza was very good value and we certainly appreciated only having to trundle our suitcases a short distance from the station. (We flew into Pisa, which has an easy and excellent train connection into Florence).

<Content>8 days in Florence We have visited Florence before and loved it. Had a descent hotel before but after seeing all the write ups on this hotel decided to try it.We were not dissapointed, an excellent hotel at a reasonable price.Location is excellent, right in the middle of FlorenceI believe they have a garage if you wish to drive in FLorence (I don't recomend it!)All of the staff are extremely friendly, half of them speak fluent English and the other half are English! I would deffinitely strongly recommend this hotel if you are an English speaker and can't speak any Italian. They are heavily orientated towards american tourists, which also works fine for us Brits.Doesn't seem very child friendly, (which is excellent for me!), don't have baby or toddler chairs in the breakfast restaurant, (I overheard someone asking for one this morning), which was the only child we saw in the whole week. There aren't really any views out of the bedroom windows, Via Faenza is not enormously attractive to look at, nothing wrong with it though it has several useful little caffe's and mini markets to get your water from etc.We stayed in the one place for 8 days, which shows how much we love Florence, and will certainly go back to the the Porta Faenza on our next holiday there, which hopefully speaks well of the hotel.Our favourite restaurant is Trattoria Il Porcospino, go down Via Faenza towards town, turn left at the end and it is in front f you, opposite the Cappelle Medici. Food is excellent as is the service, at least one of the waiters is very funny. Avoid if you have no sense of houmour at all...

<Content>Lovely This hotel was a really nice find. very close to the major attractions and easy to find from the train station. the room was very big for european standards, and although the bathroom was smaller, there was plenty of space for me and bf. the free internet was good and the breakfast was lovely. staff were really friendly, especially the breakfast ladies who never minded when me and bf got down to breakfast late every day and still let us eat and brought us tea and coffee! the breakfast is traditional continental cold buffet style but they do have a nice selection and a cool toaster thingy for warming your croissants!

<Content>Great Hotel We just got back from our honeymoon in Italy and spend 4 nights at Hotel Faenza and loved it. The staff was very nice, they recommended a day trip of wine tasting to Chianti that was the highlight of our trip, and the hotel was clean and quiet. Free internet was a plus, breakfast was good, and location was good for getting to the train and all sights. Be sure to try the trattroia Natrone a few doors down, it was fantastic.

<Content>A good location Just returned from a great trip to Florence staying four nights at the hotel Porta Faenza. I booked this hotel after viewing many reviews and reports mostly on tripadvisors. The hotel is an easy walk from train or bus stations, main attractions are also easily reached by foot from the hotel. On checking in, the room we were given on the first floor was small, cramped and dimly lit, with little natural light coming from the one window. I asked for a different room and was offered a room on the same floor, this room was also dimly lit but was bigger and the high ceiling made it feel roomier, two windows let in plenty of light, bed was large and comfy, bathroom was not very big and was cramped, shower good. little or no noise from outside or corridors made for a peacfiull nights sleep.Breakfast was O/K the lack of a hot food option was for me slightly dissapointing, hot drinks were served by a waitress. The hotel has no seperate lounge or bar areas, a couple of seats beyond the reception area and a limited selection of drinks available from the reception, the one time we used this facility they had no white wine!!! There was also a free internet access available. All staff were friendly and helpful. Overall we were more than happy with our stay. For a short break in Florence this hotel was more than adequate.To be honest I think that some of the reviews that described this hotel as wonderful and fantastic were somewhat over the top. This hotel offered nothing more or less than I would expect from a three star hotel costing 130 euros per night. I do hope this review helps.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! I chose this hotel based on the reviews from TripAdvisor and I couldn't have been happier. This hotel actually turned out to be one of my most favorite hotels on my whole Italy tour. The service is great, I loved the way the hotel was decorated and even better, the free internet in the lobby! The concierge even set me up with a great tour of Tuscany and wine tasting. I will definitely stay here again next time I am in Florence.

<Content>What a gem! We satyed at the Porta Faenza for two nights, March 27th and 28th. We had an outstanding experience. The hotel is lovely, with a nice sitting area in the lobby where you can enjoy a cappucino after a day of sightseeing. There is also a computer available for guests to use the internet. Our room was extremely large, even by American standards. We were travelling with our two children, and our room had a Queen bed, one full and a twin. We all had space to unpack our things. The room was clean and modern. The bathroom was also clean and new, slightly tiny compared to the size of the room, but very manageable. The staff of the hotel was really wonderful, especially Sheila, who made dinner reservations for us and scheduled Uffizi and Accademia visits at our request while we were still in the U.S. The breakfast was very nice and the breakfast staff was extremely helpful and attentive. The location was ideal. About a 2 minute walk from the train station, close enough to walk with your bags;and about a 7 or 8 minute walk to the Duomo. Our 7 and 10 year old kids walked it all w/o any difficulty. Overall, we loved the Porta Faenza, it had a really warm family feel, and we look forward to staying there again.

<Content>Bargain, excellent accomodations Our family of four stayed at the Hotel Porta Faenza in Florence during March 2006. We were pleasantly surprised by the spaciousness and cleanliness of the room and the stylish modern furnishings (bathroom as well). Staff was pleasant and very knowledgable about surrounding area and history. Excellent location within walking distance of the train station and hotel parking (reasonable daily rate OF $13.00 US). Best value and accomodations of the six hotels we stayed at in Italy.

<Content>Great Hotel My wife and I stayed at the Porta Faenza March 22  23. We felt the hotel had great service, good location and the free internet was very helpful as well. The room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff always greated us with a smile and arranged for a walking tour of Florence for us. We would recommend this hotel for sure.

<Content>Fantastic! We stayed at the Porta Faenza for several days in December/January during our honeymoon. We even cancelled our last two days in another city to return to the Porta Faenza in Florence before going back to the U.S. because we loved it so much! We booked through Venere and got a great deal (about $40 below the published rate) but we were certainly not given a lower quality room! The hotel and guest rooms were beautifully decorated, very clean, and very comfortable. (My husband's only complaint was that there were very few TV channels and he would have liked to watch more BBC or CNN... but we certainly did not spend much time in our room. This was, afterall, FIRENZE!) The Porta Faenza staff was extremely warm and accommodating and even helped us find a last-minute Chianti tour on our last day in Italy. Breakfast was substantial, including meats, cheeses, cereals, breads, yogurt and fruit, and of course espresso/cappuccino. The woman who managed the breakfast room even remembered us and what we liked to drink a week later when we returned for our last two days. The hotel is on a side street; 5-10 minute walk from the train station, 15 minute walk from the Duomo, 20 minute walk from the Uffizi, and only 5 minutes from the Mercato Centrale. Overall, a fantastic place to stay in Florence. We recommend the Porta Faenza to all our friends and family, and will most definitely return on our next trip to Florence!

<Content>Fabulous Hotel at Great Price! My husband and I recently returned from a trip to Italy. I had booked all of our hotels online, relying largely on the reviews of others. I just prayed that we would not be disappointed, as we feel that lodging contributes as much to a good travel experience as food, sightseeing, shopping, etc.Our hotel in Florence--Porta Faenza--turned out to be our favorite by far. After the hustle and bustle of Rome, we welcomed the quaint charm of this hotel and of Florence. The rooms were beautifully appointed, spacious (for Europe) and spotless. The staff spoke excellent English and offered amazing service. They provided wonderful recommendations for local restaurants and answered all of our questions about local sights. A huge bonus was the computer/free Internet access available in the lobby; my husband and I were able to email friends and family with an update on our travels. There was a greater selection at breakfast than at any of our other hotels. The location was also convenient, as the train station was only a couple of blocks away. We could not believe we had found such an amazing hotel for only about $100 a night. We paid far more than that for our other rooms on this trip, and they could not compare to the overall experience at Porta Faenza.Our only regret was that our stay at Porta Faenza was the shortest of our trip, as we then moved on to Venice. My husband actually wanted to cancel our plans in Venice and just remain in Florence, largely because he found the hotel to be so cozy and comfortable! On our next trip to Italy, we plan to just stay in Florence and when we do, it will definitely be at Porta Faenza. I strongly encourage travelers to visit the hotel's website, as I cannot possibly do it justice in just a couple of paragraphs. It is a gem!

<Content>Excellent location! Traveled to Florence with a group of friends and stayed at this lovely hotel in February. The location of this hotel in Firenze was excellent. It was central to all of the major sites in the city and only one block from the Santa Maria Novella train station. The room was large and faced the street. Noise from the street was minimal with the windows closed. They served a wonderful continental breakfast each morning which consisted of juice, coffee(made to order), breads, rolls, cakes, cheese, cereals, yogurt and fresh fruit. It was very plentiful and a nice way to start the day. The staff at the hotel were great especially Shiela, Alberto, and Ann. Always helpful and accomodating. You can walk to all of the major sites from this hotel within 15 minutes. Some sites not to be missed are the Duomo, Ufizzi, Church of San Marco, Accademia, Ponte Vecchio, Mercato Centrale, Piazza Michealangelo and the San Miniato Church (for evening Vespers). Some restaurants that were outstanding included La Fontacine, Za Za and Buca Mario. The fresh pasta is a must. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel.

<Content>Great Accomodations! Our stay at the Hotel Porta Faenza was very pleasant. I found the staff to be the most accomodating - extremely helpful and very friendly. The hotel is quaint and comfortable. The breakfast provided had many tasty choices. We were a group of nine friends visiting Florence and during our stay one of our group was mugged, severely injured and taken to the hospital. The staff at the hotel were especially considerate and helpful in assisting us with all aspects of getting our friend back to the USA. Special thanks to Sheila, who went out of her way to provide whatever assistance we needed (and friendly conversation).

<Content>THE standard of service Based on the reviews here (thanks for this great site), I booked the Porta Faenza for myself and 2 adult daughters for 3 nights in Jan. 2006. It was wonderful. The room was large and clean. The only downside was the 1st night, it was street cleaning time and very noisy for us facing the street. The nice desk guy (so sorry didn't get his name) said no problem and moved us to an available quad room. Again clean, large and comfortable.The hotel is an easy walk from the train station.On our last morning we got a late start and missed breakfast time but later when I came downstairs, breakfast was still out and the nice gentleman said go right ahead, no problem. There is also internet available in the lobby. This hotel could set the standard for excellent hotel service.

<Content>A Wonderful Stay My husband and I stayed at Porta Faenza for a week during our honeymoon. We actually booked the hotel because of the good tripadvisor reviews. And it was just as lovely as everyone stated. I easily reserved the room through email and a faxed confirmation. The location was great! Near the train station but on a quiet street. Easy walking distance to wherever we wanted to go. We had a wonderful room, very quiet, up to date. Breakfast was good, the people were great and always nice. Easily recommend it to others, when we return we will be staying at Porta Faenza.

<Content>Great hospitality and accommodations! Stayed at this hotel during a 4 night visit in early December. Easy to walk to from the train station, even pulling a suitcase. Easy walking distance to Duomo and other sites. Staff is excellent, particularly Sheila. Rooms are large and in excellent condition, as are the bathrooms. Breakfast includes meats and cheeses along with the normal juices, breads, and cereals. They provide coffee per your order. All done with a smile! Nice feature is a free computer station with high-speed internet for emailing back home and keeping up with news. Fully enjoyed our stay and made visiting Florence that much better. Highly recommended!

<Content>Best Hotel of Our Trip We stayed 3 nights at the Porta Faenza - right in the middle of a 10 day trip - our first time to Italy. The Porta Faenza was recommended from a friend and it was perfect! The room was huge for Europe, shower was a little funky - but you got used to it - plus it was super clean. The location cannot be beat. The price was 80 euro - a steal for what we got! Breakfast was included. The staff was super friendly and made all sorts of reservations for us - we would absolutely stay again!

<Content>SIMPLE WONDERFUL my friend and i stayed here for 6 nights over thanksgiving week recently and it was wonderful. the hotel is very charming,yet elegant without being too stuffy. the staff is very friendly and helpful. we enjoyed the heated towel rack in the bathroom which was quiet large with deep tub, large shower and bidet...beautiful cobalt blue tiles, very nice. the room was elegant with navy blue and gold appointments, wood built-ins and wood floors. good firm beds with clean sheets everyday, (this wasn't necessary, but was nice) centrally located close to everything yet on a quiet street with little traffic. a very good value for the money, i would go back in a heart beat, you won't be disappointed! bennie stevens, yonkers, new york

<Content>Loved Hotel Porta Faenza After reading reviews on Tripadvisor, we stayed at Hotel Porta Faenza, Florence, Italy and were definitely not disappointed. It is a very charming, well located hotel with friendly, helpful staff. Our room was quiet, clean and comfortable, a very nice breakfast was served by friendly staff in pleasant rooms. Free Internet was a bonus. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it highly - it deserves its 3 star rating.

<Content>Porta Faenza - convenient, comfortable  My 2 friends and I stayed at the Porta Faenza from 10 Nov. to 16 Nov. 2005. Our very large quadruple (Room 302) was comfortable, clean, affordable, and exceeded our expectations for a 3-star hotel. Breakfast included a good assortment of continental-style offerings. The hotel staff was extremely helpful. The Porta Faenza is located in a friendly, commercial district and is within walking distance of the Santa Maria Novella train station, Piazza del Duomo, the San Lorenzo market and other places of interest. My friends and I especially loved the herbaltheria shop (natural remedies) located in the same block as the hotel. We would definitely stay at the Porta Faenza again.

<Content>Nice hotel, very helpful staff I was very happy with this hotel. It is an easy walk to the hotel from the train station. Everything in this city is within walking distance. The staff was friendly and all english-speaking. The hotel offers cafe service in the lobby so you can get a coffee, soda or wine at any time. Our room was a little loud as it was right over the street. I'm sure that this is a problem throughout the city as the roads are heavily traveled. The noise didn't bother us enough to request a new room. The free internet service also came in handy and was easy to use.

<Content>Lovely place - great location! Clean hotel with amazingly spacious rooms. Staff was gracious and helpful. Loved the free Internet access and availability of drinks - including espresso - from the hotel lobby in addition to the hotel mini-bar. (Want to take a glass of wine to your room? Just ask - prices were reasonable, too.)You really can walk here from the train station. Just turn left to Via Faenza from Via Nazionale. Everything else is close by. We will definitely stay here again!

<Content>Very charming, and would stay here again! As part of our 3-week escape to Italy this past October, my husband and I decided on booking Porta Faenza based on great reviews from this site. We're so happy we did! We stayed here Oct 18-20.The hotel is very charming, and is in a great location on a cobblestone street. I had printed out the directions posted by another reviewer, which was much easier to follow that those posted on Faenza's website.Our room, 108, faced the back, and we experienced no problems. All was great, and a really great feature is that there is a speaker in the bathroom, where you can enjoy listening to whatever TV station is currently on in the room. Cool!Breakfast was also very nice, with a large selection of pastries, cereals, mortadella, and sliced cheese. I didn't know this until the first time looking for the coffee, but one of their staff comes in to take your hot beverage order - cappuccino was excellent!The extra feature of being able to use a PC for internet is great, they even have a printer for you!This is a great hotel, and we will stay here again!

<Content>Great Hotel in a good location! I spent 4 nights here and had an excellent stay. My room was in the front of the hotel and with the window open it was a bit noisey but lets face it, it is a city and hey, close the window and the noise is gone. Good air conditioning makes this possible. If you want a good hotel with an excellent helpful staff and a nice comfortable room this is it. I would say here again and I reccomend it. I got more than I expected and I have sent much more and had much less. You won't go wrong with this one. Two thumbs up.

<Content>Great location Booked this hotel on recommendations from this site. Glad I did. The hotel is in a great location, had good rooms, breakfast, and staff. However, I do agree with many of the reviews, it is a little hard to find at first. Via Nacionale is not easily identified from the train station. Another way to get there from the train station is to depart the station on the left side and walk towards the left to the first traffic light. Cross the street and continue straight ahead for two blocks. Turn right at Via Faenza and the hotel is on the right a short way up. This was a much easier way to get there.We did eat at Enzo E Piero Via Faenza, but we did not get a recommendation from the hotel. We passed it on the way back to the hotel and decided to eat there because of the very rainy night. At 7:30, no one was there, but at 8:00 when we arrived, it was packed. We went back to the hotel to wait while we were on their waiting list (they do not take reservations) and got in about 9:30. What I did not like was that the bill was just an adding machine tape and we had to guess what each item was. I did ask for a more detail bill, but they did not understand what I was asking. I was presented with another bill, but that was not much more help. I definitely recommend this hotel. Rooms did have A/C, were clean, comfortable, and quiet. Breakfast was 7:30 - 9:30, which I thought ended a little early. We always arrived at 9 and the first morning not much was left. However, more food was always put out. Couldn't ask for a better location. Felt safe at night and the hotel was only a 20 minute walk to Ponte Vecchio (casual stroll) and there was so much in between.

<Content>Definitely would recommend Porta Faenza We three ladies stayed at the Porta Faenza Sept. 7th  8th and loved it. Our room was huge (I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and booked a quad--great idea), very clean and inviting. Our bath not only had a bathtub, but a separate shower as well. The staff was very helpful and friendly and the location was great, especially for our early morning trek to the train station. We found the location very desirable and felt safe at all times of the day walking to and from the hotel. The breakfast was very good and opened at 7:30 AM as the staff had told us. We would definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel to others visiting Florence.

<Content>Room 105 handicap accessible We were in Room 105. It was very large, about 20x17,the pergo type flooring was easy for my daughter to maneuver in her wheelchair. There was a sliding door into the HUGE bathroom, which made it easier for her to get into it by herself. There was a tub with shower, and also another shower for anyone that could not get into a tub. That one was on the other side of the bathroom with no enclosure, and drained right into the floor drain.The staff was very helpful, made dinner reservations, (If you're in town on a weekend, make sure to have reservations, we tried to go to Piero  Enzo, 3 doors down, and could not get in on Sat.)They reserved a cab for us for the A.M. of our departure to the airport.There is a laundromat towards the Medici Chapel on Faenza, About 2 blocks down.The street is brightly lit at night, we felt safe returning to our room at night.Breakfast plentiful.We ate at Il Porscupino, right next to Medici Chapel, great beef tenderloin, 18 Euros.

<Content>Excellent Accomodations I can't say enough good things about this little hotel. The location is EXCELLENT and it was very easy for us to walk everywhere. We like to be out late when we travel, so we were out 'stalking' the streets of Florence very late and never felt unsafe. The rooms in this hotel are by far the largest I have seen in Europe, esecially for a 3-star. The bathroom even had a seperate tub and shower, which was great. Everything was very clean and well maintained. The staff was very nice, especially Patricia. We enjoyed their restaurant recommendations very much. We ate at Enzo  Piero, a few doors down, twice and found it to be very enjoyable and a good value. The breakfast was very good every morning and the breakfast rooms were very spacious. The woman who organized the morning breakfast and made us coffee was fabulous and very kind.One word of caution. We had such nice weather in the evening upon our arrival that we left the window open. We were really bit up with mosquito bites the next morning! After that, we left the windows shut and left the A/C on at night and didn't have a problem. Not the hotel's fault, just the stupidity of the travelers!

<Content>Would recommend the Porta Faenza Just got back from a two week visit to Italy-four nights at the Porta Faenza. Agree with previous reviewers--good location and good breakfasts. Our room was large, but the bathroom (shower only) was miniscule. Hardly room to turn around in the shower. Mattresses were good.Helpful staff-everyone from the front desk (Beatrice was especially tolerant of all our questions) to the breakfast room. We agree with a previous reviewer who suggested they redo the directions from the train. We too walked unecessary blocks with luggage. All in all would stay there again, but ask for a larger bathroom.

<Content>Great Place to Stay Just returned from spending 5 days at the Porta Faenza hotel in Florence.Rooms:-----Had a large room (303) with a small balcomy facing in onto the courtyard. Room was pleasant and good sized, very clean and nicely furnished. Had a seperate shower / tub.Food:----Breakfast was good: Selection of fresh fruit, and an array of good quality pastries, cereals, yoghurts and cakes. Coffee freshly made and of good quality, much better than some other hotels in Italy.Location:-------Via Faenza is very handy for the train station, as others have said: Also easy to walk from there straight down to the Duomo and other sites in the centre of town. The area has a few backpacker hostels nearby, so seems lively with student travellers, but always felt like a safe place to be, even late at night.Staff:----Staff were always helpful and friendly towards us: Although we hadnt booked an early check-in, we were allowed to our rooms when we arrived at 8.00 am. Good recommendations for places to eat nearby. Overall:-----Had a great time staying here: This would be my first choice hotel when I return to florence.BTW: I can thoroughly recommend the restaurant il pizzaiolo if you want a pizza:  Cheap and *excellent* pizzas there...get there when it opens (7.30pm) as it gets crowded quickly

<Content>A lovely hotel with big rooms We stayed here for the last 3 nights of a 2 week tour of North Italy. This was the nicest hotel we stayed in. Our first room definatelty had the 'Wow' factor. This was a massive room, with painted ceilings and a good sized bathroom with shower cubicle plus a deep bath. Unfortunately, our first nights sleep was a bit of a nightmare due to a neighbours dog who decided to bark all through the night and then we were prematurely woken by workmen banging around on a nearby building.Due to lack of sleep we were a little upset that the room was not better sound-proofed. As we did not wish to spend our whole stay with ear plugs (as forced to in the previous night) we spoke to reception to see if we could be moved to a quiter room. The receptionist was very helpful and gave us a choice of 3 other rooms. We settled for a front-facing room on the 3rd floor. We had peaceful nights sleep and even had a terrific view of Florence. For a great meal and night out, go to Za Za's. Amazing food and wine. If you like steak, don't miss this place. We would definately recommmend this hotel. It is a gorgeous little Hotel with brilliant rooms. Try to avoid the back-facing rooms, unless you have a bone to throw that barking dog !

<Content>Better directions from train station We enjoyed our stay in Porta Faenza. The staff was both nice and helpful to us. However, the directions posted for walking from the train station need to be improved. We walked up and down looking for via Nazionale and were getting quite frustrated. We finally started down a street that LOOKED like it should be the right one (based on the map) and sure enough, one block down it becomes via Nazionale. However, at the train station the street is labelled something else (sorry I didn't write it down).So my instructions would be to exit the train station and walk toward the green island and church. The bus stop will be to your left. At the very end of the bus stop is the street that turns into via Nazionale. Go down that street 2 blocks and turn left onto via Faenza.I hope this helps someone.

<Content>Porta Faenza - best hotel in Florence My husband and I have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Porta Faenza. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. The staff were the most pleasant we have ever enountered and we especially liked Alberto. Our room was very large and the air conditioning worked so it was great to escape the heat in the afternoon for a siesta and our bed was so comfortable, we slept like logs! The maids changed our room every day and supplied us with fresh towels etc. The breakfast was fantastic. There was a good choice of croissants, bread rolls, meat, cheese, yoghurts, fresh fruit, biscuits and cakes. It was ideally placed to explore the whole of Florence and we were a mere 10 minute walk from Duomo. We got some great tips of where to eat from Alberto and can highly recommend Za Za's and also a trattoria which goes by the name of Nutti. We went out at night and felt entirely safe walking back to the hotel. I would totally disregard any negative comments from previous reviews regarding the staff. They were all wonderful, so helpful. We have said that if we do return to Florence, Porta Faenza is the ONLY hotel we will stay at. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed here with my parents in April 2005. We had a triple room that was quite large. You could actually sleep 4 or 5 in this room because the couch was a futon as well. Like I said before the room was large and clean, it was next to the street which was quiet except for scooters that passed occasionally.The location was pretty good. 5 minute walk from the train station and a 15 to 20 minute walk from the center of Florence - Ufizi Gallery, The Duomo, etc.This was the best hotel we had in Italy during our 8 or 9 days there. (we also stayed at the Hotel Miami and the Hotel Canada in Rome) There is little not to like about this hotel, plus we got it for a great price in my opinion.

<Content>Very Disappointed This did not appear to be a three star hotel. The rooms were tiny (even by European standards) and not well-appointed. There were dust balls on the floor when we arrived. There were no carpets or rugs in the rooms. In the bathroom, all three drains were slow, causing water to accumulate in the sink, shower and bathtub while using them. The mirror in the bathroom was stained. The hose for the shower head in the bathtub was broken and leaking. The linens did not appear fresh (or particularly clean).There were very little space for putting clothing away except for a very small space for hanging clothes and three tiny drawers, one of which was broken (did not open). There were two of us in the room, and we could not unpack our suitcases. Breakfast was limited to 7:30 to 9:30, which is not very accommodating to travelers from different locations, or for those who want to get an early start on their day. One morning I arrived for breakfast at 7:40 am and the doors to the breakfast room were closed. I had to find the staff person responsible for opening it up, and she seemed annoyed with me with I asked for her to do so. There seemed to be only one iron for the entire hotel, which you had to return right after using. There were no ironing boards at all.The neighborhood left a lot to be desired. I did not feel safe walking back to the hotel at night; I took taxis if it was not daylight.The free internet service in the lobby was a plus.

Do not take a cab as we did, as the hotel is literally one street away from the station and walkable in about 5 minutes, truthfully. Cab ride was 15 euros. Hotel is cute, good reasonably priced cappucinos, usual breakfast as in all other hotels. Accomodation was good value for the price. 130 Euros quad occupancy. Located close to the market and walking distance to all attractions. Safe to walk in area even at night. We did however find it a bit away from the action especially at night and next time I will likely stay closer to the Ponte Vecchio, shopping area as the nice coffee shops, shopping is all in this location.

<Content>Wow, wow, Wow! This was the best hotel stay I have experienced in a long time. The staff and service was outstanding. Our room was spacious. Everything in the room worked. The entire hotel was meticulously decorated and furnished in the most eco-friendly and historically preserved way. Many of the old parts of its structure were centerpieces in its design. The utilities in the room would not work without a key being in the control panel, so you could not leave the lights on and waste electricity when you were not in the room. If yuo open the window, the AC automatically shuts off. In all, it was apparent that Florentines are generally eco-conscious. I just never imagined going to that level of detail in addition to the old we'll wash the towels on the floor idea. I hope to return to Florence, and I would not even consider staying anywhere else.

<Content>Great place to stay I followed a friends advice and booked upgraded rooms at all our hotels. In this case, I booked a quad-room when only a triple was needed. The room was spacious, well furnished and clean, and the bath room was spacious. As always, we asked the hotel staff where we could get good food at a reasonable price. We were pleased with the results. Even with heavy luggage the Porta Faenza was an easy walk from the train station. The Duoma, Medici Place and the Galleria Accademia are all easy walks from the hotel. One day we took the bus to San Croce and walked back via Uffize and Porte Vecchio. The Hotel staff members were very friendly and helpful. The free Internet corner came in handy. We wil definitely go back if staying in Florence.

<Content>Yes...give the Porta Faenza a Try Good location, especially if you're traveling by train. We easily rolled our bags back and forth and it was close to the rental car facility to get our car for Tuscany. The hotel itself is very clean and nicely furnished. The desk clerks were all helpful, especially the young lady who helped us with several phone calls when we had to do a quick change of plans. (museum strike for a day).Conveniently, the best restaurant we ate in in Florence was right next door! Enzo and Piero's is a locals place with fabulous fresh foods and excellent prices. It was so nice to have only a 20yard walk to our room after a 3 course meal of Tuscan specialties. The other good restaurant was Bibo's in the Oltarno, just across the Ponte Vecchio. Great Florentine steak and deadly grappa. Porta Faenza is a good home for a stay in Florence.

<Content>Excellent Location, Great price We went to Florence for our honeymoon and what a great place to stay. The rooms are clean, staff are very friendly; comparing with other hotels in Italy this was a big room. The best location (5 minutes walk from the train station, 5 minutes walk from the Duomo).

<Content>Great Time at Hotel Porta Faenza The Hotel Porta Faenza was our home away from home in Florence. It is very near the Santa Maria Novella train station, but on a quiet little street. It is near most of the main attractions -- we walked everywhere and one of our group is in a wheelchair. A 7 minute stroll to the Duomo, 10 minutes to the Academie and a 15 minute walk to the Uffizi. It's convenient location also made a side trip to Pisa and our travel to Rome via train very easy. There are plenty of little restaurants nearby, we liked Il Porscupino which was three blocks away--fresh pasta and friendy service. The room was large and clean and was handicap accessible as advertised (and was much better than the room at the four star hotel we stayed at in Rome). The breakfast was fine, mainly croissants, cereal and some meats but there was enough variety that we didn't tire of it after 6 days. We booked this based on all of the reviews on Trip Advisor. The staff at the Hotel were extremely pleasant and welcoming and genuinely interested in doing what they could to ensure we had a pleasant holiday. They booked our reservations to the Uffizi and Academie for us and even made arrangements for laundry and offered friendly input.

<Content>Reasonable Value Based on reviews on this site we stayed here one night in May. Hotel is close to the station and within walking distance of the major attractions.There are a number of good restaurants and cafes in the area.The hotel rooms are larger than normal for Europe and the bathrooms are fine. The aircon works well. Beds are a little hard and uncomfortable but after a day walking the streets of Florence you soon forget that.The buffet breakfast included in the room price is excellent with quite a large choice. The coffee is outstanding! The staff were efficient and friendly and spoke fluent English. There is guest access to the internet in the foyer. Prices rise considerably during the shoulder and peak season. I would think the latter is overpriced for this 3 star hotel but we thought our shoulder rate reflected the value of the hotel. Can recommend it.

<Content>A Charming hotel with a great staff This hotel is located in a great location. The hotel staff was so helpful to us (Anne). We forgot some medication in Venice and Anne called the hotel in Venice to have it DHL'ed directly to the Porta Frenza the next day. You are only a few minutes away from the city center and the train station. The hotel made our honeymoon a special occasion with their great service. Towels and sheets are changed everyday. The only downside was the pillows were to flat, but thats all I can say that is negitive about this hotel. They do have a garage if you are planing on driving to Tuscan towns. If we ever go back to Florence we will stay there. We stayed in four hotels in Italy and this was by far the best.

<Content>Just the right fit Stayed at the Porta Faenza based upon reviews on the Trip Advisor. Price was reasonable and location were a plus as we came into Florence from the airport by bus and left for Rome by train and the Porta Fanza was close to both locations. Room and bath were clean and nighttime street noise was minimal. Breakfast was the typical rolls, cereal, meat and cheese. The desk clerks and staff were pleasant and helpful. There were no surpises on the bill. One thing that may create a problem, which I had not run into before was the booking of tours from the hotel (it may be unique to this hotel or a Florence thing) but when booking a tour or tours they wanted the amount due in cash at check-out, I had misunderstood this and thought it was just going to be on my hotel bill, since I did not have that kind of cash on me at check-out they took my AMEX card, but it was a bit of an awkward situation.

<Content>Excellent place to stay! We stayed at Porta Faenza for 4 nights and we enjoyed our stay very much. We would stay there again. Our hotel room was huge as was the bathroom - we even had a deep soaking tub! Our room faced the street so it was a little noisy, but OK with the windows closed. Our room was spotless and kept that way. The included breakfast was a typical continental breakfast and very good. The hotel staff was friendly, helpful and spoke excellent English. They made reservations for us at the Uffizi and Academia. All major sites are within walking distance although Pitti Palace is a bit far and the cobblestones are hard on your feet. Santa Maria Novella and the train station are just a couple of blocks away. There is a laundromat about 3-4 blocks way, turn right on leaving the hotel and turn left on Via Nationale. The laundromat is signed in English as well as Italian and contains and Internet point (.50 E for 15 mintues).

<Content>Good 3-star hotel Hotel location is good. Near train station, Duomo, San Lorenzo market. Staff was pretty helpful with directions and suggestions. Hotel is nice; not overly fancy or deluxe, but comfortable. Room was huge, as was bathroom. But furnishings were rather plain, and bed was a bit hard. Breakfast was good. Overall, it's about what I'd expect for a 3-star rated place. Would consider staying there again.

<Content>Nice, clean, in a great location I came to beautiful Florence for 7 days to explore its magnificent art and architecture. The hotel was nice, and in a quiet neighborhood. The staff was very polite and helpful, and the price was good. The room was a bit small, yet, clean, with a large bathroom. and the train station was within a short walking distance. One can buy mineral water from the reception since tap water is not recommended for drinking.  Though I am complimenting the hotel, I would like to add that as I have arrived, I was politely taken to a horrible room on the ground floor, without any window. I was horrified by the thought that I would have to spend 7 nights in that creepy room. I told the receptionist that I would rather sleep on a chair near the reception, so he gave me a nice room. This experience was really unnecessary. After that, I had a wonderful and pleasant stay.

<Content>Nice hotel We stayed for two nights in early April and found the hotel to be in a good location with comfortable accommodations. The staff was also helpful with directions, finding hours for museums, etc. It is not as warm and hospitable as a BB, but for a busy city like Florence, it is comfortable and I can definitely recommend it.

<Content>Decent hotel with good location My wife and I stayed for 2 nights in early April. We found the hotel to be a good place to stay and a relatively good value.The hotel is close to the train station and provides a good point of access to easily walkable Florence. The Duomo, Uffizi and other sites are all within a 10 minute walk. The street is relatively quite so even though our room overlooked the street we were able to sleep with the windows open.The decore is dated and the walls and floors show signs of wear, especially in public spaces. The bathrooms are decent, but not too large. The linen is changed every day. However, if you are looking for glamorous lodgings, this is not the place. Porta Faenza is a good functional hotel.The best part of the hotel is the staff. Extremely friendly and helpful. We also enjoyed the Trattoria Enzo e Mario right down the street.

<Content>Great location, charming hotel This hotel is located within walking distance of the Santa Maria Novella train station, a great straw market, Duomo, and many other tourist sites. The hotel has been refurbished and modernized. It definitely had a lot of character. The ceiling was made out of bricks! Our room was small, as expected, and had no views but served its purpose. It was clean and comfortable. Front desk staff was helpful and spoke fluent English. Breakfast was adequate, complete with breads, cereals, fruits, meats, and cheeses. We got a great deal through hotels at $106 per night.

<Content>Footloose in Firenze My husband and I have just returned from a wonderful week in Florence and we stayed at Porta Faenza the entire time. It is a really sweet little hotel. It is easy to find and very close for any one walking from the bus or train station. The hotel is well kept and is decorated with interesting funky old stuff. Our room was immaculate and quiet, except for the occasional banging door (the doors are tricky to close). Our room on the top floor had a view over the roof. The room seemed small at first, but then I realized it was because the bed was huge! The staff was pleasant and helpful and called to make reservations for us at several of the museums so that we could avoid the long lines. The night clerk cleaned out his change drawer for us when we needed change for the airport shuttle (a real deal at 4 euro.) We enjoyed the daily breakfast and loved the charming attendant who came around and took our coffee orders. I see someone mentioned Enzo and Piero's. I wasn't particularly impressed with the food. In the European style, the portions are smaller and there is the included service charge. They were happy friendly people but their food was fairly average and my chicken cacciatore had bone chips in it. We discovered the mercado near San Lorenzo and bought bread, cheese, fruit, etc. and made one meal per day a picnic. The cheeses were incredible and so were the olives. There is a little eatery in the mercado called Pork's that is a little rough around the edges, but we ate there twice and the homemade gnocci with leek cream sauce (at E. 4.20) was the best deal and the most delicious pasta I ate in Florence. Also, the hot chocolate is delicious. The hotel has free maps to help you find your way around. Walk to the Piazzella Michaelangelo through the pleasant streets of Oltrarno, see the great views of Florence and ride back. Take the number 12 or 13 bus for a trip through the back streets you would ordinarily never see or the D bus for a quicker trip to the station. The bus is only one euro. It is clean and safe.I must say that I read these revews when I was in the process of selecting a hotel, and found them very helpful. However, alot of people tend complain about things like room size, weird showers, etc. It really helps if you can leave your American expectations behind and just appreciate the European experience for what it is: different!

<Content>Excellent for a 3-star We got a great deal from Expedia.ca for this hotel. We stayed here for the last 3 nights out of 8 nights in Florence. The first hotel was part of a package deal. It was okay but not as nice as this hotel. The room was a lot bigger. Only problem is if you are a big man like my husband, you might find the shower stall, which is 2 ft x 2 ft, too tight. The breakfast was also a bigger spread that our first hotel. There is also an excellent restaurant next door, Enzo Trattoria, and a cafe which serves sandwiches and coffee cheaper than cafes closer to famous buildings and monuments. Very convenient location but quiet street.

<Content>Would stay here again My wife and I stayed here and had a very pleasant time. It has a great location and is on a quiet street right near the train station. The staff was very pleasant and helpful and the breakfast was very good. My only complaints/comments are that the website says they have a computer for the internet, which they do not, and the breaker kept tripping when my wife would use her hair dryer.If you need internet there is a great place across from the Pitti Palace. You buy a block of time and come and go as you please. Nice staff there and there is a bathroom.

<Content>It was OK This hotel is well located for all the major sights of Florence. However after reading other reviewer's reports we may have been unlucky as our room was the smallest we had in our 6 hotels stays in Europe and was quite claustraphobic. The staff were friendly, breakfast was OK but would rank it at the bottom of the list of other hotels we stayed at on this trip. However I think it is still a nice hotel to stay at if in a better room.The real highlight was the Trattoria Enzo and Piero which is located about 20 metres away. The food there was quite fantastic (we ate there on 3 nights) and the staff delightful especially Aldo who alternated between cooking and waiting on tables. We also ate at another Trattoria a little further away called La Guida which was good but not in the same class as Enzo and Piero.

<Content>Warm hospitality We decided to stay at the hotel based on some of the comments on this website. We were very pleased with our spacious room, separate tub and shower bathroom, and the warm, attentive staff. During our stay in Florence, we wanted to see everything but the lines were very long even during the month of Feb-Mar. The hotel staff offered to make reservations for us which made everything easier. They even called to confirm our flight back home. The breakfast was okay...no hot food, but it sufficed. They have a morning attendant that will offer coffee, cappuccino or expresso to have with your breakfast. The only qualm I have is that the window in our room faced the Faenza street. During all hours of the night, you can hear conversations and cars driving by. Ask for a room away from the street. Other than that, our stay was wonderful! We will definitely stay there again and recommend this hotel to our friends.

<Content>Great Value This is an excellent hotel for the price, great location. Only a short walk from the train station. With in walking distance to all sites. Great outdoor market at San Lorenzo, just down the street. The hotel had a nice breakfast, cheese, meats, breads, cereal. The rooms were spacious, comfortable beds with crisp sheets. Very clean. Would stay here again.

<Content>great hotel My shopaholic girlfriends and I stayed here in September. The rooms were extreamly spacious (for 3 women with lots of luggage)!! The room itself and bathroom was very clean!! Hard wood floors and tiles, well lite and descent furniture. The staff friendly and helpful, buffet breakfast was descent. The location was good too, 10 min from train station (2 min by cab), 5 min to the cathedral(duomo) square. The price was really descent too, overall this is an all around great hotel. We are returning to this hotel in May 2005.

<Content>Great Place to stay Alberto Porta Faenza is located in Florence at Via Faenza. It is just a 2- 3 block walk from Santa Maria Novella train station. It is newly remodeled. Has one of few elevators in Italy that several people can board at one time and haul luggage. All the staff speak English and all have great personalities, friendly, and helpful. Breakfast was excellent with several meats, cheeses, fruit. Excellent restaurants around there.Rooms were spacious and cleaning service excellent. The various piazzas are a distance away but within 20-25 minutes walking time.The open air market (leather, you name it) at San Lorenzo is just a few blocks away. The room rate posted on the door cited 206 Euros a nite. We bought a trip package thru Go-Today, so of course we didnt pay that. This is a 3 star at least and closer to a 4. I would stay there again.

<Content>Good Value We stayed for four nights in early November. The room was suprisingly large and the staff was very friendly. The breakfast was plentiful and above average. The hotel was very conventiently located, especially to the train station. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>An Excellent Choice We spent 8 nights at the Porta Faenza and were very happy with the accomodations and the price (package through Expedia). The staff is very friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and of average size for Europe, it is fairly quiet, and it has an excellent location. Loved the fresh, crisp linens each day. The free breakfast is a nice perk, though don't expect a typical American style spread. The decor is a step up from a typical 3 star hotel. There are some nice restaurants close by and of course the Mercato. Highly recommended for the price.

<Content>Nice place My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights during our tour of Europe in late October. I concur with previous comments regarding the large, clean room, friendly staff and great location. One exception being that our bathroom was quite small, especially the shower stall. The hotel is situated on a relatively small street so that traffic, i.e., noise, from the outside was minimal. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Deal Nothing more to add that you won't read from the other reviewers. This place is just a dynamite deal. The breakfast spread was great..fruit, variety of cereals, typical European cold cuts spread, great breads.We took the train from Rome...10 minute walk to the hotel on a quiet street. Room was BIG...just like on their web page.Great bathroom...shower..tub.Can walk most anywhere you need to go.. 10 min from Medici Chapel.. 15 min from the Doumo. Great view from top of the Doumo if you want to hike 463 steps. Cool indoor food market 10 min away , around a corner or two towards the Medici ChapelHint. We rented a car, drove back thru Sienna ( fyi, stayed a night at the Pallazo Ravizza, will write a review on that hotel)on way to Rome. If you do this and use Hertz..make sure you use the downtown office. Its right near the train station, can walk to it.

<Content>Perfect - stay here! I endorse everything written below. This is a delightful hotel with plenty of character. The staff did indeed know us by sight within a couple of days and knew which keys to give us without asking. The beds were changed daily and the hotel is spotless. I was delighted to find that my top floor room had its own sun terrace with chairs and a table. This hotel is ideally placed for both the station and all sightseeing and the wonderful market of quality leather goods and indoor food market is just a few mins walk away. There are many small 'cafes' selling rolls and pizza and a very good restaurant with comprehensive menu just a few yards down the Via Faenza. I would stay here again and would recommend my friends to do likewise. For internet access I registered with 'Internet Train' who have many sites around the city. Its about 3 euros for an hour. You will need photo id to register. The nearest is about 5 mins walk from the hotel. There is another internet point a few doors away who are independent.

<Content>Charmed! I was charmed by Hotel Porta Faenza and cannot say enough good things about it! In every way it was the most lovely hotel we stayed at in Italy. Delightful interior spaces with lovely design touches on a nice, quiet street just five minutes walk from the busy main drag ... and the proximity to the train station could hardly be better. I did not feel that being so close to the train station was unsafe at all. Our room also was a very good size, very tastefully appointed and with an incredible hand-hewn ceiling, the likes of which you'd never see in a US hotel room. Breakfast was lovely and staff was VERY friendly and helpful ... ask for directions to La Congrega for dinner. Excellent fresh pasta w/porcini mushrooms ... we had a raucous evening there with other American travelers, (who knew friends of ours in LA!) and kept the very accomodating proprietors awake past their bedtime!

<Content>Michelangelo would be proud Fantastic hotel with friendly, useful, attractive staff in great location. Rooms are excellent size and clean, with a safe. Desk staff reserved tickets for us at the Uffizi and Accademia for no charge, and called ahead to our hotel in Pisa to notify them of our late arrvial. All with a smile. We were allowed to check in earlier than their agreed time, so we could put our bags in the room and go out for lunch. The night porters were friendly whatever time we turned up after going out in Florence. And the breakfast lady was always pleasant. Not a bad word to be said, best hotel ever!
