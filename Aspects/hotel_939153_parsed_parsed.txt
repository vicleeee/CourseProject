<Content>What a rip off - avoid like the plague We stayed in Chifley Potts Point for 2 nights over new years. One would expect to pay a premium for new years, but $270 per night for this dump was a bit much.We arrived at the hotel a bit early, to find out that we could not check in until 3pm - international check in is 2pm...The staff on check in were OK, it was the room that REALLY let the place down.For a start, the pictures that they use for advertising are not from the hotel. The rooms are only just above a hostel level. Plain white walls  plain white bed sheets (just sheets, no other covering).The bathroom has to be the piece de resistance though. First the smell - a constant vile smell of urine. Then the shower - a plastic hose connected to the taps that jumped out of its holder when ever you turned on the water.This would all have been bearable, except for the fact the air conditioning did not work for more that 10 minutes at a time. After that the Air Con control would display FAULT and refuse to work. The air con was reset, it broke again. A service man came up and dismantled the air con, it broke again. It was reset again, it broke again. The staff made no attempt to offer an alternative room, offer a fan or anything else to help deal with the 30+ degree Celsius heat.Overall, a very disappointing experience. I would rather sleep on the street than be ripped off by this dump again!

<Content>Basic indeed This was one of the most basic hotel rooms, although I have to say it was pretty clean. The lobby/reception pictures online looked really beautiful, so after a quick look at the bedrooom pictures it was booked. It's fine if you get it really cheap, because it's so basic... location is okay, if you're prepared to walk around in the Cross! Far more Kings Cross than Potts Point, I wish I'd looked at this site before booking.

<Content>We won't be back - Thanks to fraudulent ads What a terrble emabarrassment !  Chifley Potts Point Ad in online booking site shows picture of Wooloomooloo Wharf Hotel, tricking travellers into thinking this is the Chifley. This is totally dishonest, misleading conduct of the worst kind. Ad also reads address as Potts Point but hotel Chifley is actually slap dang in THE SLEAZIEST AND NOISIEST STREET IN KINGS CROSS bar none.We booked Cifley with some overseas guests , not having time to research. WHAT AN EMBARRASSMENT !!! NEVER AGAIN. It has blighted both ours and their view of Sydney. So little time , so many other places to visit which are much nicer.

<Content>Did not enjoy my stay at Chifley Potts Point Check in - receptionist did not smile, was not warm or the slightest bit friendly, did not advise of services of the hotel or restaurant times. It was the duty manager who checked me in. Room - Lock was broken and could not get into room initially- No working space- There was no area to plug in my laptop- Bed was hard, pillows were 100 years old- Bits of chewing gum stuck on the outside ledge of my window- Large/long room but needed another piece of furniture added as it looked awkward with so much empty space- Scuffs marks on walls Bathroom- Mirror smudges- Piles of sand in the in the corners- Black hair everywhere (not mine)- Mould on tiles in the shower- Rust marks in the bath (15 of them)- No hook for the clothes line- Where the hook was previously been has fallen off and ripped the wall tiles off- I was taller then the shower head Bar and restaurant- Only 4 people in bar- Did not get acknowledge for 15 minutes even though we were sitting at the bar looking at them to be served- They served a staff member before us and she knew we were waiting to be served- Bar manager greeted us at the restaurant then yelled across the room to get the other staff members attention- We were the only people in the restaurant all evening and they burnt the garlic bread- Fish was dry and had no sauce- Menu suggested home made chips - chips were straight out of a bag- Waited a good 20 minutes between bread and main meal Breakfast- Only 2 people in for breakfast- Very minimal choice, no fresh juice, no egg station- Did not get charged for breakfast  Gym- no gym on site - had to pay $10 at Fitness First across the road Hallways- Scuffs mark everywhere- Open car boards with stained blankets and old pillows thrown in and the door could not close. Positives- Most staff were lovely- Carpet looked ok to.

<Content>Don't stay here if you want any sleep! Rooms are basic and clean, the walls are paper thin,and the noise from the Cross was horrendous, even on the 9th floor-shame they didn't fork out for double glazing when they refurbished.2 of our 4 nights there were loud parties on our floor with yelling and doors slamming all night. reception told me after the first night that the culprits had checked out, untrue, and we had to endure another night of parties, I complained to reception at 2am who sent someone up. The party stopped for all of 1/2 hour. Next morning when I complained (again) reception told me that they had all snuck back in and there wasn't much they could do about it!!!!! We were finally moved (very reluctantly) on the 4th night to another floor. The aircon was broken and pumped out hot air (it was over 30 degrees outside) and the window wouldn't open- we could hardly breath. We returned from dinner at 12.30 am to assurances it had been fixed- it had not. We were once again reluctantly moved at 1am. Not a 4.5 star experience. The staff were friendly but mostly very unhelpful and gave us false information on several occasions. You can do better for your money. I wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Had a great time! My teenage daughter and I stayed for the weekend, on a short break to meet up with friends. I had read reviews about noise so asked for the highest floor possible, and with bay views. Our room (1406) must be the one on the brochure..fantastic. Quiet with a great view.I agree with others that this is definitely Kings Cross, however I found the place so lively day and night that it wasn't at all an intimidating area. Everything is 24 hours, good reasonably priced places to eat nearby. Trains leave very frequently for the city, but it's also a lovely walk down via Finger Wharf and botanic gardens to Opera House. I would absolutely stay again and stay on harbour -(Victoria St) side of building as we found it nice and quiet.I booked via hotel website which was best deal over other internet offers. Only negative for whole stay was that neighbour's room service trays were left outside our door all day and night.

<Content>Disappointingly basic The Chifley would have been ok if we had wanted just a basic bed in KingsCross, except that the hotel rating, description and pictures had given us higher expectations. After comparing budget hotels on web, the Chifley seemed like a bargain: 4 1/2 stars for the price of a Holiday Inn or YMCA, stylish rooms, and in PottsPoint: wow! The reality is it's in the middle of KingsCross, overlooking (and hearing) strip clubs and street partying and misery. Our standard room had a good bed but was no more stylish than a hospital room. And the hotel entrance is a little bit dodgy and reminded us of a night club.Overall, except for the street noise on Saturday night, the Chifley Potts Point is ok: it has got the basics right: public transport at the door, walking distance to everything (for serious walkers like us), and a comfortable  clean bed. But it's just that.If we were to stay in that area again and were on a budget, I think I'd look at the Holiday Inn, much prettier, which is just across the road and I am sure is a lot quieter. Around the corner was also a Formula 1 and I suspect could have been good value. But personally now that I've walked around the city, next time I'll stay closer to Hyde Park.

<Content>Nice, but could have been so much better!! My Partner and I spent 5 nights here during a quick break in sydney. Chose hotel due to location and room rate. Chifley is close to many restaurants, bars, a Coles supermarket and the best gelato shop ever...called Messina. Worth a visit.Hotel was in a good location in relation to the train and bus services (right above the kings cross station)...however be prepared for the sights and sounds of this busy and vibrant area of sydney..it has it's good and not so good points.Room was large and decor pretty good for the price we paid, however the hotel atmosphere was somewhat lacking. The hygeine of the bathroom especially was a bit dodgy..but we survived.The reception was on level two of the hotel, but the entrance was on ground level..a modern area, but very dark, with dingy lighting and nobody at the Concierge desk ..(we saw not one staff member at this so called concierge desk during our entire stay!..which we feel was very dissapointing indeed).Whilst we enjoyed our stay and absolutely loved Sydney we would probably look at different options next time.

<Content>Ripped off - twice. My wife and I stayed at the Chifley for three nights early in September 2008. On check in we were impressed with the look of the place and the room we were given - pretty new, well appointed and roomy enough. Unfortunately the first night was Saturday night and even ten storeys up the noise from Kings Cross was pretty disturbing. We booked because the hotel is called Chifley Potts Point - if we had known it was actually smack in the middle of Kings Cross we might not have bothered.However for the next couple of nights the noise wasn't really a problem - except early on Monday morning when the people in the next room started talking.My big gripe is that, as we were going on the road, I was accumulating one and two dollar coins for laundry, and I left about $15 - $20 in change on the desk. Sadly when we came back from a day out, the room had been cleaned and the clean-out included all but $2 of my change. When I complained, the desk staff were a bit non-committal but shortly after that a chap came and checked who had entered our room during the day, and I thought we might get a result. Several weeks later I have received absolutely no communication from the hotel as to where my money went or even to apologise for this gross breach of trust.To add insult to injury I have now discovered two charges on my credit card, attributed to 'Crest Management' for $12.95 each, even though we didn't watch any movies, use the minibar, make any calls or incur any other charges. It wasn't till I read another review and discovered that the hotel was formerly called the Crest that I realised this crowd had charged me for absolutely nothing. I will be making a formal complaint but if you are considering staying in this place think again.

<Content>More Kings Cross than Potts Point Let me start by saying that the hotel is more Kings Cross than Potts Point, as anyone who's looked at the street location on a map will see straight away. This is fine - it makes for an interesting stay in an interesting part of Sydney, with great eating options just outside your door.The room was nice, done in shades of chocolate brown, including the carpet, however this means every bit of lint shows up and it's very easy to see if the room has been vacuumed after it's been serviced in the morning.I agree with a previous reviewer that:- The aircon is noisy. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the white noise helps cover the noises from the street (esp. on a Saturday night :)- The bathrooms are not really anything special, but generally fine.- You can certainly hear the neighbouring room guests if they are chatty.I essentially enjoyed our stay in Kings Cross (3 nights) and the room was superficially very nice (including widescreen LCD TV, albeit the picture was stretched as it didn't have a digital box), however I can state that around $10 in small change went missing from the room, and despite reporting this to reception and having them promptly check the electronic door lock to see whom had been there last, we had no resolution, and not even a follow up call.Granted there is a safe in the room, and you can be sure we kept all our valuables in in after that, however you would think some small change scattered across the desktop would still be safe in a hotel such as this. Very disappointing.

<Content>Didn't meet expectations My partner and I paid $180 AU for the package which included a botle of wine and breakfast for two, in the harbour-view room. This was more than we were planning to spend, but it was our first holiday together, and thought it might be nice, especially since there was so much talk of the refurbishments.The location was absolutely excellent. Right in Kings Cross, amidst all the action. The room was supposed to be 10th floor and above, but somehow we ended up on the 6th. Maybe a minor detail, but we were excited about the sky-high views, and it didn't entirely deliver.When we arrived we were checked in and went up to our room with no mention of wine, so we assumed it would be in our room. It wasn't, and we had to go back down to ask about it. I guess make sure you remind the staff at reception what is meant to be included?The room was rather bare, so I suppose if you're a true minimalist it will work for you, but I'm more about the little extras, and there were definitely none. The bathroom was pretty unexciting, even though it had a bath. Water flowed readily all over the bench-tops, which got a bit annoying.THE AIR CON IS THE NOISIEST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. Made it a little hard to relax and get to sleep. Honestly, it sounded worse than an old washing machine.The bed was nice, and we were able to wheel it around the room easily, which was fun. The tv seemed small-ish at first, but the clear, bright picture meant that we ended up having to sit further away anyway, so can't complain there!Breakfast was okay- not the warmest, but a decent selection. The staff at breakfast were very friendly and accommodating. All in all, it was okay. Next time I'd pay much less for a simpler room, minus the package, which doesn't really deliver. The location again was perfect for young travellers like us, keen for bright lights and late night food/fun.

<Content>Reasonable value The room was large, well appointed and upgraded with a nice tv, bed and ammenities. The bathroom hasn't been upgraded and is one of the older style with the removable shower head. The location is more Kings Cross and all that has to offer than Potts Point but I never had any trouble in Kings Cross as long as you keep your eyes on the road and walk fast. The rooms have nice views.The room I had was connected to another room by door so you could hear the occupants talk sneeze, laugh and other things quite clearly. I got used to it but it could keep you up at night if they were noisy, fortunately, my neighbours were quiet . The room was quite good value despite this though the noise factor could be unbearable depending on the neighbours. I think the staff were efficient. The rooms were cleaned well though I found a stack of dirty sheets on the floor left in my room. Having internet costs $12 per hour. Quite a fair place to stay for the price depending on what room you get.

<Content>Great Hotel and Price We have no complaints at all regarding the Chifley Hotel at Potts Point, Sydney, the staff were friendly and very helpfull at all times, our room and facilities were always prepared to our liking and very clean.Our stay of three nights on the thirteenth floor we found exceedingly quiet, this being a real plus for ourselves as we are light sleepersWe liked the railway station, almost next door, so convenient for us, and the buses just across the road.Please ignore the negatives in some of the letters and give it a go, you will be pleasantly surprisedThanks everyone at the Chifley, Great place, Great staff, and the room price per night, Superb, we will return.Glennis  Brian Paterson8 Country Lane Highbury.

<Content>great hotel Stayed there for 5 nights in June 08 and nothing but good comments from check-in to check-out. The staff were freindly and helpful - even remember the wine you like in the bar. A couple of comments - as everybody said, the hotel entrance is hard to find even for taxi's and there is no staff at the entrance. The neighborhood is iffy but you should know it when you book the hotel. The breakfast is great but gets boring after the second day - same food everyday.Overall, definitely would stay here again.

<Content>What a dive We went to the Chifley to celebrate our wedding aniversary. It was actually quite funny to find that the hotel we had been told over the phone was brand new was as dirty as its car park. The floors were filthy the entire time we were there, the cupboards in our room were old and suffering water damage. The bar fridge was dirty, disgustingly dirty. Some thing had obviously dripped down and died in all its brown glory some time ago into the fridge door and all over the wine that we decided against getting. The bed was simply white sheets over an uncovered doona, NOTHING like the pictures on the web. The bathroom had mould inground. The shower was only big enough for one of us to get under the head at a time, and it faced up. So we had to take turns in holding it for each other to avoid drenching the ceiling and so we could get reasonable wet without becoming very cold - lucky we like each other. Bemusingly for us, the 'marble' like sink was crooked and obviously unfinished (you could see the inside of the wall behind it, the mirror was delaminating and the sink tap flooded the floor everytime we turned it on. The airconditioning was too loud to sleep with on - luckily we were having a big night out. But it wasnt all bad, breakfast was ok, even if they did take a few attempts to get the food we requested. Best way to describe the Chifley is to imagine a grand idea where you totally ran out of money so you had to get in someone to do up the apartments with a $100 dollar budget. It literally looks like they ran out of money for everything including cleaners.Oh a final word, dont eat the complimentary apples - I fed mine to a pig.And PLEASE, PLEASE dont send your stock standard. management reply to me.

<Content>What you see is not what you get I couldn't wait to stay at the newly refurbished Chifley Potts Point after having seen how wonderful it looked after the recent $22m facelift it had had.But, when we arrived, we weren't able to get in to the hotel as the reception is on a different floor to the entrance (which was not able to be opened). Saying that, the decor in the entrance was fresh and funky and very up to date.At check in the staff were friendly, and again, the decor was impressive. We were shown to one of the newly refurbished rooms, but not with the 2 single beds as requested. (I had called the hotel a few days before to confirm our reservation and was assured that everything would be as requested).After advising one of the staff that the room was not what we had requested, we were offered a standard room (we had asked for a deluxe room) with the 2 single beds as the other deluxe rooms were booked out.Just to verify that I had made the booking correctly, I tried to check the booking on my lap top. - NO WIRELESS INTERNET as advertised. Reception later advised that I would only be able to get internet access if I went to the lobby area.The standard room was not completely refurbished, old bath taps, old bar fridge old sink etc. We were unable to sleep for most of the night as we had a very amorous couple next door to us moaning and groaning all night (the soundproofing was that bad it did sound as though they were in the same room as us).When we complained to the staff at reception, they just had a quick giggle to themselves and didn鈥檛 even suggest talking to the couple to try and get them to be a bit quieter.The free breakfast we were given to compensate for the mix up with the rooms wasn鈥檛 up to scratch either. Lukewarm cooked breakfast, room temperature juice and brick hard mini croissants.It also seemed like the place was still being refurbished because of the constant drilling in the lobby.When we were eventually allocated the room we had originally asked for, we were pleasantly surprised. It was stunning. Fantastic modern brand new d茅cor, great quality fittings and a lovely plush carpet.Then we got a phone call advising that the pipes were frozenand there was not hot water. We found that absolutely hilarious (considering we are from Scotland originally). So I went to brush my teeth (that wouldn't have needed any hot water). Strangely enough, it was hot water coming out of the taps and not cold.We had some travellers cheques to change and after consulting the booklet which listed the hotel facilities provided in our room, we were pleasantly surprised to see that the brochure said up to $200 in travellers cheques could be changed. -NOT SO. Also advertised was the fact that all fridges in the rooms would have jugs of iced water - NOT SO IN EITHER ROOM. We went to reception (which was flooded - maybe from the frozen pipes?) and were advised that they did not yet have the facilities to change the travellers cheques, and were not aware of anything stating otherwise.So, we proceeded to the bank located close by. When leaving through the main entrance, we were greeted by the most awful smell of excrement, this terrible smell lasted about 2 days (I still have no idea what it actually was).It's a great shame that what you pay for is not what you get (in more ways than one) when you go to the Chifley, and that you are downgraded instead of being upgraded for something that's not your fault. (By the way, the hotel was not booked out at all as stated by the hotel staff, I checked through various booking sites).Maybe they should have competed the renovations and ensured that all facilities were up and running instead of luring customers there with false advertising.

<Content>Dissappointing Experience I stayed at this hotel on a Friday night. I selected it as it was newly refurbished and offered Internet access. I was astonished to see the bath and shower; there was a huge scratch in the bath and rust on the bathroom floor.Furthermore, the wireless Internet connection was down. I called reception, the guy had no clue on when this was going to be fixed and was not overly concerned about it. On Saturday upon checking out, Internet still was not available and the girl at the reception did not look concerned at all. She did not even ask how my stay was...perhaps she anticipated the answer...On the bright side, the room was comfy but a bit noisy...nevertheless I will never stay at this place again (poor service).

<Content>A Four and a Half Star Fawlty Towers I have stayed at this hotel several times previously while it was under the banner of the Crest. While the rooms were starting to show their age, the previous stays were always pleasant. However, now that the hotel has been refurbished as a Chifley hotel, the quality of the rooms and the service has deteriorated dramatically. On arrival, the room booking was not as requested despite a follow-up telephone call prior to arrival to confirm the booking. The room was not available until 2陆 hours after the advertised check-in time.During our stay (one night) the air-conditioning failed four times. The chairs in the room were broken, stained and paint splattered. There were no contact numbers in the room for reception. The min-bar had not been restocked following the previous occupant thereby resulting in an attempt to charge us for missing stock. Minor items from the clock radio, clothes line and even the toilet roll holders were not operable.Housekeeping staff dominated the lifts and, on one occasion, a cleaner pushed her large trolley into a lift we were occupying, pinning us against the back wall. She was then very reluctant to remove the trolley to allow us to exit at the required floor.Reception staff were less than helpful possibly frustrated by the constant complaints from customers.For a 4陆 star, newly refurbished hotel, it was a joke and definitely not worth the money.

<Content>Great Hotel Stayed at this Hotel on Saturday 8th March 08. After reading all the negative comments, I was genuinely surprised.The Reception Staff were courteous and friendly, the room was completely refurbished and also the bathroom.And surprise, surprise, our room even had a beautiful view of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House. All this for a standard room.The only fault with this Hotel(if you call it a fault) is that you can hear the street noise when trying to sleep. Maybe that is normal in a City Area?Gayle

<Content>Don't bother My partner and I stayed there last weekend. The hotel itself is quite impressive, and the bar and check-in staff were a pleasure.The management staff, however, are rude and obnoxious. We witness three separate instances of guests being spoken to in a derogatory manner.And the noise!! The reception area is double-glazed. Lovely. The rooms, however, are not. I'm quite a heavy sleeper, but even I couldn't manage a wink through people banging drums and screaming outside, and hotel guests shouting on their mobiles after coming home from drinking in the early hours. It really was unbearable.I'd give this one a miss.

<Content>Just a pretty picture This hotel is defenitely an example of beauty is only skin deep. I give the hotel positive credit for beautifully refinished rooms, comfortable mattresses, and plush carpet. The view of the harbour and the Opera house is a bit distant, but no less stunning. The staff is friendly, even though a little clueless. The lounge and bar have some great street watching of the bustling Kings Cross and a very modern feel. Now the bad...They included:- The legs breaking on our bed, twice, and absolute nonchalance from the front desk of that's been happening-our phone not working-our room not being cleaned and serviced twice, once even after speaking to the front desk, plus the second time they actually had the nerve to take the request for cleaning off the door and move it to the inside, without touching the room-we didn't receive our ordered newspapers -worst of all we ran out of water, there was no water for the shower or sink on our last day and tons of angry people in the lobby-20 minute+ checkout time- staff tried to move us to a lower accomodation even though we had paid for the upgraded harbour view because they were overbooked -The kitchens and room service weren't operational, so much for cake on my birthday. We were seriously disappointed.-Trash sat in the hallway for 8+ hours on our first day-The hotel spa is under renovation and not available for services, nor is the conceirge able to recommend an alternate spa or even a simple place to grab lunch.-The elavators broke downNeedless to say, all those renovations aren't worth much when the service and function of the hotel is terrible, I hope they improve, because I've stayed at better 3 stars and they are supposed to be 4.5.

<Content>Very disappointing I stayed at the new Chifley for a week in February.The reception, bar  restaraunt looked very impressive, new  modern however, the service isn't great and alot of confused people are working on the desk being it's first month open. When entering the elevator though to get to my floor, the elevator smelt a little like alcohol so I'm not sure what this building previously was?!The hallway to my room was dirty and looked like it had never been vaccuumed! There was also a cleaning cart in the hallway for my entire stay!The room itself had two beds, a king and single that were jammed together to make one enormous bed?! A Bit confusing as to why they did this but the sheets and beds seemed brand new. Thankfully!The carpet, TV and curtains are also new however, that's about it! I would not in any way say this hotel is new, it's been renovated and that's it!The bathroom is old and for my first shower the showerhead fell off the wall and I've had to hold it each time I shower to clean myself.The bedside tables and TV benches are all old and the bottoms have lots of cracks and marks on them.I also did not have a phone in my room for my entire stay even though they informed me I should have one and they would bring one up three times that I asked however, that was obviously too difficult.I had a few drinks in the bar and also a meal. The alcohol is very overpriced and I had a seafood basket for $18 - I got two pieces of calamari, three prawns and fish that tasted like it was the cheapest fish possible! Couldn't eat it and ended up only eating the chips! Very disappointing and would never return to the bar for food or drink!Overall, I was severely disappointed with this hotel and would definitely not recommend it to anyone for atleast 2 years when they'd hopefully have sorted out all their MANY teething problems.
