<Content>No way. Never again. Not even for free. We picked this hotel based on the review on Karen Brown's World of Travel website. The website recommendations had proved to be reliable until this stay. The ordeal began with our efforts to find the hotel-recommended parking garage. Tip #1: do not drive in Florence. The garage was down a tiny side street that we passed several times before we spotted it. They charged us 28 euros and we had to be out by noon the next day. Finding the garage proved to be easier than finding the hotel itself. It was a rainy late afternoon. We dragged our luggage all around the wet streets surrounding the Piazza Della Signoria, passing a couple of very nice hotels, until we finally realized that the dark, dank barely visible 6 foot gap between two buildings was actually our destination. Yes, the Uffizi hotel is down an alley. Some might call this a quaint or charming back street. This is just spin. It is an alley. The hotel's entrance is a glass door. You get buzzed into a 15 foot space where you have a choice of a creaky elevator or a creaky stairwell. We foolishly chose the stairs, not realizing the lobby was five flights up. We were alarmed as we climbed the narrow stairs, alarm that proved to be quite prudent on our part.The receptionist greeted us and quickly checked us into our room. It was literally right around the corner from the reception area (room 502?). We cracked open the door, expecting a small, simple but pretty room promised on the web site. Instead, we were greeted by barren walls, worn carpet, defeated furniture and a miserable bed. The big windows, perhaps the only nice part of the room, unfortunately opened on to the aforementioned alley.We could live with the room but not with the bathroom. It had a moldy tub/shower with a mildewed shower curtain and a noticeable urine smell. It was bad enough to make us rethink the cleanliness of the bed linens and carpet.I returned to the receptionist but she said she didn't have another room for us. She was very nice and as much as i disliked doing this, I told her we did not find the room to be clean and would like to leave. She said she would still charge us for the night. We finally agreed to accept 40 euros off the 260 euro a night rate.We slept fitfully on the miserable bed and avoided the bathroom as best we could. The next morning we ate in the breakfast room and could not help but admire the common room that looked out on the Piazza. We also saw some of the rooms on the Piazza side of the hotel and thought they looked much nicer than our room. Tip #2: if you do stay here, insist on a room on the Piazza side of the hotel.The room I was in ranks as the single worst room I have stayed in this decade and I have stayed in approximately 100 hotels.I do think there are nice rooms in the Uffizi.. and I am sure other travelers have had much better experiences here. I know I will not go back.

<Content>Awful - bad air gave us headaches, and it smelled We booked for 3 nights and left after 1 night. They gave us a room on the first floor, in the alley. The air quality was very poor, because outside is a tiny narrow alley and there is no air flow. And Florence's air quality is pretty bad in the center of the city anyway.The hotel has very bad noise problems as well. Our room was 1 flight up from the entrance, and it's an open stairwell. Guests take an elevator to reception. Well this door they come in has to be buzzed open, and it slams shut HARD. This means if you are in a room near that stairwell, you will hear that door slam shut about every 15 minutes up until 2am when the last guests stumble home to crash. Plus, our first floor room is on the tiny alley just off the biggest square in the city. So at 3am, a group of drunk Brits were shouting and carousing in the alley just outside our window. Even with the window closed and the A/C blasting, they kept my wife awake.Finally, the air quality. We both had bad headaches by morning. When we got outside the open air cured them, but they came back when we stopped by the room later. That, combined with the sewage stink coming from the pipes in the bathroom, was the final straw. We high-tailed it out of there and went to a nicer and more expensive hotel by the water. One redeeming quality: the staff is gracious. The breakfast is decent. And they refunded one of our nights we canceled. But we would advise you to stay away from this hotel. It was awful.

<Content>A great location and a charming hotel This hotel is a hidden gem. It's really hard to find without good directions, but once you do, it's great. The location is right off the Piazza Della Signoria and close to Uffizi Gallery and Duomo. The room we had was on the secret 4th floor and was lovely. Big and bright with a loft above with a bath. The hotel is in an alley, so no rooms face out, but ours was great because we could hear the foot traffic below (added to the flavor), but it wasn't noisy enough to disturb sleep. There is a great restaurant next to the hotel in the alley. The breakfast was the least fancy or extensive of all the places we stayed during our trip to Italy, but was good. This is a small hotel, but they are very nice and the rooms are all different.

<Content>Strange but good My husband and I stayed at the Relais Uffizi for three nights on our honeymoon in June, 2006. The hotel could not possibly be in a better location but it is almost impossible to find because it is down a narrow alley. It took me an hour (in over 100 degree heat) to find the place, and I had been warned that it was tough to locate! I think they should make it a point of including a map with detailed directions with every reservation. As far as the hotel itself is concerned, it was okay if not amazing. The room was fine, actually rather large, with a couch and a comfortable bed. The bathroom was small but clean and functional. Breakfasts were good although repetitive. Service was rather odd (although friendly enough); there is no front desk, so you check in in an office area. There was no internet access but the manager allowed me to use the office computer a couple of times.

<Content>Terrible experience,great location. The good thing about this place is its location if you can find it.The entrance is in a 6 foot alleyway. Several policemen standing around the corner had neither heard of the street or the hotel nor did the nearby restaurants.It took us an hour to find it.GPS also was not useful as far as this hotels street address was concerned.Arriving late in the evening before christmas we were given an unheated room.What little heat there was turned off at 2 am.We tried to find someone to help and eventually found a guy who had no choice but to move us to another room at 3 am.On day the new room deveolped a severe acridic smell from the bathroom the cause of which could not be located.At this point we had given up and we left not a moment too late.The breakfast is adequate but sparse.Coffee is good.I dont think this place can be classified as a Hotel.It may be cheaper than some other places but our experience here was the worst in Italy and affected our impression of Florence.

<Content>Great location, very friendly staff We have just come back from a 3 night stay in the Relais Uffizi House (the overspill to the hotel). The room was very clean, spacious and had a good sized bathroom. The room was also very quiet at night which was a plus. There was a safe in the room and a mini bar which was adequately stacked with water. The location is absolutely superb (although a little hard to find at first since it is located down a narrow alley) literally 2 minutes from the Uffizi - the staff were exceptionally helpful and accommodating. Breakfast was served from 7.30-10.00 am so there was no mad rush to get up and out. Overall a very nice little hotel for a short break in Florence.

<Content>Great location This hotel was in a great location, however, if we had not hired a taxi from the train station upon arrival we would have never found the place! Our room was small, but nicely decorated with a large bathroom. The price for accommodations was reasonable and the breakfast was OK but the same of everything everyday. The staff was friendly and helpful.

<Content>Great Location! We just returned from our honeymoon this week. This hotel is in an absolutely great location. The rooms are nice, but not super fancy. We stayed in Room 15 which was large and had a leather couch and desk also. The bathroom was gigantic in Italy standards although there was only a bath and no shower due to the slanting ceiling. Our room even had a view of the Piazza's tower. It was private and quiet and perfect for our honeymoon. We also found out that one of the recommended restaurants I had brought with me was right around the corner....Osteria Fattoria. There are also 2 other restaurants just steps out the front door.

<Content>Location, Location! We stayed at Relais Uffizi in room number 118, a suite with an upstairs bedroom. It was on the 'secret floor' that required a special 'key' to use in the elevator. The hotel is a combination of two buildings that makes the inside funky and unique. There was some noise from the resturaunt next door in the evenings, but not enough to keep us awake. The elevator is very small (aren't they all in Florence?) But these were very small inconveniences compared to the advantage of the location. The breakfast was 'OK and fairly typical, we had better during our 2 week tour. But it was sufficient and nice to have fresh squeezed orange juice each morning. The breakfast room is off the sitting room that has 3 large windows that overlook the Piazza Signoria. It was great to view a protest parade for animal rights that occurred during our visit from that vantage point.I saw no problem with the location of the entrance. The narrow passage way to the entrance never smelled bad, was well lit and was washed (along with the entire piazza) every morning.

<Content>Great location, average room We stayed at the Relais Uffizi in August 2007. The hotel's location was great. It was steps from the Piazza and a short walk to all of the famous sights. The rooms were very large and had authentic Italian decoration that was floral with chandeliers and painted wood furniture. The room security was a joke. The keys were attached to a giant keychain and could probably be picked with a bobby pin. The hotel did attempt to accomodate this problem by locking the exterior doors of the hotel (you have to buzz to bet let in). Also, there are no in room safes. I would stay at this hotel again. However, I really do hope that they upgrade their room locks soon.

<Content>Great hotel Our family of four stayed in florence for three nights in a Junior Suite. This room consisted of a very large main bedroom, a loungeroomand a second bedroom on a mezzanine level. The bedrooms had shutters which made the rooms lovely and dark for sleeping. There was a littlenoise from a restaurant kitchen next door early in the evening but the place was beautifully quiet when we slept. The loungeroom of the hotel looks over one of the main piazzas in Florence and it was wonderful to stand at the window and watch the throngs below! The breakfast was delicious and the position of the hotel absolutely perfect. It is beautifully cared for and very clean. We would highly recommend this hotel

<Content>A Little Wierd but friendly staff We are a family of 5 and stayed two nights at Hotel Relais Uffizi in April 2007. No real complaints. The rooms are large and sparsly furnished. The location is great for a quick trip to Florence as the hotel is right in the middle of the city. We booked our rooms directly with the hotel and experienced no problems. The hotel was also able to make reservations at all the sights and restaurants we wanted to visit. On the negative side the hotel is down a narrow alley off the crowded Piazza Signoria. This alley was often used as a toilet by people from the Piazza and until 10 or 11 pm the rooms were noisy.

<Content>Perfect Florentine lodging We planned a family trip (all adults) in October 2005 and emailed the hotel frequently to make arrangements for our 5 night stay. Alessandro and the other staff were so friendly and accommodating and all of our requests were met, including Accademia tickets and dinner reservations. The hotel location was perfect and our 3 rooms were great. If you are expecting an antiseptic, noiseless, 5 star luxurious hotel, this is not it. Here you meet travelers who enjoy experiencing a small, clean, lovely Italian abode with spectacular views of the lively Piazza della Signoria from the lounge. We enjoyed the breakfasts, talking with other guests, and drinking wine in the lounge in the evening. It was a delightful experience and worth the 220Euro rate.

<Content>Great Location Pros: The hotel is in the perfect location, right next to the Uffizi, just a few minute walk from the Ponte Vecchio and Duomo. Breakfast is standard Italian breakfast with coffee/cappuccino, yogurt, cereal, baked goods, etc. Very helpful front desk and staff. Beautiful, spotlessly clean bathroom. Lots of closet space.Cons: no carpeting in room, bedspread and couch looked a little worn. Room overlooked the alley/street that the hotel is on. Also, there is no formal lobby for the hotel--you basically buzz up to the hotel, although there is a reception on the 2nd floor. Also, there was a slight smell of sewer in the bathroom, taken care of by the bathroom fan and air fresheners. However, I have smelled this before in 4-5 stars hotel in Florence, so I suspect it's a problem of the city. Others have commented on the noise. It was never noisy. We slept fine. The garbage was collected around 6pm, so that was not noisy.

<Content>No Complaints My wife and I stayed at Relais Uffizi in early April 2006. The location is great, right in the middle of it all! The room was nice, nothing fancy, but spacious enough. The tub/shower was a little weird- hand-held shower head's cord was not long enough to fit in the overhead holder, made it kind of difficult to bathe comfortably, but workable. Breakfast was adequate and the staff was outstanding, very willing to discuss local restaurants and provide other information. They also have an extensive collection of travel books and other guides to browse over breakfast or whenever. Right next to Uffizi Gallery and Ponte Vecchio. Would definitely recommend for the budget traveler looking for a great deal and location!

<Content>Perfect location--Quaint rooms I stayed here for 2 nights on my honeymoon in January. It is a 10 minute walk from the train station and proved a little difficult to find, with the entrance in a small alley off the Piazza. Once we finally found it we were delighted--it really is next door to the Uffizi and a great base of operations for exploring Florence on foot. The staff was friendly enough. Our massive room was on the top floor and had soaring ceilings with exposed beams, tile floors, and a four-poster bed. The decor was simple and classic and I thought it was quite romantic. Spacious and clean bathrooms although I wasn't mad about the towels--they were like large dishclothes instead of normal terrycloth towel fabric. My husband was not pleased when I had to use all of them to dry off before he had his shower.The minibar prices are very reasonable, especially for water.Breakfast was blah and the seatinng area was a tad claustrophobic but I didn't care since it did the trick and we really spent the rest of the time in Florence outside.It was fairly noisy, even on the top floor, since there was construction on an adjacent building, but noise seems to be par for the course in Italian hotels. My recommendation is to have a few glasses of vino and you'll sleep just fine in a truly lovely and quaint room.

<Content>Noise not bothersome Just returned from Florence, coincidentally had same room as  other reviewers-room B (or 11). As stated, a very large room with loft, respectable bath, shower no tub. Did notice the street noise, they seem to pick up garbage every night and wash streets daily. However the sounds were brief, certainly did not inhibit our sleep. Any hotel near the Piazza Signoria will have the same issues. Staff was extremely nice and helpful. Breakfast similar to our previous hotel in Venice, at least this one had fruit. Views as stated previously, but main advantage of this hotel is fantastic location and relatively economical at about $220 Euro/night. Booked this hotel because of favorable reviews on Trip Advisor, and would definitely recommend.

<Content>Great choice for Florence We loved this hotel! Great staff and the perfect location with an easy cab ride from the train staion (about 10 Euros) and an easy walk to the Duomo and the Ponte Vechhio. And, best of all, we were next door to the Uffizzi Gallery and right off of the Piazza della Signoria. The rooms were very spacious and well appointed. Not all the rooms have bath tubs so if that is important to you, make sure to ask. The staff was very helpful. They got us into a private tour of the Uffizzi with one day's notice and helped us with our train scheduling when we left. The breakfast was nice although the room where breakfast is served, strangly, did not take advantage of the wonderful veiw that was on the other side of the room, which did not have tables. We would definately stay at this hotel whenever we are fortunate enought to return to this remarkable city!

<Content>Great Hotel ... shame we couldn't sleep! Like other reviewers, we were impressed by the service and the location. The only complaints (and I guess they are serious) are the level of noise and the disappointing breakfast. The collection of rubbish and general chaos starts very early and never stops. It was virtually impossible to take a nap during the day. However, the room (B) was lovely and the staff were very helpful. There is a 5% discount if you pay in cash. As we stayed 3 nights, this was significant.

<Content>To be Precise As all the other reviews say - great location and very helpfull staff. Many of the reviews also say that u will have breakfast overlooking the square. To be precise this is not strictly true. You can get a magnificent view if you walk up to the windows in the breakfast room. But as you sit at your table or on the sofa while you have breakfast you will not see the square. To be precise you will see the sky above the square and hear the hussle from below. The lift and the front door of this hotel as well as the odd mosquito can keep you awake regardless of how sweet the hotel and the staff are.

<Content>great location Great location hotel. Friendly staff, good breakfast, close to Piazza Signoria. The only complaint I had with this hotel was that our room B was on a side street that was very noisy. It seems that garbage collection and street cleaning is done after 11pm until early morning. Also a very noisy restaurant just below my window. Bring ear plugs. Too bad because this room is a beautiful suite with a loft bedroom (for 3 people).

<Content>Great location, but beware of parking situation My husband and our 4 month old infant recently stayed at the Relais Uffizi for 3 nights. The location cannot be beat for sightseeing, just off the Piazza Signoria. Be warned, however, if traveling with small children or a lot of luggage: there is no way to drive up to the hotel. Cars are whisked off to a parking garage across town, and luggage and children have to be carried from a nearby street (the hotel entrance is in a pedestrian alley). Otherwise the staff is incredibly kind and helpful, the breakfast room is lovely and the double room was one of the most spacious we have seen in Europe!

<Content>Location, Location, Location! Location, Location, Location for a bargain price. We stayed here during the Christmas holidays 2003. Although this hotel is modest (no views), the room was large with high ceilings, nicely appointed furniture/linens, and clean. The lounge overlooks Piazza Signoria. It was wonderful being smack in the middle of this the historic area of this wonderful city within walking distance from all museums, shops and restaurants and a couple of blocks from the Arno River and Ponte Vecchio. Great in the winter when you don't need a pool or terrace (which requires you stay outside town). Would defintely return.

<Content>Great Location - Good Value We stayed in a Junior Suite in October for $225. The weather was great and the location, value, and size of the room was just as the other reviews say. I would highly recommend. The only real problem is getting there. Make sure you have good directions. Once you get to the Piazza, you have to go down an alley between a Pizza restaurant and the statues and then turn right at the next alley. Its about a 30 second walk from the Piazza. If you drive, you'll pay $27 a night to have your car parked.

<Content>Great Location! We enjoyed our stay at Relais Uffizi. The location can't be beat. It is right off a small side street of Piazza della Signoria and the breakfast room/sitting area overlooks the Piazza. Great view and very convenient to everything. The staff was helpful. Breakfast was fine, nothing fancy, but good. Our room was large and clean although the decor was somewhat sparse. The bathroom was modern and the shower had great water pressure. Overall, it was a good value for the price and everything was very comfortable. And again, LOCATION was fantastic.

<Content>Location, Location, Location Our room was huge and the bathroom was nice-sized. The only wierd thing was that it's off the main building. It looked like the hotel converted a couple of aprtments in the adjacent building into rooms. To get to our room we had to take two separate elevators in two different buildings. One day, we walked down the stairs of our building (not the hotel), opened the front door and discovered that we were right on Piazza della Signoria, in between two cafes. Unfortunately, we couldn't get back in to the hotel through this entrance. Strange! We had several friends who told us that Florence was very noisy, but our room was very, very quiet. The service was wonderful.

<Content>Great little hotel! My husband and I stayed at the Relais Uffizi from October 2, 2004 through October 7, 2004. What a cute little hotel in a wonderful location! We had reserved a junior suite, and it was huge. Room had a canopied bed, a very large bathroom and a loft! Location was perfect - right off of the Piazza del Signoria and Piazza del Repubblica which we think are the best two squares in Florence for their beauty and people watching. The hotel was central to all of the major sights, and steps away from the Uffizi Gallery (hence the name of the hotel!). We would highly recommend!

<Content>We'd stay there again in a heartbeat The Relais Uffizi was just about the perfect place to stay in Florence. It is located just off the town鈥檚 main square, but is so quiet you鈥檒l sleep in complete peace. The breakfast room overlooks the square and you can see the Duomo and Campanile from there, as well. The Uffizi Gallery is less than five minutes鈥?walk while the Ponte Vecchio is about 10 minutes away. Our room was spacious and squeaky clean. The bed was really just two twins pushed together, though. Our bathroom alone was about as large as some hotel rooms my wife had stayed at in Switzerland. The place was wonderful, but not cheap. We stayed there for three nights in late August, 2004 and the cost came to US $591.

<Content>What a location! Room #4 was spacious (it included a loft) The bathroom huge by any standard.The salon overlooking the piazza (from where you can see a replica of David and the hustle and bustle of street life) was cozy and a great place to unwind at the end of the day, with a glass of good Chianti. Breakfast was plentiful. The staff was helpful. The location central; San Lorenzo market nearby, Ponte Vecchio a block away, the Uffizi, a stone's throw away. Etc. Etc. Book a room right now!!!!

<Content>Very nice surprise in Florence We would never have guessed where this hotel is located. It overlooks the Piazza Signoria but would be almost impossible to find without directions because the entrance is tucked away in a tiny alley. I can't recall even seeing a significant sign of any sort. The only problem you will encounter is the trek to the lobby which is on the third floor. An elevator takes you up there but you still have to hike a few steps and make your way through a winding corridor to find it. However, this is a wonderfully run place and the prices are fantastic given its location. The rooms are very spacious and charming and the staff ranks up there with the best we've experienced. Nothing to complain about unless you find walking stairs difficult. We have to thank this website for helping us find this place.
