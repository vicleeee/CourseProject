<Content>Ahhhh Shibuya ! This hotel is kind of hard to find when you get off the train in Shibuya and are a bit disorientated but it is very close and upstairs from the mall, you just need to get your bearings.Its clean and SO quite being smack dab in the middle of Shibuya, everything is central and although the staff speak limited english they are very helpful! You can also get a buffet breakfast on the one of the top floors that gives you a wonderful view of the city, the food there was great and the view and service was wonderful! I would recommend this hotel and as i can see from the reviews so would many others. i booked this hotel based on the other reviews on Trip Advisor and am VERY glad i did.

<Content>This is my favourite hotel Shibuya Tokyu Excel is my favourite hotel in the world. My company complained that at $300+ SGD per night, it's a bit expensive, but it is Tokyo!I love the location of this hotel. It's in the trendiest part of Tokyo, sitting right on top of the world's busiest pedestrian crossing, and more importantly near a pivotal railway station.The hotel room is quite small (maybe not by Tokyo standards) but it is very very comfortable, with a nice bath and a techno toilet. The selection of beverages in the minibar is very wide - one night I had no idea what I was drinking.The best part is the Japanese breakfast. I have never had another breakfast like it, and it has modified my food habits. As a bonus, it's served at the top of the hotel, so there's an excellent view to be had of Tokyo central.I am looking forward to my next trip to Tokyo, and I will definitely be staying here.

<Content>Feel the Vibe! Took my family ( 2 adults, 2 kids aged 8 and 10) to Tokyo last week and wanted to get a BIG reaction to staying in Tokyo on the first night. Guess what? I got it. Arrived at night so conveniently on the Limo Bus from Narita to our doorstep which was perfect for the sleepy kids. Had a quad room which is sooooo hard to find in Tokyo and this was perfect. Their little mouths dropped as they look upon the city lights with amazement from our room on the 15th floor. We could see a rooftop soccer game in play, huge numbers of people crossing at the major intersection, and a vibrant city in action. The room was just fine for us and the reality of the place is somewhat better than the photos. The shots look a little clinical and cold, but believe me, we were very happy to be here. I had considered The Mandarin and the Ritz Carlton but this place just had everything that was important to my decision. Front desk - easy check in and helpful, excellent location, clean rooms with the perfect combination for us, great shopping and restaurants. Great access to subway and rest of Tokyo. Children loved riding up and down in windowed elevators looking at the sites of the area. From Shinjuku to Yoyogi, and all over. Couldn't have been happier and paid so little for the desired effect. Surely stay there again. Great introduction to Japan, subway culture, corporate culture and shopping culture. This is where our children learnt that walking single file in rush hour is a better option than walking four abreast. Kids also took photos of rush hour commuters. Great insight into the real Tokyo. Highly recommended.

<Content>Will stay again Great 4 star holiday hotel in a fabulous location. The rooms are small by western standards, but they were very clean and the furnishings were fine - really what you are paying for is the location not a room for a luxury romantic getaway. Like one of the other reviewers, we were returning from a ski trip so were not dressed up like the locals, however unlike that reviewer, we felt very comfortable walking around the hotel wearing hiking boots and outdoor wear.

<Content>Great Location but in need of renovations You couldn't be more central than this hotel. Right in the middle of the action. The lobby looks nice, but the rooms are a little small especially the bathroom. It looks like there has been attempts to upgrade the room furniture but I really think all the rooms need to be completely renovated. The rooms were clean with nice bed linnen. Only 2 bath towels were provided and there was no in-room safe. Internet was free. This is not your Grand Hyatt and certainly felt like a business hotel. The hotel service was ok. The reception did not greet or speak until she was telling me what my room number was at check-in. The view from the breakfast view was amazing. The quality and variety at breadkfast was average. You have to ask to get your bread toasted. The hotel has an overnight bag courier service and can send your bags to Narita- very handy if you have large suitcases and pick them up at the airport.

<Content>Great Hotel in Great Location I'd say the hotel itself was your typical asian midprice to better than midprice hotel. Lobby and restaurants were first class like a hilton/hyatt, but the rooms where tiny and basic with burns on the carpet and very warm hallways. No great amenities at all. Staff spoke very basic, limited english. Location was super awesome...the action/bars/crowds/eats where right out your doorstep. Not to mention the great hub of the trains and the subway right outside just steps away.There is a higher class hotel a couple blocks down if you want more upscale, but for me the Excel was just fine and I would stay again. Hotel was 'upscale' for me, but I am used to travelling cheap...company foot the bill on this one.Paid around 17500 yen with special company rate.

<Content>Not for the casual traveler Perfect location at Shibuya Station, couldn`t be better for seeing the city. The hotel is located at Mark Plaza in Shibuya, a very upscale shopping center. Everyone, and I mean everyone is dressed to the absolute nines. If you are not used to being in close quarters with lots of people in thousand dollar suits and ladies outfits, then don`t stay here. I am used to traveling fairly casually and wearing shorts, t-shirts, jeans, sneakers, etc. But, here I was very uncomfortable. This is a fairly upscale hotel, despite it`s three-star rating. Also, the ventilation in the hotel is terrible, hallways and elevators extremely hot and stuffy. I mean, such that you can`t breathe it was so bad. My skin was always clammy from the heat in the hallways and lack of ventillation. The staff was very helpful in all our requests and they all speak English quite well.

<Content>Great location for a first time traveller I stayed here in December of 2006. You really could not get a better location - next to Shibuya station which provides hugely easy access to where ever you may want to go in Tokyo and the surrounds, connected to a large shopping mall complete with restaurants, food outlets with everything from Starbucks to Dean  Deluca and pharmacies. And across the road is Shibuya itself, with department stores, international banks, teenybopper stores, 100 yen stores, music outlets and more bars and clubs than you can shake a stick at. The hotel itself is very good. I stayed on the women's only floor. Be sure to ask for a room with a view of the crossing. The view past the park in Harajuku and the skyscrapers of Shinjuku in the distance is beautiful. Being Japan, it was not a particularly large room, but there *is* actually enough room to swing a cat ;) so it is no way cramped. The room and bathroom remained spotlessly clean during my stay, and the staff were very helpful and pleasant with my many, many questions.

<Content>Extremely Convenient Excel Shibuya is situated in the shibuya station which is also connected to Tokyu department store and Mark City, a complex of restaurants and shops. I cannot find anywhere more convenient than staying literally on top of the train tracks. Of course there was the noise factor but it was tolerable. My husband and I stayed here for 2 days and we were both very impressed with the service of the hotel staff. I had to leave for a meeting once I got out the airport limosine bus. I asked the hotel staff to deliver my luggage to my room and check me in at the same time when I hurried off to see my company. No problem at all. Then I had asked the hotel concierge for recommendations for a hair salon. She booked the appointment for me and took me personally to the hairdresser; explained what I needed before she left. She did the same thing to my husband. I could not have asked for more. We stayed at a double room with standard shower and tub. It had a sitting area big enough for 4 people. The facility was a little bit old but the level of service and its location made it a great place to stay. As long as there is a Starbucks and my favorite sushi restaurant, Midori, close by, I am satisfied.

<Content>The Most Convenient Hotel in Tokyo Our family visit Japan almost every year. This was my 9th visit, and our third stay at the Hotel. We were very impressed at their Triple-Room during our 2nd visit. We made early reservation  were able to enjoy their early-bird discount this time (about 25% off rack price).Remember to join their Tokyu Hotels Comfort Membership. You can join on their web-site, or at the Hotel. Members receive room discounts and gift vouchers. We used our vouchers for breakfast (1,950 yen per person) at the Hotel, which was great. Also, check with the hotel by e-mail in advance to reserve the room of your choice, eg. ladies floor, non-smoking, free internet access, etc. They have very prompt response.Location of the Hotel is excellent, with convenient access to Metro station  Rail Station. Shibuya itself is a great shopping  dining place, and other trendy shopping areas, such as Harajuku  Omotesando are just one station away. There're also direct subway/ rail routes to go to other famous shopping areas like Shinjuku, Ginza, and Akihabara.If you like Sushi, a must-try Sushi place is at Mark City, the Shopping Complex connected with the Hotel. There is always a long line-up outside the restaurant, which you are not likely to miss when you pass by.

<Content>Great Location If you are looking for a central hotel, with rooms that are clean comfortable and a good size for such a central city location then this is the place for you.The hotel is on top of a shopping Mall (but please do not think by this that the rooms are noisy as they are not) and next to Shibuya underground, so you can just wonder down stairs for a selection of restaurants or if you fancy going further afield just hop on the under ground.One point to note about Tokyo if you are travelling from the UK, our phones do not work out there, so can be a pain if you are travelling with others to keep in contact. (what did we do before the mobile??)Highlight of my trip was seeing the band the Killers who were also staying at this hotel!

<Content>Super-convenient location, good hotel I am writing this in my room at the Shibuya Excel Tokyu using the free internet access at the end of my 2 week stay.Overall I was very impressed with the hotel, it is very clean, the room was much larger than I expected, and the view was great!! And the price was pretty reasonable for the centre of Tokyo.The location is ultra convenient, right above Shibuya station, which has lots of over- and under-ground connections to get you just about anywhere extremely fast.Bear in mind that Shibuya is just about THE busiest place I came across in Tokyo, so it might not be to all tastes. I was a bit worried there might be a lot of noise in the room at night, but actually that didn't prove to be a problem at all.Based on the quality of the hotel and the great location I would definitely come back here again with no hesitation.One tip -- it took me some time to notice the Food Show section under the Tokyu dept store next to the hotel, this was a great place to pick up some of the familiar western foods I had been craving but couldn't seem to find anywhere...

<Content>Alternative to Shinjuku area, if you want to be in the middle of the action This was our second stay here. We booked through Asiarooms and got a great deal which included breakfast. This is a great deal (breakfast at the Western-stye restaurant is about 19,50 yen a person) and the western -food buffet was delicious. Because Asiarooms is a bulk room buyer, you get what they have available. We did not have the greatest view, but did get the nonmoking requested. Be warned however that people at this hotel sometimes ignore the fact that they are on a nonsmoking floor. It's annoying, but we picked up some Japanese Febreeze and that really helped. There is convenient internet access via 2 computers in the lobby and you get 10 minutes for 100 yen.The location is convenient--located right by the JR station in Shibuya. The areas is always crazy crowded with plenty of all night conbini markets and lots of clubs within walking distance. This part of town can sometimes feel a bit dirty, but it is extremely energizing, regardless. You do have the Tokyu Department stores and Mark City Shopping Complex and plenty of clothing stores aimed at the ultra-hip Tokyo youth. Love Hotel Hill is also nearby if you want to take a break. The room was quiet despite Shibuya Crossing being just 8 floors below. Beds are comfortable.

<Content>Dissappointed, Not geared to Business visitors and rooms very basic and drab, Having stayed at the Shibuya Excell on a number of occasions I have expressed each time my disapointment that basic needs particularly for the visiting business man are simply not available.When the front desk is approached to provide assistance they tend to adopt a no can do attitued.I have visited this Hotel a number of times since drawing these anomolies to thier attention but see no effort to make improvements, They are most certainly not international in thier service although the staff are polite and well groomed the end result always remains the same....No can do!!!This last visit will be my last as I have given up on any expectation of improvement, my business associates in Tokyo are naturally disappointed to learn of my frustration and have confirmed similer complaints by other guests they have recommended to the Hotel.They will no longer recommend visitors on business to check into this Hotel and I have visited it for the last time.

<Content>Really good place to stay I stayed here for 3 nights on the way back from Australia/NZ and was really pleased that I chose to stay here. It was OK value about 拢90 a night, pretty good/average for a tourist/buisiness hotel in Tokyo.The location was perfect and my room on the 20th floor overlooked the famous crossing that most people remember from Lost in Translation and had a fabulous view of the city but the room or hotel wasnt at all noisy.As I was travelling on my own I choose to stay on the women only floor (allthough the city is v safe so it wasnt really necsecery) which costs no more but has key card entry to the floor and apprently more feminine rooms. My room was very clean (and I am very fussy!!)and the size fine with an good size/clean bathroom and a duvet on the bed so none of the horrible sheet and blanket thing that a lot of hotels have!Mini bar at usual okish prices and TV with CNN and BBC news etc and good air con, not too noisy.So after a long flight it was a great room to collapse into and relax.Breakfast which I ate in hotel once was OK ish but not cheap and to be honest with several (dare I say it and its v bad I know but cant beat a tall skinny latte!) Starbucks nearby it was easy and cheaper to grab a latte and Muffin!So hotel good, views great BUT location amazing! bang in the heart of Shibuya with great shops and places to eat, right on top of the station and you really feel that you are in the heart of things and its really easy to get around and see some of the amazing places.The Limosine bus(normal coach)goes from the airport straight to hotel and only costs 拢15, its easy if a bit boring 90min journey. I would definetly reccomend staying here.Have Fun......

<Content>It offers four beds in a room We have two young children. As I was planning this trip, I was looking for a hotel with rooms that can fit four people comfortably. I found this hotel from a friend who traveled to Japan often. We stayed in a four bed room. The breakfast buffet was excellent. I would recommend this place.
