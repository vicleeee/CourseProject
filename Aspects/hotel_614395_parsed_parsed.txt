<Content>Not quite the start we had hoped for... Having looked around, I booked this hotel as it was one of the Small Luxury Hotels in the World chain, and had very good reviews on this site. I called directly and booked a Deluxe room with the Front of House manager, emphasising that this was the first break my wife and I would have alone since the birth of our daughter almost two years ago and we wanted a quiet room at the top. I was assured that all Deluxe rooms face internally into the courtyeard, and they would make the stay special.We arrived, big surprise for my wife (she thought we were staying at a friend's apartment), and checked in. On arrival to the room, I realised immediately that it was the basic level room and, worse, it was facing the street. I called down to tell them that a mistake had been made, and they asked to call me back. They did so within ten minutes, and basically said, yes, a mistake had been made, but there were no deluxe rooms available but they would give us a better standard room and breakfast thrown in for free. This wasn't good enough. I went down to the desk and emphasised that I had booked this directly through them and expected to be upgraded, or worst case scenario, found a superior room in a partner hotel. I have to say that the people I dealt with were extremely polite and courteous, and once they realised that I wasn't going to accept their original offer - which took some stressing - they said they would make every effort to accommodate us. We went for lunch and they said they would call me.I got a call within the hour saying that we would be upgraded to the next level above Deluxe, the Junior Suite - result! We continued our lunch, very happy.On return to the hotel, I was told that they weren't giving us a Junior Suite, but a Deluxe was available and they had moved us there. At this point, I didn't really want to argue the toss anymore, as it would otherwise spoil what was meant to be a romantic getaway. We had what we had booked, after a bit of an argument, and I feel that many other hotels just wouldn't have made this much of an effort to sort it out.The Deluxe room was great, nice modern layout and feel, and the manager had had the good sense to leave a bottle of champagne on ice to await us. The staff on the whole were exemplary, the cleaning service great. The one complaint about the rooms is that the doors are not soundproofed, so if there is a connecting door between your room and the one next door, then you can hear what's going on there.The location is good, ten minutes from Las Ramblas and less than five to the La Ravel, everywhere is eminently walkable. Without the rather negative experience at the start of the trip, I would have recommended this hotel without hesitation. As it is, I still do - but with reservations.

<Content>Nice Hotel -- trying hard to please My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Casanova for 5 nights in late Nov-08 following a few days in Paris. I booked the hotel via their on-line website. I had informed them that we would be arriving very late on Friday evening and to hold the room for us upon arrival. Previous comments on Tripadvisor were quite true. Modern hotel, very good location near Universitat Metro station and 10 minute walk (past Starbucks for the morning java) to La Rambla. Very noisy bar scene on the main floor on weekend nights so be sure to ask for a room higher up. The room was, indeed, very dark -- but that's the decor of the hotel room. Black / brown walls and not much lighting around the room. As noted on Trip Advisor, I think the shower pressure was the best I've ever found in a European hotel. We did, however, experience a few issues for which the hotel did attempt to resolve. We came back to our room late on Sunday evening and found the hotel room door propped open by the door bolt. Needless to say, we weren't amused. We contacted the hotel front desk and asked for someone to come up to the room to explain. The head housekeeper did come up and profusely apologize for the mistake -- she had done it herself as a reminder to another maid to do something in the room -- and had forgotten to close and lock the door. She was very embarrassed and apologized again and again, but with all the petty crime issues one reads about in Barcelona, you can only imagine our concern. Luckily, I had locked up everything of value in the hotel room safe. The hotel did, in fact, send up a bottle of champagne as a token of apology.When checking out, I was informed that the hotel accepts euro-denominated travellers' cheques subject to a 3% service charge. I never recall having seen anything on the check-in form or on the on-line booking form or on the website. This is hotel policy and may, in fact, be a policy for all Barcelona hotels -- but shouldn't they advise the client ahead of time? I chose to purchase travellers' cheques (in euros) in advance of the trip because of the petty crime / theft concerns and didn't experience any problems using them in Paris a few days earlier. Had I known in advance, I would have arranged other means to settle my account as using my credit card proved very costly with double conversion charges from euros to U.S. dollars and then to Canadian dollars (the currency of my card). Anyways, the clerk was very apologetic again but I had to use my cc.Thirdly, I noted that the fee I was charged was higher than that which was quoted on the on-line site. I did email the hotel upon my arrival home, pointed out the discrepancy in charges and they did reverse the difference very promptly.As for internet connection, the hotel is wired for wireless connection and will even lend you a laptop computer to take up to your room for two yours to use and check your emails / browse the web. All in all, a very modern, well located, hotel with dark rooms and great shower pressure. My only complaint is that they should have advised us of the 3% euro travellers cheque surcharge in advance. Nice hotel staff. No concierge on site so if you're looking for restaurant recommendations / reservations, they weren't very accommodating -- you'll have to make your own choices.

<Content>Excellent staff and lovely accomodation The hotel is really lovely - great rooms, comfy beds, nice clean and modern bathrooms. But the real winner for the hotel is the staff and their attention to detail. They went out of their way to please us. We were given a room (lovely) but the airconditioning was set too high and couldn't be turned down, however opening the doors exposed us to traffic noise. When we asked if there was something they could do they quickly and pleasantly changed our room to something quieter and cooler. The staff were also helpful in directing us to local attractions and providing local information. Lovely little bar in the foyer for a night cap too! Would definitley recommend this place. As for the walk to La Ramblas....its only 10 mins max and you get to buy pass some traditional little tapas joints along the way where if you don't speak the language you just point and smile to get your food.

<Content>Great Modern Hotel Just returned from this hotel. Location wasn't as great as I wanted and led to believe but still within easy walking distance of the Ramblas and taxis are also very cheap in Barcelona. Room was lovely and very trendy and clean. The bathroom was great with a wet room and high powered shower. After reading the reviews saying this was a noisy hotel, I requested a quiet room and was happily given one at the rear. This was quiet except I was given one by the lift which had a slight noise when used. I could also hear the music from downstairs ever so slightly on the saturday night but my partner couldn't. But if you want a quiet room ask for a back room away from the lift area and you wont hear a soul. I got a real bargain on this hotel by looking up various websites so please check all available offers. Lots of cafes nearby to eat and drink. Would definately recommend this hotel to others at the right rate, of course....

<Content>What a gem! Booked this hotel as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday, as I had never been to Barcelona wanted a hotel in a good location. And it was! After arriving off the airport bus at Cataluna square we easily got a taxi to the hotel at night.Seeing the hotel first at night was fantastic candles throughout the bar and into the recption made it very welcoming and romantic.Room was spilt level very modern even though we overlooked the front road noise was not an issue to us. Breakfast fantastic choice and replenished regulary even 15mins before closing.Walked every day to Cataluna Square where all sightseeing buses go from. Enjoyed drinks in the hotel bar not cheap but complimentry nibbles made up for it.Only gripe was wardrobe in room too small we were only there for 3 nights and struggled to fit our clothes in.Staff were excellant and friendly nothing to much for them even recommended beachfront restuarants near the port.Would definatley go back for value, location and the beauty of the hotel.

<Content>Good hotel Good hotel on a good location. Very close to Place de CataluniaStayed here for 3 days with the company I work for and would definitely go back next time..Reason why the hotel doesn't get 5 stars is because of the bar personel. The guy behind the bar was not friendly, quite rude even. Prices are quite high as well...Should you go to Barca I would definitely recommend Club Opium in Barceloneta! Great Spot to have dinner and to go clubbing afterwards

<Content>Modern-Stylish The hotel is located just west of Las Ramblas and about a ten minute walk to the nearest underground at Universitat. So it's pretty well located for getting around most of the popular attractions.Can't say i was overwhelmed by the reception staff and they seemed a little indifferent, but nothing too troublesome.The hotel is quite new, built in 2006. It's very stylish and modern and in the evening the giant sized candles that line the foyer are lit and give a nice ambiance.The room we had was again stylish and comfortable and i particularly liked the large walk in wet room type shower with mini bath and giant shower head! The room was a little on the small side but very comfortable and spotlessly clean and very nicely decorated if you like an ultra modern style.The only minor complaint i had about our particular room was that it was a little dark with not a great deal of natural light due to the fact that the long narrow window faced into an interior type court yard of the hotel, this probably works well in summer helping to keep the room cool, although the room has air conditioning. They have taken care to make the view from the window pleasant and positioned giant sized planters with colourful flowers just outside the window and these planters light up at night! I managed to glance into other rooms and noted that these were not as dark and had much larger windows. We took a room at the rear of the hotel as i had seen on this site that there may be a problem with noise. We had no problems and it was very quiet at night.Thought that the cocktails in the bar were a little overpriced at 9.50 for a small marguerita.We had a lovely meal in the restaurant and the food was fresh and well cooked. The staff on this occassion were very attentive but it wasn't very busy and again was a little dark!I would recommend this hotel for modern style and comfort.

<Content>Loved This Hotel We loved our stay here. The hotel is very centrally located and the interior decor is great. The one thing is that we were led to believe that the hotel is just 5 minutes from La Rambla. In reality, it used to take us about 20 minutes ... The breakfast was sumptuous. The reception and guest services staff were very helpful and helped us in making reservations for local shows. Overall, I'd highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great location The hotel is situated within walking distance from Las Ramblas and with excellent cafes nearby.The hotel staff were friendly and the room was very clean, however my only complaint is that the room stank of cigerette smoke - this was not at all pleasant.I did ask for a quiet room, which we recieved and this was fantastic.Barcelona is a beautiful city and i would recommend this hotel if you are a smoker or dont mind the overpowering smell which did put me off.

<Content>Nice Hotel, near Metro stop I stayed at the Casanova for 3 nights with my wife. The room was large, and the bed was very comfortable. I've read a lot of reviews complaining about the noise. Our balcony faced a side street, and with the air conditioning on, I had no problem with the noise despite being a very light sleeper.The bathroom is extremely nice. The tub is huge, and has its own detachable showerhead separate from the overhead shower next to the tub. Both are inside the stall.I thought the location was good, its near the Urgell metro stop. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from Las Ramblas, which I thought was perfect. Its close enough to walk to easily, but far enough away from the crowds and noise. There is also a small supermarket across the street, which is very convenient. I would stay here again.

<Content>Great stay at the Casanova! We stayed at the Casanova for five nights and were very happy. Great hall, very nice room. Maybe a bit on the dark side, due to the fact that it was facing the nicely designed yard (which is a good thing if you like peace and quiet). Staff is very nice and attentive, and food at the restaurant is also great. The bar itself ist a bit of a hot spot on weekends (they even have their own DJ). Don't expect great luxury or a lot of space in the rooms, but it is more than just adequate. We would strongly recommend the Casanova to anyone who likes staying central and enjoys some modern design! And as for thieves experienced by other travelers in the reviews below - it's a big city, like any other big town. So be watchful.

<Content>Clean, Boutique hotel Firstly... if you are thinking of going to Barcelona, my advice is don't ! It's a crime ridden city. We were robbed three times in just 8 days... seriously. My partners handbag was stolen, money was taken from her pocket and money was also stolen from the room at the Casanova hotel, presumably by an employee.Coming back to the hotel, It's a clean and centrally located hotel with decent access to the city. It's far from cheap though, but nothing in Barcelona is. The standard rooms are adequate and I would not advise taking a deluxe. Try and get one at the back of the hotel though as you might not be able to sleep if you have a front room. The hotel provides everyone with ear plugs !Food and drink here are expensive. It will cost you 5 Euros for a soft drink in the bar.The staff are friendly and efficient.However, this is a city full of thieving scumbags and i'm never going back. It wasn't that pretty anyway and there are better places to holiday than here.

<Content>A great hotel-wish I could stay here more often. This was my second stay at this hotel in 18 months and again I absolutely loved it.From the moment of arrival the service was second to none and at all times the staff were welcoming and could not do enough to help you and make your stay more enjoyable-even going so far as booking theatre tickets and a restaurant for us one night.The buffet breakfast was superb and could keep you going right until the evening although there are many excellent restaurants in Barcelona to keep tempting you for the duration of your stay.We enjoyed drinks in the bar every night and I can particularly recommend the liquer coffee as a nightcap!!All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Barcelona that it central and makes the city more accessible-that is also clean,friendly and reasonably priced.if you are going make this your hotel of choice and you will not be disappointed.

<Content>First trip to Barcelona Really pleased with the service we received. We did not use the restaurant as there were many bars etc close by but had a night cap in the bar which was very relaxing.We were disappointed when we returned home to realise that one of our rooms was standard not the superior we booked as we had been under the understanding that the other room had been upgraded to a suite - so be aware of the facilities offered.The only downside in the rooms was that the decor is dark  there is not much natural light.Overall the hotel is in a good position - approx 5 mins walk to the Ramblas  the Catalunya Plaza, the rooms are very comfortable  the staff attentive.

<Content>Great Hotel in Barcelona We just came back from a trip to Spain and stayed at this hotel. The hotel is in a great location only a few blocks from La Rambla, only about a 10 minute walk. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Our Junior Suite was spacious with a small living room, extra bathroom for guests, and the master bath had a large shower and a tub. The room was spotless, which is very important to us. The hotel has a great bar and restaurant. The included breakfast was buffet style and very good, with Iberian ham, cheeses, smoked salmon, fresh fruit, lots of pastries, fresh squeezed juices, and they also would make eggs any style and other requested items.In general, I would highly recommend this hotel. If you value peace and quiet, this is a much better choice than some of the nice hotels in the heart of La Rambla.

<Content>a good choice Stayed a long weekend (3 nights), 4 couples of 30+ yrs. Good location and base for exploring Barcelona (though quite a few taxi drivers did not know its location by name only...) Nice reception area with a bar and lounge, with cool Dj at w.end evenings. Excellent drinks in the bar, though abit pricey at Euro 10 each. Clean and modern rooms, nicely decorated. Might be worth asking for a room abit up as some traffic noise might be experienced at the lower floors. Overall: cool and highly recommendable!

<Content>Good hotel - Dreadful service We arrived to the Hotel feeling that we had done a very good choice: nice deco, good location, good rooms. The reality it service was very poor. The staff were extremely inflexible to all our requests.On check out they told us that although we had a rate without breakfast they were going to do an exception for us and we could have breakfast. On the next day, when we came for breakfast we were advised that it was not going to be included - we were ok to pay for it, but the guy again said to us aloud that it was not included embarrasing us with the rest of the guests in the hotel.We asked if we could do late check out as our flght was not due until 10 pm, and not only they were not flexible (which is understandable) they just didnt try to find a way to help us so that we could take a shower before leaving the hotel.Overall - staff with bad mood, bad manners, and not willing to help. I wouldnt stay there again and would advise people against it.

<Content>Great hotel! Our party of 10 stayed in Barcelona for two nights - Monday 11-Wednesday 13th August. Since there were so many of us, we took a taxi from the airport which worked out cheaper and less hassle. The hotel itself was very clean, modern and trendy. All our rooms were beautifully furnished. I couldn't find any fault with the hotel or the rooms. Breakfast was included with our price and there was quite a lot to choose from - cereal, pastries, toast, cheese, hams, yoghurts, fruit, hot sausage, egg, bacon. The reception and bar staff were all very friendly and willing to help. The hotel manager even helped us find minivan hire for one of our daytrips.All in all, great hotel - good location - not too close to the hub of everything, but easily reachable via metro or walking.

<Content>great hotel, great location - perfect! We had booked the Silken Diagonal but after reading reviews on this site, and others, changed to the Casanova. We were really pleased with the hotel. The staff were very helpful and the location was perfect.Casanova is a modern boutique hotel and the location is within walking distance to Las Ramblas and Plaza de Catalunya, so it's very central to anything you might need. The area around the hotel offers a good selection of bars and restaurants and two subway stations are nearby.Breakfast offered a wide variety of choices, so something for everyone. As for the rooms, they were well presented, comfortable and the air conditioning was great. I'd recommend this hotel to everyone and my daughter is already planning a return trip with her friends.

<Content>Excellent hotel great location Great location. nice and central within easy 10 min walk to Pl Catalunya. Clean hotel, friendly staff. Good breakfast. We had one of their evening menus for 35 euro/pp. It included water, cocktail and bottle of wine plus good food. My only gripe was poor lighting in bathroom and poor drainage of bathroom sink.Overall strongly recommend this place.

<Content>Great hotel and nice staff I spent 11 nights in this great hotel. Staff were freindly, polite and helpful. I liked the location of the hotel, about 10-15 min walk to La Rambla Street. Bus and Metro station are at a walking distance. Plenty of coffeeshops, fast food resturants and other resturants are nearby. Many dress shops are in your way to La Rambla. One negative point is that rooms are noisy. However, It is a woderful hotel. I will not hesitate to visit it again.

<Content>Hip! Why need a replacement? Outstanding hotel in a great location. I prefer staying slightly away from Las Ramblas and this hotel is just about 5-10 minutes walk away. the restaurant is excellent - I know there have been some patchy reviews on this, but the general standard of food is top notch - the service is casual, which fits the feel of the hotel.Would recommend to everyone.

<Content>Good Location Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights for our wedding anniversary this is a lovely hotel very clean very modern staff very helpful. The room was wonderful although a little small we had a very nice bath/shower room and a very comfortable bed pity there were no tea making facilitys in the room, but the really good thing was that they had a decent hairdryer in the bathroom ! and dressing gowns. The only thing that really lets it down is the price of the drinks in the bar this is a lovely bar and we would have liked to have spent more time there but the drink prices were way over the top 拢10 for a gin  tonic ! The tour bus is fantastic Bus Touristic I booked our 2 day ticket before we went via their web site we managed to see most of the city and surrounding areas by using this bus and you never had to wait more than about 5 mins for one to come along..brilliant. If you stay at the Casanova I would say it will take you about 15-20mins to walk to the port but it is well worth it especially if you walk through the Gothic quarter. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Great Location Me and my wife stayed there for 6 nights and it was ideal for us. It is 5-10 mins walk to Placa Catalunya and 4 mins walk to the nearest metro station.Rather than getting the taxi from the airport, it is better getting an Aerobus which costs about 4 euros per passenger. The Aerobus stops 2 blocks away from the hotel.Reasonably priced on Lastminute.com, cheaper than booking direct.The rooms have laminate flooring and small rugs near the bed. Only problem is that they do not provide slippers.Highlight has to be the bathroom, which includes a tub and a wetroom, best of both worlds! The water pressure is quite strong and is always piping hot.Being a European hotel they do not provide kettle or tea facilities in the room. We only had breakfast once and would rate it as good. They do not provide hot food such as Omellete and their fruit selection is somewhat limited.The staff are very friendly although they are a bit slow in providing an iron and ironing board.The bar is quite stylish but the drinks can be lethal depending on who is serving them.

<Content>Very Good Location, Good staff, Poor Restaurant We stayed at the hotel for 3 Nights, and Location was Very Good and we where able to vist many different attractions. The staff some where more helpful than other but overall Good. The Restaurant was not very good quality foods and very experience, there seemed to a bit of lack of things to do in hotel, like internet, pool. Also the price of the massage, etc was well too much.I would recommend it if you can get an cheap price.

<Content>Fantastic hotel minutes from La Rambla. After looking at various hotels for a surprise 40th birthday trip in Barcelona, I decided that Casanova (by Raphael) looked most likely to charm my good lady - and boy, it done so in abundance.A beautiful stone exterior was replaced internally by modern chic in a staff friendly establishment . Our upgraded room was spacious, and impressive with chez longue and modern furniture, although slighly lacking in natural sunlight as we were at the rear of the building. The bathroom and shower topped everything off brilliantly - fantastic. A few minutes walk took you nicely on to the bustle of La Rambla to mingle and watch the street artists.The tour bus was the perfect way to see the sights and get around the city. Plan your days attractions around the red, blue and green bus routes but beware some stops are busy with queues. Sagrada Familia is unmissable and pay the extra few Euro's for the guided tour which is packed full with information. Other attractions that we visited were The Nou Camp and Barcelona Cathedral which were both equally fantastic.This is truely a fantastic city to sight see and relax in the cafes, bars and restaurants.

<Content>Nice Hotel good location After many hours of searching hotels on trip advisor and the net I finally decided on the hotel Casanova for 4 night break, we were impressed, we stayed in a Junior Suite which had a separate shower, bath and lounge area. The bed was massive with well appointed rooms in general. Some observations: the rooms to the rear of the hotel are quite dark and have no view, it鈥檚 a 10 minute walk to the top of the Rambla and 20 minutes to the central area. I would recommend this hotel however if your after a really central location I would pick Hotel 1898 or one of the hotel on the Rambla as it quite a stagger back last thing at night. Few Points on Barcelona, taxi is the easiest way to get from the Airport its around 20 euros and worth it with big suitcases, the underground system is brilliant, cheap efficient trains run every five minutes and walk along the Rambla but don鈥檛 eat there, its expensive and there are far better restaurants a few blocks away.

<Content>The Great Times... We booked this hotel after reading several positive reviews on TripAdvisor. We can confirm that the hotel is very stylish, relatively inexpensive, the staff helpful and the location ideal for seeing the sights of the city. Our standard room was street-facing and the traffic noise was not a problem in the slightest; if you are in a city you should expect a fair level of ambient noise. The bathroom was clean, modern and well-fitted; large shower head and clean bath in a wet room. The bedroom itself was not particularly spacious but was comfortable, the air-conditioning worked efficiently, the bed was large; in short, it was exactly what we wanted after a long day of sightseeing. We would highly recommend the Casanova to anyone wishing to enjoy a smooth and comfortable stay in a central area in Barcelona.

<Content>good base for exploring the city just returned after spending 2 nights at the Casanova Barcelona.Excellent location for transoprt links and as abase for exploring the city.Room we had was at the front of the hotel overlooking the main road and was a little noisey, but perhaps that's being over critical.Comfort, decor and size of the room is above average and the bed a joy to sleep in.I stayed on a room only basis and found the cost of eating in the hotel prohibitive ( 20 euros each for a continental breakfast ?) and found god option for a cheap breakfast directly opposite the hotel.Reception staff were very cold and disinterested on check in, but on he whole a good hotel if a little overpriced.

<Content>Stylish, convenient hotel I chose this hotel for my third stay in Barcelona, this time in connection with a language holiday at the Don Quijote Spanish school on Gran Via. The hotel is very conveniently located on Gran Via, about a 10 minute walk from the school and Plaza Catalunya. Barcelona has a well-deserved reputation for stylish hotels, shops and restaurants - and the Rafael Casanova lives up to the city's high standards. The hotel boasts a very funky and comfortable lobby/bar that is perfect for lounging at the end of a long day of shopping or sightseeing. The staff are friendly, particularly the regular doorman.I had asked for a quiet room because I would be studying, so I was given a room on the 3rd floor facing the courtyard. This limited exposure to noise from the street, but unfortunately the sound insulation between rooms and between the rooms and the corridor is poor. When people came back to the hotel late at night, it sounded like they were talking (loudly) right beside my bed. Overall, the noise levels didn't bother me, but if you noise bothers you be wary of booking here.The room itself was great - very comfortable and stylish. While the desk was small, the room came equipped with side tables you could pull over the bed - perfect for bedside reading or computing. I appreciated the fact that broadband internet access, if you connected to the network via a cable loaned by the front desk, was free. It cut out a few times for brief periods but overall it worked very well, as I needed it to, for work purposes (because I had to stay connected to the office even while on holiday).The best feature of the room was the bathroom. Again, the decor was great and it was of a good size. It came stocked with robes, good quality towels and toiletries from The White Company - the only minor disappointment is that the hotel provides only a combination shampoo/conditioner, which I dislike. The best feature of the bathroom was the bath/shower arrangement. It took up half the bathroom and was enclosed in glass. There was a large comfortable bathtub and beside it, a tiled shower area with a powerful shower equipped with a rain showerhead. I loved that shower - and regretted the fact that my husband wasn't in Barcelona to enjoy it with me. Aside from the minor irritant of the lack of sound insulation, the only other negative aspect of my experience at this hotel was the reservation process. I tried to book directly on the hotel's internet website but balked at doing so when I realized that the hotel wanted me to provide my passport number (and to do so on a page that wasn't secure - before moving to a secure page). So I called the 1-800 reservation number and was faced with the same request for a passport number. The booking agent stated that it was part of a policy, a legal requirement, to ensure that foreign visitors didn't leave the country without paying their bills. Yeah, right. I'm willing to provide a passport number, only on check-in, when I stay in a foreign country as part of the hotel's obligation to register foreign guests with the local police. It is, however, contrary to a hotel's merchant agreements with credit card companies to require such identification as part of a credit card payment process - and I'm certainly not going to provide it as part of a hotel booking process. So I declined to do so and proceeded to book the hotel through Expedia (for a slightly better price and in US dollars, thereby avoiding the charges my bank levies for foreign currency transactions on my credit card).On balance, I'd certainly stay at the hotel again because it's such a stylish and convenient hotel, but I'm very disappointed with the hotel's reservation policy. I plan to raise the hotel's booking policy with my credit card company.

<Content>Stylish boutique hotel Very stylish hotel in a good location in Barcelona close to the University. A short walk from Playa Catalunya and Ramblas.The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. There was some problem with our booking between the Uk travel agent and the Spanish travel agent, but they took care of it and understood the concept of customer service which is not always the case. Our first night, because of this booking confusion we were allocated a smoking room, which really was smoky but on the second night they upgraded us to a better class room. The breakfast was very nice and the cocktail lounge was stylish although very quiet while we were there.Don't let the hotel book you a taxi to the airport, there is an additional charge and taxis are very easy to get on the street.

<Content>Great hotel, great location! Stylish hotel, great location! A bus station is right in front of the hotel and the subway station (University) is a couple of minutes away. However, walking down the street towards Placa Catalunya is very nice and along the way, you'll encounter many stores like Zara, Topshop, Bershkin etc. The famous quarter- Las Ramblas- is also very close which makes this hotel the best choice for tourists. The room is well equipped and the staff is very nice, offering info along with maps for those who wanna check out this marvelous city. Right in Placa Catalunya there is a touristic info center from where you can book a tour of the city by bus, which I highly recommend. Also, this is the place where you can take the bus to take you to the airport, cheap and fast. We did not have any breakfast, but next to the hotel there's a pastry shop where you can buy sandwiches and croissants. Other than that, Barcelona is full of places to eat so this wasn't a problem for us. I would definetely come back to this hotel!

<Content>A comfortable, stylish and friendly hotel We thoroughly enjoyed our 3-night break at the Casanova, having returned on 7 March. Wheelchair users will find a ramp to the foyer and then everywhere else is on the level. Although our BB package was for a standard room we had the use of a larger bedroom with excellent access to the superbly-equipped bathroom. This was at the back of the hotel overlooking a very unusual, but nice, courtyard and next to the spa. It was very quiet.The room was spotlessly clean and serviced twice a day. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful and spoke English well.The Aerobus from the airport has low access with a ramp and you can get off at a stop about 100 metres from the hotel.The journey back to the airport though has to be from Placa Catalunya, about a ten minute walk away. The central location makes it easy to walk to the major Gaudi landmarks and also down La Rambla to the attractive harbour. Bars  restaurants abound - tapas being very popular and often good value.

<Content>Modern lovely hotel I stayed at this hotel with my bf and his parents for 5 days in January 2008. When we first walked into the hotel the staff were very friendly and most helpful, their Englinsh was very good.As the hotel was not busy they even asked us if we would like to be upgraded to a Queensize room! The rooms were lovely, and absolutly spotless. The fluffy dressing gown and slippers are a nnice touch. The bathroom is a semi wet room which was a little bit strange for us not being used to it, but the shower was really good. One of our party had also had a bath in their room.Our room faced onto the Main Street and had a little balconey. We could hear some of the traffic at night - things like police sierns and alarms but this is to be expected in any city and it didnt disturb us.Breakfast was excellent - full continental. the waiters also offered eggs adn bacon. The fresh fruit was lovely and catered well for vegetarians.We didnt eat in the restaurentat night as we felt that there wasnt enough selection.The location of the hotel is also very good. There are two metro stops close by and the Ramblas is an easy walk away. Barcelona is such a big city that there is always going to be a lot of walking involved.The staff were all very friendly and helpful. If I was to return to barcelona I would stay here again.

<Content>stylish but bad experience The hotel is located convenient to the main street, the interior is clean and stylish, the price didn't feel overly expensive; however a big problem was safety. The door didn't have a dead bolt, which from a US resident standpoint a bit worrysome but some may say normal for a European hotel. One night, there was a group of very drunk young men who were basically kicking and screaming in the hallway just outside of our room. Then actually one guy was able to open our room door with his card key! Right after that we went downstairs to the front desk, and the front desk manager deactivated the keys and re-issued us the refreshed set of card keys. A security guy said that he didn't see anyone suspicious. The durnk men continued to kick and scream (seemed that they were staying next door to us), so we called the front desk, but it didn't feel like any intervention was made. It could have been just a small mistake at the card key installation point, but as it was combined with a group of drunk people, it unfortunately turned out to be a bad experience. Otherwise the room was cleaned neatly every day.

<Content>Excellent Hotel The hotel is really good. For the price we have paid it was overal very good. The point that we missed was that there wasn't a swimming pool, but I think when they would have a swimming pool this hotel certainly would get a 5 star. And would be more expensive.The hotel has a very good orientation, near plaza catalunya and Ramblas so the shopping area. The hotel staff was very friendly and the rooms were always okay.The hotel even maid our trip to cava freixenet, they have made the booking for us (group of 7)The triple room was bigger then we thought.Overal a good hotel, and I have read that many persons complain about the noise, but you have to remind that you make a citytrip, and a city where is much to do, there is more noice. But I have nothing noticed at all, and had a quiet sleep!

<Content>good hotel barcelona Just come back from 3 night break in Barcelona, 13 adults, we stayed at the Rafael Casanova Hotel. The hotel was very good and only a short walk to the centre of the city. The rooms were modern and very comfortable the only downside was the hotel is on a very busy road and consequently the noise from the traffic could be heard throughout the night. I would still recommend the hotel but request a room on the back of the hotel if you are a light sleeper.We ate in the hotel restaurant twice and the food was very good, the staff are pleasant and helpful. The hotel has a nice bar and lounge area and was an ideal meeting area to start the evening or to round off the evening and very comfortable, We drank copious amounts here !Overall a great weekend.

We can confirm the friendly staff and the excellent breakfast, which was available until 10.30 a.m. Our room was a standard room but was very well appointed and with plenty of space. Even though we were overlooking the main road the noise was not a problem apart from the sirens of the emergency vehicles passing by but we could hear these all over Barcelona anyway. Thankfully either I slept soundly or the sirens did not operate after midnight because I did not have a disturbed sleep.If you arrive at Barcelona airport then the aerobus outside each terminal is worth taking into the Plaza Catalunya as they depart every 6 minutes and only take 15- 20 minutes to get there for a modest 鈧?.90. When you arrive in the centre go back to the other side of the square and you will see the Cafe Zurich at the top of La Rambla - keep this on your right hand side and walk up Calle Pelai and you will see the University at the top. Turn left and the hotel is 2 blocks on the right hand side. An easy 10 -15 minute walk at most.

<Content>Great Hotel This hotel is very upscale and modern. The location is great within walking distance to Las Ramblas and other touristic attractions and the metro. We had a king bed which is next to impossible in the rest of Spain we traveled to. The shower was INCREDIBLE. It was bigger than the one we have at home. They have big fluffy towels and nice bathrobes as well. The breakfast was superb with lots of options. The staff were most helpful and the service was excellent. When we checked in we were told by the lady at the desk that the breakfast was included with our room. The next day when we went we were told there would be a charge so we contacted the desk again and she said actually there was a charge but since she had told us otherwise that there was not that she would honor it. I was very impressed with this level of service. I have traveled to many other European cities and have stayed at many different hotels and will have to say that this was great for the price. It is not the quality of a Ritz but is close and is half the price. Great value overall and would highly recommend to anyone traveling to Barcelona. This was one of my favorite cities in Spain. The architecture is amazing and it is a very international city with many options for dining. Most of the people at the hotel speak English which was refreshing after having been to other cities in Spain where it is not. Although I do not expect people to speak English when it is not the language of their country it does make it easier to travel if they do and you do not know their language!

<Content>A bumpy start but worked out well... I booked (online) a superior double for a Friday and Saturday night weekend trip with my wife. When we arrived my heart sank ... we were told that there was no superior room available. There then followed a bit of haggling whereby we eventually settled for the standard double for the first night but insisted on taking an available superior room for the second night against which we negotiated a discount for both nights.At that stage we felt a bit miffed and the standard double was fairly small albeit very smartly presented, spotless and at the back of the hotel (quieter!).On the Saturday afternoon we got back to the hotel to switch rooms and were pleased to be told that we had been upgraded to a Junior Suite to make up for the inconvenience.The Junior Suite was terrific so although in the end we did not actually get to see the superior double I had booked we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, reception staff were very helpful (although my frame of mind on arrival did not allow me to appreciate it at that time!) and the hotel was spot on for quality and presentation.

<Content>Lovely hotel We enjoyed our recent four day trip to Barcelona. Other reviewers here have already praised the hotel and we thoroughly agree. We'd like to add a little about practicalities.We arrived at El Prat and took the Aerobus into Barcelona at 鈧?.95 each. The buses run every 10 mins or so and you need the stop Place Catalunya. Then walk back along the Gran Via de la Cortes Catelan in the direction of Place d'Espanya and you will find the hotel on your right.We did not use the hotel bar or restaurant (other than breakfast - very good indeed), instead we took a bus (No 59 right outside the hotel) to the port where there is a huge selection of fresh fish restaurants - menu of the day starts at 鈧?0 each. The last No 59 bus comes back at 22.30, or there is a night bus, N9. The single fare is 鈧?.25, but we bought a T-10 ticket from the machine just inside the underground at l'Universitat for 鈧?.75 which allows 10 trips and can be shared between 2 people over a number of days.The Place Catalunya is about 10 mins stroll from the hotel and has a very large, efficient tourist office (below ground but well sign posted). We bought a two day ticket for 鈧?3 each on the Bus Touristic - these buses follow three different routes and you can hop on and off as much as you like over the two day period; there is also an audio facility in several languages.Others have commented that the hotel can be noisy - we had a room at the side and it was OK for us. The rooms are air conditioned and have a free safety deposit box and amini-fridge, which we used for our own water. The bed was very large and more comfortable than ours at home; the bathroom has a wet room - lovely. The rooms and public areas are very clean. The staff are very helpful, courteous and professional.

<Content>A random but very fortunate choice The choices of hotels in Barcelona seem almost endless so I'd been looking and looking and still couldn鈥檛 decide so just chose the Casanova on a whim. It looked central enough and the price was reasonable for a 4 Star, so I just figured it would do and hoped for the best....What a brilliant stroke of luck making that choice!To echo the previous reviewers this hotel was fantastic. I felt I was paying Travellinn prices and getting Radisson luxury. I've stayed in quite a few 4star hotels on both business and leisure tripsand this was easily the best. It rivalled some 5 stars too..The location was good being just that bit away from the centre but still within easy reach. It is midway between 2 stops of the Aerobus so you can either get off on Gran Via de les Corts Catalans at Urgellor Universitat and walk back. You don鈥檛 need to go all the way to Placa Catalunya. However since the bus doesn鈥檛 go back the same way, it meant I had to walk to Placa de Catalunya on the return trip, and wasn鈥檛 sure where the stop was. I found it quite easily though , its beside where the Bus Turistic - Red (North ) route stop is. By the way, another tip for the bus....When I came out of the terminal there was a huge queue at a ticket machine by the Aerobus stop. I was sure I had read that you could paythe driver so I wondered why the queue? It seemed people were struggling to feed crumpled Euros into the machine and it was taking ages. After watching for a few minutes a bus came along and there wasvirtually no queue to get on as everyone was still at the ticket machine, so I thought I'd chance it and got on, and yes you can pay the driver (鈧?.90 one-way) and he does give change. Felt sorry for the people in the queue. Think it was a case of 'follow the leader' and people joined the q because they assumed you had to.Anyway back to the hotel...Check-in was easy, no queue, the girl on the desk was friendly and efficient. I鈥檓 not sure if my charm offensive earned me an upgrade or whether the room I got was indeed the standard double I booked butif it was I am even more impressed. The room was a good size, spotlessly clean, nicely furnished. Very contemporary and modern. Good quality flat screen TV, beautiful bathroom with nice toiletries (The White Company if your interested!) Everything about it said quality, from the bed linen, the decor, the flooring, the soft fluffy white towels. And everything worked too! Safe, hairdryer, air-conditioning鈥?Makes a nice change from some so-called 4* London hotels !! Surprisingly the air-conditioning worked even when the main power switch was off, which I realised when I mistakenly left it on one day. The housekeeping staff (who did a fantastic job by the way) even left it switched on which was nice of them - if not very environmentally friendly!The A/C unit was concealed as opposed to being fitted to the wall and was quiet and efficient. There was some road noise with the French door to the balcony open (I was in a room over-looking the Gran Via) but with the door shut the noise was virtually deadened. I鈥檓 struggling to think of anything negative to say about the room and I think that says it all鈥?if you have to look that hard for something negative then it is probably not worth mentioning.The location on the corner of Carrer de Casanova is good with plenty of shops, bars, restaurants, cash machines nearby. The Underground is about a 5 min walk away at Universitat and the start of Las Ramblaabout 5/10 mins further.All in all, Barcelona is a wonderful city and this is a fantastic hotel, and I will definitely be returning to both!

<Content>Loved the Casanova I simply cannot fault this hotel. Not only were the staff extremely friendly, but the service, cleanliness and style were amazing. This is an ultra modern hotel, but not so much that you feel you have to wear designer labels just to walk in. The reception girls were so lovely and the consierge was helpful and a great conversationalist! Walking into our room, we were presented with a spotlessly clean bedroom with all the facilities you would expect for this 4 star hotel. The bathroom was massive, with a bath and shower (separate, not together!), a plasma TV, with CNN/BBC, a beautiful view of the garden below and such a comfortable bed! Highly reccomended and perfectly located (just a stroll down to La Rambla), this hotel is a cut above the rest...and for an affordable price too. We're definately staying here again.

<Content>Modern, chic and central hotel I stayed here with two friends during the Easter holidays and had a great time. We chose a hotel at the last minute and the Casanova was perhaps a bit more than what we would have wanted to spend but I think we all felt that it was great and well worth it.The location is excellent - about 5 minutes from the Gaudi houses north of the Gran Via, 10 minutes from Plaza Catalunya, easy to get to the top of the Ramblas, the modern art museum, etc.The decor is very sleek and modern, with a green-lit reception area and lots of chocolate brown and swirly patterns in the rooms. The room we had was very spacious, with ample room for three beds, flat screen TV, nice big bathroom, good shower, etc etc. Despite being right in the city centre, it was reasonably quiet with the windows closed and curtains drawn.The breakfasts were superb - lots of meats, cheeses, toast, pastries, fruits, etc. The staff were generally friendly and helpful.The only minor annoyances were: (1) the shiny blankets are quite loud when they crinkle, so it's difficult to get to sleep and even harder to get back to sleep once you've woken up, and (2) for some reason, I couldn't quite figure out the A/C unit so I found it a bit hot at night.Other than that, it was all good - would happily stay here again.

<Content>Great place to stay Lovely people, charming, very clean with daily housekeeping service. We enjoyed staying there very much. Close to everything. A 10-minute walk to the Rodeo Drive of Barcelona and to metro station. Lots of cafes nearby. Make sure to ask for room in the rear. The front room which overlooks the street is unbearably noisy. Also wished we didn't have to pay for our entire stay upon arrival because you're stuck if you're not happy, and can't move if you find something you like better. But we were very satisfied there and had no desire to move, so it all worked out!
