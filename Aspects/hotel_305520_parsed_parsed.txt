<Content>Not really recommendable Worst Check In experience ever - took them more than half an hour for a simple check in process - not once, but with many people I spoke to. Completely incompetent concierge. Rooms ok, but very thin walls; forget sleeping if one of the neighbours takes a shower.Breakfast is not in a breakfast room, it is in a part of the lobby - exteremely loud and uncomfortable.There must be other and better 4 and 5 star hotels around Orchard Rd. Avoid this one.

<Content>excellent stay Just back from this hotel -stayed here on our way to and from Oz.We cant find any fault with the hotel excellent service and lovely clean room,excellent base at the top of Orchard road for shopping but also for non shoppers like ourselves.We found the pool area very relaxing after a long day sightseeing.We stayed on a room only basis but found a lovely cafe a 2 min walk from hotel for breakfast -reasonably priced called The Rocky Master.We ate at the Newton Hawker centre and really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.We loved Singapore and would recommend a visit to Sentosa island

<Content>Breakfast a disgrace! We stayed in Singapore overnight on way to Phuket. We had to pay much more than the usual rate as it was Grand Prix time but this did not include breakfast. The breakfast was suppose to be $20 each but we were charged $28. Everything was stone cold - the eggs, bacon and tea and coffee - I do not mean luke warm but freezing. The rooms were nice and the hotel wasin a good location. The rooms were also very clean.The staff did not go out of their way.

<Content>My all time favourite hotel Easily the best hotel I have stayed in. I stayed here in March 2006 during my stopover on my return journey from New Zealand, spending nearly 3 days in the balmy 33潞C of Singapore before returning to a cold (4潞C), wet London. My room was lovely, well designed, with a spacious marble lined ensuite. The hotel is huge and the vast lobby of the hotel hosted live music in the evening. I arrived at 9.00pm in the evening and by the time I had sorted myself out the hotel restaurant was closed (more about the restaurant below). Hungry, at 1.00am I ventured downstairs to the reception to find out what kind of food was available through room service or locally. I was asked if a dish of fried rice was acceptable, brilliant I thought, not the usual fare of congealed potato wedges and dips. Less than 15 minutes later a steaming plate of food arrived with not just fried rice, but chicken, singapore noodles, spring rolls and other goodies. The service at the hotel was the best I have ever experienced.The Orchard's restaurant offered an 脿 la carte or buffet selection, both of which were of the highest standard. I was in my element at breakfast time with a wide selection of breakfast fare, a choice of eggs (scrambled, poached, boiled, fried or omeletted to order). I chose to return to the hotel for most of my meals during my short stay in Singapore, as the food was so good.The hotel is situated close to the shopping area on Orchard Road, where you can visit the designer shops, or buy electronic goods and jewllery for far less than you would in the UK. In the shopping mall behind the hotel I found a good tailor who was able to make a dress and suit for me in just over a day and at a reasonable price. I would highly recommend the Orchard Hotel to anyone staying in Singapore.

<Content>Dreadful place - won't ever stay there again We recently returned from a short 2 night stay at the Orchard Hotel. We chose it because it was a short distance from the Thai Embassy where we had to renew our visas (we live in Bangkok).All we can say is...dreadful...and we'll never EVER stay there again. Firstly, my husband's company booked it and asked for a large deluxe as we were travelling with 2 small children (3  1). Upon arrival we were told we could have a larger room but wait for 45 mins. Ok, we thought if it's worth it. Complimentary drinks whilst waiting, but, only if you had red wine or beer...Told it was a corner room, get there and it had a tiny L shaped corridor that led to the smallest deluxe room we'd ever seen. Annoyed, we asked for the bigger room we were promised and were fobbed off by a junior who said that the Orchard does have the smallest rooms in Singapore! There was no where to put our travel cot and you couldn't swing a cat in it. Finally the duty manager arrives, and very rudly said this was the best they could do unless we were prepared to pay more. After tense arguments, they moved us to a twin room which was much bigger which proved they had the rooms all along. All of this took 3 hours by which time our children were going nuts.Next morning we head to breakfast only to be told there were no tables free, there was a queue and could we come back in 10 minutes! We have never been asked to wait for breakfast in a hotel in which we are staying. With 2 small kids you cannot wait. So after much hasseling we got a table. Breakfast was less than impressive. Service appaling.Lifts that close so quickly one of our strollers with our 3 yr old sat in got caught in the doors.Finally when checking out and rushing for the airport we're told our lugguge is on it's way from the room so we call a taxi and wait and wait to be told they cannot get into our room, their master key does not work. So they lied to us and not one apology.It's outdated, run poorly, furnishings are old, tatty and in sore need of replacement. To charge min USD250 is an insult. There are plenty of other alternatives in the same price bracket. Last month we stayed at the Pan Pacific Sinapore at Marina Bay. Same price and in a different league.Worst place we've ever stayed in. Don't go.

<Content>losing its shine ! I have stayed @ the Orchard Hotel on several occasions in the past whilst visiting or passing through Singapore and have found it to be very good, not excellent but very good. However, on my last stay they seem to have dropped the ball.I stayed in an Executive room in the Ochard Wing which is the room grade I normally choose but based on my last stay, I think I'll explore other accommodation options.Firstly, the room tariff has increased to SIN$400 per night + 10% service fee + 7% GST. I think the Orchard is becoming a little expensive.Secondly, the executive checkout wasn't functioning (so I was told) when I tried to check out and I was told to go downstairs to the main desk. This didn't worry me unduly but one of the things I like about the Executive Club is that you don't have to wait in line to checkin or checkout. After waiting for 10 minutes to reach the front of the queue, I was told by the staff member that I could have checked out upstairs. When I stated that the staff member upstairs told me to come to the main checkout because of a problem, he didn't look very impressed and neither was I.Lastly, on each occasion that I've previously stayed @ the Orchard, I've sometimes tipped for excellent service and sometimes not if I thought it wasn't warranted. This last visit was the first time that I've seen staff on 2 seperate occasions obviously stand there waiting for a tip and not being at all backward about it.On a previous visit I had asked about the service charge on the room and had been told that tipping was not necessary as the service charge covered this aspect, and besides this is Singapore and it's not considered to be polite.If you consider that the service charge on my room was SIN$40 per night, that's a lot of tipping value that's supposed to be distributed amongst the hotel staff.I like the Orchard but they need to pull their socks up in my opinion.

<Content>Three strikes, so they are O-U-T I had booked through one of the online Asian booking services, and stayed for three nights in early June 2008.The carpeting in the room was filthy: stained with many splotch marks, and general unsightly. The furniture in the room was so antiquated it is what I remember from my childhood 50 years ago: stained wooden beds, night tables, and desks painted over at least nine different times down through the years.The buffet for breakfast was merely adequate. Coffee and tea were self-service, so there were large numbers of persons always walking about the dining room with cups of hot beverage. No waitress/waiter service, no carafes; one simply had to get up and walk over to the hot beverage dispenser with one's cup. This is truly an accident waiting to happen.There is a fast food outlet off the lobby (Swenson's American style coffee shop). The hotel doors leading into the fast food outlet are always open, so the odor of the fried food always permeates the hotel lobby. What a smelly situation.

<Content>Very good hotel I stayed at Orchard hotel just for a night and obviously I cant have a complete opinion about it. Despite of that I can make some comments. Unfortunately I didnt ate or used any facilities that the hotel may have but I loved the location and the room. Conveniently located at the end of Orchard road and ideal for shopping and with a great room this hotel was just perfect for me. I shall use it again to my next visit to this wonderfull city.

<Content>Over Priced Clean  tidy, I stayed on the executive level, pool is good. Not worth paying the extra to upgrade to executive floor for the few benefits.1) Free cocktails between 6-8pm, but is all waitress service, 1 girl serving  the service is slow. Food is buffet type, and is nothing special. 2) Laundry to the value of S$18, however by the time u have put your T shirt  socks in you are over the level. expensive if you stay more than a few days.Handy for the shopping on Orchard Road  Orchard towers 2 mins awayThe room needed a bit of maintenance, knobs missing off the cupboards, sink cracked etc, not what u expect from a hotel of this calibre

<Content>Pretentious We booked this hotel for (what was meant to be) our one night stop over en route to Thailand. Initial impressions are good, the lobby and reception area were nice and lively. Reception was cold and could not be described as friendly or welcoming. The rooms are nice and large and very well appointed. our room had very high ceilings which added to the feeling of size. We had no complaints with the room and found it quite comfortable.The location of the hotel is good for shopping and sightseeing tours.I had some visa troubles trying to travel to Thailand so we had to stay in Singapore one more night. After travelling from the airport back to the city centre to the airline offices and back to the Orchard hotel, we were notably hot and sweaty and tired. we did not have a reservation, however as we asked if they had availability she took a looked at us disapprovingly then in the system, had a quiet word with her colleage and told us that they were sold out. We later checked and there were rooms available online that night. I am very unimpressed with their arrogance and lack of customer service skills.I have stayed in hotels much nicer than this and have never been treated in this manner... very disappointed.

<Content>Superior suites good We originally had a superior room booked for 6 days however these rooms have a quirky little feature of a large porthole between the bed and the bathroom, ok if you are travelling alone or if you want to watch your companion on the loo (not my cup of tea but hey each to their own). We upgraded to one of the new wing rooms which was great had a hugely impressive bathroom and incorporated breakfast evening cocktails and snacks the cost of the upgrade was 拢230. The hotel was easy walking to the big malls on Orchard Rd. Word of warning we left a cash deposit of 拢150 as security even though we had paid in full as we didnt wish to give our card details this was not offered back on checkout and had to be asked for. would i return? No but thats because i would never choose to return to Singapore.

<Content>Just OK We stayed in the Orchard Hotel as part of a SIA stopover package. The hotel is in a great location easy access to attractions, shopping and restaurants We arrived early in the morning after a long flight and we were given a room immediately, we requested a non-smoking room, however the room smelled like someone chain smoked in there for about 2 years. The carpet was filthy with big black stains all over. I found this inexcusable and disgusting. I assume management doesn't read TA reviews because I know smelly rooms and dirty carpets have previously been mentioned. I did report my observations to the management before leaving, whatever that's worth.Breakfast was good and was included with our package.The public areas of the hotel appeared to be clean and well kept and I found the staff to be helpful and friendly.I would not stay here again.

<Content>Good hotel after reception We booked two nights at the Orchard as a stopover en route to Australia. Specific requests were made for an early check in as we arrived at 07:00am following a 12 hour flight. The receptionist simply was not interested in this and advised us that a three hour delay was the best they could offer. There was no duty manager available to assist and despite repeated requests there was no way past this lady. We did eventually get a room at 09:30 despite a considerable number of people checking out whilst we waited. Surely Orchard management must be aware that the Orchard is widely used for stopovers and they must be more accommodating. After the initial problems we had no further cause to complain, the room was fine and very clean however watch out getting out of the shower as the bath side is considerably higher than normal and slipped getting out of the shower. The included buffet breakfast was excellent and the location convenient to shops and restaurants, the Hard Rock cafe is just across the road.

<Content>What you'd expect from a large hotel Stayed in the Orchard on return journey from NZ/Aus. Had two nights on the way out and one night on the return. Hotel is large and very busy, business travellers, airline crew, delayed flight passengers and many stopovers. Staff were friendly and the rooms were clean and well maintained. We were travelling with 3 children which the hotel couldn't really cater for. We had two rooms one double and one double with extra bed, on both visits we had to request the extra bed on arrival as it wasn't already set up. A little frustrating as we arrived late with jet lag and the kids were desperate to get to bed. It also meant that we had to split the family up, one adult in one room with a child and one adult with the other two in a different room. The food at the hotel was ok. Buffet style and what you'd expect from a large hotel - nothing special but plenty of alternative places to eat down the road. Location is good, right at the top of Orchard Road so if you enjoy shopping malls, you'll be in heaven! A couple of things which did impress us, my husband left a jacket at the hotel on our way out and 5 weeks later it was waiting at reception for him on our return trip. The pool was quiet and plenty of loungers and towels. Drinks very expensive though. A hospitality room and childrens playroom (very basic) were available for use after checkout but you had to share facilities with everyone else waiting for late flights. Overall, not a bad place to stay for a night or two but wouldn't recommend for anything more than business or 'stopover' accommodation.

<Content>Peacs and tranqullity Having just completed a 12 Day Cruise from Hong Kong To Singapore visiting Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, it is always a comedown leaving the comforts of the luxury ship and checking into a hotel! To soften the effects I booked an Executive (Club) room for the 3 nights at the Orchard Hotel before returning to Dublin. Yes, the three nights cost another 鈧?50 above the rack rate but what you got was worth every penny.Checkin is on the Executive Floor and, by luck, a room was ready for us when we arrived... at 8 am in the morning. Having the Room so early enabled us to get a few hours sleep before seeing the sights of Singapore. The Rooms on the Executive floor live up to everything the Hotel website states and the colour co-ordination is totally peaceful and relaxing being a mix of Black, Blues and Red. The Breakfasts were delicious and served in the Executive lounge as was lunch bites, afternoon snacks and evening hot and cold hors d'oeuvres. Between 6 and 8 pm any drink you like was there for the asking, free including top-ups . The Service was outstanding and the Staff could not do more for you if they tried.On the last night we tried the Buffet in the Cafe on the Ground floor( don't be put off by the name as it is really a Restaurant). WOW, from Snow-Crab to fine Fillet roast and 36 other choices in-between together with 14 different sweets to finish....this was some meal to end our Holiday. The buffet only costs 鈧?0 for 2 including Service charge. I have stayed in many Hotels in the past but this has to be one of the most relaxing and tranquill ones. I will return to the Orchard if only for this.........rarely found elsewhere.

<Content>OK Hotel Just came back from Singapore where we stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Some of the staff are friendly, some not as much. The rooms are big enough for what we needed. We were in there to see the city and not stay in the room all day. Location wise, it's a bit further from the main attractions of the city (Orchard Road shopping strip, China Town, Little India and the Harbour). Don't get me wrong, the public transit system is pretty easy to use and it's about a 5 minute walk to the MRT (their local subway system).About the rooms, a bit on the tired side. The carpets need replacing badly! The hotel claims to be a smoke free hotel but I think it was a smoking hotel before. No matter how much they steam clean the smell of smoke is still around. We had to ask them to leave an airpurifier in our room for the duration of our stay. Aside from that, our room had a large bed, safe, mini frig, kettle for making tea or coffee.iron and ironing board and a really cool window between the bathroom and bedroom area. Don't worry, there is a screen you and pull down for privacy. They also have an outdoor pool (pretty good size), a fitness room, a mini golf area and a kid's play room.The hotel is fair for the price you pay. If you are booking this hotel, make sure you get a really good deal (compare prices throught the Internet or with your travel agent first). DO NOT pay the rack rate because it is NOT worth the money. Upon check in we heard another customer request a room and the hotel quoted them more than twice the price as what we paid.

<Content>Average Stayed here for 2 nights on route to Australia, booked 1 twin and 1 triple room but on booking in was told there were only twin rooms available and we would have to have extra bed in one room 3 single beds in a not very big twin room! so was not too happy about this but no apology from staff just take it or leave it  attitude. The pool was OK but don't buy a drink from the pool bar, the prices are very expensive as is the bar next to reception. The buffet breakfast was good with all tastes catered for but had to wait for some things to be cooked. Our breakfast was included in room rate don't think I would have paid extra for it as was quite expensive.  Think I would try a different hotel when next in Singapore

<Content>Great location! We just came back from spending 3 nights at the Orchard Hotel in Singapore. This was a great hotel with an excellent location - right on Orchard Road. Check-in was fast and easy. We hadnt gotten breakfast included in our rate but it was no problem b/c we ate at this little cafe facing Orchard Road called Rocky Mountain or something like that. They served an american breakfast for about US$7. A nice way to start the day! The Orchard Hotel has nice, clean rooms, and good bathrooms. There's a flat screen tv in the room too! The only thing I'd criticize is that the beds are too hard. We knew this from all the reviews we had read anyway. I think anymore than 3 nights and we would've been uncomfortable but 3 nights on a hard bed was fine. The location is really great at this hotel - a quick walk to the visitor centre, across the street from CPK and Starbucks etc.. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Singapore. Cant comment on the food and other amenities as we didnt really try anything. The concierge service was nice though and helped us out with a luggage pick up. Great place to stay in Singapore!

<Content>Disappointing We stopped in Singapore for one night en route to Australia. The Orchard Hotel is well located, and the rooms were comfortable enough. However, we arrived at 8:30 pm and the room was not ready until 9:30. Room service was slow, even after reaching them (the direct phone line didn't work).

<Content>Not Bad, very impersonal Stayed here for three nights enroute to Thailand. Check in process was incredibly slow and after about 20 mins managed to get to talk to someone, who spoke about three words during the process. We were upgraded to an executive room on the top floor free of charge which meant that we ended up with a room that was huge and had our breakfast on the same floor as were were staying.The staff on that floor were friendly and helpful, but would not have liked to pay the extra for the service.Ate in the hotels acclaimed Chinese restaurant on Christmas night and although not expensive the menu is certainly not to Western tastes, the food however was good and the service was prompt and curtious.I would stay here again but would be hunting for a good deal

<Content>Ok hotel The hotel location is ok, but a little far from the MRT after a full day of walking. The room and bathroom is very small. The quality of the breakfast is atrocious - there are much better breakfast places outside the hotel. Overall a very average hotel.

<Content>dont stay at the orchard hotel I work for an international shipping company. I have been staying at the Orchard Hotel Singapore for around three months now. This has given me enough time to evaluate the hotel and may I say that it is the worst hotel that I have ever had the displeasure of staying at.Please allow me to give an example, on 31st dec 07 at around 530pm I received a phone call in my room from the guest relations officer, informing that I had to relocate rooms because they claimed they were doing rectification on that floor, keep in mind this is new years eve. Disappointed I moved to another room on another floor. I went down to reception and spoke to the guest relations officer who ensured me that the rooms were undergoing rectification and that nobody would be staying in the room that I once occupied. So it was to my surprise when I called the room from my newly appointed smaller room and to my surprise there was somebody staying in there. The guest relations officer blatantly lied to me.The gymnasium is poor in relation to some of the equipment. The treadmills require servicing only one of them gets upto the speed that you select. the decor in the rooms looks tired, fixtures in the rooms need repair. Fire exits are blocked on occasion by room service trolleys or boxes and the doors that should provide you with a somke free escape are rotten at the bottom. The thermostats in the rooms that I have stayed in dont work. When I checked in they reserved 1000 dollars on my credit card without my knowledge. Overall A poor hotel with tired staff.

<Content>Smelly and slow service When I just check into the room, it has a very strong smell of smoke, I believe the previous tenant is a heavy smoker. I called up the room service but no one pick up the call. After a few fail attempts, I called up the front desk and made the complaint. I requested to changethe room, but the front desk people promised me after the room servicecame in, the smell will be gone. Waited for an hour with no response, I gotto leave the hotel for my event. When I was back to the room at night, the smell never improve, so I repeated the hassle of calling different extension to get the service. After an hour of waiting, the room service came in and simply spray something in the room and walkedout. There is no improvement to the situation but I gave up to made another complaint and settle with it.

<Content>Good hotel, well located We stayed at the orchard for 3 nights on our way through to Australia and found the hotel fine for the price we paid. Food in the hotel is pricey but there is plenty of places a taxi ride away. The room we had was a little small for the extra bed for our son, you should check what size room has been allocated. There is an outdoor pool that was a little chilly when overcast but I am sure in the sunshine it would be lovely.

<Content>Good Hotel, Excellent Location Spent three nights at the Orchard Hotel en-route back to London from Brisbane. Situated at the quieter end of Orchard Road, the main shopping street in Singapore, the hotel is well equipped with professional and courteous staff. The rooms are a good size, modern and well appointed. There are three restaurants, two bars, a well equipped gym and large pool. Check-in was painless and the luggage was speedily delivered to the room. Good breakfast buffet. A good 4* hotel, which I would be happy to use again.

<Content>Impressive We stayed only one night as a stop over at the end of our trip. So all we needed was a good place to rest as we had seen Singapore before. We paid a little more for the room (not the basic room) and was well worth it as we were treating ourselves. The room was quite well fitted our with modern styling, flat screen tv, relatively spacious. The bed was wonderful with a soft matress  pillows. Being a big hotel - reception was busy both when we checked in and out. But this wasn't a major problem. The location is quite convenient.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel Friendly Staff This hotel was great, my husband and I stayed here on our return trip from Australia for two nights, we loved it. The staff in the bar and resturant were supper friendly and very welcoming. The buffet evening meal was lovely, lots of choice and well laid out. I got my hair washed in one of the hairdressers and it was really good, spent a lot of time on it. Shopping on Orchard Rd is amazing, but as they are mostly designer goods a bit expensive, I bought some nice jewellery here, half the price than at home.If you prefer the market atmosphere and prices, China Town is good value and only a short taxi ride away.

<Content>"Above Average" Stayed here only for 1 night, coming from Australia on a stopover to the UK  we were happy with the stay! Probably wouldn't go back again - it was above average but only a typical business stop-over hotel. I didn't find much atmosphere there, it was just all robotic, there wasn't much human heart in the hotel but well worth the stay. It was central, clean  friendly.

<Content>Look forward to returning After reading some reviews were dreading our overnight stay to and from Australia. We needn't have worried; the hotel, staff, room and food were excellent! Don't know what people are harping on about re the breakfast buffet, it was fit for a king and a bargain price. We look forward to returning.

<Content>Decent but not spectacular - a typical business hotel Booked in the Claymore Wing for Sin$210+++ with breakfast. Checked in very late in the evening. specifically mentioned non-smoking and king size bed during booking through its hotel website. Was given a room with 2 single beds which I abhor. Only after expressing displeasure that a room with a king size bed was given. At least this receptionist did her best to accomodate unlike the Swissotel Merchant Court.Hotels should give preference to people who checks in late and checks out in very early in the morning to compensate for short duration in the hotel.Good things about the hotel: the bed is very comfortable. I think it's same as the one used in Royal Plaza at Scotts. In room amenities is extensive. Well kept. Good location.Bad things: public area does not commensurate with the high number of rooms. It feels cluttered and hectic. Breakfast area reflected the cramp-ness - tables were so closely put together and really felt rushed. Breakfast quality is not up to mark.In summary, for Sin$200+++ it's better value than the others I've stayed in. Far far far better value than Swissotel Merchant Court.

<Content>Nice but watch out The Orchard hotel is beautiful with very attentive staff. The daily buffets are a feast. Entertainment is good. My only warning is to watch out for deceptive add ons. I was encouraged when checking in to accept a $60/day executive upgrade. This was to include free soft drinks from the mini-bar and daily laundry up to $18/day. Also, access to the Executive lounge. Well when checking out I had been charged for drinking canned green tea from the mini bar and for cleaning services. It was explained that green tea was not considered a soft drink. And all of the daily laundry charges added on were because dry cleaning was not considered a laundry service even though it was under the $18/day allowance. Needless to say I was not pleased since at no time was there any mention that dry cleaning was excluded from the package or I would be charged $6 additional for each can of tea. So overall it was a nice hotel with very misleading promotions.

<Content>excellente !!! I was just in singapore for a few days for a business trip as well as sidestepping to jb in malaysia and stayed at the orchard hotel. though the hotel is at the end of the orchard road it wasn't such a drag to walk for 7 minutes to the nearest metro station and 5 minutes to the nearest bus station. along the orchard road is the shopping haven for up trend market labels. but for bargain hunters is not that difficult either for the metro station is just 7 minutes walk from the hotel.the hotel itself is superb in furnishing and style. i like especially the bathroom with a rounded see-through glass to the bedroom so you can watch tv while in the tub or just plain tease someone in the bedroom while bathing. lol!

<Content>Excellent Property I stayed for 2 nights in July 07. I had an executive club room so enjoyed access to the executive lounge upstairs where breakfast was served separately from the rest of the hotel guests, and drinks and finger food are served for nothing between 6 and 8 pm every evening.The hotel is really excellent and so was the service.The deluxe rooms were very well appointed and elegant. Location was first class, right on Orchard Road and close to everywhere. Highly recommended property for business or leisure.

<Content>Central The agent recommended this place, and on arrival despite the lack of welcoming staff and doors being opened for you, the lobby looked the part. The biggest choker was breakfast. S$20 each for a poor quality, limited choice buffet. We went to Negara next door for the same price at higher quality.Location:If you like shopping  prostitutes, no problem! As soon as dusk arrived, it was Hooker central outside.

<Content>very good hotel We stayed here on a 3 night stopover going to Australia and 1 night coming back. We had two very pleasant stays, with a warm welcome each time. The rooms were clean and well equipped, although the room on the first stay (13th floor) was bigger than on the second stay (6th) for the same price. Carpets in both rooms were a bit shabby and there was a slight musty smell that you might expect in a high humidity environment. All staff were very helpful. We didn't eat in the main hotel restaurant as it was a bit expensive and found places to eat elsewhere. There is a Subway and a western/Indonesian cafe within the hotel building, where we had a meal that was rather disappointing. There was a small, quiet shopping arcade here, including a tailor where I had a suit made to measure (in 2 days if you want), at an excellent price and very well made. All things considered we would certainly stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Place As our brochure stated the Orchard Hotel, offers cosmopolitan elegance and comfort in a great location. I agree!We stayed for four nights, but wished we had longer!Great hotel, rooms very modern, comfortable with a touch of luxury and a very good sized TV. (great value for money) Though we didn鈥檛 have time to watch TV, too much to see and do in Singapore! This hotel is in a great location, at the top of Orchard Road. This hotel has a beautiful reception area and the reception staff are very helpful.Though beware if you are checking in really early, (before 12noon) you may be given a key to a small courtesy room - you may also find that you are sharing this room with other early arrivals! Ok for a quick freshen up, but not good if you have got jet-lag and need to sleep! However I would definitely recommend this hotel and we hope to back one day!

<Content>Nice hotel, good for business travellers As Honeymooners, this in hindsight wasn't our best choice but it is still quite a nice stay. It's under going reno right now but we didn't notice it.It's got a very nice foyer, great facilities (gym, pool, hospitality room for late check outs, kids room and putting course), good breakfast buffet (with daily Vegetarian option, great for us) and very good staff.The only downer for us is that, as Honeymooners, there wasn't much and the room was on the small side.Having said that, the room was nice and cleaner, with a cut bathroom to boot.It's good stay for families (especially if you have kids) however I think it's probably best as a hotel for business travellers.Still we enjoyed our stay there.Ka.

<Content>Fab hotel, great location I stayed in this hotel during a stopver on the way back from Australia in Feb 2006. I found the hotel to be very clean and tidy and the staff were very welcoming. I was travelling with another female friend and we felt very safe in Singapore, and in this hotel. We were treated so well, we booked onto a morning sightseeing tour (arranged through the hotel) which I hightly recommend if you want to see some of the famous sights of Singapore in a few hours. Staff were always so helpful when getting taxi's and needing any assistance at all. The rooms were modern, very clean and well looked after. The location is great, situated inside a small shopping mall - you walk straight out and onto Orchard Road. The only slight disappointment was the breakfast, we thought we'd try it one morning (as we had paid for room only). It was quite expensive and not particularly worth the money!! All in all though, a fab hotel.

<Content>Pedestrian, at best... I'd been to Singapore before in 1994, but stayed in the Oriental. That hotel was very good, but geographically, a bit out of it. The agent recommended this place, and on arrival despite the lack of welcoming staff and doors being opened for you, the lobby looked the part. It is attached to the hotel shopping arcade, which like so many in over-subscribed Singapore is a run-down ghost town.The room:Refurbished in contemporary theme, but with chunks knocked out of the woodwork and a dirty carpet. Kind of an Ikea vibe going on and unfortunately quality of fittings to match...We were told it was recently refurbished, but it looked rather hammered. Only supplied 2 bath towels  no hand towels. Our room loooked over 2 building sites and the refurb of the pool area.Pool: Shabby. Ancient loungers, ice cold water and looking onto the side of a building, hence little sun. They did however, site the 'putting green' overlooking Orchard Road, which was bathed in sunshine. Go figure...The biggest choker was breakfast. 拢12 each for a poor quality, limited choice buffet, in an ambience of cheesy plastic marine life. How they can charge 10% service charge on a serve yourself breakfast is beyond me.Location:If you like shopping  prostitutes, no problem! As soon as dusk arrived, it was Hooker central outside. Both my Wife and Daughter felt anxious coming towards the hotel after shopping, being looked up and down by some very dubious characters.In conclusion, we would definately not recommend, or stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Excellent All-rounder I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and had complimentary brekkie! The hotel is situated in the CBD and as soon as you leave the hotel, its the shopping strip. The hotel is also close to all tourist attractions. The room was very clean and comfortable and had a plasma tv. I requested a Queen+ bed but got 2 king-single beds instead, but the service, location and quality made up for it.

<Content>Lousy, Filthy, Smelly. Obstinant and Arrogant Staff. I stayed for 1 month in this hotel. From the onset the place smelled terrible and my sinuses were enflamed by the mildew and mold in the place.The lobby is nicely done for sure but the rooms are shabby, old and small. I was apalled at the condintion of the place. I was so reviled by the filth that I would not let my feet touch the carpet.The mildew smell was unbearable, the rooms and halls have this very old AC with registers dripping condensated moisture all over the hallway floors. I had to buy a fragrant candle and turn off the AC just to have a chance of sleeping.The staff are obstinate, rude and unhelpful. They were unable to coordinate my statement with the arraingments made by their sales staff. I tried 5 times to settle my account according to the agreements made by their sales staff and was still not able to do so. I feel like I was caught in between their own petty internal fight.The restaurants were a complete rip off. I was charged $22 Sing for a bowl of cereal. The staff thought nothing of it. The in house dinner restaurant food was basically inedible, despite some positive comments from collegues and fellow travellers, there is nothing I can recommend there.One thing there is good to say about this place, is the location. But, one can find at least 3 or 4 hotels in the same place and I heartily suggest they do.Do not stay here.

<Content>Fantastic in every way I can honestly say this is the best hotel experience I have ever had. Nothing was too much trouble.When we arrived, I was upset 'cos there was a blocked drain smell in the bathroom - we were moved to a new room within 10 minutes of 'complaining'.From then on everything was great. The rooms are very nicely decorated and furnished, the buffet breakfast is enormous, and we spent late nights in the pool and playing outdoor chess.The location is fab, we walked everywhere at any time of day or night. Approaching Christmas is a really good time to visit this hotel, they had built a real gingerbread house in the foyer and decorated it with frosting and sweets. It was so creative.I'm saving up to go back as soon as we can!

<Content>Nice Hotel This is a very busy hotel in a prime location for visiting Singapore. I stayed here before and this time is the 2nd, each time on business trip. The rooms are small but up to date and comfortable. The reception desk does an efficient job. In my case, the check in took forever...but as I learned later because the lady who checked me in secured me a non-smoking room with a king size bed instead of 2 Queens. All i all a very neice hotel. It is walking distance to the prime shops of Orchard Road and some nice bars and restaurants. The breakfast buffet is very nice (especially the coffee).

<Content>Orchard was OK I stayed at the Orchard Hotel for 2 weeks in Feb. while on a buisness project. The hotel is located right at the end of bustling Orchard Rd. near most of the expensive designer shops and malls. I arrived very early in the morning and had no difficulties checking in and getting to my room. The hotel is divided into 2 wings with one being a little older than the other. I was in the older wing, but thought the room was very tasteful and modern. The rooms are a bit on the small side by American standards, but are still nice. I found the bathroom especially interesting as there is large round window between the bath/shower and the living area of the room. The only complaints about the room are that you can not adjust the temperature even though there is a thermostat in each room. They keep the air conditioning in the rooms set very cold! The other issue was that the carpet in the room was very dirty and didn't look like it had been cleaned in years. There is a very nice buffet for breakfast with lots of food selections to suit people of all tastes. There is a restaurant in the hotel, but I did not ever eat at it. Room service is offered 24hrs a day and has a pretty good selection, although I never found the food to be that good. There is also a lounge area in the lobby with live music everynight except Sunday. The same group sings there everynight, and although they try, they just aren't very good. The hotel will be going to all non-smoking rooms by March 2007, but smoking is allowed in the lounge area. There is an outdoor pool on the 4th floor which is very nice and some of the rooms in both wings overlook it. You are also able to get Tiger or Corona beer around the pool if you can find the wait staff. They tend to disappear from the pool area during the day. The hotel is connected to a shopping center that has mostly food shops. There is a Subway and Tony Roma's restaurant as well as a money exchange booth that keep good hours. At night, right accross the street there are prostitutes that pick up men in the bars in the shopping center next to the hotel. I went out a few times in the evening as a lone female and never felt threatened, but it was somewhat unfavorable to see next to the hotel. The area is very safe and there are always people out walking around. Overall the hotel sees a lot of business travelers and seems to be busy all the time. I don't know that I would stay here again if I ever came back to Singapore for holiday, but the hotel was ok by me.

<Content>OK but not great for lone female travellers The hotel was fine at check in but I was told they did not have a double bed just a single. This struck me later as odd. I did not realise the heat and immediately walked towards the shops to buy a dress for my business meetings the next day. As you turn to head down orchard there were a lot of Benches with men on them and I thought I heard a few comments. It struck me as off as I was told it was very female friendly and safe for women here. I returned and decided to have a drink in the lobby arounf 9pm with a magazine and my book. Very frosty reception from the waitress and felt like i was being watched by a table of men beside me who were not singaporean. My colleague the next day told me that after 10pm Prostitutes sit on the Benches outside and get picked up in a cab from the hotel. An Aussie lady I met on the way to the airport told me she had a drink the night before and a group of men were pointing at her. Did they think we were working gals??? She also had two singles and somone above her kept making noise all night. Maybe the double are for other customers. Travelling for business alone I will not be staying here again. On the other side the hotel was VERY clean but the food was average. Breakfast was the better meal I had here.

<Content>Good Hotel in a great location I stayed at the Orchard Hotel for four days and on the whole had a good experience. The hotel is right at the end of Orchard Road and therefore it is in a great location as you can simply walk down the long strip and ensure that you have not missed anything! The hotel is particularly popular with people on business and I encountered a lot of people who were staying at the hotel for business purposes. The pool area is on the third floor although with the hotel's prime location you may struggle to find the time to use the pool! The rooms although fairly small, are modern and newly renovated. There is a coffee shop in the lobby with a lovely bakary attached. The Hotel also has it's own little parade of shops attached although I would advise you not to exchange your currency in the currency exchange shop attached to the hotel as the rate is not as good as it is outside. There is a nearby convienience store which offers a better rate of exchange. There is also a Subway, an Irish Pub and restaurant attached to the little shopping mall to the hotel. On the whole I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a comfortable and centrally located hotel which is reasonably priced compared to some of the more well known chain of hotels situated on Orchard Road.

<Content>Horrible customer service As soon as I had arrived at Orchard Hotel, I felt unwelcome. We stayed at the Orchard Hotel for a total of two nights, three days. We chose this hotel because of its central location, and because it was hosting a conference we were attending in Singapore. We booked a room online with the triple B package. We were given a Superior Deluxe room with Internet access. It turned out the room had wireless broadband access, which was a plus.We drove into Singapore in a rented Malaysian car. As we drove into the front drive to drop off our luggage, we were completely ignored by the doorman. We stood and waited for five minutes until we were able to flag someone down to help us. In front was a van of European tourists, who were immediately attended to. As it was Christmas season, the check-in desk was understandably busy. However, the check-in desk was understaffed and disorganized. There was no sense of queue, and we had to fend for our place in line. Our room appeared hastily cleaned, and the floors were unvacuumed. The room was quite noisy at night. The breakfast spread was large, though once again, the service was questionable. Although we had booked for two people, the hotel made a mistake in the number of breakfasts allotted to our room (i.e. one breakfast for two people). The server was disagreeable, and didn't even think to give us the benefit of the doubt. She went to find the manager, and then halfway there, she realized she had made a mistake and quickly led us to a table beside the kitchen. Upon requesting to be seated in a quieter location, she snapped back and said that all the tables were full, though in reality, the entire cafe was probably half full. The final straw came at check-out, when I went to ask the concierge for driving directions back to Malaysia. Behind me were three young girls from Thailand, and I felt that the concierge was more interested in picking up these girls than helping me with my directions. Upon asking for the directions, the concierge then went on to say that he didn't know. And when asked if he had a map, he said that the hotel didn't have any, when in fact the previous day they had given me a map. Afterwards, I overheard the concierge attempting to pick up these girls, asking them for their name cards and phone numbers. I was disgusted. When I brought up the issue with front desk, they quickly found someone else to give directions, and indeed, they did have a map. The customer service at Orchard Hotel is spotty, and at the very best, second rate. It appeared to me that customer service was conditional on your appearance, and secondly, your country of origin. Coming from Malaysia, I felt that we were treated less favourably than if I had waved around my Canadian passport (which I didn't). I am extremely dissapointed with Orchard Hotel, and I don't think I would ever stay there again. I do not recommend this hotel if staying in Singapore. I believe one can get much better service, and much better quality of accomodation for less.

<Content>Loved the Orchard The Orchard was booked for us by a local government ministry. It was excellent. Great location, and the service was outstanding. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Orchard Hotel We stayed here on our way back to the UK our sixth time in singapore but first at the Orchard. Looks good from the pictures on the website. We opted for the upgrade to the Excutive rooms cost of $100 per night (not what reception said). Room was just a basic room on the 16th floor. Free soft drinks from mini bar and free drinks on the hotel between 6pm-8pm up in the executive club room (17th floor). Found the staff Rude and could only understand english when you were paying the final bill. Food in the orchard cafe we ordered chicken in a basket, later found out it was shipped in from a KFC outlet down the road. Would advise to book a different hotel as we do alot of bussiness in singapore and would'nt return here.

<Content>Great value This was the first stop on our round the world honeymoon and we found this hotel to be great. It is in a very good location near shops, a short walk to the train and Mac Donalds!The rooms are not huge but we had a comfortable bed, very clean bathroom and huge tv on the wall. The hotel also has a very impressive lobby and lounge which had live entertainment each night.The staff very friendly and helpful I would reccommend this hotel to anyone wanting something a little nice on their holiday.

<Content>Nothing special This hotel is OK and provides decent accomodation. The pool area has a bar but doesn't provide any snacks or meals.Reasonable access for getting around Singapore.Staff OK but not particularly helpful. We had asked for connecting rooms as we have 3 children but had problems on arrival and initially were offered rooms not even next to each other. We ended up with rooms next to each other but not connecting but it took a lot of discussion to get there.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Great Location My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a four day trip in September 2006. The staff were unfriendly when we checked in, which was a disappointment given how luxurious the lobby is. The person who helped us was new and in training, however she failed to smile or look at us while searching for our reservation. When she couldn't find the reservation, the person she called over to help her also did not smile or look at us, and they spoke only to each other (and not in English, which was a little frustrating since I kept asking what the problem was). Fortunately, this seemed to be a fluke because all other staff members were more than friendly during our stay. We were in a standard room, which was clean, beautiful, and nicely furnished (with the exception of the bed). The beds are very hard, which made for a bad night's sleep after walking around all day touring the city. The rooms are quite small, but we were hardly there so it did not make a difference. The mini bar is nicely stocked, but expensive of course. The breakfast buffet included in the room price was large with a variety of foods to choose from. We ate breakfast there every morning and usually were not hungry for lunch. We did not try any of the other restaurants in the hotel as there is a wide selection of restaurants in the area.The location of the hotel is great! It is only a short walk to a metro station, which we found to be the easiest way to get around. Taxis are cheap (and clean and safe) as well, and the hotel is well known so it was not difficult to find a taxi driver who knew their way to it. I would not recommend booking any tours at the desk in the lobby. We were disappointed when we booked a Night Safari tour only to find we'd paid a lot more just to have a bus take us there. We could have saved about 30-40 singapore dollars if we had taken a taxi or the metro. We also did a city tour which was fun for the river boat ride part of it, but the tour mostly took us to places we had already found on our own, so again it was not worth the money. Take a taxi and ask what places they recommend seeing, or buy a travel guide and take the metro around instead. Our overall experience at the hotel was pleasurable and we would stay there again.

<Content>Stay Here! We arrived in Singapore towards the end of a four month trip round the world and loved the Orchard Hotel.It had everything we needed. The rooms were stunning - very stylish and the bathrooms were top quality. You couldn't hear anything from the surrounding rooms. Tea and Coffee in the rooms as well - mini bar v expensive (we got some beers from the 7-11 just next to the hotel..)The hotel is near all the shops and the metro - a ten minute walk so not too bad. There is a lively Irish pub in the basement of the hotel and a Subway for late night snacking. The pool is massive and the gym is very nice as well although I got stared at a lot being female. We checked out at 11am but our flight wasn't until 2am the following morning. The hotel staff let us store our luggage and we had a day out and then had a swim before leaving about 10pm.

<Content>Clean, Comfortable, w/ wonderful Exec Lounge We really enjoyed our stay in Singapore and this hotel was a pleasure. Yes the rooms are on the small side, but ours was attractively furnished and decorated with an Asian theme, very clean and comfortable, and most importantly -- quiet! We were in the Executive Suites though, so I can't describe the regular rooms.One of the best parts is the Executive Lounge on the top floor. It is well-staffed and the friendly attendants are helpful without being obtrusive. There is a selection of newspapers for the taking. The buffet is glorious, with all kinds of wonderful pastries, fruits, meats and smoked salmon, yogurt, cereal and even a short-order cook standing by to make your eggs however you like. One can also partake of Asian dishes here too. We ate far too much for breakfast, and in the afternoon a snack buffet is set out, and in the evening, more hors d'oueveres and snacks. The hotel itself is full of fun shops and restaurants. There is even a tailor, and one should get some custom-made clothes when visiting Singapore. There is also a pool and fitness center but we did not have a chance to visit as we were too busy sightseeing. There was also a tour coordinator located in the lobby who booked us on a sightseeing expedition to the nocturnal zoo -- transportation included and made everything so easy.My one complaint is that an open lounge area is located in the hotel lobby, with smoking permitted, so the entire lobby and adjoining cafe smells of cigarette smoke which is a real bugaboo with me; consequently we didn't spend any time there at all.

<Content>Value for money Once you get through the airport loungesque check in [i.e. chaotic], the hotel is of a good standard. Rooms are modern, bathrooms are marble and no signs of disrepair. Room service is good. No wifi but ethernet internet connections. Location is good for shopping, but if you want to head to Raffles and Chinatown - its a bit of a trek by foot. For those who use the gym - its impressive in comparison to other hotel gyms. Overall - its good value for money. I travel for a living and stay in 4-5* hotels around the globe and this is above average.

<Content>Definitely stay again We stayed for one week and enjoyed everything the hotel had to offer.Only snag was they didn't have our reservation and weren't too interested in helping but booked us in anyway and i was able to contact travel agent and everything was sorted by the time we checked out.The buffet breakfast , included in the price was a feast never to be missed. Dined once at the restaurant on the second floor and that was amazing.The service was was excellent.The pool was a welcome relief from the heat and humidity after visiting sites around the island,and the gym was excellent.Overall had a fantastic holiday in Singapore helped along by staying in quality accomodation.

<Content>It's OK... The rooms are nice and modern (Orchard Wing) but very small and may not suit everyone鈥檚 tastes but they are clean. The hotel seems busy all the time 鈥?the lobby is too busy for my taste as is the reception. It was very noisy when we stayed there - they were renovating (this was not mentioned on their website at the time). We were out of our rooms most of the time otherwise it would have been unbearable. They even changed the hallway carpets one morning and I was shocked when I opened the door to discover the cloud of dust that surrounded it. They really should not do this with guests around! Other than that the buffet is OK, staff is not that friendly. The location is good (in Orchard Road) and the price is alright as well. I have stayed in many hotels in Singapore from budget to 5-star and the Orchard Hotel just rates average for me. It was just OK! I think this is an ideal hotel for a business traveller but not so suited for families.

<Content>Very Unpleasant It was a noisy hotel. The soundproofing was so bad that you can hear everything outside the corridor considering my hearing wasn't good. Woke up early on Sunday morning due to renovation knocking noise. Also, I find the rate expensive as it did not include any internet access. Will definitely not stay again.

<Content>Surely We Cant Afford This??? What can I say....We booked trought an australian Travel Agent as we were visiting on the way back from Sydney for two days.When the Taxi arrived, My partner and I looked at each other and said, there must be some mistake, we cannot afford to stay here... There must be two Orchard Hotels in Singapore. Turns out not.Gold everywhere, really nice Doormen, very nice entrace and lobby.It was fabulous, rooms where really up to date and hotel was placed nicely for shopping. We paid about 拢50 which would get a single bed in a dump in London!We would stay here again diffinately.

<Content>Well located for shopping. Check-in and out time are not confortable I was at the Orchard Hotel for 5 nights in February 2006 for a meeting in the same hotel. Overall is a good location for shopping, the rooms are comfortable but not luxurious. The people are very welcoming, and the breakfast (included) has everything as a brunch.The cons are that the windows do not open and the sound isolations between rooms are very bad: I can here all the next door noises. The meeting rooms are very nice, everything works fine, and the health breaks have fruits and all other choices of the regular coffee-breaks.The personnel of the Hotel are nice, but you may wait until 3 to have a room (after 24 hours flying and arriving at 7:40 am it is very bad). There is no chance for more than 1 hour late check-out but paying half of the regular room to stay until 6 pm, after that full payment is required (as flights are at mid-night it is also too bad).

<Content>Would stay there again We stayed at Orchard Hotel during Chinese New Year. It was great. Because of the holiday, the hotel was only at 60% occupancy so we received a free room upgrade. The room had modern furniture. The bathroom looked newly remodeled. The carpet needed to be cleaned, but overall the room seemed clean.The hotel is at the start of all the Orchard Road shops. Very near to many western restaurants, which we enjoyed because we are Americans living in Asia. Taxis are easy to get, but we did a lot of walking. Breakfast was good - Asian and western. So much food that you could skip lunch!The internet connection was slow. They could improve that greatly. It was easy to buy minutes, but you had to use them all in one session.Overall - good hotel. Would stay there again.

<Content>lovely hotel i stayed at the orchard at the beginning of january as a stopover on my way through asia and was thorouhgly impressed. it may well have been on the wrong end of orchard road but the transport through singapore was so good it really wasn't a problem. my room was lovely and the staff were so helpful - the hotel was apparently having some work done but with such discretion that i never noticed. the food too was great- especially breakfast.also, i found, quite to my suprise tahat it was just as cheap to make an international phonecall from my room as from a phonebooth- something of a first!i'd happily go back and stay.

<Content>Expensive and slow in-room internet I only ever book hotels with in-room internet because it is a necessity for me when I travel.This hotel has wifi in certain areas and wired ports in all the rooms. The hotel has two internet price packages: by the minute or day-rate. The minute rate is $.50 (Singapore Dollars) and the day is $28 (Sing dollars). Not cheap but in-line with the other hotels in Singapore. My biggest disappointment was with the speed- the login page listed it as 256kb/s up/down but in usage it was much slower and felt like dial-up.Be warned if you like your internet fast and hot, this ain't the place to stay.

<Content>Excellent hotel! Just returned from the Orchard hotel and was very impressed! After reading mixed reviews about the hotel before our trip we were rather unsure what to expect. We were very pleasantly surprised the staff were very friendly in fact they could not do enough for you especially one of the porter's Louis. We booked a deluxe room in the Orchard wing and were not disappointed, the room was medium to large in size, clean and modern and had a large bed and modern bathroom. We were on bed and breakfast and there was a lot of choice and all was very nice. The foyer area to the hotel was very impressive as was all of the hotel, we really enjoyed our stay at The Orchard and really enjoyed Singapore! Great hotel don't be put off my other people's negative reviews!
