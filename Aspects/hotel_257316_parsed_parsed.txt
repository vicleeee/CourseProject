<Content>Great hotel ! We spend a split stay of 5 days of our trip Downunder here and booked this BB through their website.This BB takes you back to the victorian era, but with the nowadays comfort ! The staff is superfriendly (we could leave part of our luggage here without any charges when we left for the red center) and is more than willing to help in any way they can. As we stayed 5 nights, we got a free upgrade to a bouquet room, which was very nice. The room was on the top floor (please note that there is no elevator, so people who have difficulty using stairs should ask for a room on the ground level) and although not extremely spacious, was very cosy and clean. The bathroom was small (with only shower), but as you don't tend to spend much time in your hotelroom in Sydney, this was perfect!The continental breakfast is not very elaborate, but you can eat as much as you want and it is well taken care of. The breakfast patio is an oasis of peace in the city.From the BB is a 30 minutes walk through the harbour to the Syndey Opera House and the famous Harbour Bridge. The King's Cross City Rail station is at 5 minutes from the hotel and each half hour there is a shuttle bus to the Airport (domestic and international ,price per person 12 AUD).In the neighborhood of the hotel are a lot of places to eat, from cheap take away to very upmarket trendy restaurants.If we would go back to Sydney, we would certainly want to stay here again.

<Content>Well run and good value for money We stayed 4 nights at the Victoria Court on our way to New Zealand and found it to be excellent. It was exactly what we were looking for. Great location for exploring Sydney éˆ¥?very convenient to buses and subway; however, we were walking most of the time because everything is very close. There is a beautiful walk from the hotel through the Botanic Garden to the Opera House. The Botanical garden is amazing and there is even a colony of bats, which is a big attraction. We had a lovely room overlooking the courtyard, which was very quiet and pleasant, an oasis of peace in such a busy city. A free breakfast was offered, which we appreciated and prepared us for the day. The courtyard has a fountain and singing birds, which reminded us of a Spanish patio. The staff were incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. The restaurant across the road is worth a visit; not cheap but excellent food and magnificent views over the city skyline. Generally, there was an abundance of good restaurants and smaller eateries in the area where the real Sydney people eat, not tourists. We overstretched our budget a bit with shopping so we took the shuttle bus from the hotel to the airport instead of a taxi. We had a great and very memorable stay and will definitely recommend it to our friends.

<Content>My take on why this hotel gets mixed reviews Victoria Court Hotel is unique--reminiscent of New Orleans. It is an older building and should be judged in that light. The hotel has a character that you won't find at newer, chain hotels and for the most part is thoughtfully decorated and furnished. That said, the bed in our room was worn, the bathroom a little tight and the electric lighting a bit poor. On the plus side, our room (labelled superior), located on the second floor, was quite roomy with tall windows providing a view of downtown Sydney. The two different men who ran the hotel (I forget their names) were friendly, helpful and professional.I've read other comments about the brunch -- it is not awful as one person described it. It is simply your standard continental breakfast including cereals, breads, coffee, and tea, plus a bowl of prunes and peaches. Nothing special, but sufficient. (If you're at the hotel for more than a few days, I imagine the breakfast would get tedious.) The breakfast area is lovely, with a sitting room off to one side and a stand of palm trees off to another, where the ceiling is open to the elements--hence, the space is chilly in the winter months (at least it was when we were there -- perhaps they normally heat it?). The hotel is in a youthful neighborhood with a lot of hip restaurants mixed in with backpacking hotels. We were there in the winter, so the leafless trees were a bit dreary -- I imagine that in the summer time, this area is truly lovely. It's not quite as close to the Sydney center as I was lead to believe, but there's a terrific walk from the hotel that leads through the gorgeous Royal Botanical Gardens up to the Opera House -- perhaps a 30-minute walk in total (if you don't stop and stare at the wildlife in the park, like the fruitbats!). Victoria Court, in its heydey, was probably a grand place to stay but has grown a tad antiquated. With a little renovaton, it could be a true gem.

<Content>Disappointing...would not recommend Stayed for 3 nights. Location a bit out of the way but public transport was good. Our room was a bit shabby, stained walls etc, TINY bathroom - not enough room to dry off after shower - and could have been cleaner. Breakfast was awful, very cheap quality and after the first morning we had to go out for breakfast. Plus points - manager was very friendly and helpful, the dining area was nice, but this should apply to all rooms too. Looking at other reviews it seems that some rooms are better than others - surely staying here should not be a lottery?

<Content>Little oasis in a big city Great location with lots of good restarants in the neighbourhood. Very quiet in an old victorian building. Very friendly and helpful staff; nothing is too much. Breakfast is in teh conservatory; very charming. Have been there two times so far and had a good time on both occasions. The italian restaurant accross the street is a real treat. Good food and most beautiful views over the entire skyline.

<Content>Would have loved to stay longer We booked this hotel over the internet at the last minute and had a great stay. Nice room with comfortable bed - nice people. Rudy the manager was particularly helpful with booking tours and giving information. Nothing was too much for him. We enjoyed having breakfast in the courtyard with the fountain. Great location for sightseeing and good restaurants in the area, yet quiet to get good sleep. Highly recommended. We wish that we could have stayed longer; but we will be back. Thank you.Penny RistCoral Gables, Florida

<Content>Would not go again I was not very keen on this place and had some reservations before we arrived following the mixed reviews on Trip Advisor. We arrived very early after a long flight and slept most of the day. We tended to sleep in so missed the room cleaning, although on the days they did clean the room and bathrooms seemed the same. The bathroom was so tiny only one person could stand up in it. It was pretty old and during our week stay the taps broke, the towel rail fell off the wall and the towels all but fell apart they were so threadbare. Also out sheets had stains on and tears in and did not seem to be changed during our stay.It was fine but I woudl not recommend it or stay again. It was a good location in a slightly shabby buit charming area. Simpsons round the corner in Challis Avenue may be worth a look as it looks lovely but is quite a bit more pricey if you are staying for more than a few days. There is also a lovely italian restaurant in the same road.The hotel felt quite hostel like and if you want to sleep in, no chance as its pretty noisy. On leaving I reasied we l had been charged for phone calls we did not make whcih was a hassle (they had been made before we even arrived!!) as they do not sem to ahve any electronic billing so I had to fax the bill to them from the UK as they did not seem to ahve any e-mail copies of their billing.It needs some serious updating.

<Content>The Victoria Court Hotel - a charming B I was looking for a nice hotel near the central downtown area of Sydney, but one that wasn't nearly as expensive as most of the well-known hotels. I checked the Sydney travel websites for BBs and found the Vicoria Court. I checked the travellers comments on it and saw that, although there were only a few reviews, they were largely very complimentary. The hotel staff were very accommodating, helpful and friendly. For instance, the room I was interested in was not available when I wanted to make the reservation (two days after first inquiry) so they gave me a free upgrade to the boutique room. The room was quaint and lovely, and I was quite happy with it. It wasn't huge but I expected that because it is a pair of Victorian houses that have been converted into the hotel. Some reviewers complained about the room sizes but if anyone is looking for a large Holiday Inn type room, then I would suggest they go to a Holiday Inn.I arrived at the hotel early - at about 9:30-10:00am - and the previous occupants had already checked out and the room was prepared so the staff let me get into it right away. How nice. It was so nice to be able to freshen up after the long trip, change and get out there touring right away, and so early in the morning. The little court where breakfast is served is charming. The breakfast consisted of cereals, toast, croissants, prunes, peach halves, toast, tea, juices, and coffee. It was fine - not elaborate but quite satisfactory - and continually monitored and restocked by the attentive staff. I was certainly satisfied with the quality and selection but if the VC wanted to improve in any area, they might consider varying the breakfast choices a bit from day-to-day. For people staying a few days or more, a bit of variation from day to day is a nice touch. The location of the VC is great, easily within walking distance of the main downtown tourist sites, and quite close to the grocery store (Woolworths) and some nice bakeries. I took the Syndey Explorer and Bondi Explorer and the bus stops are very close, on Macleay street. All in all, I was very, very pleased with my three-night stay at the VC and would highly recommend it to anyone.

<Content>Victoria Court, a bit of the French Quarter in Sydney When I first saw the pictures of the Inn and it's rooms on their website, I immediately thought of New Orleans' French Quarter. It was so romantic looking. Our room was beautiful, with a canopy bed, fireplace and French doors opening onto a terrace overlooking a tree lined street. Perfect way to start our holiday!It was well located within walking distance of everything, yet set away from all the noice of the main streets. All sorts of publlic transportation was just a block or so away. The staff was very pleasant and very gracious in helping us with anything we needed. I would definitely recommend it.Jonini

<Content>Great website...poor place!!! We decided to spend our honey moon in Australia and organize all by ourselves as we do not like impersonal places. and we love to discover tiny, little BB that would help us to get in contact with the place we are visiting..searching on internet we were impressed by the images of the website and we hurried up to book a room, we phoned direclty to the owner and pointed out that it was our Honey moon asking to have a good room....the expectations were high...The room assigned was at the first floor, but it was not bright...and it was really far from the one displayed on the website...it was damp and the bathroom just reminded me of the one we found in a barren moor in the andesite a couple of years before. The breakfast was poor and essential...Considering that it took almost 30 hours to get from Italy to Sydney we did not have the strenght to complain, but the first impact was really bad!! Luckily it was in a strategic position (the one and only positive aspect)!!! i would not reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a nice place...at least at the price they sell the rooms!!!!

<Content>Very disappointing We contacted Victoria Court Hotel directly to book a room. Well aware of the experience of some of the travellers posted on this website, we requested the hotel management to give us a room in the upper floor. So when we arrived we were quite surprised when we were given a room on the ground floor without informing us. The room was unbelievable. The window in the room faced the wheels of a car standing in a garage and it was so dark that it was difficult to make out whether it was day or night. Because of the darkness, we even got depressive. Further, the room was smelly as the windows could not be opened. We pointed out to the hotel management that we had asked for an upper floor room at time of reservation. The management told us that in fact they had reserved a room upstairs for us but one day before our arrival they had given it to other guests who paid more than us. We do not think that this is the way to treat people. If we had known before that all economy rooms face a garage we would not have booked it.As a consequence, we looked for another accommodation in the neighbourhood and found a nice place to stay with light and airy rooms and a view on the skyline of Sydney which was less expensive than Victoria Court Hotel. It should however be noted that the rooms are beautifully furnished and that the breakfast room in the court is lovely. However, due to our experience we would not stay at Victoria Court Hotel again.

<Content>Lovely! When my husband and I were planning our trip to Sydney, we were looking for an accomodation that's affordable, accessible, quiet, and without the hotel feel. Our search led us to Victoria Court Hotel, a bed and breakfast/boutique hotel.Their rate of less than USD100 per night (for a boutique room) was affordable and fit our budget just nicely. It's about a 1minute walk to King's Cross Station and about 5minutes walk to the nearest bus station. Despite being on a street parallel to the red light district, Victoria Street is decent, quiet, and lined with trees on both sides. There are many restaurants that offer affordable, delicious, hot meals in the area. Convenience stores and money changers are nearby.Everything in the hotel - from the facade, to the interior...from the room, to the courtyard conservatory - is just lovely. The bed is big, soft and comfortable. There is free, wireless internet connection inside the room. A breakfast of coffee, tea, juice, cereals, toast, butter, jams, peaches/prunes is included in the package. The owners are friendly and helpful. This rubs off on the other guests so the atmosphere was also warm and friendly.If I ever get the chance to go back to Sydney, I'd definitely stay at Victoria Court Hotel again.

<Content>Great Small Hotel After reading some of the uninspiring comments below we were a bit hesitant to book this place, but we are happy we did. This is a great little hotel. We had a fabulous room and the beds were very comfortable. The hotel is located very close to the centre of Sydney and we didn't need to use public transport as we walked everywhere. Highly recommended.

<Content>Disappointed....cockroaches We stayed here for 6 nights in Feb 2007. Our Economy Double room was the size of a shoebox. The breakfast was average and I found two cockroaches in our room. On the plus side the location was very good...although very close to the main red light area. The area was safe though. Walkable to Sydney city centre and a 1 min walk to Kingscross subway. The hotel was expensive for what we got. There are some 4* Hostels right in the city centre now which offer excellent accomodation for very reasonable prices. Will go there next time.

<Content>Not impressed Chose this hotel after being recommended somewhere else.My first mistake.Had a premium room and wonder where the premium came into it..The room was very tired and in need of renovation.The area was as I expected and we enjoyed our time in the city.The Potts Point area,to the west of the hotel ,was good for strolling and there were a lot of good eating places.

<Content>Great location - disappointing hotel The hotel did appear to be very promising from previous reviews, though unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. The building does look very appealing from the outside. However, the real problem was the damp, musty smell that was everywhere in the hotel. If you do decide to stay here, beware of the ground floor rooms at the back - truly the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in - a terrible smell that really gets into your clothes, and small windows that back onto a garage (noisy) with no view at all. It really did feel like a cell.The area though is amazing, you would never know that you were bordering Kings Cross. A short stroll to the underground rail station, so the whole of Sydney is really accessible. There are numerous places to eat/drink on Victoria St. Well worth a visit is Jimmy Liks - South East Asian fusion and amazing coicktails.The hotel has got potemtial but it desperately needs renovation. In summary it is tired and completely lacking in charm and certainly not worth the money. A better deal would be the Holiday Inn which is just 50m up the road or there are a few other boutique style hotels in the area, for example, Simpsons.Enter at your peril !!!

<Content>Very nice Not a lot to complain about really - inexpensive, superb location very close to station, air-conditioned rooms, lovely building and al fresco breakfast included in price! Only two minor gripes - we got quite a small room and the prices quoted on their website exclude Goods and Services Tax, a 10% tax that everyone has to pay. Although it's possible for non-Australians to get GST refunded on goods above $300, that doesn't apply to services. You've got a great hotel guys, worth $165 per night of anyone's money, so why not be honest about your prices?

<Content>Sting in the tail! On Honeymoon and decided to try a boutique hotel in the Kings Cross area. Location is good (although very close to the back-packers district if that's an issue) and the welcome was friendly. Our room at the front (#13) was a good size and tidy with a really nice balcony but the bathroom was very small.The problems started at checkout. We had made a mistake on our day of checkout and thought we had booked for an extra night which we had not. The manager informed us of this and said that we could move to another room or checkout (still no problems). The other room was not as nice but since it involved less stress than a change of hotel i decided to stay. When my wife saw the new room she said that she'd prefer to move to another hotel and we decided to splurge on our last night to somewhere with a view of the harbour. When i informed the manager of our change of plan i was profusely apologetic as i realised that not only had we missed the normal checkout time (a very early 10 am) but had changed our mind so quickly on our decision to stay.At this point he became very rude and suggested that he had 'guessed' that we would do this and that we were doing this purely to muck them around. Again i apologised but it felt like he was determined to make me feel as uncomfortable as possible (which i did). Eventually he calmed down and i settled the bill but i felt this was highly un-professional behaviour from a business that should pride itself on customer care.It annoyed me that the friendly manner that had greeted us was very quick to change and whilst i completely understand the frustration of what happened, it should never have got as uncomfortable as it did.Sorry but this hotel does not get a return visit from me!

<Content>Nice hotel but overpriced We stayed at this hotel for a few nights in Nov. The owners are very pleasant and it is in a good location (a nice stroll away from Sydney Opera House), but I think it is a bit overpriced. You get a plain breakfast and the rooms aren't very big. It does however have a very warm and pleasant atmosphere.

<Content>Very Special We were recommended by friends to stay at the Victoria Court and booked a deluxe room because we wanted something special. What a delightful place! We had a great time there and the location is good; near to all sightseeing and there are good restaurants in the area. If we travel to Sydney again, we will definitely be staying there again.

<Content>Quaint Wonderful Place We don't like large impersonal hotels and were looking for a quaint little place on the internet and found Victoria Court. It was exactly what we expected and had a wonderful time there. Not knowing Sydney we got great advice from the owners about where to go and what to do. Nothing was too much and everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Definitely a place to recommend.

<Content>Victoria Court - Good place to stay The Victoria Court is in a nice old building with a lot of character. It's in Kings Cross and very handy to the subway station. The street is mostly backpacker's places, but has several really excellent cafes and is a short walk to the Botanical Gardens and the Opera House. We stayed in 2 different rooms (both ensuite) and they were fine, although the one upstairs was considerably larger (both were the Boutique level rooms). The free breakfast is adequate as a starter. They offer toast, coffee and tea, cereal and some croissants along with prunes and canned peaches. The tea service in the rooms is outstanding - a real electric teapot and real milk. Chis at the front desk was helpful with a great sense of humor. We would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Great Location, Good Value! We just stayed at the Victoria Court and had a fantastic time. The place has a lot of charm and character and the owners couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. We had a lovely quiet room and enjoyed our stay thoroughly. The location is very good, near to everything, yet quiet and there are many good restaurants in the vicinity. One of them is just opposite, called Mezzaluna and we had the most amazing dinner there. After entering, we were overwhelmed by the gorgeous views, the whole city skyline and the food was sublime and the service attentive. A very enjoyable stay and recommendable to all.

<Content>One of the best B First thing to remember is that this is really an upmarket BB - it's not trying to be a five star hotel. Having said that, the staff I met tried extremely hard to make things easy. The rooms are nice, with huge mirrors. It does feel like staying in someone's home - the lounge is a great place to just sit on the sofa and read through the paper / magazines. In essence, it's really a very good BB

<Content>Windowless, Damp and Musty Rooms We stayed in Sydney in balmy April and had booked two single boutique rooms at the Victoria Court Hotel. Boutique rooms are the least expensive category, so we didn't expect four posters or marble fireplaces. Nevertheless, for a pricetag of AUS $120 plus tax we believed a romantic stay in a nice setting could be expected. The hotel itself and especially the breakfast room are truly lovely but we were in for a bad surprise. Our rooms at the back of the house were very damp and had a terribly musty smell. They had small windows facing into a garage (!) and the little air that got in (apart from the exhaust fumes) never really made any difference. The linens and the bedspread remained damp throughout our stay in spite of an outside temperature of more than 20æŽ³C. When I got home, I had to wash everything because all my clothes smelled as if they had spent their holiday in a cellar.The breakfast buffet is not spectacular either. It consists of toast and dry cereal. Once the waitress brought a basket containing 3 croissants....I guess, the hotel is ok if you go for the more expensive rooms. We felt cheated, however.

<Content>You get what you pay for..... After reading the reviews we were expecting a little bit better than we got.First of all the area it is very close to Kings Cross and there are alot of backpackers properties on the same road - plus side is there is a wide variety of cheap eating places if on a budget - minus side we didnt always feel safe walking home in the evening. The hotel itself looks great from the outside but the rooms are looking quite dated - the curtains and bedspead in our room were the same as I had at home in the late 80's - I suppose we should have realised as no pictures on their web site only pencil drawings. Also on the rooms they have different standards of rooms but it is very unclear what extra facilites you get for the upgrades, I would advise you check exactly what you are getting....we were told our room as slightly larger and had a view....well there wasnt much room around the bed and we were on the main street which was a little bit noisy. Breakfast is ok a choise of cerial and bread there isnt enough tables in courtyard for all the rooms though so at times you may wait.ADVISE - if you are on a budget and want a hotel rahter than a hostel it will be fine, if you go expecting a beautiful hotel in a nice area you will be disapointed......but you are in one of the most expensive cities in the world for accommodation so I suppose you do get what you pay for

<Content>Pleasant stay Room is considerably small (esp when we added a bed for the third person) but adequate. Situated on a leafy street 20 minutes stroll from centre, 300 meters away from Kings Cross railway station. Nice hostess, pleasant room and courtyard. If you have 2 people or more and have not purchased any travel pass, I would suggest you take a taxi to central instead of waiting at the Cityrail. It was a frustrating 20 minutes wait to get to Town Hall or Central by Cityrail, where you can change for Circular Quay. We took a taxi to the Opera Hse and the fare was under A$9. And you save a lot of time.

<Content>Good Location, A Little Noisy This BB is located on a charming, architecturally significant street within walking distance of Cityrail and a number of hip eateries. Breakfast consists of cereal and toast for the most part, although we had croissants one morning. If you're a light sleeper, ask for a room in the back, away from Victoria Street--pedestrians and garbage collection just outside our window woke us up.

<Content>We will be back! We have stayed at the Victoria Court already two times so far. Great location, close to the harbour and Opera House and a lot of good restaurants in the area, yet it is very quiet. Very nice and lovely interior, feels cozy and warm. The owners are very helpful and genuine people. We'll definitely go back again

<Content>Bad experience at the Victoria Court Hotel The Victoria Court Hotel is in a lovely traditional Sydney house, in a lively area of the city. However, what should have been a pleasant stay was marred by an abusive outburst from the manager on one night of our stay when we (politely) called reception to notify them that the air conditioning in our room was not working. His first comment was 'did we say the room rate included air-con?' I found this attitude suprising  unprofessional, and his manner very aggressive. He then became even more abusive, and stormed off. While he apologised the next morning for his outburst I was shocked  upset. It ruined our stay at the hotel  I would not recommend it as a place to stay, despite it being an otherwise lovely hotel.

<Content>Victoria Court I stayed at the Victoria Court in March 2002 on the recommendation of my travel agent. I do not like large, impersonal chain hotels and my agent felt this smaller, more intimate boutique hotel might fit the bill. He was right!The staff (i.e. the owners) are incredibly friendly and without making any fuss about it, they kindly upgraded my room category, simply it appears because one was available. The buffet breakfast is an excellent and cost effective start to the day ane the lounge with free newspapers is good to relax - not that you want to do much of that in Sydney.The walk from the hotel to the centre takes perhaps a leisurely 20 minutes, but it is a pleasant walk, much through the beautful Botanical Gardens. The hotel is situated in a conservation area, and for the traveller, there is an excellent laundry a few doors down. All in all, this is a reasonably priced, cosy, friendly and atractive hotel (more of a BB really) in a great city.
