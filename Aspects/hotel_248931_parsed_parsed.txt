<Content>Nice Hotel on the Water This hotel is in a great location...set away from a lot of the tourist crowds in florence and right near the river. It is easy to get to retaurants across the river and tourist sites like the uffizi from the hotel. The room was clean, pretty cold in temperature (the staff warned us about this), and the bed was comfortable and large. The bathroom was clean with great oversized towels. Breakfast was boring with some toast, meats, and yogurt. Would stay here again in a heart beat.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel Good Points* Friendly staff* Beautiful room overlooking the river which had been newly renovated. The wood carving in the ceiling was gorgeous. Ask for the room at the front with the balcony...it is amazing* Free parking at night* Bar and lounge area in the lobby with small library* Fantastic breakfast* Close to the sights (10min walk)* Clean* Safe in room* Great value for money, this is not a 2 star as quoted by trip advisor. Much more like a good quality 3 star.* Nice area* Quiet* Laundrymat a few streets awayBad Points* It is not right in the heart of the city of Florence, but the walk isn't far at all.

<Content>Does not live up to the brochure blurb This hotel is pretty poor when it comes to service, we arrived late saturday and because we where in a group it took nearly 30 mins to book us all in , my wife and myself where at the back of the que and had to stand in the street because of insufficient in reception, no tea or coffee makink facilities in room asked for room service as in their current brochure was told too busy you will have to come down and collect it yourself , staff have bad attitude when it comes to service , breakfast was very poor fruit juices had been watered down coffe was like sump oil and the poor selection of cheese and cold meet left a lot to be desired , the waitresses could not be bothered to clean tables so we had to remove crocks ourselves.We only found one pleasant and very helpful man on the desk the others where lazy and unhelpfull.we could not wait for our stay to come to an end , i would not reccomend this so called hotel to anybody.

<Content>SERVICE WAS ATROCIOUS As several travelers have already mentioned, we were extremely unpleased with the staff with the exception of one man, Gabriel Vaccaro. Particularly, there were two older men on the evening/night staff that were just downright rude. Our father is diabetic and needs to store his insulin in a cool place. The rooms don't have refrigerators, which is fine, so we asked if we could use their kitchen refrigerator. Well you would've thought we were asking for all the gold in Fort Knox. Those two men were very lazy and didn't like to leave their chairs or talk to anyone, grunting at us whenever we'd ask for help. In fact, we went out late one night and came back to find one of them asleep at the desk. When we woke him to ask for the insulin, he was clearly irritated that we dared to wake him up. Our train was leaving early the morning we checked out and let the night guy know the night before to call a taxi and have it ready for us. No surprise, he hadn't done it so we nearly missed our train. Not only did he forget to do this one small thing, he was completely rude about finally getting to it.I would NOT recommend anyone stay here unless you don't plan to ever interact with the staff, which is impossible because you still have to check in and out, requiring some level of interaction. Breakfast was below average. The only two good things about Hotel River is the rooms were nice and the view of the river was gorgeous (hence they got 2 stars instead of just 1). There's a rooftop overlooking the river that is open to all guests, however, there are guest rooms beside them so you have to be courteous of when you go and how loud you plan to be.If your trip at all involves a stay in Rome, I highly recommend staying at Les Chambres D'Or Hotel. Delicious breakfast, best cappucino in Rome, wonderful location less than 10 minutes from the Vatican, and most importantly of all, their staff was impeccable. Hotel River needs to take a few lessons from them and I hope their management reads these reviews and does something about the staff.

<Content>Nice Place, bad service The location of Hotel River was perfect, in walking distance to everything but out of the way to relax. The room was nice and we had a view of the river. The only issue was the concierge. I can't remember his name, but he was the most unhelpful man I ever met. We asked him to make reservations at a reccomended restaurant. He replied you don't want to go there it's touristy. We asked him than to reccomend another restuarant. He said to give him a half hour. We cam back down only for him to inform us that they were all closed. He didn't reccomend any others and it was too late to go to our original choice. Another issue that I had with him was we booked the florence in a Day tour. He only took cash and when we went to the tour they said our concierge booked us for the lesser priced tour, yet we paid him full price. Thankfully the tour people trusted us and let us do the whole tour, in which we paid for. Upon checkout he gave me a bill, which I was sure I pre-paid through expedia. When I told him this he became extrmely defensive. I went to go on line so I could figure out the problem and he literally was harassing me to pay him and wait till I got back to the states to work out any issues with expedia. he literally came into the internet booth with me. Very wierd. All in all Hotel River is fine as long as you do not deal too much with reception

<Content>Fabulous service, great location We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel River. The cheerful, personal touch and helpfulness of the staff (particularly Salvatore the concierge who gave great tips re restaurants) made our stay an absolute pleasure. The view of the river Arno from our terrace was beautiful and the location was just right - a short walk from the centre but far enough away from the attractions so as to be quiet.The room was quite small but comfortable and clean and had a nice bathroom and a great shower.There was free internet access in the hotel lobby.We would highly recommend the Hotel River and would definitely stay there again next time we visit Florence.

<Content>Clean decorated room, out of the way location, lazy staff We booked this hotel through Venere.com for 100EUR per night, double room. The first surprise was attempting to take the bus system from the train station on a Sunday -- we got stranded and thankfully a very friendly gentleman from the Grand Hotel called a taxi for us to get us to the Hotel River! The Hotel River looked very nice inside, though our room was VERY small (barely any room around the bed). Not like the pictures I've seen on this site; I assume we just got unlucky. Between that and the fact that we needed to get to the train station several times during the week, we decided to inform them that we will need to leave the hotel after a day and get closer to the center of town.  The staff reminded me of a concierge you might see in a Home Alone movie. The night person told me to talk to the manager in the morning. The manager told me I'd have to pay a 100EUR cancellation fee. I talked him into making a compromise, that I stay 2 nights and pay no cancellation fee. He really seemed to want me to stay the entire week. The next morning when I was checking out though, I heard everyone around me being charged only 60 EUR a night! This did not make me very happy.  When I asked the staff for dinner recommendations the night before, they happily offered a non-touristy place and promised to make reservations. They never notified us, though, that the restaurant was closed for holiday! (We learned this the hard way).The only other favor we asked them was to tell us the number to make reservations at the Accademia, to which we were lied to and told it could not be done over the phone. The location, while inconvenient to us, was very nice -- right by the river and away from the hustle and bustle. The service just left a bad taste in my mouth -- we were happy to move to the Albergo Firenze, right by the Duomo, for only 78 EUR a night (off-season price), beautiful large room with a nice view.

<Content>Beware!!! The Hotel was average in terms of bed comfort, cleanliness, and amenities but well below average in terms of staff. The staff valet parked my Mini Cooper S and put 15 anonymous kilometers on it. We also reserved a wine tour, which is run by one of the receptionists, for 4 people at 300 euro for the day. We were told that it would include a light lunch, wine tasting and a guide. Unfortunately we only received a driver who had very limited knowledge of the region and wine making process and we had to pay an additional 20 euro per person for the wine tasting/lunch. Bottom-line, we paid 300 euro for a drive to take us to Sienna and back. In every case the staff was defensive and argumentative. BEWARE!!!!

<Content>Nice and quiet Incredible little hotel away from the noise of Florence, but walking distance of only 10 minutes to city center. Great sized rooms and beautifully decorated. Very clean with decently sized bathrooms for Europe. Beds were very hard. Breakfast served beautifully and elegantly with many choices, based on basic Italian breakfast of pastries, cold cuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs (with cute little cups and spoons), fruit and real coffee! Very small staff works hard to meet every need. Great place to have a drink before dinner in the lobby or on the rooftop balcony with view of the Arno.

<Content>A perfect, little gem! We were thrilled with our stay at the Hotel River! It's a charming hotel located right across from the Arno River. What I loved about it was the location. It wasn't right in the center of the city where all the tourists are. It was quiet and had a nice ambiance. Although, it was still in walking distance to most things. We did take a cab to the train station though. It's in walking distance to the Santa Croce and Ponte Vecchio and other major sites like the Doumo.The rooms were spacious enough and had a nice bathroom. Great shower and good towels (which is important). Beds were comfortable too. The room had a small flat screen TV. It was a very nice stay - not a super fancy place, but perfect for a city where you won't be really around your hotel much. They offer a nice continental breakfast and free internet access in the lobby. The hotel only has three or four stories, so I liked that it was small. There's a nice terrace too upstairs. The hotel has a home away from home feel to it. The best part of our stay were two of the concierages. Abbas and Salvatore! They were extremely helpful, kind and knowledgeable. They didn't steer us wrong especially in the restaurant department. I felt like we didn't go to typical tourist type eateries. They recommended two restaurants we loved - Ristorante di fagioli and Il Barrino. They were wonderful. Ask for Rita at Il Barrino and she'll hook you up with an amazing tasting of all different stuff. Get the Florentine steak and ask for the pasta with truffle oil (which wasn't on the menu, but she gave it to us anyway). Abbas and Salvatore did add to our experience with their hospitality and friendliness. Abbas in particular was very helpful and so wonderful! He also has a car service and took us on a day tour in Chianti. He knew so many charming little towns in Tuscany to visit and took us to a great winery for wine tasting including a homemade lasagna lunch. He truly made our trip extra special since we saw so many things we would've never had a chance to if we just went by a guide book. I would definitely recommend the Hotel River!

<Content>Hotel River Experience We recently stayed 3 nights at the Hotel River in Florence. The accomodations were good and the staff were very helpful and accomodating. The room was small but very neat and clean. The shower was incredibly small but it had hot water and worked well. I liked the fact that the location was away from the center of the town. The streets were quite in front of our hotel. Overall, it was a great place to stay a few nights. We would stay there again.

<Content>Nice and quiet but far from everything This is a nice hotel compared to anything we stayed at in Italy. However the price was 180 a night. It is directly on the Arno about a 10+min walk from the Uffizi. The staff was really nice and very helpful and the breakfast was by far better than any other place we stayed. The room we stayed on the 2nd floor not a river view smelled like sewer which we had heard but it was pretty bad most days and you couldnt leave the windows open because of the bugs. It was also a very far walk from all the sites and from restaurants. Many times we took taxis because we were so tired at the end of the day. Its a 13 euro cab ride to train station, take it, its worth it. Also its near the major autostrade so if you have a car or rent one it would be a good location. We stayed 5 nights and that was too many....3 would be good. Nice bed, clean room, nice TV......all in all comfort is a plus here.

<Content>Excellent hotel We have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel and what a pleasant experience it was. The reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly, our room was nicely decorated with a very comfortable bed, the bathroom was immaculate. Breakfast, which could be taken in the breakfast room or conservatory, was standard continental fare and was constantly replenished. There is a small balcony on the top floor which all guests are free to use. The hotel is situated on the banks of the Arno, a little way from the historic centre of Florence but that was a plus as it meant being able to escape from all the crowds.Would stay here again.

<Content>Great little hotel! The Hotel River was a pleasant surprise for the price (booked through venere.com). The rooms were clean and nicely furnished. Breakfast was included and was pretty standard continental fare. Nice location on the river and close to St. Croce (I may be off on the name of the square), but Florence is small and walkable anyway. What really made the place stand out was the staff. Extremely nice and helpful. They made reservations for us, called taxis, etc. and generally offered excellent service (and seemed genuinely happy to do so). I would absolutely stay here again!

<Content>Very nice My husband and I stayed at this hotel this past September and it was lovely. We liked that it was by the river. Eventhough, we did not have a river view, it was nice to walk out and see the other side of Florence. Breakfast was simple but definitely fine. It was also very easy to walk to all the spots. Staff was also very helpful and there was free internet use at the computer right off the concierge desk. I recommend this hotel and I would go back again.

<Content>Love it! We always thought we would only be staying in Hotel David for our trips to Firenze, until we found this little gem. I am not saying that Hotel David is not good. When it comes to a 30-euro difference per night, I am afraid I have to choose Hotel River.We stayed in Room 200, which is in fact right behind the reception counter. We were there for 3 nights and experienced no noise at all. Location is gerat, walkable from all major attractions. The room is of decent size, modern and spotlessly clean bathroom, and a simple but more than sufficient breakfast.Bus 13 takes you right in front of the door from train station (but remember it's sort of going the opposite direction with River Arno on your left and the Hotel on your right. Sit on the right side of the bus if you are a first-timer to Firenze. You will pass the hotel before the bus-stop.) Opposite teh Hotel, you can take No.12 to both train stations. We left from Campo di Marte (a smaller one vs main SMN) for Roma and it is very convenient indeed.Have fun in Firenze.

<Content>The charming River We enjoyed the Hotel River as part of our 14 day European honeymoon. We stayed here for 3 nights and were very impressed by the hotel itself. The room was beautifully decorated and quite spacious for European standards too! The bathroom was very large compared to any of the others we stayed in and we loved that. We were able to get on the internet there too, at no charge, and see pictures from our wedding...which I was very happy about. Every other hotel wanted to charge us 5-10 euros for 10-15 minutes of use!!! So that was nice too! Oh and if you go upstairs to the rooftop, you are able to have a great view of the city of Florence and the river itself. It is within walking distance of most of what you're going to want to see... if you aren't ready to walk, then nothing in Italy is for you!! I definitely recommend Hotel River... and some gelato too!!

<Content>Excellent staff, cleanliness, location! We spent 4 nights at Hotel River in Florence and it absolutely exceeded our expectations! This hotel is located in a SAFE, upscale area within walking distance to Florence's highlights. If you prefer using the bus, a stop is located on the corner. The lobby is spacious with overstuffed couches, small library, and free internet provided in a private booth. Staff speaks fluent English and is genuinely concerned about patron satisfaction. (We especially appreciated the touring tips and good humor provided by Abusa.)The quality of our room looking onto the courtyard was 4-star! You can expect a very comfortable bed, fluffy towels, generous ammenities, a large bathroom and excellent TV reception. Breakfast was the best we experienced during 3 weeks of independent travel in Italy. It included a variety of pastries, fresh fruits, yogurt, boiled eggs, and coffee/tea/juice. The breakfast area includes a glass atrium where you may look onto the courtyard. We will ABSOLUTELY return to the Hotel River in Florence!

<Content>Nice hotel - great location Nice hotel in a great location on the Arno River. Rooms were large; bathroom was large compared to other places we stayed in Italy, and the A/C really worked! The staff was helpful and accomodating with maps, directions, restaurant recommendations, taxis, and laundry service. There is a booth in the hotel lobby with a computer with internet access. Don't miss gelato at Vivolo, near San Croce.

<Content>good base for exploring Florence good location and nice, clean hotel with very good customer service. Just 10mins walk from Uffizi Gallery, Ponte Vecchio etc. and (to my wife's delight) 5 mins from the School of Leather by the beautiful Santa Croce church. If you fancy pushing the boat out for a wonderul meal then go to Alle Murate in Via Del Proconsolo. We followed the hotel's recommendation for another restaurant nearby and it was really good (sorry, can't remember the name now but it's only 15 mins walk away)

<Content>Perfect My new husband and I just loved this hotel! (we were married in Sicily on this trip) Everyone was so friendly and helpful. While checking in we mentioned that we had just gotten married and ten minutes later a delicious bottle of perfectly chilled champagne was brought to our room along with nuts and crackers. We enjoyed this on our private terrace overlooking the River Arno. We drank and watched the sun set behind the buildings, reflecting in the river... it was gorgeous!Also while checking in, we went ahead and had the staff book our tours of the Academy Gallery (Michelangelo's David is there), and the Ufffizi Gallery. They were delighted to do this for us(tip: have cash). We were at the end of a two week trip and needed to wash some clothes. We were told where we could do this ourselves (just a short walk from the hotel), but we opted to have the hotel send our laundry out for us first thing in the morning. We had it back that evening around 8 or so (fine, since dinner is later that 8!). It really didn't cost much at all. I don't have anything bad to say about this hotel. We had a double room, and the room size was fine. Tastefully decorated. Large closet space with a lot of hangers. Bed was comfortable. I was so happy to have a real shower stall after only having a hole in the floor in Rome(another review of mine). My husband and I have a problem with bathtowels when we travel. Some hotels give you these paper-thin things they try to pass as towels that don't even absorb any water. Not so here... Hotel River has some great, big, absorbant towels! We were very happy.I've already told everyone to stay here if they are blessed with the chance to visit beautiful Firenze. Rest assured, we will be back, and we will stay at The Hotel River!

<Content>Well worth booking This is an excellent hotel and well managed hotel. A short walk by the river to get to all the main Florentine attractions. Our room (204) was small but more than adequate, recently refurbished, spotlessly clean and very quiet at night. Hotel staff are also very helpful. Breakfast is reasonable with a good choice and unlike a previous reviewer it didn't bother me to carry my coffee from the counter a few metres to our table.I would recommend the River and would certainly return

<Content>Very satisfied Much nicer than their website implies. We were very satisfied with friendly and helpful staff and nice rooms. Although on a map this looks to be a hike to many attractions, if you like walking, this is a pleasant distance to just about anywhere in Florence. We would stay here again, and have recommended it to many friends based on the reasonable rates.

<Content>Small but perfectly formed A charming clean and comfortable hotel. Polite and helpful staff.A short walk (or inexpensive bus ride) to the historic attractions.The knowledgeable manager will tell you which buses go where as well as sell you the tickets. He also directed us to the shop selling the gorgeous room fragrance that was in our room.Standard breakfast in an enclosed terrace or in the elegant lower breakfast room. My only crticiscm is of the coffee, because I just prefer a pot at the table.

<Content>Florence gem situated on the side of the Arno We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel River during our six-night sojourn in Florence. The staff were eager to please and extremely friendly and amicable. The rooms were decorated very thoughtfully and we were much impressed by how quiet the room was at night. The only (very very minor) complaint we have about the room is the lack of natural light. The buffet breakfast was well-equipped and we really enjoyed eating in the sun room, which overlooked the hotel's sunlit courtyard. The upstairs terrace on which you can enjoy a drink while gazing out onto the Arno River was much appreciated. As much as other reviewers say the hotel is well-located, I must admit that I found the hotel far from central. It is located in the Santa Croce neighbourhood and is about a 10 minute walk from the Uffizi Gallery and Ponte Vecchio - it doesn't sound like much, but returning to the hotel in the heat of a summer afternoon from the center of the city to take a rest and then going out again in the evening can become very tiring. Overall, we adored this hotel and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Perfect Hotel, Good Memory When my boyfriend and I first stepped into this hotel, we know that we have made the perfect choice for our 2nd visit in Italy. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Room and Toilet were massive and were tastefully decorated with very single detail is coordinated perfectly in an Italian manner. Despite our room is on the ground floor next to the reception, it is exceptionally quiet at night. The best is that we can enjoy a nice breakfast at the courtyard and have a late night drink on the roof garden. It is well deserved as a 4 stars or higher in Florence. Negative points are only no bathtub and hotel is slightly out of town (15 mins walk to the city centre - Uffizi gallery), which aren't too important. Will definitely go back again.

<Content>Great location... My husband and I stayed the River Hotel in Florence back in May, and for the price it exceeded our expectations. It was a lovely place right on the Arno and EVERYTHING was in walking distance. The Uffizi was about a three minute walk. The staff was exceptional and the complimentary breakfast was served in a lovely glassed in garden room. The rooms were small, but most rooms in Europe are not the size of those in American hotels. And they were sparkling clean. There was a great rooftop balcony where you can enjoy a glass of wine and watch the sunset over the Ponte Vecchio. We would definitely stay there again!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! Just returned from a 3-night stay at the hotel. Loved it! The entire staff was very welcoming, friendly, and informative (they helped me with everything from bus tickets  taxis to booking tours). The breakfast area was lovely - you could take your meal in the sunroom or large breakfast room. Don't miss the glazed croissants (they are better than those I've had in France!). And I was quite excited about the room, it was much larger than I had expected given past stays in Pisa and Rome.The hotel is situated beautifully along the Arno. A stroll along the river is a great way to start/finish the day in Florence. The route seemed safe as there are several small hotels along the same road, I had no concerns traveling it alone. The Santa Croce area is only minutes away where I found great glass/pottery shops and restaurants. Wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else in Florence!

<Content>Great find and good value My husband and I stayed at this boutique hotel in May 2006 and we loved it. It's a 10 minute walk not necessarily on a busy street to Piazza Signorellli, 5 more minutes to the Accademia to see the David. We were driving from Siena to Florence and this hotel was easy to find without driving through the city, a big plus for my husband who was the one doing the driving, and they readily parked the car in a garage for us for our stay. The garage fee was 21 Euro/day and they readily brought the car around when it was time for us to leave. We had a wonderful 4th floor room with balcony with wonderful view of the Arno river, Ponte Vecchio and sunset over Florence.Our room was comfortable with enough room for our stuff and we had a lot of stuff at this point of our trip. The breakfast was more than adequate and served in a lovely garden room.The staff was polite and helpful in recommending good restaurants and routes to walk through while exploring Florence. Most definately would stay here again.

<Content>Highly Recommended Just returned from a 3 day stay at the Hotel River in Florence. We were travelling with friends and looking for a good hotel at a reasonable rate - not that easy to find in Florence. We chose this hotel based on previous reviews and were not disappointed. The hotel is small and very friendly - much more welcoming than chain hotels. The location was perfect - close enough to walk to the centre in under 10 minutes but far enough away to be peaceful and away from the hordes of tourists. There is a great roof terrace with views over the Arno to the Ponte Vecchio where we took pre dinner drinks every evening.The rooms were simply furnished but very comfortable and clean - much nicer than other 3 and many 4 star hotels that I have stayed in. Also the website does not do the rooms justice - they are much more comfortable than they look. The staff were very friendly and booked excellent restaurants for us every evening - not tourist traps either - one evening we were the only non italians in a local trattoria.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again if I return to Florence.

<Content>Great find! We loved the Hotel River. A great boutique hotel. We are not real BB type people but like smaller, more personal hotels. This one was a good find. The front desk staff was very cordial and helpful. The hotel was remodeled in 2000, so the rooms, though somewhat small, are very modern and comfortable. We splurged for a fourth floor room with a balcony. The balcony was fairly large with a beautiful view of the Arno River and the Ponte Vecchio. The breakfast was more than adequate and served in a nice setting to be eaten indoors or in their enclosed sunroom. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend to friends and family.

<Content>Would stay here again Spent 10 euro on a taxi to get from the train stationto the Hotel River along the Arno. Location is withinwalking distance of the main attractions but it is along walk along a busy street. Room was clean andbreakfast was the best we had at any of our Italyhotels- try the filled croissants! Staff was helpfuland friendly.

<Content>What a gem! We recently stayed at the Hotel River in mid-January. Got an excellent rate thru Expedia of $89 per night, and once we arrived at the hotel took a tour of the rooms with a river view and opted for the additional $50 per night for the view. Pleasant room, comfortable with a great view of the river. The staff at the hotel was very helpful with restaurant reservations, taxis and general sight seeing information. I will say that if you value peace and quiet, don't go for the river view room. The street is bustling all night long, but we loved the sound. I would absolutely stay here again!

<Content>Excellent hotel! We stayed at Hotel River from Jan.2-Jan 4. 2006. After arriving in Florence, we took a taxi to the hotel since we arrived late evening (7-8E). The reception staff was very friendly, helpful, and offered excellent dinner recommendations. Room cost was 80E/night, inclusive of breakfast. Our room was clean and spacious by European standards. It is a 15 minute walk to the major attractions, but we enjoy being a bit away from the hustle and bustle of the city center. We highly recommend this hotel and would plan to stay again in the future.

<Content>A Gem I lived in Florence for several years and am well-acquainted with the city's hotels. Hotel River is one of the best, especially for those travellers who are looking for moderately priced accomodations, but who do not want to skimp on comfort and safety. The hotel went through a complete renovation in 2002, so the rooms are well-appointed, a good size, extremely clean, and very, very comfortable and quiet. We actually looked forward to going back to the hotel after a long day touring the sites. The reception staff are professional, courteous, English-speaking, and friendly. The location is ideal for those who want to escape the hustle of the city center. It is about a 10 minute walk from the Piazza della Signoria, and located directly on the Arno. Even in the brisk weather of January, the walk was easy and even enjoyable, with views of the Tuscan hills, the old walls, and the church of San Miniato up on the hill... and rather romantic. I highly recommend this hotel, and will stay there again, without question.

<Content>Perfect for us! We have just returned from an amazing 2 day taster of Florence and the Hotel River was the perfect hotel for us.We enjoy a brief stroll to see the attractions so the hotels location did not concern us.However i would recommend that you take a taxi from the train station when you first arrive as we did get a little lost, and it really isn't expensive. It's around 8 euros. The hotel staff were very helpful, advising us on restaurants and travel around Florence, via the free internet access. Our room was at the rear of the hotel which was clean,modern and fresh smelling. It was lovely and quiet (apart from the second night when a tearful baby arrived!)The breakfast was fresh and adequate for your needs first thing in the morning. The views from the outdoor terrace are amazing. We will definately be returning to Florence and will be staying at this hotel again

<Content>Top Hotel Returned this evening from a brief trip to Florence. My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hotel River, which was superb. The room we occupied was a good size and absolutely immaculate. It had a large, smart bathroom with bidet and shower, all nnce again extremely clean and well looked after. The staff were friendly and accomodating at every turn, from recomending restaurants to opening the bar just for us after we returned from dinner. Free internet access was provided in the foyer, and the staff were more than willing to help us reserve tickets for the numerous galleries in the immediate vicinity. The hotel is superbly located and around a ten minute walk away from the duomo. Whilst further away than some, we found its location away from the tourist trap that is central Florence was actually of benefit- it feels more like the hotel is in the real Florence. The only problem I had with the Hotel was the breakfast- I am sure a greater variety of produce could have been offered- but this is a small niggle with an otherwise excellent hotel. We hope to return!

<Content>Excellent small Hotel The pictures on-line do not do justice to the Hotel River. I was told to stay there, by a friend, so took a chance. I was pleasantly surprised and loved the Hotel. The foyer, stairs and public rooms are beautiful. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. They gave me advice on restaurants, buses, best gelateria, Bankomat, stamps, anything. They took out a map and showed me how to get everywhere. The room was modern and clean. The breakfast buffet was excellent and served elegantly or in a lovely greenhouse setting. It ends early (9:30 AM), so be sure to have it delivered to your room if you are having a late morning. The hotel balcony with a beautiful view of the River, falls and bridges was a great place to sip wine or read a book. Avoid the late night front desk man on the weekends (unless absolutely necessary), as he gets cranky. The shower was plentiful (which my daughter tells me is a problem in Italy) and warm, just a bit small for very large people. No iron, No clock All other amenities were great. Would stay here again and recommend to friends, as long as they don't mind the 15 minutes walk to get to the sites. I loved the chance to walk off all that delicious Italian food that I ate.

<Content>An Amazing Value Once again the Trip Advisor reviews were on target. The Hotel River is an excellent value; the accomodations, service and breakfast were more than I could have expected for the price. The room was tastefully decorated and very comfortable, made even more attractive with a terrace right off our room. The bathroom was spacious, newly refurbished and kept immaculately clean by the housekeeping staff. The breakfast foods were plentiful and could be taken in the attractive dining room or the lovely enclosed sunroom. The staff at the front desk just as all the staff we encountered were courteous and the gentleman who was on duty during the day couldn't do enough to make sure that our stay was wonderful. Though the hotel was a little far from the center of town, it was a pleasant retreat, away from the hustle and bustle of things.

<Content>Peaceful and luxurious I booked this hotel discounted through a web site online. A very quiet hotel. Good breakfast. VERY comfortable beds. The staff were very welcoming and spoke excellent English. It's a bit of a walk to the centre of Florence, but walking along the river is pleasant. I would definitely come back. It was worth paying a little above budget prices for such a nice hotel.

<Content>Wonderful retreat in Florence Stayed at the Hotel River for 2 nights - what a great find! The staff was very warm and helpful and the location was good. I was travelling with family so we had 3 double rooms. They were spacious, very clean, nicely decorated and the beds very comfortable. Each of our rooms had a couch as well. Breakfast was included in the price and served indoors with the option to eat in their courtyard. There is also free internet access in the lobby in a private alcove. You can walk to most sites (approximately 10 minutes to Ponte Vecchio). The hotel was very welcoming after a day of sightseeing and walking until we almost dropped! On the last night we brought dinner back to the hotel and ate on the terrace with views of the Arno River - a great way to end our short but sweet stay in Florence. It's a short taxi ride to the train station (~10 euros). I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.

<Content>Lovely hotel with pretty view of the river We stayed in this central hotel after changing from a dismal, allegedly three-star hotel. The room was pretty and clean, with a nice view of inner courtyard. Staff were friendly and very helpful, and we were close to all the main sights. The hotel balcony was lovely to sit around and watch the world go by and see the river below. I would recommend this as a good value, better than 3-star hotel and would visit again.

<Content>Great Hotel The River in Florence is a real find and probably was one of the best hotels that we stayed at on our trip. It is located across the street from the Arno in the San Croce area. Our daughter and I liked the location because this area of Florence was very clean and was away from the main hubbub of the city. There is a bus stop very close to the hotel. We arrived by train and took the number 13 to the hotel and the number 12 took us back to the train station. The staff is very accommodating and the reception area and breakfast area were very nice. The hotel also offerred free internet access.

<Content>Adored the Hotel River The Hotel River is perfectly situated along the Arno River in Florence. The location is excellent. Directly across the river from the hotel is the Piazza de Michelangelo. The hotel is clean, the rooms are charming, and the staff couldn't be nicer. I never expected such a nice hotel for the great price we paid. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>Room with a river view Since we didn't stay in our room much, we were able to overlook the smallness of it. We were lucky enough to get the 4th floor room (ask for 401 when making reservations) which has its own balcony and looks out over the river. Perfect for people watching. The staff was friendly and helpful in getting us into our room early after we explained that we had flown from Saudi Arabia and then had been on the train from Rome. Overall, a wonderful 4 days in Florence.

<Content>Elegance, convenience and tranquility We stayed at the Hotel River last year whilst visiting Florence. What a great place to fall upon. Our room was boutique type accommodation with great features, very clean, and safe. The hotel staff were delightful and friendly and helpful. The location was perfect, just 5 mins from the centre of Florence, and great to find and beautifully siutated across from Michelangelo's statue and the river of course. They had great breakfast in the morning in a lovely seating area both inside and outside.Highly recommended.
