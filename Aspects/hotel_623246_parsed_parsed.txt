<Content>Not worth it. The concierge who helped us with our bags upon arriving did not help with our bags at the car and when he delivered them to the room had a grimace on the whole time. When we thanked him, he mumbled his response. Apparently unhappy about something.The room stunk of cigarettes even though it was a non-smoking room.The room was always hot even when we adjusted the thermometer.The bed was extremely uncomfortable.The very strong scent of cleaning products (to cover up cigar and cigarette odor?) was very irritating to our sinus allergies. In the lobby and hallways and room.No facial tissue or wash cloths in the room.The pool is set in a back courtyard, where people from their apartments can look down over you.

<Content>Lovely hotel I went to Barcelona for a 3 night break with my elderly mother and my brother and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. This hotel was very good, well up to its 4* rating, our check in was fairly uneventful the only problem being that I had booked 2 rooms not one but Patricio on reception was extremely helpful and spoke excellent english. The second room was duly found and was as good as the first (a double as well for one). The bar was expensive indeed the beer in the minibar was cheaper. Our deal included breakfast and there was a vast array of food to help yourself to from meats and cheeses, fruit and cooked food whith eggs cooked to order. I would recommend this hotel to every one especially as it is so close to Plaza de Catalunia and the Ramblas.

<Content>Great Location, Brilliant Hotel Travelled as a couple for a short break in Barcelona. The hotel is in an excellent location, in the triangle at the top of Las Ramblas.The hotel is between Universitat and Place Catalunya Metro stops which get you to all the tourist sites in the City.We arrived late in the evening and check-in was quick and efficient. The hotel staff were very helpful and polite and expecting our arrival. I emailed the hotel which is part of the large Catalonia hotels group a day before travel to confirm the booking, they responded quickly with a reservation number.The hotel room was modern, very clean and standard to a 4* hotel. The rooms were cleaned daily with all the toiletries and towels replaced for fresh. The toiletries were a wide range and the bathroom also included a hairdryer. The room had no view as it was to the rear of the hotel but on the plus side it was extremely quiet, anyone who has been to Barcelona will tell you how noisy the city is on an evening. The hotel has a SPA with steam room and Sauna, this are all included in the booking priceThe hotel bar was relaxed and modern but very expensive; I am not one for eating in hotels so this was not a problem to us. There are hundreds of Tapas bars, restaurants and ice cream shops nearby. People will try to scare you with the possible dangers of Barcelona, more so to the south of Las Ramblas 'El Ravel'. We saw no such problems and the hotel is in a safe area next to all the tourist amenities, department stores and transport links.I booked through easytobook.com and got 4 nights for æ‹¢290 which was a real bargain. If I could get the price again I would without doubt book the Catalonia Ramblas again. I would recommend this hotel to other travellers

<Content>Hotel of Horror - The Worst Hotel in The World This is truly the worst hotel experience I have ever endured. I travel frequently and reside at hotels globally, and have to say I have never been had such a horrific experience.Interestingly enough, I didn't have the time to check Trip Advisor before my trip, and if I had I would have read negative experiences which paralleled mine.The staff is abusive, negative, and misrepresented the price on the hotel room. Not just one staff member, many representing many different shifts.Carolina and Federico were just two of the staff members who truly RUINED what was the most amazing trip to Spain. Their behavior was almost sociopathic in their disdain for hotel guests and guest experience.A question regarding the rate of the room provoked Federico to threaten to call the police and report us to authorities over a 15 Euro difference. The hotel rate online as we booked was 90 Euros. He charged us 105 Euros. It wasn't the money, it was the principle, and the way we were treated was HORRIFIC. So, just for verification, we did pay the 105 Euros, but again, for us, it was about the principle, not the cash.I could go further into detail, but will tell you this was one of many abuses by the hotel staff that made our stay truly TERRIBLE.You can also read some of the other negative reviews on this website and find that they are all true.This is a terrible hotel, the worst staff, and the most horrific service I have every experienced.Please feel free to contact me for further verification or questions regarding this Horror of a Hotel.If you would prefer to be threatened, abused and experience terrible service, Hotel Catalonia Ramblas in Barcelona is the place to be.My advice... there are many nice hotels in Barcelona, and this isn't one of them, so book yourself somewhere else where the staff is friendly.

<Content>Excellent hotel from a Barcelona regular I have had the pleasure of staying at this hotel three times this year and have been very impressed on all occasions. I have been coming to Barcelona on business and leisure for the past ten years and have stayed at numerous hotels and have seen the standards change as the city becomes more popular.Without question, even including 5 star hotels such the Majestic on Avenue Diagonal, this hotel beats them all for location, style, food, room comfort and service. I have also held meetings using their excellent facilities on the lower ground floor and the high standards have been maintained.My only niggles would be that the signage can be a little confusing (the first time I ended up at the swimming pool with my luggage!), the lifts can get busy (maybe there are lifts I haven't discovered?) and that sofas in the bar are very low.....but thats may be my age and dodgy back!I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to friends and business colleagues and indeed have done so already.

<Content>Recommended I was somewhat apprehensive about staying here after reading some of the other reviews, but our experience at the Catalonia Ramblas was very positive. For starters, the location is just brilliant, right in the middle of everything, handy to the Metro and only 15 Euros by taxi from the airport. We were on the ground floor but at the back of the hotel - so no view, but the room was incredibly quiet and very dark when the curtains were pulled. Our room was very comfortable and VERY well equipped with lots of unusual but thoughtful touches like individual small reading lights (as well as bedside lamps), plugs in the sink (unusual in Europe), coffee and tea making equipment with a kettle to boil water (also unusual in Europe - and with a good assortment of herbal teas), free WIFI and even bathroom scales. The only thing I didn't particularly like was the funny long pillow, but that's not uncommon in Europe. Everything was very clean and worked fine - the air conditioning, the safe etc. The reception staff were a little offhand when we checked in but later I needed their assistance to make some phone calls in Spanish for me and Carolina on Reception was extremely helpful (including making a long distance call for me that I was never charged for). We arrived at 2pm (check in time) and had a 15 minute wait for our room to be ready - no big deal.There is a huge amount of seating in the lobby/bar area, as well as outside by the small pool on the second floor. We didn't use the pool as the water was not warm enough when we were there.I booked our stay via the www.wotif.com website and we paid only 138 Euro per night - a bargain for this room in this city. I'd definitely recommend the Catalonia Ramblas and I'd definitely stay there again.

<Content>Rude Service From a "Four-Star" Hotel Ruins a Trip Although this hotel is sometimes called a four-star hotel, this was the worst hotel stay I have ever endured. The customer service ranged from lacking to actively insulting. After having to deal with (1) rude and unhelpful customer service, (2) a lost reservation, (3) broken air conditioning, and (4) a lying front desk attendant (even the reception manager admitted that the front desk attendant had lied to me), I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.*LOST RESERVATION*The first problem was that when I arrived at the end of a long trip from Valencia, I was told by the attendant at reception (Quentin) that he was unable to find my reservation. After about five minutes examining the list of reservations, I asked Quentin whether there was a problem with my reservation. I handed him my printout of my hotel reservation confirmation (I made the hotel reservation directly on the hotel website). Quentin curtly responded that there would be no problem, but for the fact that they did not have my reservation in the system. He then tried to send me to another hotel down the street. However, it was late at night at this point, and I was exhausted, so I asked Quentin if he could find a room for me. I had my reservation in hand, so it was clear that I was not in the wrong. After making a few phone calls to some other hotels, he finally assigned me to a room in the hotel. I asked Quentin how he was able to find another room. He snidely replied that he was only able to do so by taking a room away from a later-arriving customer, so he would have to deny them a room. I also explicitly confirmed with Quentin that the room he had assigned me to was the room that I had indeed contracted for. He responded, Yes, and this room is even superior to the other room. *BROKEN AIR CONDITIONING*When I arrived in my room, I was dismayed to discover that the air conditioning didn't appear to be working, even though I specifically booked the hotel because it said that it had air conditioning. After calling guest services, I was informed that I should turn on the air conditioning, and wait 15 minutes before calling them back. So I called - and was told that I would be called back in 15 more minutes. After waiting for far more than 15 minutes, and having received no call, I finally called back. And called. And called the front desk. And called. Until I finally got through - and when I spoke to Quentin at the front desk, he seemed totally unsurprised that the air conditioning wasn't working, and simply told me that there was nothing the hotel could do until the next day. Now, this was the middle of summer, and it was swelteringly hot in my room. I was forced to open the windows because it was incredibly hot. Even then, the room was still very hot, and because of the loud street noise consisting of rowdy partygoers that persisted until at least 5 am, I could not sleep at all that night. I had a full day planned the next day, and was exhausted all day because of my lack of sleep. *RUDE RECEPTION MANAGER*The next day, I spoke with Carola, the reception manager. When I calmly told her my story, and about how dismayed I felt at my treatment by Quentin, she interrupted my recounting of the incident at least 3 times, demanding, Are you done? She actually *ADMITTED* that Quentin had known about the broken air conditioning when he had assigned me to the room. And as for Quentin, she scornfully asked me, What do you want me to do - ask him to apologize to you because he knew that the air conditioning was broken? Well, Carola, I entered into a contract for a room with a/c - but your hotel breached that contract my giving me a hotel with NO a/c. Moreover, your hotel representative acted in bad faith by lying to me about the lack of a/c. I was so disturbed by Carola's accusatory attitude of denial that I asked to speak to her supervisor. *UNACCEPTABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE*Throughout this whole situation, I received no apologies from Carola or Quentin. It was only when I spoke directly with the director of the hotel that my concerns about shoddy customer service were even addressed. However, the director of the hotel still failed to make me feel like my concerns about shoddy customer service had been adequately addressed. He kept repeating that he had confidence in his staff, and he did not allay my concerns at having been treated poorly, despite NONE of the problems (lost reservation, broken a/c) having been my fault. Perhaps the hotel director's lax management skills has resulted in the unfortunate attitude with which the staff now treats the customers.I have never in my life complained about the customer service I received in a hotel - nor have I ever had to. Even in the smallest BBs I stayed in in Italy, I received service with a smile. I selected this hotel based on the positive Tripadvisor reviews as well as the hotel's proximity to Las Ramblas. However, I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone else stay at this hotel, nor any of the other hotels in the Hoteles Catalonia group, in the future.

<Content>Stylish, good location, friendly staff. This hotel is OK We stayed here for 2 days for a Barcelona city break. When you first see the Hotel you might think it's quite small but once inside you'll think differently. The staff was nice and helpful and the hotel itself has a a stylish and luxury feel to it. Lot's of wood  marble panels. There is a bar lounge area inside (quite large for a hotel), and on the A-level there's a pool with bar as well. When you stay here make sure you know you way around. There are multiple levels and a second set of elevators that get you to some those. Our room (std. deluxe room) was okay although the bathroom door was located really close to the bed. but the rest of the room was spacious enough. Minibar, an in-room safe (big enough for a laptop), Flatscreen Tv, plenty of closet space are all present in the room. what i particularly liked was the double entree doors so most of the hallway sound is blocked. what I didn't like was that the beds came with a hard mattress. The hotel is located near the Catalonia Square (turn right outside the hotel) and La Rambla (the must-see boulevard) starts right there. all in 5 min radius. Opposite of the hotel is a bus stop for the red-route tourist bus which can take you to all the famous places in the city (get tickets/map at kiosk on Catalonia Square). We enjoyed our stay and we will come back and recommend to others.

<Content>Loved almost every bit of this hotel When the taxi pulled up to the hotel, needless to say, it wasn't what I had expected. I was disappointed, but also surprised. I was surprised by the superb location of this 4* hotel. But disappointed, by the size on my first look. But once inside the hotel, I realised that, I had no reason to be disappointed, as the hotel from the outside, was very misleading, when infact, the hotel is really big!We checked in with no problems, even got a free upgrade. Happy days! The room was fabulous, virtually brand new, with all the mod-cons. Oo, I must mention the shower in our room, one of the best showers I've had in a hotel! Lovely and big, and clean. Perfecto!The location of the hotel couldnt be better, right next to the world famous Ramblas, yet, near enough away so that you dont get all of the hustle and bustle throughout the night. As I write this, I am sat in the hotel's reception/bar/t.v area waiting for our time to come before we can fly home. I will miss this hotel, as I think of all the hotels I've stayed in the world, this is one of the best.One thing I should mention, is the pick-pockets along the Ramblas, although that has nothing to do with the hotel, any one visiting the hotel or area should be aware that they need to bare in mind their security during their visit, might I suggest a bag that you can see and not carrying around lots of money or important travel documentsThe staff are friendly, and polite, and couldnt do anymore to help us. Another bonus, free wi-fi! The instructions said that we'd only be able to pick it up in this area on the first floor, but I have managed to pick up the signal in my room on the 3rd floor and at the other end of the hotel.To say that I am impressed with this hotel would be an understatement. I have already planned my return visit with some friends. Catalonia Ramblas, I'll be back!

<Content>Aweful security When I arrived there, I saw the entry hall, and it looked nice, so my expectations got very high. Then I saw the single-bed room they gave us, when I clearly reserved a double-bed room. The rest of my stay was kind of nice, but in the last day, somebody stole my mother's purse when we turned around a bit to go get some food at the buffet. It didn't even last 5 minutes, and it was gone. All our documentation, money, etc, was in there. Then we went to the front desk, and they offered almost no help at all. The only help they gave us was lending us the phone for free phone calls, calling our air company so we could fly back to our home country, and indicating where the nearest police station was. So, in the end, I wouldn't recommend it at all. It's the worst hotel I've ever been in my life.

<Content>Recommend this hotel We have just returned from a long weekend break in Barcelona. Despite initial problems with checking into the hotel, we would still strongly recommend it. The room was very comfortable and spacious. I think it is the most comfortable hotel bed ever!My only complaint would be that the rooms didnt seem to be cleaned until evening time, which was very inconvenient, given that this is the time we would have liked to be in the room before heading out for the evening.The buffet breakfast selection was second to none. Absolutely fantastic.The location of the hotel was ideal, very central but yet quiet at night when we wanted to sleep. No noise at all.Pool area was lovely and everything was spotlessly clean.We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Top Marks for the Ramblas As with all holidays I was nervous in case I had got a bad hotel as it was a treat for me and a girlfriend for my 40th birthday, I need not have worried, It was fantastic. Yes the reception staff were not overly friendly but they were professional and quick. Hotel is half an hour from airport. Hotel and the room was very clean. Our room number was 239 and the room and bathroom were very spacious, the view is not great but we did not go there to sit in the room. The spa is to die for- again very clean. The pool on the roof is a great bonus the staff at the bar particularly one called Festus was a dab hand at the cocktails! The hotel restaurant is a must - top class meal, but you must book beforehand. You must have breakfast at this hotel, everything is so fresh and the choice is great. The location is cental, you leave the hotel and everything is on your doorstep, we were there for 5 days and did not use a cab. The harbour is a 20 minute walk. The designer shops LV, YSL etc are a 15 minute walk but if you are the kind not to venture too far this hotel is ideal. I would recommend that if you are coming here avoid paying the transfers as it is cheaper to get a cab yourself from the airport. I would defo class this as a 4 star and am planning to stay here again.

<Content>Very good location. The hotel was a somewhat pleasant surprise.I had a spacious room with 2 queen beds, wooden floor, flat screen tv and a big bathroom with separate baththub and shower. The room was spotless and comfortable. The only complaint about the room is the difficulty of adjusting the temperature of the water from the (nice waterfall) shower. It was either very hot or too cold.No bottled water is provided free of charge in the room, but there are plenty of shops nearby to get all you need.The hotel had a small outdoor pool with a pool bar. I didn't try the spa services (sauna, jacuzzi, massage)Breakfast was comprehensive and beautifully laid out. No complaints.Service in the reception varied from standard polite service to somewhat rude and indifferent by one receptionist.

<Content>Great Hotel, Fab Location My husband I stayed at this hotel in February 2008. The hotel is in a great location - really close to The Ramblas, bus routes and sights.Our room was spacious and beautifully laid out. The bathroom area was great. We stayed on a BB basis - the breakfast was very good with lots of different things to choose from. You could also have bacon, eggs, etc cooked on a grill whilst you waited. I would recommend this hotel. The reception staff were very helpful. The only very minor downside we found was that we didn't have a good window in our room which meant there was very little natural daylight, however the plus side to this was that our room was located where there was no road or traffic noise.A great hotel, definitely worth a stay in a fab, vibrant city!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel I organised an incentive trip for 30 people in January 2008 to go to Barcelona for a weekend. Booking hotels abroad is always a bit tricky to get right for such events but this one exceeded all our expectations.The rooms where modern, attractive, spotlessly clean, and large. It was an idea location for exploring the city of Barcelona as just off the famous Las Ramblas, restaurants and shops. Plus it was easy for our coaches to find and pick us up for the activities and excursions.I would recommend this to anyone who is going to Barcelona for a short break or on business as the facilities are excellent.

<Content>OK but expensive Foyer of the hotel is nice and it is in a good location, but the room is very dark and quite small given the amount of money it cost. Very central location but very touristy area.No noise from outside the hotel, but from inside it is very noisy every time a flush went or a shower was turned on from either rooms above or either side it sounded like it was running through our room and any chance of a lie in was hopeless. The marble corridors also meant that any internal door shutting echoed loudly and anybody talking in the corridor sounded like they were on loud speaker.i'm sure there are other hotels in the area that offer better value for money.

<Content>Excellent, pricy choice Location:Very central, close to the main street of Barcelona and the Ramblas area with the narrow streets and speciality shops. About 150 meters to the subway station and taxi stop. The street is busy, but most, if not all rooms, have windows towards the pool or the backyard. Rooms:Very modern interior, spotless cleaning. The room is very large with stone tiles and plenty of storage space. The internet connection was speedy, however I had to call the reception to get login and password. The bathroom was also spacious and spotless. Flat screen TV with mostly spanish channels and some international news and music channels.Service:Friendly, polite and english fluent staff that were very helpful with guidance.Dining:Breakfast was pretty good, fresh made juice and a chef that made omelettes or egg and bacon.The only experience I had with the bar was a disappointment, I ordered a Caiprinha, but it didn't taste anything like it.

<Content>Fab Hotel, excellent location! Really loved this hotel, stayed there at the begining of January 2008, the location was perfect as was right around the corner from La Rambla, which has lots of resturants, bars ect. The staff were very friendly and when we decided to stay an extra night this was no problem and was charged the same rate as the other two nights which were booked online (even though the extra night was a Saturday)!My only niggle with this hotel was when getting our creased clothes out for a night out, we hunted around for an iron then phoned room service to request iron and ironing board, and was told they don't have them but they can iron a shirt for you for 5 euros! So we hung most of our clothes in shower to steam them as was not prepared to pay someone to iron our clothes for us.Apart from that our trip was excellent, and the hotel fab, did not eat breakfast there as it was only cheese, ham and breads ect, but there are a couple of places round corner on La Rambla selling english (ish) breakfasts for half the price.Also we had a good eve out at a mexican restaurant called 'Margarita Blue which is a short taxi ride (7 euros) down by the port end of La Rambla or a stroll (not in heals though), they did fab cocktails and quite nice food, good place to go if your young (average age 30). We had a very good time and got quite tipsey trying all the lovely cocktails!

<Content>Great Hotel in fantastic postion We were a little apprehensive as previous comments mentions refurbishment works. However this was completed and the hotel is excellent. We got the bus from the airport which dropped us off in the Plaza de Catalonia, and it was just a three minute walk to the hotel.The room was large and modern. Excellent shower. Very clean.The breakfast which was included, was very comprehensive, with eggs cooked to order. It set us up for the day.The Ramblas is just round the corner, so the location could not have been better for us on a sightseeing holiday.

<Content>Great stay Booked in by the organisers of the Barcelona Round the World Race - I stayed 3 nights. My arrival was delayed by a day - I had come straight from a regatta in Brazil but my wife came a day earlier and was made welcome - impeccable treatment from the reception staff. We were treated to a superior room - large room with large balcony on the 6th floor right above the street. Because the room was set back from the street it was adeqately quiet but I'd be a bit worried on the floors below. However most rooms look out onto the central courtyard and the swimming pool. Delightful in the summer and a quiet oasis insulated from any street noise. Excellent breakfasts, good coffee and drinks in the bar.

<Content>under refurbishment Under major refurbishment - not worth visiting until probably 2008, no apologies - water and electricity switched off during our stay - no warning of any of this prior to our stay - building site nightmare rings a bell!booking of twin/double room mixed up as anticipated and despite trying to arrange ahead and checking at reception prior to going to the room, it was still wrong. The location is excellent if you can put up with the mishaps one after another. Breakfast is good if you can get coffee to go with it. Lack of sun beds, etc etc. If they can zip up the management and complete the refurbishment it could be a good hotel.

<Content>Great Location Stayed over 4 nights 30th July - 3rd Aug. 2 rooms - 2 adults, 2 teenagers.First impression was not very good renovating work being carried out at the hotel reception area, this is for a month or so (July/Aug), so make sure your room is on the 3rd or 4th floors.Staff very apologetic about the situation didn,t spoil our holiday.Had 2 twin rooms both very well equipped, very tidy and spotless.Rooms next door to each other but different, room 1 had a bath with shower over it, the 2nd room had a seperate shower cubicle + bath, if you prefer a shower this is the room you want.All hotel ammenities were quite good all though the pool is not very large or deep. Booking included breakfast, this buffet style and ample choice available. Didn't use the hotel restaurant, loads of very good places to eat nearby, in particular L'Olivas just around the corner + the Attic which is on the Ramblas. The hotel is ideally situated for exploring this magic city, Metro + local and tourist bus stop just a minute away from the hotel. Will definately consider using this hotel again, hopefully the work in the reception area will be finished!

<Content>Good location We stayed four nights at Catalonia Ramblas. The hotel is OK, (but not very exciting) and the location is very good. Easy walking distance to the Ramblas and to shops and lots of restaurants.Only a few of the staff speaks English, but all were very friendly and we got fast help when our aircondition didnéº“t work.We only had breakfast at the hotel once. The breakfastroom is very noisy and you have to stand in line for a long time if it is rush hour. The quality of the breakfast was good, but you can easy get breakfast out, just go around the block there are several places.

<Content>Nice hotel, could try a little harder We stayed here on a short 3 day break to Barcelona. Overall we were very pleased with this hotel, however I wouldn't really say it is a 4 star, more like a 3. As a newly married couple we emailed a request for a room with a double bed, the 1st room we were given was quite nice and spatious, but with 2 x singles. We went back to reception to ask for an alternative room and were given another. The 2nd room did indeed have a double bed, but was tiny in comparison with a window opening on to an internal shaft, not a very pleaent view at all. We then went back to reception to say this was not acceptable and were then given a really nice big room, with a bath and double shower and a view with a balcony overlooking the walkway at the back of the hotel which was very pleasent. This made such a difference to our overall impression of the hotel (our room was 233).Storage was a little limited, there was a small wardrobe and a couple of shelves, but nothing more. Not too bad for a weekend break, but not very good if you are staying for longer. The free safe was a bonus though.There was tea and coffee making facilities, and a mini bar stocked with the usual items, however the maids didn't seem to check and refill on a daily basis.The rooms were cleaned daily, although standards could have been better (whilst walking around the room bare foot after taking a shower I found my feet picked up quite alot of dust from the floor. Having said this, they seemed over zealous with things like changing the robes on a daily basis (this was a bit unnecessary)The hotel staff are not the friendliest of people, some were better than others, but maybe that's just the spanish way, nothing seems to happen with any pace or urgency. We only ate in the hotel once and had breakfast, it was nothing to write home about. The hot water for tea was not boiling hot and had an unpleasent after taste and the coffee was quite weak. You can get a lovely breakfast of coffee / croissants for just a few Euros in many of the cafes nearby, much cheaper and nicer than in the hotel if you don't mind taking a stroll.  The best thing about this hotel was the fact that it had a rooftop outdoor swimming pool (approx 10m x 3m) which was a real bonus. Towels are provided for guests but tended to run out late afternoon but were eventually re-stocked. The pool area has quite a few sun loungers and there are also quite a few really comfy loungers with parasols too. This area became quite busy from about 3.30 onwards, but was a very pleasent way to take in the last few hours of sunshine and seemed to be a real suntrap. Overall a very nice aspect to the hotel.The location of this hotel is very good, it is a stones throw away from the busy Ramblas and Placa Catalonia so very central for all you want, but far enough to get peace and quiet. If we booked to go to Barcelona again I would use this hotel again, however I would be quite particular about the room and I would lower my expectation of customer service to 3* levels.

<Content>Doesn't quite deserve its four stars I stayed at Catalonia Ramblas while attending a conference held right there at the hotel. Because of the special conference rate, I had to contact the hotel directly to make a reservation. It took me 7 (seven) international phone calls and 4 emails (reservations office closed; the office is open but the person doesn't speak English; the person does speak English but the reservations computer is broken, etc). In the end, they still managed to screw it up - apparently, there was another person with the same last name as mine which proved to be too much of a challenge. -- Later, when observing the front desk in operation at this hotel, I noticed paper notes and paper files everywhere. It seems that computer technology has not yet fully made it there. -- On the first day, the front desk called me, and woke me up, at 10:30 PM: they couldn't find my reservation (!) - can I please tell them how many nights I am going to stay. I had to be brusque in response.The building was apparently converted from a newspaper headquarters to a 4-star hotel last year. For a new hotel, the Ramblas looks rather old and tired. The choice of hardwood and wood decor is strange: dark brown color makes the rooms look like they were last renovated in the 70's. I was first given a small room facing one of the busiest, noisiest streets in the center of Barcelona, and the insulation was not at all sufficient. Since I was tired after a transatlantic flight, I slept for most of the night, but the street noise was so annoying that I requested a different room in the morning. They did give me a nicer, larger room facing a very quiet side street. The only problem was that it was a smoking room. The faint stink was just below my tolerance threshold so I accepted the trade-off.The bathrooms in both rooms had a number of design lapses. The doors, made of glass, have hinges that tend to emit a loud snap sound when you open, then close the door. There was a single hook and no towel bar, so there was no place to put or hang the towel to dry. A kind of radiator could be found inside the shower cabin; it was obviously wet after I took a shower, and therefore useless. In the larger room, bath robes were provided - tucked into a gap next to the sink (nowhere else to put them).The pillows were sausage-like: long, thin and uncomfortable. There was no alarm clock and the TV doesn't have one built in, either, which is a major oversight for a 4-star hotel. The multitude of switches for different lamps in the room (no indication of what is what) took several days to get used to. Air conditioning was provided but only inside the rooms, so corridors and especially elevators (lifts) were too warm, and the air conditioner in the larger room had a tin sound when it was revving up. The ironing board and iron, standard in US hotels and so useful to us travelers, were not available, but a coffee machine was.The hotel staff was neither particularly friendly nor unfriendly.On the positive side, breakfast was very good, there was free wireless Internet access that worked, and the hotel's location is obviously a plus. And, my request for an early (4:30) wake-up call and a taxi 30 minutes later was fulfilled in a timely manner.This hotel is an illustration of the unevenness of the 4-star standard in Europe - I don't think it deserves the rating.

<Content>Very nice stay It is always a chance you take, when you book an unknown hotel on the internet. Ramblas Catalonia was one on the better choices. The facade is old 1920 style Spanish, so one could fear an older worn down hotel inside. This worry was gone when entering the lobby. Inside was a fully renovated modern style Spanish hotel. Very nice clean rooms and a nice large bathroom.Very nice pool and pool area and also a great spa bath.Some of the staff I meet would benefit from being a bit more tentative. And my minibar was not working for my entire stay, although it was mentioned to the staff a couple of times. That is just minor flaws, all in all a very pleasant stay at a hotel I would book again.

<Content>Don't stay here.... We are just ending our stay at the Catalonia Ramblas. All the TripAdvisor reviews were wonderful and the only thing that was really good, was the location. That was perfect. Oh, also the shower was great. It was a real shower! However, from the time we walked in the staff, other than the bellmen, were rude and unhelpful. No one smiled. We were given a room that was nice enough and quiet for sure, but were a bit upset when we heard another couple check in and they were given a suite for half the price of our room. They hadn't even requested it. When I asked if that were available for us, I was told the hotel was already booked up. Sour note there. The bed was miserably uncomfortable and we had to fold blankets and sleep on them so we wouldn't be as sore. The other thing is that there was no drawer space and just one small small closet. Most of our clothes stayed in our suitcases. The breakfast was fine. Nothing great. The hotel itself is beautiful. There is a pool and an outside bar area that was nice and away from the city. We were very disappointed and my husband just kept saying, I hate this place. We do not recommend it at all. We were in Barcelona 2 years ago and find the people so unfriendly and rude this time, we are amazed. We will not rush back to this city that we loved a short time ago.

<Content>Loved the Catalonia Ramblas Fantastic stay at Catalonia Ramblas 20-22 March 2007. I requested a free upgrade for my husbands birthday and we were given an amazing room. We had absolutely no complaints, room was immaculate and furnishings were in A1 condition. Tea and coffee tray provided etc. Our bedroom was 6m sq, with separate dressing area and a huge bathroom complete with double shower. We didn't eat in the hotel at all and we didn't check out the leisure/spa facility. Great location right at the top of the Ramblas, 2 minutes walk to the beautiful Place Catalonia. Though in a busy area of the city we heard no noise from our 2nd floor room which had 2 double glazed doors onto a balcony. We loved the hotel and would not hesitate to return there.We booked with lateroomsdotcom and got a superb deal.
