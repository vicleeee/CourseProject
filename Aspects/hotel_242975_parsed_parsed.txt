<Content>Lovely Hotel; Very Expensive We arrived to the hotel by Taxi from the airport and were charged 50 Euro!! Be careful of this as it should only cost around 20 Euro.Hotel staff were pleasant and helpful. Rooms were clean however not as Fancy as we were expecting them to be for a 5* Hotel. We were charged 12 Euro per day each everytime we wanted to use the leisure facilities, this was not explained to us before we arrived we thought it was included in the price. I wouldnt recommend having a drink in the hotel again it is ver expensive there are one or two bars just across the way and an irish bar across from the Hilton hotel which is a 10 min walk.The hotel is located in a lovely area a 5 minute walk from Barcelona FC stadium and close to 2 shopping centres. It was also conveient to the Metro line which is brilliant and very easy to use taking you to Las Ramblas in 15 mins. (You can walk but it does take about 45 mins) Be aware the shops in Barcelona close on a Sunday which was a shame especially at this time of year when we were trying to stock up on our Christmas shopping.

<Content>Allways good even better this time We always try to stay in the princesa sofia when we go to barcelona as it never fails to to feel like a very special experience. This time I booked a special package with bookings.com and for 181鈧?we stayed in a club room with access to the club lounge which provides drinks and snacks all day long (the mumm champagne was excellent!) a back massage and entrance to the spa was included as was breakfast which could be taken in the main restaurant or in the club lounge. The staff as always were supper attentive polite and efficient. It really was absolutally brilliant and couldnt be faulted the only trouble is next time we will have to do the same as it would feel a let down to be just and 'ordinary ' guest!! Can't wait to go back.

<Content>Certainly not 5 Star I have to agree with what has been said, this is not a 5 star hotel, the interior is not bad, and the staff are ok. However the food we had was terrible, by husband does not eat meat or fish and they had a real problem with that (only grilled veggies). The room was a good size with all the things you would expect. There are much, much better hotels in the area.

<Content>5-star staff, but ... Hotel has seen better days. Funiture in room and lobby was chipped and water-stained. Bedding was of 2-star quality. Wallpaper was peeling off walls. Management should be ashamed for letting hotel run down in such a manner. They should lose their 5-star rating.

<Content>Barcelona Lucky enough to be visiting Barcelona on a short mid-week business trip. Barcelona has changed beyond belief over the last 10 years (since expo)This hotel has great communication and also lovely well mannered staff. I am fluent in Spanish but didn't need to any help getting information.I would recommend the hotel to anybody for a short break / weekend visit.We did not dine at the hotel, we found a lovely little tapas bar about 400 metres away (large menu)

<Content>Royally treated at Princesa Sofia This was the first time I have stayed at this hotel, although my daughter and husband have visited before. What can I say...great staff, from the reception and concierge through to the restaurant staff and chambermaids. They really went out of their way to help, especially when our flight home was cancelled, and after an uncomfortable night at Barcelona airport we returned desperate for a room and a sleep at 9.30am. We were immediately given quiet rooms, tea was sent up, and they couldn't do enough to make us comfortable. Great spa, swimming pool and gardens, and well placed for metro, trams etc. With the Nou Camp around the corner, a great base for a few days in this great city. We've stayed twice at the Hotel Arts, but this is the one for us from now on.

<Content>Not a 5-star hotel, but not a bad hotel either I had never been to Spain before, and stayed at this hotel for a work conference. The taxi driver on the way over told me it was one of the nicest hotels. I鈥檓 not so sure about that. The criteria for 鈥? star鈥?in Europe must surely be very different from the US. I鈥檓 guessing the Sofia gets extra stars because of its size and ability to cater and hold large meetings? Other than that, I can鈥檛 see what would make it 5-star. While there was nothing wrong with the hotel, in my opinion it did not belong in the same family as your typical US 5-star establishments such as the Ritz or Four Seasons.Hotel: while not 5-star in my opinion there was nothing wrong with my room. Comfortable bed, spacious bathroom (with separate vanity area from toilet, which is always nice if you鈥檙e not staying alone) marble counters and plentiful toiletries. Rooms looked a little old, but all in all just fine, and cleaned thoroughly every day. Small, but no smaller than most european rooms. Concierge service was hit or miss depending who you got at the desk. Cost of food in the hotel is outrageous! Area: If you鈥檙e looking for a central location in Barcelona, this isn鈥檛 it. There is a tram outside the hotel, but I didn鈥檛 take it so not sure where it goes! There are a few little cafes next door to the hotel, and a giant dept. store a block down. Definitely venture out and buy your water/snacks outside the hotel 鈥?the walk is worth the cost difference. There is a monastery up the street from the hotel that is very interesting and pretty 鈥?definitely check it out if you have the time. Other than that, it didn鈥檛 seem like there was a whole lot to do around the hotel.All in all, the hotel was fine, but if I was travelling for pleasure I would not pick it. I stayed closer to the city center later in the trip after work, and would recommend finding a hotel closer to central Barcelona.

<Content>Definitely not a 5* hotel Stayed here on a business trip last weekend. Previous reviews are correct. This hotel is a good 3* or poor 4* at the best. Have to say the room was spotless but I had holes in my towels, frayed sheets and all of the furniture in the room was damaged and well past its sell by date, as was the carpet.Most of the staff at this hotel had an appalling attitude. They clearly do not like the english and are not afraid to show it.Take the advice of most of the reviewers on this site and avoid this hotel

<Content>dont go there! Stayed here for two days on a buisness trip . Hotel is a three star at very best. Rooms in badly need of refurbishment. Old chipped furniture, mattresses like rocks with grotty bed covers.Bathrooms smelly with mould around taps and tiles, to get under the shower you need to be 53 or under and took about 5 minutes just to work how to turn it on! Arrived at the hotel at 2.30 to be told the room was not ready and had to wait until after 3 oclock before it was.The waiters at breakfast were exremelly slow and twice we witnessed them spilling jugs of milk/tea over people.All i can say is the few people who reviewed this hotel and raved about it have never stayed in a true 5 star hotel so have nothing else to compare to.I have stayed at the juan carlos and the skipper in barcelona and would say they are much closer to a five star than the princessa sofia . Please take my advise and go to one of these instead.

<Content>Reasonable hotel, good location for football I stayed for a couple of nights as part of a works 'jolly', and was over when Barca played Man United in the football. The hotel itself is on the outskirts of the main city centre, and only minutes away from the metro station to the centre. The room I had was clean and good sized, and despite what other reviewers have said was in great condition. Breakfast was good and buffet style. It is only a couple of minutes from the Camp Nou, so if that's why you're visiting Barcelona it can't be bettered for location, and the tourist buses that go round the city pick up from there. That would also have a down side if Barca are playing and you're looking for peace and quiet, as 100,000 people coming out a stadium are quite noisy!! I would agree however that's it's not five star, and a rating of four would be far more reasonable.

<Content>Worst hotel experience ever I travel a lot for work and this turned out to be my worst night in a hotel ever! Room was definitely not a 5 star standard - stains on the carpet, chips in the furniture - overall very tired looking. At around 1am I woke to the sound of water dripping and found water coming through the celing in the bathroom. The front desk were extremely rude and not very helpful - basically yelled at me they were trying to fix it. The water got a lot worse - it was gushing down and I could not use the bathroom. In the end I asked to be moved - they dropped off a key to my room around 2am but did not offer to help with my bag or anything.The room I was moved to was much nicer I must admit - it was on one of the top floors and must have been the next class of room up from the one I had been booked into.Checking in and out I had to wait for over 20 mins each time - a huge queue and not enough staff on.The location is not great for central Barcelona. The only positive I can think of was the breakfast was nice. I would not stay here again and it is most definitely not a 5 star standard.

<Content>tired and falling to pieces stayed here for a conference and five stars it certainly is not. Rooms are adequate in size but falling to pieces (drawers especially) and need a revamp urgently.Bar prices are expensive - a small coke is 6 euros and a large beer 10 euros.Service OK - phoned about a couple of problems but never had any response despite their promises to call back, fix afore mentioned drawers ...Location reasonable - especially if you are there for the football - but I've stayed in better 3 star places in the heart of Barcelona - trip into the tourist centre of town is 30 minutes, good connections though - metro 5 mins, buses right outside.Facilities for conferences are excellent, and these and the communal areas like the lobby and bar are by far the most modern part of the hotel. unless you are staying for the football or for business stay elsewhere.

<Content>In serious need of refurbishment Not very welcoming, rated 5 stars but reality shows 3 stars at most.Some of the staff are helpful and others don't care, certainly understaffed.Stayed at the 4th floor and in my tiny room none of the pieces of furniture matched the other.

<Content>Not 5 Stars Have recently stayed at the Princesa Sofia on a business trip and if I had been personally paying would have been very upset with the experience. The hotel does provide all of the usual 5 star luxuries ie bath robes etc and the food was pretty good but it is in very serious need of updating and refurb, it feels very 80's and worn out.The check in was ok but no instructions on where to insert the room card to activate the power and after a few minutes of fumbling in the dark located the slot. The lifts were speedy enough but made some very worrying noises.My room on the 11th floor was large and had a good city view but the carpet was stained and in some areas worn out.The bathroom was not cleaned properly with the previous occupants hair both in the sink and on the floor. The whole bathroom area was old with cracked tiles damaged internal door,broken shower head and a shower curtain that looked like it had seen better days with the wall mounted hair dryer broken and un usable.My advice is if you are paying yourself find somewhere else to stay.

<Content>Not a 5 Star Hotel The star ratings of course relate to the overall hotel and not the room standard which is a shame as the room was very disappointing - tired decor and average, more like an English 3 starHowever, the restaurant, in particular the breakfast buffet, was very good and the service excellentVery disappointed at the fee to use the pool area, which again, was tired and dated. 12 euros per person.The bar and restaurant weren't cheap but we expected that due to the star rating, the choice, service and comfort were excellentA little distance from the Rambla which actually worked well for us as it felt unsafe at night and much safer in the hotel area of the City. Taxis were reasonable and the tram was easy to catch -right outside hotel although we found it difficult working the tarif out!Visit the Market area off the Rambla and the historic buildings in the day, which are interestingWe took a tour on the open top bus which was 20 euros per person for a full day and we visited the old Spanish town which was great but again, expensive as we had to pay to gain entry c.10 euros each and then we got off the bus to visit the acquarium where there was a charge again. Its just as well it rained and we didn't stop off at other attractions as the monies were running out! Not good value for the day but if you want to see Barcelona there's not many options really All in all, Barcelona is a great City but be warned, its City prices we wouldn't pay for 5 star again in Spain

<Content>Time for a revamp I am not sure what the requirements are for being considered a 5* hotel. I am sure the Princesa Sofia hotel gets a tick in each category but I couldnt help but feeling that every item of furniture in the hotel belonged in the early 90's.Everything seemed old, worn, colours faded. I stayed on the 10th floor.The room was good for a 3 or maybe 4 star. I would describe it as plain. Bathroom was ok - usual bath/shower combo - probably the best part of the room. I thought 5.50 euros for a Coke from the minibar was excessive but I didnt fall for that trap.The rest of hotel was much of the same. Very large hotel with plenty of staff to greet you, all dressed very smartly to welcome you before you go through the doors, after you get in, while you walk to the from desk and finally once you get to the front desk.They were helpful enough though so no compaints but the place did feel a little pretentious - just a little to grand.The location is reasonable - depending on what you want to do.La Ramblas is a 10 minute taxi that will cost about 8 euros. Not walkable. I didnt try public transport.There are alot of shops in the area - about a 5/10 min walk and there are shopping centers, resturants and quite a vibey retail area on Avenue Diagnal. Camp Nou football stadium is a 10 minutes walk.As a tourist I would stay closer to to the coast next time - just a little far for what my intentions were. More suited to business travellers I would think.

<Content>Nice stay. 3* rooms not 5* Spent 3 days in Dec 07. Rooms were fine, nice bathroom but expected more for a 5*. Didn't use pool or bar so can't comment, nice places close by for a bite or beer and half the cost. Public transport no problem, tram stop, bus stop right outside and metro 100metres away.Cost 6.50 euros for a T-Dia ticket which gave us 10 trips on the metro, bus, trams, great system. 22 euros taxi from airport. Good location for upmarket shopping. Staff were very good great english and very professional. I would recommend this hotel.

<Content>My experience better than most I was somewhat hesitant given some of the overwhelmingly negative reviews written here as well as one from a colleague whom had stayed here recently. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I found the front desk staff to be professional and courteous and they attempted to satisfy my requests. They weren't overly friendly but I found nothing negative about their behavior as some reviewers did.My chief complaint about the hotel is the 26euro/day internet charge (which is about $40 USD about now). This really is outrageous. I stayed at the hotel for six nights and wasn't about to pay this, even though my company was picking up the tab. I was attending a conference for three days a short distance away and just used the (free) internet access there. On a couple of occasions, I went down to the business center late at night and asked if I could send an e-mail or check my flights. I was told of course. Other people did go and sign up and pay. Had I said I wanted to use a machine for a half hour or more, I suspect I would have had to pay as well.My room was o.k. Beware that the mattresses are very hard, although Islept quite well. I was not bothered by any noise, but I sleep with earplugs anyway :-) The bathroom was quite nice and there was a powerful shower head which I really appreciate. The overflow drain attachment on the tub wall was not secured and dropped out a couple of times - don't know why they didn't fix it - but it didn't bother me that much. The vanity was marble and the lighting in the bathroom was nice. The overall condition was good, but could stand some touching up.The furniture was a bit dated, but o.k. Also, the carpet, although not filthy as some reviewers stated, was a bit worn and a little dingy.I had difficulty turning on the lights when I first entered the room. It turns out you have to insert your room key card in a slot just inside the room when you enter. Otherwise, the lights and outlets are disabled. This is a neat energy saving device that other hotels should adopt. When you leave your room and take out the key card, the lights all go out. (Another advantage is you never have to hunt around your room for your key card before you leave - it's always in the slot).The breakfast buffet (included in my room rate) was absolutely wonderful. Smoked salmon, eggs, breads, fresh fruit, cereals, fresh juices, coffee, champagne!, mineral water, .... I looked forward to this everyday.Also, a similar lunch buffet is also very good. I don't think it was included in my room rate, but the one day I went in there and tried to ask the waitress for a bill she simply shook her head and shooed me away. Nice.I rented a bicycle during the whole stay. The porters and the concierge were absolutely great about locking the bike up every night in the baggage room and getting it for me in the morning. Theyalso were very helpful when the bike rental guy was unable to pickup the bike on time - they held on to it for me to deliver safely to himwhen he showed up later.All in all a very pleasant experience -- but still wish they internetservice was included (and the pool as well -- that was 12euros extra/day - so I didn't step foot in it).

<Content>Very close to the stadium I stayed at the Prencesa Sofia hotel for two nights. I stayed in the business room on the 10th floor...The room was spacious but outdated. The furniture should be changed. The bathroom was good and spacious too but the bathtub was little old. Barcelona stadium is less than 5 minutes walking and my room has a stadium view. The breakfast was really nice and the waiters were quick and helpful. The hotel is 20 minutes by bus to the city center. The local transportation is available all the time and the bus stop is just out the hotel's door. The area is really quite and unlike the hustle and bustle of the city center but there are many restaurants and shops within walking distance.

<Content>Good 4 star, but certainly not 5 star This is a tower block hotel which houses a significant number of meeting rooms, mostly in the basement. It is five minutes walk to Maria Christina metro station, and from there it is about 20 minutes to the Ramblas/Harbour (direct). There is also a tram and many bus routes from directly outside. It is also just a short walk to the football stadium.The hotel is classified as a five star, but I would rate it as a good four star. There is porterage/concierge service and a grand foyer, but the desk staff were very slow and decidedly grumpy. The gym, pool and internet were not included in the room rate we had, which was for a conference.The room was a fairly standard size, but the bathroom was slightly larger than normal, and came with a bidet. Both room and bathroom were well fitted.The restaurant serves an excellent breakfast buffet, and a rather nice desert buffet too. However prices for the evening meal, bar snacks and buffet were rather expensive.Overall, it is a four star hotel pretending to be a five star. It was let down by very grumpy and slow desk service, lack of inclusive room services and expensive restaurant prices.

<Content>Parading as a five star hotel. It is clear that the Princesa Sofia tries to be a five star hotel but it lets itself down on the following points:- There was no turn down at night, which we have come to expect in European five star hotels.- There was hair on the floor of the bathroom.- Members of our group complained of dirty carpets in their rooms- The plumbing in the bath and shower was faulty.- Any use of a bathroom within the hotel could be heard from all rooms.However, the rooms were spacious and well appointed. Many facilities were on offer throught the hotel including onsite ATM's and business centre. We also found the breakfast selection to be expansive. This is not a five star tourist hotel but it does cater very well for business travellers or those staying for a short period of time.

<Content>Highly Recommended Hotel We stayed here for two nights in May, and had a very positive experienceOur room was on the 11th floor with a fantastic city view (lifts were frequent and quick). The room was small but had everything we needed, and the bed was really comfortable. Bathroom was fully marbled and the shower was powerful with plenty of hot water. Everything was clean, as you would expect from a hotel of this standard. If staying here with children, I would recommend monitoring their access to the TV 鈥?some easily accessible channels were not suitable for their viewing.The hotel has a business centre where you can use the internet for free (4 computers) by giving your room number 鈥?really convenient. There is also in-room Wi-Fi (for a fee).Lobby very impressive and doormen very attentive. I didn鈥檛 try the restaurants or any other services, so cannot comment on those.Although the hotel is not right in the centre of Barcelona, it is on the main Avenue Diagonal so it is easy to get in an out. It is situated a 5 minute walk from the Maria Christina metro station, which is on Line 3. This takes you straight to the Placa de Catalunya stop (Top of La Rambla) in about 20-25 minutes. Plus the metro is air-conditioned 鈥?so much better than London! The 鈥淏us Turistic鈥?tourist tour bus also goes right past the hotel, which is a really convenient mode of transport.For football fans, this hotel is moments away from Nou Camp, the Barcelona FC stadium. There wasn鈥檛 a match on the weekend that we were there though.All in all, a great hotel. I would go back!

<Content>Good Hotel Just returned after a week vacation with the kids at this hotel. We took Junior suite + interconnected double room so we had plenty of space.The rooms were clean and comfortable.We had free access to the club lounge and it was real pleasure with the free internet access food and drinks there.We also had free access to the spa center and used the (big) pool, Jacuzzi and (big) gym.Breakfast was ok and the staff was helpful and nice.On the other side I can say that the hotel is not cheap, especially the charge for laundry, DVD in the room, and also room service menu can be better.The bottom line - this is a good 5 star hotel, nothing fancy, not too modern, but reasonable good quality hotel option in Barcelona.

<Content>Excellent for business, close to the Stadium. It is a modern hotel not a boutique one. I've been to this hotel 3 times in the last 7 years all the times for business purposes. The hotel is not in the center but the is the metro station very close by.Is in the Barcellona FC soccer team area since the Camp Nou is in walking distance, as well as the training area. So if you like soccer this is the place to go. Once occurred to me seat at the bar next to 2 brasilians playing at that time in the team.From the airport is about 15 minutes by cab. The rooms are big, clean and have all the conforts you might need.

<Content>A bit disappointed My husband and I chose this hotel because we like higher standard properties and this was a good deal. The hotel was very clean and the staff friendly. The Metro stop is a 5 minute walk and it is a very easy trip to the center of old Barcelona. What made this stay so difficult was the fact that the beds in the hotel are VERY, VERY FIRM...it's like sleeping on the floor!! Both of our backs were killing us after 3 nights sleeping here! Also, we could hear a baby crying in the room above us ALL NIGHT LONG, so the floors did not drown out the noises from upstairs at all. Even the toddler walking on the floor upstairs was amplified and was loud. We loved Barcelona, but with the exception of seeing one of Gaudi's works (literally across the street!) we wouldn't stay here again.

<Content>Had a wonderful time! My husband booked a long weekend break to celebrate my 40th birthday and arranged for my family and his parents to come too, a group of 15 people. The hotel was decorated for Christmas, with lights on the outside of the building and a large tree in the foyer. The staff were polite, very helpful and pleasant, and nothing seemed to be a problem. We ate in the hotel restaurant on the first night which we thought would be quite expensive but, given the vast selection of food in the buffet, turned out to be the best value evening meal we had all weekend! The bar prices were expensive, as was breakfast at 20 euros per person, so we learnt to avoid both. My 3 year old got lost at one point and the staff couldn't do enough to help find her (she was in one of the lifts). We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here, my only small gripe being the smell from the bathrooms. I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to visit Barcelona. The hotel may be outside the tourist area, but there are abundant taxis, buses and the metro which are all within a stone's throw!

<Content>Subperb Service and Staff Stayed with two teenage sons to attend a football match, paid a little extra for a club room on the 18th floor. Staff at check in were excellent , everything was done to order and nothing was too much for them. Have been to Barcelona several times but this was first time at this hotel and in terms of price to value/quality ratio i would have no complaints. Club staff even supplied a complimentry cake and drinks as i had mentioned when booking that it was a birthday treat. Breakfast was a veritable feast with even a cook on hand to do fresh omelettes etc and the staff were attentive without being intrusive. Views of the city from the upper floor are excellent and the staff and service in the club lounge is first class. Top end of city but a metro both to left and right on main avienda so getting around no problem. Overall an excellent hotel which justifies it 5 starsBill and sons

<Content>A solid business hotel - NOT in a tourist area Stayed here for 6 nights recently because my company held an event here. I would agree with other reviewers who comment that this is NOT a 5 star hotel, but it is a quality business hotel with all of the amenities that you would expect.The main thing that makes a 5 star hotel is the service. This hotel has passable service. Most of the staff is busy or indifferent. I have come to discover that this is typical of Barcelona, but I still don't appreciate it.The concierge gave decent but not outstanding recommendations.THIS IS NOT a good place to stay if you want to explore Barcelona as a tourist. It is close to a subway stop, but a LONG way from anything interesting.

<Content>cant belive some people Quality!!!!! for starters I cant believe some people I stayed here in may for the barca game v espanyol I found the staff helpful and warm I have stayed in allot of 5 star hotels and im only 22 and I think people are being slightly blind to the fact that if you stay in a 5 star hotel then it will be expensive that鈥檚 the whole point isn鈥檛 it for them extra touches food was great and the hotel is super close to the stadium the only thing I would say is if you want to be near the town this hotel isn鈥檛 for you as its a good 10-15 minute drive with all them dam traffic lights.nuffsaid4@hotmail.com with any questions

<Content>Terrible serive, stay away and save your money. I stayed for two nights at this hotel and regret every second spending there.First staff is terrible, they were so busy and not helpful at all.We didn麓t get any information about services they had, and they state that they have pool but if you want to use it you must pay 100euros/day.Nothing special at all so save your monet and find an other hotel that you will appreciate.

<Content>Good hotel, but expensive The hotel is very good. Moderate size room, very good size bathroom. Very good service; friendly stuff. It is still expensive related to what it provides. For us breakfast was not included, and it cost more than 20 Euros!It is located in a business district; but that did not bother us. There is metro stop very close (Maria Christina). There was a large departmental store nearby as well - Ingles(?)

<Content>Not a Bad Choice Stayed in the hotel for 3 nights over the weekend. Overall I was impressed - room was big and spotless, service was friendly and efficient, and value was good. We got a 3 nights for the price of 2 deal on Expedia which meant it was under 300 Euros for a double (excluding breakfast).Only downside was that everything extra was horrendously expensive - 25 Euro for continental breakfast, 10.50 Euro for Gin and Tonic, 13 Euro for a sandwich. There are bars and restaurants just outside so they proved to be the best bet for eating out!It has a gym and pool that costs an extra 10 Euro.Location is great for the football, 5 mins walk from Camp Nou, also 5 mis walk to Maria Christina underground, and bus stop outside. Tour buses stop at Camp Nou so also handy if you want to do that.Would recommend to others, but don't eat or drink in hotel!

<Content>拢50,000 euros won't buy you a cup of tea If you are reading this, chances are you are going on a business trip with work, in which case you will have no choice but go. If you are travelling independently then choose somewhere else. I was with my company , 70 of us in total. Some rooms had tea making facilities but mine didn't. I asked if I could have a kettle but was told this was not possible. Being very English and unable to do without my morning tea, I went out and bought a kettle. I purchased a glass of milk from the bar (5 euros) and left it in my minibar fridge. When I returned after lunch, the chambermaid had disposed of the milk! Unbelievable, our total bill for the few days was over 50,000 euros and they would not do the smallest thing to assist. I would not bother mentioning this small incident except that it was typical of most of the staff. For such an average hotel ,they were unhelpful bordering on rude.

<Content>Not a Good Choice for Barcelona We stayed at the Princess Sofia Hotel during a business trip in October, 2005. The hotel was clean and located next to the stadium, in a business section of the city. Not convenient for any tourism at all. The metro was just a few blocks away but there was just no atmosphere. The rooms were ok but not great, the concierge was very unhelpful and the waiter in the bar just about as unfriendly a guy as I have ever met in hotels. I got the most help from the car valets and bellmen. I thought the hotel water would be ok, but it turned out not to be. Fortunately, there was a friendly pharmacy (big green cross on all their signs) next door who fixed me up. If you go to Barcelona, stay somewhere else. PS-- Try not to miss seeing the Parc Guell by Gaudi. It was one of the most amazing places I've ever been.

<Content>Stay away! I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights (which was 2 nights too many in my opinion). Having moved from another hotel near the Rambla (H10 Universitat Hotel: great location, charming staff, modern, good value, Would Sir like a glass of Cava? greeting immediately upon arrival), I was thoroughly disappointed with the Princesa Sofia which I found to be a big, charmless, corporate monstrosity straight out of the 70s in dire need of a complete re-vamp. Either that or a bomb! A soul-less affair with no character or ambience whatsoever. Unfortunately, I was stuck there on business for 50 hours without leaving the hotel and the room service food was frankly quite awful! And there was no fixed-line broadband internet access from the rooms either. It was either high-speed wi-fi in the business centre or analogue room access only. Like going back to the Dark Ages. Bathroom not good - old-fashioned, no natural light, gloomy. Room not much better. Stay away! You can do far, far better than this place. Note my H10 recommendation above.

<Content>High rise, high prices... We stayed at the hotel for four nights in October 2004. Book through the internet and shop around to bag a mega bargain, we paid 230 pounds for the room for the whole stay. The hotel is about a ten minute metro ride from the centre of Barcelona which is no problem as metro is cheap, frequent and reliable. First impressions of the hotel were promising with a very grand lobby. Also exciting were the pilots in uniform who were guests at the hotel, yum.The hotel is impressive and we were looking forwards to seeing our bedroom which was bound to be fabulous. However, the bedroom was nothing special if you are looking for five star luxury. It was clean, large with a great view and a lovely bathroom, but bland and a bit characterless.Staff were efficent when checking in and phoned to book restaraunts for us on request, but otherwise we were completely ignored and could not even raise a smile from staff throughout the stay.Prices were sky high in the restaraunt, do yourself a favour and walk twenty seconds from the hotel and eat at one of the many other places nearby with the locals. This way you won't have a heart attack when the bill comes.Avoid the bar in the hotel unless someone else is paying else it may be time to run off. We ordered two reasonably priced brandies, and drank them. When the bill arrived for eighteen pounds we found that the kind barman had subsituted the cheap drinks for the dearest on the menu. We had a brilliant time in the best city in the world, do not miss a visit to Barcelona. The hotel is recommended and we enjoyed our stay, but if you have paid full price you may find you have been ripped off.

<Content>The Intercontinental way The hotel is somewhat off the chaotic city center, in a quiet area very convenient to shopping  subway transportation. It is the standard international luxury Intercontinental, so everything was perfect without good or bad surprises. Staff was also friendly and helpful. However, although I found absolutely nothing negative, I should say that I have found a better value for the money in other hotels in Barcelona.

<Content>Do not use the hotel phone ! Staied at the P. Sofia for more than one week.Lobby big for nothing and rooms, of course, too small. Bed Ok, but pillows being typically Spanish, i.e. salami-shaped and polyurethan-made, are uncomfortable.Staff friendly, but not too alert. I have been charged some items wrongly, despite my warnings, on my non-euro credit card and than, when they realized the error done, riaccredited from Euro into original currency with a negative difference on my account. It took me several international phone calls to have a PARTIAL reimboursement (and no excuses).Hotel telephone real RIP-OFF. Awfully expensive. After meticolous research at Telephonica de Espana I proved to them that they are overcharging by twenty (20) times. After one hour discussion, theygranted me unbelievable discount (but they probably wont like to have me as a guest for the future...).Restaurant bartenders moaning if are not tipped to their liking (not used to have foreigners who understand well Spanish language and mood).Other than that, clean, good location for biz purposes and friendly concierges who let you park in the front entrance.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel and WONDERFUL view!! We stayed for a week at this beautiful hotel. The employees were very polite and helpfull. We appreciated the room safe and the outstanding view of Barcelona from our room. Just one minor complaint - irons do not come standard. I believe there were only about 12 or so for the entire hotel and they run out quickly.Very close to the Metro and there are a few quaint restaurants nearby. An excellent choice if you want to stay at a quiet place a short distance from the tourist areas.
