<Content>great central hotel Just come back from a stay in Barcelona. We have stayed in an HCC hotel on a previous visit but it was full when we booked so we booked another in the group.TheTaber hotel is perfect for a short sightseeing break. It is within 5 minutes walk of the Plaza Catalunia and a number of the other sights of the city. The Bus Touristic is a must to see all of the main sights of Barcelona and you can get on and off when you want.The Taber is on a busy road so rooms to the front of the hotel could be noisy with the window open, but the double glazing does work very well.The hotel is very clean, rooms are serviced every day to a very high standard. Our room was to the side of the building and due to the tall building next door did not have a lot of natural light but this did keep the room cool, we didn't need to use the aircon. The rooms are very well decorated and furnishing are comfortable and of a high standard.The breakfast buffet is very good with plenty of choice,but you do need to ask for the hot cooked option which does not take long to appear. All the staff are very friendly and efficient with all of them speaking good English.We would not hesitate to return to this hotel when in Barcelona again and would recommend it to others.

<Content>Great location, nice hotel A wonderful hotel, good quality, nice breakfast and nice beds. The location is excellent: within walking distance to the city centre but still in a quiet area.

<Content>Very good value We stayed at the Taber for 6 nights earlier this month, and overall, were very happy with the service provided.The reception, breakfast room and housekeeping staff could not have been more helpful - tourists should note that a smile and some attempts at Spanish, however poor, go a long way.Our non-smoking room was clean and everything worked. There was no information about the safe though, which you pay 4 euro a day for. We also had to ask for the bed linen to be changed after 4 days. I thought that most hotels did this every day, but perhaps not in Spain. It wasn't an issue anyway - we left a note for the housekeeping staff and they were changed right away. Problem solved. It did get a bit noisy being in a room close to the stairwell, but not to the point where we couldn't sleep, and that was the fault of the other guests and not the hotel.Breakfast was a continental buffet style, staff were pleasant and polite and very tolerant when people (like us) turned up 10 minutes before they stopped serving. The food was good - a wide range of fresh bread, cheese, meats, fruit, cereals, pastries.It was included when we booked, otherwise I might have been tempted to find cheaper alternatives. As it was paid for though, we enjoyed it and it was convenient to have it there in the hotel.The Taber's location was excellent. We spent a lot of time down in the Barri Gotic, but it was good to escape to the slightly quieter end of town when the day was done. The hotel is a short walk from the main square Placa de Catalunya, and they have a room where you can store your luggage after checkout if you have a while before your flight. All in all, a great hotel and we enjoyed our stay.

<Content>An Excellent Choice We stayed at the HCC Taber for three nights in June. I would definitely recommend this hotel.We had a quiet room facing a courtyard. Our room was clean, comfortable and pleasant. We were able to get a non-smoking room. The rooms were comfortably air-conditioned and odor-free.The reception area was very modern. Although the hotel apparently has free WiFi, if you do not have your own laptop internet access was fairly expensive. After dark, there is a security guard stationed at the door which increased our sense of safety.Perhaps the best thing about the hotel was its excellent location. The streets around the hotel are very busy during the day but are relatively quiet at night. (I definitely would not want to stay at any hotel located in the Raval.)The HCC Taber is a block from a major metro station that offers train access to the airport. It is situated less than half a block from the start of La Rambla and is a ten minute walk down La Rambla to Place de Catalunya. One of the best shopping streets in Barcelona, Passeig de Gracia, is only one block away (running parallel to La Rambla). This means that there are many restaurants, cafes, pastry shops and clothing stores nearby. The two major hop on hop off tour bus companies both have stops on Passeig de Gracia about 2-3 blocks from the hotel, which was also very convenient.I would definitely stay at the HCC Taber again and would highly recommend it. Excellent value for the price.

<Content>neither professional nor friendly I went to 6 different hotels in spain for 2 weeks, this is only hotel I hated among them.When we got into our room in HCC taber, it was so obvious that some people just smoked in the room right before we arrived, even though it was a non-smoking room. The strong cigarette smell instantly gave my mom headache. We asked for a new room, then problems after another. The desk people didn't know how to say sorry, how to smile or how to be willing to help.The location is good, the room is pretty clean, but the breakfast also was the worst. I've been to big hotels in big cities with professional service, and to small hotels in small cities with friendly service if not professional. The desk service in HCC taber was neither professional nor friendly. I feel sorry for the people who hire them

<Content>Clean, modern hotel in great location The HCC Taber is a simple, clean hotel with a modern feel in a great part of the city. It's a 5-minute walk to Passig de Gracia (La Pedrera) or Placa Catalunya (and La Rambla), and the immediate neighborhood offers plenty of food, drink and shopping options. We enjoyed sitting at nearby outdoor cafes in the evening, and even found a local market for fruit in the morning.As for the hotel itself, the rooms are on the small side and have few extras (breakfast only included with some rooms, no pool or premium cable, etc), but everything is new and, as I said before, very clean. Prices were surprisingly reasonable for the area, too. Long story short, this is a good place for those looking for an inexpensive hotel near the sites and away from the noise.

<Content>Great location, Good value If your in Barcelona for a city break then this is an ideal place to stay, This Hotel is situated around 10 minutes walk from Placa Cataluyna, if you get the airport bus to placa cataluyna it鈥檚 about 4 euros, then as soon as you get off walk north towards Casa milla  casa Batillo and you will find the hotel located just after casa batillo on the left hand side, address is Aragon 256. Expedia was the easiest was to book this hotel.The Hotel was clean, but small, the room we had didn鈥檛 have the greatest view but we were not concerned as it was a place to sleep, im sure if we would have asked we could have got the room changed for a better view. The room was cleaned on a daily basis, remember to stick the tag on your door saying that you want it cleaned or please do not disturb otherwise you will have cleaners knocking at your door early! We did not get breakfast at the hotel but it was available for some 16 euros, not worth it considering you could go 100 meters down the road and have what ever you wanted in a caf茅 for a fraction of the price.The staff were friendly and helpful.To sum up great location, good standard of accommodation, quiet, friendly staff, definitely recommended.

<Content>A Standard 'group' hotel - but friendly with it Stayed here in between Christmas and Newyear. I always stay in the Eixample district - good shops, bits of park, really good public transport links to everywhere. This is the first time I have used a standard 3star group hotel in BCN. I got exactly what I get in similar UK chain hotels. I had a single room - which was quite small (but adequate) the obligatory massive TV, very good ensuite facilities and the usual toiletries. Clean, well decorated, cleaned/towels changed every day.Just what you'd expect from this type of hotel. Breakfast was fine - I tried it once. As usual, however, it's cheaper and more fun to find a local cafe - there are loads in this area. Although I'm making this place sound soul-less - it's not. It's absolutely fine and very efficient/professional but not much 'Character' - although all the staff I met were very friendly and helpful.Mind you, I'd complement a park bench in Barcelona!!!

<Content>Good location, decent value A really good location, around 5 minutes from Plaza de Catalunya, and just off the top section of the Ramblas. Great tapas places are just around the corner from this hotel, and its very close to the Gaudi museums. The hotel itself is fairly bland, but for the price its good value. Rooms are a decent size and well fitted/equipped. Breakfast seemed very overpriced, especially as there are so many places nearby where you can get a coffee and a croissant for under 5 euro's (versus the 20 euro hotel buffet). All in all, a decent, business-like hotel. Great value for the location, but not a hotel that will knock your socks off.

<Content>Great Locations It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel but if a great location, clean room and friendly staff are what you are looking for this is a good choice.I got a small but nice 8th floor single room with an unusual feature - a private patio on the roof !It is in walking distance of a lot of tourist areas and very close to Metro.I would definitely consider returning.

<Content>Barcelona si, Taber no We stayed at this hotel with my husband for three nights. The first room we got was on the backyard (fortunately on the 8th floor) and the view from the the window was very poor. After one night stay we asked if we could change the room and we succeeded and got the room with a view over the street. We stayed at the 1st floor and had no balcony but a bay instead. Maybe that麓s why there were no noise from the street and that was ok. The bathroom was very small!Last day our flight was leaving on 9 p.m. and we had agreeded with the staff that we can keep our room til 6 p.m. (leave our luggage in the room and take a shower before leaving). Then in the morning they just told us that we can麓t keep the room and if we do, we have to pay for the whole day ( we had agreeded 50 euros previously). We were very angry and disappointed because they had promised it would be ok. In addition, they tried to refuce to take our 500 euro banknote when paying although some client just before us had paid with similar one. We felt very insulted. Finally they accepted the banknote looking very suffering.And when we finally left to the airport, the staff didn麓t even say goodbye or anything like that. Maybe the situation of the hotel is almost too good and they don麓t have to be friendly to tourists? But who brings the money to the company if clients don麓t?? Very poor service :-(

<Content>Good Value Tourist Hotel I stayed at this hotel with 49 of our staff and I have to say I was pretty impressed with the value for money. The location is fairly central (quick stroll to Placa Catalunya) and the rooms were clean and had all the usual amenities. Mini bar was expensive, but that's to be expected in any hotel. We were lucky enough to have a top floor room with a spacious balcony at the back of the hotel. Others had rooms at the side of the building and the balcony was only big enough for one person to step outside for a cigarette. Breakfast was cold buffet style with plently of healthy options and was served untill 11.00 am which was good for those of us with hangovers from the night before!I would definitely stay here again, due to the location and price alone.

<Content>Good location - average Just got back from a short three night stay. This hotel is fairly average in relation to decor and staff. We had to pay on arrival which I found strange. The location is great in that it is central to all landmarks and has a metro nearby. It was situated a couple of minute walks from Las Ramblas and in a nice part of town. The rooms are small and basic..ask for a room at the back as I imagine the rooms are at the front are noisy. Its situated on a busy street. I would go back as it was in an excellent location.

<Content>Good base hotel for exploring City break, hotel base good for exploring. Taxi driver had trouble finding it, though, from information we had when booking - he had to ask someone in the end! Breakfasts quite good, but thought cost high 15 euros each, although if we had bought them on line when booking hotel, we were told 20 euros each - plenty of cafes nearby and we had excellent croissants and coffee for 4 euros for two people! Hotel rooms clean, but small and back rooms have no view whatsoever. No space to sit in room other than on the bed! Staff pleasant and helpful. Barcelona excellent break for weekend - try a tour on the tourist bus the first day, and see many of the sights before deciding what you want to go back to. Still trying to work out Metro though, not quite so easy to follow as London underground, but very clean and smart (not like London underground!)

<Content>Perfect position My husband and I have just returned from a 6 night break at the Taber. The hotel was clean, tidy and had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable. La Rambla was just around the corner and all the tourist sites were within easy reach. Transport was excellent, both the tour buses and the Metro, but we still did a lot of walking (comfortable shoes are a must). The highlight of our holiday was the football at the Nou Camp - fantastic atmosphere and so safe. Barcelona is a must for people who love city breaks, and the hotel Taber can definetely be recommended.

<Content>Ideal for us Thoughly enjoyed our short stay ( 3 nights) in this hotel. Location was very central for all the main attractions. We travelled from the airport and back by aerobus which if you don't have too much luggage is great. Therafter able to walk to most areas we wanted to see and to get tourist bus for round city tours.Hotel room was on 6th floor looking over main road but with double glazing onto balcony was pretty quiet. The hotel did have some building work going on but we saw no evidence of this.Room was well furnished and clean with fresh towels every day. Buffet continental breakfast was fine - only complaint was water to make coffee was in vacuum flasks which meant it was tepid but good selection for breakfast available.Would love to return to Barcelona and would consider this hotel again.

<Content>Dirty  We took our 22 month old son with us, booked a non smoking room and a cot. What we got was... A very old cot damaged and dirty, dirty curtains and carpet tiles which don't seem to have been cleaned for some time! The room was COLD and when we asked about heating, we were told it was switched off. Under normal circumstances I could cope, but with a 22 month old baby it's just plain unacceptable. The hotel claims to have been refurbished recently, this is not evident. Staff were helpful but we didnt get what we asked for and we could not even bring ourselves to stay one night!

<Content>Great Location Stayed at hotel over the school holiday period based on reviews from this forum. Generally pleased with our experience. Rooms were large for European 3 star at reasonable price. Stayed in room with enclosed balcony displayed on Home page. Double glazed windows, generally left room fairly quiet. However hotel is on a busy road. Shower and bathroom all good. Dryer and Room Safe. Location is the winner. North of Catalonia Square and surrounded by a quieter cafe/restuarant area. Also very close to the other main shopping street running parallel to the La Rambla. Staff were pleasant and generally helpful, however quoted online price did not include the 7% tax had to pay on arrival. Overall very satisfied with the hotel and particularly the location. Would stay there again.

<Content>Taber Hotel Review Location very good a 5 mins to Placa Catyluna at an average pace. Aerobus drops off and picks up from Placa and a taxi with luggage cost about 拢3. You can easily walk to everything once unencumbered by your luggage. Room size very good but very poorly laid out. Gets its third star for having a gym-sized exercise cycle in the room, not what you need when you鈥檝e spent most of the day walking around. Double was two singles pushed together, asked for extra pillows and received them immediately. Room has mini-bar and there鈥檚 no problem using for own drinks. Had a room at the back, so it was quiet, except that it overlooks a kids playground where there鈥檚 a lot of noise until it gets dark. The TV gets very poor reception but not a problem as it only shows CNN in English. There were only two electrical points in the room and these were already heavily overloaded with plugs 鈥?has no hotel ever heard of multi-gangs! Bathroom was the tiniest I鈥檝e ever seen and was cheeky enough to check other rooms that were being cleaned and they were all the same too, so not just ours. I鈥檓 only 5foot 2 but had problems sitting on loo without hitting knees off washbasin, my husband had to sit side-saddle. However, shower was powerful and there was always plenty of hot water. The haridryer in the bathroom is industrial-sized and only suitable for desteaming the mirror, ladies bring your own if you actually want to style as opposed to just drying your hair.Breakfast room was pleasant enough with lots of food and if they ran out of anything it was brought pretty quickly. However, we had to ask for clean cutlery every morning as their dishwasher is obviously pretty poor at cleaning off the previous users food. Yeuky.Hotel knows it doesn鈥檛 have to work hard as tourists will always flock to city and generally this shows. Would consider it probably slightly lower standard than a Travel Lodge/Inn, certainly not 3 star, but apart from the bathroom, acceptable for a stay of a few days.

<Content>Fair hotel We stayed in HCC Taber Sept 22-27. During these few days, we experienced mostly good experience with some minor issues.Good: 1) Nice location. 15 mins walking distance from Las Rambles and Passeig de Gracia. Zara is just around the corner. If you carry luggage bags instead of backpack, it might be a bit far, (15-20mins) walking from Universitisat sta (the 3rd aerobus station).2) Clean and normally quiet room. Our rooms are on 6th and 7th room. Though the hotel is on a busy street of Balmers, i didn't hear any noice at night.3) Helpful and polite reception.All staff in the reception area can speak English. They are all polite and helpful. As i can't speak Spanish, i booked all my reservations through the Hotel. Additionally, they provided recommentations for the nice dinner place and tour advice.I found them much better than the staff in Crowne Hotel in Madrid which is supposed a 4-star hotel.4) BreakfastComparing to other European's breakfast, the breakfast here offered several varieties. Sausages, different jamon and cheese,toast,crossiants, eggs and cereals were quite good. Everyday, different fruits were provided. Quite delicious.5) Lockers roomSince our departure was in the afternoon, we left our luggages in the hotel room which with a key-lock for free of charge. And we continued the last minutes shopping. That was really convenient.Issues:1) Thin wallsThe room is normally quiet. But since the walls are thin, there was one night we heard someone speaking and openning doors in the midnight. 2) No double-bed roomI requested a double-bed room for my parents. Yet, when we arrived, the hotel could only offer a two-twin-beds-push-together bed for us. We were ok with this. But if you really want a double-bed after a full day walking, you may need to think about it.3) No replacement of a non-functioning hairdryerThe hairdryer in my parents' room was not working. Though we asked for the replacement, there was no extra one which could be replaced4) No non-smoking rooms5) In-room safe costs Eur$4 per day.6) Quite expensive.It is quite expensive which costs about 200Euro per room per night during our stay. With this price, the rooms are considerably small.

<Content>Really nice hotel My boyf and I stayed here last weekend and I was not sure what to expect but we had a great time. The hotel is in a great location by being a 5/10 minute walk from Las Ramblas so is easy to get to but you dont feel as if you are amongst all the noise. The room we had was lovely, very clean bathroom and room. I do not have any complaints about the hotel at all and would recommend it to anyone. The staff were also very helpful.

<Content>Nice location Had the same crappy room as the person who visited in january -dingy and dark. the stain is still on the wall!!Did see some of the other rooms overlooking the street and they looked good tho. In the end you don't spend time in Barca in your hotel .The room apart from the stain was clean and tidy and the beds v comfortable. Top location - three blocks from Cataluya sq. V reasonable price - 拢420 for two adults and one 12 year old for room only for a week so cannot complain. Why bother with breakfast when you can walk 50 yards from hotel and choose from a number of local cafes?The staff were all really miserable despite a sign in room that guests are all greeted with a smile - not one smiled all week. Small todo with receptionist who refused to refund money for a token for internet in hotel which wasn't working. Got it back after asking to see manager. was 3.50 for 15 mins any way which was a rip off - choose an internet cafe for 1 euro an hour in town if you need internet access. In the end good value and clean with top location - just try and get a better room that we had!

<Content>Wonderful Hotel! My fiance and I stayed at the Hotel Taber on a quick vacation to Barcelona last summer. We found the rooms to be excellent and the staff to be quite courteous. We also loved the area. It had great cafes, restaurants and shops and was in a very peaceful part of the city. About a 5 minute walk to the metro, public trasnportation was easily accessible. We explored many parts of the city but were very glad to make Hotel Taber our home base. I would definitely stay there again!

<Content>perfectly located During our second visit to Bacelona we have choosen the hotel at randon and never regreted our choice. The hotel is pefectly located several steps to the line of bouleveards (Ramblas) which 1) in the evening gives you perfect chance of sitting outside in one of numerouse not expensive cafes and feeling the taste of evening Barcelona 2) in the daytime easily leads (abt 15 min of walk) you to the famouse theme Ramblas and then to the famouse historical places in the old city of Barcelona. In different direction in abt 15 min you will find Gaudi houses, and in abt half an hour of walk (mb 40 minutes)- Sagrada Familia. The rooms are convenient and well equipped. The staff is very friendly and helpful (we travelled with our bicycles and the staff found the possibility to place them inside which is really great for a city hotel :) The breakfast is a little bit too expensive but next door you will find a small privat cafe which works from early in the morning (and don't forget about the great number of cafes on the boulveard). We would recomend the hotel for those who want to feel the city from inside.

<Content>Convenient Hotel Stayed here last October and very happy with the rooms. We had adjoining rooms one larger then the other. The rooms were at the back and were really quiet, very well maintained and a nice bathroom. Teh hotel is in an ideal location within a few minutes of the Tourist Bus great shopping and close to loads of lovely restaurants and cafes. There is a lovely bread and cake shop round the corner ideal if like us we did not have breakfast in the hotel. There is a Zara close by too which was a lot quieter then the main one. ASk the hotel staff for directions. A really good value well placed hotel with helpful staff. I would stay there again as it is just far enough away from the action but close enough to enjoy it all.

<Content>fantastic city we stayed at the hcc taber hotel over the new year period and was quite dissapointed with the room that we had, which was at the back of the hotel at the bottom with no views at all and very stained walls, but as a positive i must say that the beds were very comfortable and the reception staff pleasant, the hotel was in a good position for sightseeing and what a beautiful city to do it in, if your taking a car there is no parking strictly for the hotel but there is a carpark next door to the hotel which costs approximately 25.00euros with overnight parkingoverall a lovely city to visit and can't wait to go back

<Content>Had a great time Spent a 4 day break in Barcelona in October. Stayed in the Hotel Taber. Had a great room on 3rd floor overlooking the street. We had two balconies. The room was large buta bit noisy with the windows open but fine when closed as they were double glazed, but what do you expect from a hotel right in the centre of the best bit of Barcelona. Within a few minutes walk we had fab cafes and restuarants, the tourist bus and the best ever shopping. Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a great break within easy reach of everything. The staff were lovely but the bar bill was outrageous. A couple of gin and tonics cost as much as our meal so beware. No tea or coffee in the room and do ask for a non smoking room as ours was a bit smoky from the last occupant.However apart from that the room was immaculate and very comfy . Plenty of hot water and lovely complimentary goodies.I will use the hotel again next year.
