<Content>Part of the Family We stayed at the Albion based on a recommendation from our travel agent. As a number of reviewers have mentioned it's a quirky sort of a place with lots of artefacts to keep you amused. It's only a short walk from the station and about ten minutes into the centre of Florence. What makes this place special are Massimmo and Sara, the owner and his daughter. They really make you feel part of their family and extremely welcome. Nothing was too much trouble and their friendly nature makes you want to come back again. One thing to note though, there is quite a bit of traffic noise as it is located on a major intersection, but this is small price to pay for good, inexpensive accommodation in a wonderful city.

<Content>A gem of a hotel in Florence! This was a lovely hotel to stay at in Florence, because of the warm welcome from Sara and her father, who also provided lots of useful information. If you don't mind stairs (great for burning off all that gelati) the rooms at the top are very spacious.If I'm lucky enough to return to Florence I will stay here again.

<Content>More like a home than a hotel Hotel Albion won't win any awards for its luxury, sophistication, or being the most salubrious hotel in Florence. But if awards were given for hospitality, generosity and kindness, the Hotel Albion would surely be right at the top.This small, family-run hotel is authentic, renaissance Florence. On the outside, the plaster on the walls is falling away. On the inside, the furnishings are mismatched and kitsch. But that's all part of the charm. You can't help but be drawn in by the welcoming nature of the hosts. It doesn't take long before you feel like you are guests in their home rather than paying customers. Nothing is too much trouble; no kindness overlooked.The rooms are exceptionally large (especially for Italy), and quite comfortable. It's proximity to the station makes it a bit noisy, but that can also be part of the ambience of the city. The owners know Florence incredibly well. Their advice was perfect and phoning ahead and organising things was never too much trouble.I travelled there with a group and everyone expressed the same sense of feeling welcomed. We travelled with a group of celiacs, who had special dietary requirements. Not only were they thoughtfully catered for, but the owners went out of their way to ensure that each of their meals looked as close as possible to the others (so that they wouldn't feel different). Nowhere else was there this level of thoughtfulness.Not only will I be staying there again when I return to Florence, but Hotel Albion will part of the reason to return to this magnificent city.

<Content>Clean and cozzy and close to everything you need A nice hotel with friendly hosts - thanks Sara for the warm welcome. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the train station which is also the bus terminal plus a bus stop across the street of the hotel and also only a 10 minute walk to so many wounderful places to see. Room was clean including the bathroom, no elevator so a few steps to get to the 3rd floor (I guess in is called the 2nd floor in Europe) with a nice little balcony. Breakfast area is an interesting setting...many painting and framed currency bills from around the world.If your looking for a place to eat, just walk a few minutes and you will find numerous places to eat and also many grocery stores and even a laundry mat. And if your looking for some fantastic Kabobs, there is one just a few minutes down the street (I have added a pic of the place).Overall, we would definately stay here again as the convenience to the train station and monuments plus the well kept hotel make this hotel a nice place to stay.

<Content>Wonderful find in Florence Hotel Albion was a great find in Florence. Definitely not super fancy but the room was clean and the staff was wonderful. Family run and owned. Daughter of the owner, Sara, works the front desk and she is a total doll. She's very knowledgeable about the area and gives great recommendations for restaurants. 10 minute walk into the center of town. When walking from the train station don't be scared. The streets into town and toward the river are much nicer and safe. Great shopping as you walk into town. My husband and I didn't book a fancy hotel in Florence because we knew we would be out of the room for most of the day. But this hotel exceeded our expectations because of the great staff. Definitely a good find if you are looking for a medium-price range hotel. Would stay here again!

<Content>My Third trip to Albion!!! This was my third stay at Hotel Albion and I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in Florence. While the hotel is certainly not considered fancy the people who run the hotel, Sara and her dad, Massimo, certainly make the whole experience a wonderful one. From the minute you step in the door you are treated like family and they go out of their way to make sure that everything is taken care of,. Restaurants are recommended, cars are reserved if needed, tickets to museums are reserved, and every detail is taken care of with a smile. I love the neighborhood this hotel is located in because it's far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the main piazza's, but in an easy walk to everything including the river. As a Hilton Diamond member I am accustomed to staying at 4 and 5 star hotels around the world, but in Florence it will always be Albion for me!!!

<Content>Great family run hotel We found out about this place through Le Boscarecce, owned within the same family. Sara was very helpful before we even arrived. She booked the Uffizi Gallery for us and gave a ton of information about the opera, we were very grateful for the assistance. The hotel is within walking distance to the Duomo, etc. It is a little hard to find when driving so just have good directions with you!

<Content>Amazing! I stayed at the Hotel Albion in mid-July while attending a conference. Massimo and his daughter, Sara, were the quintessential hosts! They happily helped me with every detail of my stay...great suggestions for restaurants, tickets to museums, train reservations. My room was typically small, but impeccably clean, and the breakfasts were fresh and filling. It is a nice 10 minute walk into the historic center of town, and less than 5 minutes to the train station. If you have time, take the train down to Castelfiorentino, where mama Susanna and older daughter Swan run a magnificent inn and restaurant, Le Boscarecce. It was the perfect ending to my stay. I will definitely stay at the Albion again.

<Content>We enjoyed our stay! My boyriend and a visiting friend stayed at the Albion for 2 nites, Aug 12-14th. It's quite difficult to get a Triple room, but they put us in a Family room, so it actually had 2 seperate rooms, one with a double bed and one with two twin beds. Would be perfect for a family, or up to 4 friends travelling together! We actually arrived in Florence without a room and went directly to the main train station to ask at the tourist information desk. So we weren't picky and weren't expecting the world. But for what we got we are all satisfied! The price was 120EUR in total including breakfast AND parking. It's a 7 min walk along the river to the Uffizi Museum. And maybe 5 min into the city area (pedestrian zone, shopping, dome etc.) It's a walk but it's not so far that you need to take a taxi or bus. The staff are all friendly and polite. They even tried to help us in getting reservations into the Uffizi, as waiting in the ticket line can be 3 hours+ long! The breakfast buffet is stacked with croissants and will keep you full until lunchtime. The only thing is that the bathroom was a bit small and the hose attached to the shower head exploded once...but when we told them, they had a new hose/shower head fixture attached by the time we returned in the evening. It is on a street where buses drive by so opening the windows at nite is not meant for everyone. They have air conditioning to keep you cool if you leave the window shut (to avoid noise).

<Content>What a wonderful place! While researching hotels in Florence I was quite happy with the majority of the reviews given for Hotel Albion. Thank goodness I booked a room there; the hotel is fabulous! The staff, the hearty breakfasts, the decor on every floor (including art work galore) and the location make this a gem. Our room was sparkling clean, spacious and had everything we could possibly need, including a balcony. Sure, there is some traffic noise, but it doesn't go on all night and the glass doors and wooden shutters sufficiently cut down on the noise level. I am not a 'city' person but I must admit the traffic noise did not bother me as I had thought it might. Right around the block are great restaurants, rental car agencies, gelateria, shops and nearby are some of the great sites of Florence - one can walk everywhere. I can only say thank you again to the wonderful staff of the Hotel Albion, where I hope to make a return visit sooner than later!Laura Marlowe

<Content>Great Stay in Florence My husband and I stayed at the Albion on two occasions for a total of 6 nights during the month of September. Each time we felt like we were coming home to friends. Sara and her dad, Massimo, were wonderful hosts and they were very helpful about various things we asked of them from recommendations for dinner, location of the nearest laundromat, managing to get around Florence using public transit, even when strikes might occur and under what terms. The staff absorbed the philosophy of service to the guests demonstrated by Massimo and Sara and cheerful, friendly assistance was given at all times. Breakfast was very good with cereals, meats and cheese, boiled eggs, buns, cakes, fruit, juice and beautifully made coffees to order. The provision of internet service was appreciated by us as was a willingness to help with reserving tickets to see the Uffizi and l'Academmia. The lobby bar was a nice quiet place to hang out at the end of the day. We stayed at 8 hotels in Italy and the staff and service at the Albion were by far the best.

<Content>Not so Good After leaving train station take a hard right to the hotel. A few blocks and a few minutes walk, so need for a taxi. Stayed for two nights before going back to Rome. Interesting older hotel. Alot of different pictures on the walls. No elevator so the bell boy brings your bags up. The little furniture in the room is in terrible shape. The bed was soft and the bathroom was stark and dated. The towels were what I would call a small dish cloth. Early morning traffic noise was also loud. They issue you a key which you turn in when you go out for the day. Did not eat there for breakfast. The neighbothood was safe and full of young people. It was a short walk to all the major sites of Florence. Sara the owner was nice and hellpful with directions. She did get us reservations to the Accademia for the next day. Spend time eating and drinking wine in the outdoor cafes in Piazza della Repubblica. A great spot to see the world go by.

<Content>Book it!! Delightful. All of the staff including the owner Sara went above the call of duty to help with directions, attractions, tours, restaurants and needs. VERY clean and comfortable. It is not like staying at the Ritz, but when you are at checkout and paying the bill you sure are happy. I travel for business and pleasure. In Vegas I stay at the Bellagio and the service at Hotel Albion was much more impressive. What you give up in fancy beds and marble vanities, you get back in location and service. Will definitely return.

<Content>Loud, but just great otherwise Sara on the desk takes all the plaudits! She was just great, giving reassurance and good advice about where to vist and where to eat in Florence. My room was overlooking the noisy street outside. The noise drove me mad the first night, but I couldn't stop myself from opening out the tall windows, and gawping at the crazy traffic below and the mazy junction. Breakfast was great - the dining room had a really relaxed atmosphere and there was a nice camaraderie among the visitors. The rest of the staff were really nice and helpful. My stay here wonderfully rounded off my trip in Italia.

<Content>A City to Remember We checked trip advisor for other hotels located in florence, italy. The reviews on this hotel had alot of positive feedback. We decided to stay at this hotel and made reservations. Every positive comment made on this hotel was accurate. We met Sara at the front desk, she was very friendly and very personable. We stood there 3 nights, and at anytime we had questions about dinning, shopping and site seeing, Sara was there to help immediately. The staff made our stay very pleasant. The continental breakfast was great. This was the best hotel that I had ever stayed that made you feel like family.

<Content>Overpriced Hostel We stayed at the Hotel Albion for two nights in October 2006. We booked the hotel because TripAdvisor users raved about the place. We found the owners to be friendly and helpful but honestly that would be the only thing worth raving about. The hotel is on a very busy street (we slept with earplugs in every night) and the atmosphere/decor is decidedly funky. This place had more of a hostel-vibe than that of a hotel. The room was clean but with dated furnishings and a lino floor. The bath towels were like large dishcloths. The included breakfast was fine - just fruit, juice, cold cereals and pastries. We thought that this place was extrememely overpriced.

<Content>Enojyed the Hotel Albion I just returned from a week long stay at the Hotel Albion. The staff are wonderful. Sara speaks fluent English and was extremely kind and helpful. Our room was less than wonderful upon arrival, but we were moved to a lovely room at the top of many stairs. The location of the hotel is perfect for day trips from Florence as it is near to the bus and train station. The area is safe, but noisy. We loved our stay there. The only negative was the noise from the street. The entire staff was pleasant and made us feel welcome.I have stayed at more expensive and quieter hotels in Florence, but never one with the great staff at the Albion. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.Carol- Santa Barbara

<Content>Sara R. is the hostess with the most personality There are many good things about staying at Hotel Albion. My favorite was the service we received from Sara Ravelli. My Italian is not too good, but her English was extraordinary. She recommended a great restaurant within walking distance upon arrival. Close to the train station (that's OK in Florence), our room was very large and comfortable with plenty of water pressure in the shower. Although the breakfast wasn't awesome, I was prepared for that. Italy serves hard rolls, cookies and cappucino for breakfast. Get used to it. One of the best things about Hotel Albiion is the free Internet access. It helped us book a room in advance in Monterosso. Without it, we would've missed out on that magnificient scenery. Oh, the free bikes saved our legs, although it's a little scary at first. Take advantage of this service from Hotel Albion. I never imagined that the least expensive hotel during my whole stay in Italy would be my favorite, but Hotel Albion in Florence and it's unmatched service was the best!

<Content>Finally....Customer Service! What I liked best about this hotel was the staff. They went above and beyond to help us in any way that they could. They really do take customer service seriously. All of their staff speak excellent English. Massimo and Sara were able to give us perfect directions and tips on all of the best local restaurants. Gimmy, Tyron and Nik were always there to help us with our bags and make our breakfast very enjoyable.Believe it or not, these things truly matter when you don't speak the many different languages in Europe. Our party spent 16 nights in Europe and the service at the Hotel Albion was the best.Hotel location was very good and 4 of us stayed in one family suite for $130 Euros per night which included a great breakfast. This hotel also had free internet. Our family suite was clean and spacious. Great find!Andrew, Oakville Canada

<Content>Home away from home! Hotel Albion knows how to make guests feel right at home, from the moment they arrive. When my friend and I entered the lobby on our first day we were greeted by name and welcomed with a smile. Throughtout our two week stay, we wanted for nothing and only had to ask whenever we had questions. Good restaurant recommendations, museum reservations, bus and train schedules, directions about town, shopping guides and even locations of the best gelato places were easy to come by at the front desk. The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating and if this is a priority when you travel, then this is the place for you. We even met travelers staying at a 5 star hotel up the road who preferred to join us at the Albion because of its unequalled warmth and hospitality. I would stay here again, without hesitation!

<Content>Hotel Albion is like staying at home! Come to think of it...staying at Hotel Albion might be BETTER than staying at home! I can't say enough good things about Massimo and Sara, the owners. They made my 10-day stay there the most comfortable, delightful, and fun I've ever had in a hotel. In addition to the perks of being a guest: free use of bikes, being able to run a tab on drinks and such, they go the extra mile in assuring the comfort of their guests. They happily made arrangements for many of my museum visits, Tuscany travel, and guided tours. When I got sick, they were quick to offer their help. They are genuinely kind people and I give their hotel the highest recommendation! Thank you, Massimo and Sara!

<Content>Hotel Albion, A home a World Away My friend and I have just returned from a nine day trip to Florence. We stayed at the Hotel Albion, after it had been recommended by the workshop we were attending. The rooms were generous in size, clean, comfortable and cool, but the best part was the hospitality and warmth of the owners and their staff. They all took time to get to know us personally, and catered to our every need, including finding taxis during a strike, getting hard to get tickets for museums, arranging for Tuscany tours, and so much more. It truly felt as though we were coming home at the end of every day. Sitting in the lounge area, talking to the other guests, felt as though I was in my own living room. I can't recommend iit highly enough.

<Content>Exceptional Service There are not enough wonderful things to say about the gracious family that owns the Hotel Albion. Sara and her father, Massimo, were always most helpful with any questions we had about things to do and how to get there. The rooms were spotless and charming. By the time we left, it felt like we were leaving family.

<Content>Loved the Albion Hotel Albion is a wonderful choice for staying in Florence. It is about a 20 minute walk from the rail terminal, is two blocks up from the river and at the second bridge beyond the Ponte Vecchio. This is a small hotel that is family owned and run. The rooms are large and comfortable in a typical European style. Breakfast is included in the price of the room and it is a most complete breakfast with cereal, yogurt, meat, cheese, eggs, many breads and cakes, coffee, tea, juice, etc.  Although this hotel is not in the city center, it is an excellent value for the cost. The best part is that the family who work there -- especially the owner and his daughter -- take a very personal interest in every guest.They go out of their way to make you feel at home and it is a good place to return home to after a long day of sightseeing. Most places you would want to see are within walking distance or reachable by bus. There is no substitute for a hotel that is clean and comfortable and where you know your every request will be handled efficiently and to your liking. In a short time, we felt like part of this wonderful family. Sara was always there and always desirous of helping. We certainly would stay there again without looking for another option.

<Content>Hotel Albion was the best! I took a group of 29 people through Europe for 2 weeks and Hotel Albion was the best hotel by far. The staff treated us as if we were extended family, answering questions in English and solving every problem that we had. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Florence!

<Content>home away from home the albion's biggest assets are the family and staff. i've been coming back to this hotel every year for 8 years. it was recommended to me by a colleague who had been frequenting this hotel for at least 15 years! i come to florence for business and i always stay at the hotel albion because i feel welcomed and accommodated. the entire staff reflects the kind-heartedness of the family that owns this establishment. the personal service given to each guest is never pushy. the warmth is genuine. and countless times, i've not only enjoyed extraordinary service myself, but seen that same above and beyond assistance given to other guests to ease the difficulties of logisitics or navigate an unfamiliar city. one need only ask.what it might lack in the latest technical amenities, it more than makes up for in charm and a reminder of the goodness of people. hospitality is the key to a good travel experience and these folks do it with ease and grace.

<Content>Excellent Location - Home away from Home Hotel We usuall come to Florence once a year. This has been our hotel exclusively for the past 25 years. We find everything we need here because of its' location, service, beautiful collection of artwork and...last but not least...the wonderful family that has owned it for generations. Susanna and Massimo and Sara (their daughter) all make you feel special as you walk in the front door....and it only gets better as they are always on hand with suggestions for dining, maps, directions, and wonderful advice on anything you might ask about Florence and also neighboring areas. It is very close to the Arno allowing you to enjoy walks along this famous river. Another wonderful advantage of staying here is that this family also owns the nearby Locanda Le Boscarecce in Tuscany. The staff at the Albion will drive you to this lovely place in Tuscany where you again might be greeted by Susanna, and meet Swan (their other daughter) and Bartolo (her fiancee') and the very talanted young chef there You would enjoy a beautiful dining experience here with a view that is awesome - then be driven back to Florence. This family can make your stay here a most memorable one!

<Content>My favorite place in Europe I have been traveling to Europe every summer for the last 10 years. Every year I go back to Florence, and every year I stay in the Albion - NO EXCEPTIONS! The hotel is in a great location, a 3-minute walk (with luggage) from the train station, a 7-10 minute walk (without luggage) from all of the beautiful sights of Florence, and a stone's throw from the River Arno. The rooms are air-conditioned (crucial, especially in the summer) and the charm is unparalleled. But what makes the Albion so special are the people. Massimo, Susanna, Sarah, and the whole family and staff are among the kindest people I have ever known. They are so hard working, generous, and full of ideas. They have gladly helped me with everything from restaurant suggestions to train reservations to hotel reservations in other cities. I cannot say enough about my friends at the Albion. To me, it is the only place to stay in Florence. And if you can stay a couple of extra days, ask them about the Boscarecce, their absolutely beautiful Tuscan country villa.

<Content>My favorite hotel in Firenze for fifteen years, Special Care. Hotel Albion is owner operated by Susanne and Massimo and their daughter who鈥檚 name escapes me at the moment. Great location, near enough to the center of town and two block from the fresh air of the Arno River. Many different types of room with tall ceilings and windows capturing great sunsets and they have a locked garage for those of us who drive. I can鈥檛 say enough about the care and attention this family and staff give all its guests, especially older folks and those visiting Firenze for the first time. I once left a pair of sunglasses at a store and I didn鈥檛 remember which store and Massimo and Susanne called and asked every store that I went into that day and found my sunglasses and mailed them to me. Every one of my friends that I鈥檝e recommended to Hotel Albion over the last fifteen years say it was their most pleasant and comfortable hotel experience ever.
