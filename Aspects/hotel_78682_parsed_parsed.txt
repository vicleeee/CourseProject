<Content>Awesome Place, Staff, and Food The Beverly Garden Holiday Inn is a Great Stay! We flew in for the Rose Parade and were scheduled to stay 6 nights. After being stuck in Newark's Airport for 2 days we only had 4 nights left. They not only held my reservations but only charged me the 4 nights that I stayed. The staff was exceptional and assisted us with directions to each attraction. They found out that it was our anniversary and sent a bottle of wine to our room. We ate at the hotel's restaurant several times during the stay. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the dinners were superb all at a very affordable price. The chef was amazing and the service was prompt. I would rate this hotel with 5 stars in all categories. Staff Friendliness, Staff Helpfulness, Restaurant, Pool, Gift shop and Room. The only thing that was disappointing was that the hot tub was broke while we were there.You must stay here if you are in the LA/Hollywood area! P.S. They have shuttle service to Citywalk/Universal.

<Content>quiet, clean, and great location We spent Christmas 2008 at the hotel and found the service to be fantastic. It's in a surprisingly great location. They have a shuttle service to Universal Studios, the metro is a very short walk ( or the same shuttle will drop you off there as well ) and it's only one stop to Hollywood Boulevard. We even received a Christmas present from hotel management. Unfortunately, Beverly Garland passed away just a few weeks earlier. We'd like to offer our condolences. We recommend this hotel if you're visiting Hollywood or Universal studios.

<Content>Handy for Universal Studios but that's all We stayed 3 nights at the Beverly Garlands Holiday Inn, it was easy to find as just off the freeway. It's really close to Universal Studios and they do lay on a shuttle bus to take you there, if you catch the time right that is as we found it sat on the car park most the time and it was quicker to walk, as this bus also drops at the metro station (or so we were told, we never actually caught it). Our room was of the bog-standard variety and did us for the 3 nights its a shame it's so far out of the way we had to catch the metro and buses everyday to do any sight seeing. But on the bright side the metro is very cheap and if your doing alot of travelling it's worth getting a day ticket. We did have breakfast one morning at the BG and the pancakes  maple syrup were great. Watch out for the guy standing outside the hotel who wants to sell you tours, he caught us the second we walked out of the hotel and before we knew it we where on a 4 hour tour of LA and $120 lighter. Rob who was our tour guide was great and there was only 2 other people on the trip so that was a bonus. There are lots of tour companies doing the same routes whether the cheaper ones are as good I just couldn't say.

<Content>Perfect find! We stayed at this Holiday Inn for five nights in the beginning of December at the start of a mini tour of the States. We stayed in this hotel to explore LA and can honestly say we were not dissapointed. I had emailed the hotel prior to our stay to advise that it was a surprise for my partner (this was his 40th birthday present!!) and when we checked in the receptionist wished Steve a happy birthday and advised that they had upgraded our room to a larger corner room with a fridge - fantastic!! We checked in to our room on the fifth floor and it was spacious and extremely clean. You can tell this isnt a brand new hotel but everything was in good working order and kept extremely clean and tidy. We had lots of storage space, a very comfy king size bed and a nice balcony overlooking the Hollywood hills and tennis courts. There was a function room below and we did experience some noise, but this finished reasonably early and I cannot say it bothered us. There are tennis courts, a gym, swimming pool and a small shop at the hotel. There is also a restaurant and bar, we only used the restaurant once for breakfast on the day we left. It was very nice but seemed very quiet in the evenings. Ironing board  Iron, TV (not flat screen), Hairdryer all in room. NO Safes. Parking was not a problem - charged $12 per night. Easily accessible to get to all the sights. Right off the interstate, so you could hear the traffic but nothing major. It was nice staying at this hotel, as you felt safe and it was in a nice residential area but close to all the attractions - would definately reccomend!

<Content>Good Value Hotel  My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in Nov 08 and we found this hotel fairly average. It was clean and quiet with all the relevant amenities one would expect for a 3 star hotel. The hotel had a minibus to take their guests to Universal Studios every hour (which was v convenient and it only took only 5mins) and the Concierge was v helpful with giving directions and organising tours to downtown LA, the Chinese Theatre, Beverly Hills etc. Foodwise, the onsite restaurant is OK but a little bit pricey. For decent food head to CityWalk at the side of Universal Studios (although it's still pricey!). This hotel is not close to anything else except for Universal Studios  Warner Bros Studios. If you want to be downtown and nearer to the other attractions - don't stay here.

<Content>Great Place to Stay Found the staff most helpful nothing was a problem to them speak to the staff before you book any sight seeing trips the company they use is great.Free Bus to Universal Studios also free internet connection in all rooms. Hotel is also close to Underground where one stop takes you to the Chineas Theater and the walk of fame and many other attractionsRooms furnished to a high standard by far the best Hotel out of the four Hotels we stayed in this trip.

<Content>Lived up to expectations ! We (family of four) stayed in this property for two nights at the end of October 08.The Hotel is exactly what you would expect from an above average Holiday Inn,the Staff were friendly and efficient,the location is good and the shuttle to Universal is great,the problem with the drivers/consierge trying to sell additional trips is exaggerated in my opinion,we just politely said no thanks and there was no problem ?The restaurant attached didn't look great so we eat locally for breakfast( The Neighbourhood Cafe as recommended by TA reviewers and it was great),for Dinner we drove to Santa Monica (about 15/20 mins and there were lots of varied restaurants to choose from)All in all a very satisfactory stay !

Our room had two comfortable double beds and was a nice size. There is a free shuttle bus that runs from the hotel to Universal Studios/City Walk. The staff in the restaurant and the bar were friendly and efficient, and the food was lovely. Overall a very pleasant stay.

<Content>Great Location ! As a first time visitor to LA, we weren't too sure which area to stay in and had heard some horror stories about staying in Hollywood. The Beverly Garland was recommended by a friend although the travel agent said they didnt recommend it without a car (which we did not have) - the hotel was great! Good location, couple of bars/shops within a 10 minute walk and the shuttle bus to universal was excellent. The metro was only a 15 minute walk and this took us into Hollywood - I would definately stay here again any questions, please email me [---]

<Content>Nice Hotel But With A Surprise Guest Overall the hotel room was nice we enjoyed it but there's one thing that kind of freaked us out. I know there's no reported hauntings there or anything but in room 206 there was something like that going on. We were constantly hearing noises through the night coming from INSIDE OUR room. We didn't want to say anything not wanting to sound dumb, but after leaving my husband asked me if i heard anything at night and then we started comparing the things that we herd. We experienced things such as: faint knocking sounds on door and on table inside the room when no one was there or even awake, shuffling, items moving, window squeaking, and also shadows. This may sound strange, but that's what happened to us during our stay at the Beverly Garland Holiday Inn. It's not a big deal or anything just thought we'd give future guests to room 206 a heads up. If you had any experiences like this at the hotel, please email your story to aricbell@yahoo.com

<Content>Affordable and well located Our room was clean and included free high speed internet. The hotel is well located with a free shuttle to Universal Studios, and short drives to Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the Walk of Fame, about 1/2 hour from LAX and a quick drive to Warner Brothers Studio.The beds were comfortable, our room was quiet, although a bit small for four adults.

<Content>Great hotel for seeing all the Hollywood / LA sights We booked this hotel last minute as we wanted a pretty central hotel to see the sights of LA and Hollywood.Check in was quick and simple. Room was comfortable and clean, had everything we needed. The hotel had a smallish pool and people seemed to use it throughout the day (what a waste of potential LA sight seeing time though!!!. There was a decent cafe / restaurant type place which was good for breakfast. the hotel provided a free shuttle bus to Universal Studios which was handy too.The location was great for us as we had a car but then i don't think anyone goes to LA without their own transport do they! We found this hotel very convenient and much more reasonable than staying in other hotels in similar locations.

<Content>Brilliant....Loved It We stayed at the Beverly Garland on the second destination of our tour and it was brilliant. set just outside of universal city, the hotel takes you up to universal studios free where you can catch the metro to pretty much everywhere. You can even walk to the metro as it is only a few minutes away.the room itself was good, decent sized, great view of the hollywood hills and free wireless internet. the hotel breakfast was not so great though. overall, enjoyed the stay and would recommend to any young travellers on a budget... it doesnt get better then this.

<Content>Great stay at this fine hotel We had a great stay at Beverly Garland's Holliday inn. We are a 5 person family from Norway, and had to have 2 rooms. We got connecting rooms, which we were very happy with. We were all together, and we had lots of space at the same time. We enjoyed the comfort of two bathrooms 2 TV's as which was fine, since the oldest and the younger children had different interests. We were very happy with: The rooms, the service of the staff, the possibility to bath in the pool, and the possibility to wash our clothes in the valet laundry.We also have to mension the fabulous service we got from Sonia at the Tula's Cafe. The breakfast was always. Our daughter Karianne was became very fond of her. All in all we don't have anything negtive to say about our stay. The only thing that keeps us from top score is that we never got any resonse to the e-mails we sent to the Hotel with a few questions before we arrived. If we get a chance, we will be back. All our regards to the Hotel, and to So Sonia in the Cafe.

<Content>Good location, good value, good time! From check-in, every employee we spoke to was pleasant and courteous. We ate in the on site Tula's restaurant on our first night. Menu was typical though plentiful and good quality. Service was very efficient too. Didn't try the bar area. Ate at Tula's for two breakfasts too. Again typical menu and albeit a buffet offered, we stuck to the menu as the buffet was simple.We stayed in one of the family rooms with one king and a bunk bed for our two children. Room was large and comfortable and more than adequate. Included was a mircowave that we did not use, non-stocked (but working fridge) plus LCD TV.The on-site pool looked great, though we did not use. Open from 08.00am to 10.00pm. Towels were available and always on the beds in the morning. Seemed the pool was *not* popular as there was always free beds. So if you were looking for a relaxing day by the pool, there's no need to awake at stupid o'clock to resreve a bed!Fantastic location, about 5 minutes drive from Universal City. There's a free shuttle to and from Universal every hour. We did not take this service as we wanted to use the hire car and be in control of our own timings. This was a professionally run accommodation and everyone was pleasant and happy to help. Would I recommend, yes!

<Content>Great place, great price We stayed at the Beverly Garland Hotel last July, we wanted a place that was near the Universal Studios Park, we stayed for a couple of nights and we were pleasently surprised. The ambiance was very California with nice touches, the place well mantained, pool, gardens, tennis court, etc. the room was clean and spacious, and the restaurant on site was really good . ( we had a great dinner for less money than for the greasy pizza we had at the theme park). We would stay here again with out a doubt. And they even have a free shuttle to the park, very convenient.

<Content>Think Twice Just returned from a 10 night stay at this hotel. It is in need of some cosmetic work, but the rooms are adequate. The beds are comfortable and the balconies are a nice feature. The front desk and gift shop personnel are very nice. The men who run the shuttle spend far too much time trying to sell tours. The hotel offers a shuttle to Universal and/or the metro. This sounds great, but is very limited. It does not run for about 3 hours during the day and the last shuttle pick up is 9:15pm even though the park is open until 9 and city walk is open until at least midnight. DO NOT EAT At TULA's, the hotel's only dining option. I can honestly say, I have never had food as bad as this place. After a day of flying from Mass to Calif, we went in for a quick bite. First, nothing happens quickly here. I watched 2 different parties leave after not being acknowledged. I ordered a hambuger, my son a reuben, and young son ordered a kids chicken meal. There is no way my hamburger was cooked that day!! It was old. Chicken meal was almost black, and reuben was on stale bread! You will need a car or cab to eat anywhere around this hotel, unless you eat all your meals at Citywalk.

<Content>Wonderful in its simplicity, excellent frontdesk Arrived on July 11th and spent two nights.The man at the frontdesk was very helpful and interested in our travel plans.We asked for a ground floor room and he offered us one with the least traffic noise, although the hotel was fully booked.Every question we had about Los Angeles, how to get here and there, was answered calmly and professionally .The recepion has a drawer with little pieces op paper with the FAQ of their guests; impressive, bever seen anything like it.The room was OK, not too big, not small either.A little balcony overlooking the parking, so little dragging with the suitcases.The shuttle for Universal Studios was very OK, regular timings, so no need to take a hotel close to Universal which are in the middle of nowhere except of course the theme park itself.For future visitors who don't want to spend a lot of money on breakfast: leave the hotel and turn left; just before the traffic lights, turn left again and you will see a large Ralphs supermarket.

<Content>Great family rooms We were really pleased with our room, a King Kids Deluxe. It had lots of space. There was a sofa bed, king bed, bunk beds, with the bottom bunk a double size, plus a table and four chairs. Great for a family on a trip. There's also a great gym, small pool which does pool-side drinks and food service. The shuttle buss runs hourly too and from Universal and is very prompt. The only down side is that on top of the not cheap room rate, they then charge you per day for parking - it would feel so much better if they didn't try and make extra money this way. However, we would stay again just for the room size and quality.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised I booked this hotel for a one night stay using my priority club points, this was just a very quick in and out visit from our main las vegas vacation specifically to see Stevie Wonder at the Hollywood Bowl (fantastic by the way)Upon check in, the desk clerk upgraded us to a suite as I have a platinum priority club card. For a start this doesnt appear to be usual procedure for Holiday Inn despite what their website says, so I was happy with that. The room was on the 7th floor and was two rooms knocked into one, so was spacious. One side contained the bed and bathroom and the other side had a living area and another bathroom (so they could convert back into 2 rooms easily I guess).The 'rooms' were separated by a wooden lattice panel, giving the room a kind of Eastern feeling. The decor was nice, neutral tones and exposed, painted brickwork and we had a large plasma screen hanging from the wall on a swivel pole so we could turn it round and watch from either the bedroom or living space. The bed was super comfy !To be honest we didnt spend enough time at the hotel to check out any of the dining facilities or pool so I cant comment on them, but the room was great, the desk clerk was really welcoming and also gave us a bag of free stuff, water, chocolate etcWe spent our free afternoon at Universal city Walk, and theres a shuttle bus from the hotel that picks up and drops off every hour or so, so convenientWe've talked about holidaying in the Hollywood area again so would definitely look at staying here again

<Content>Not As Bad As Everyone Thinks I stayed at the Beverly Garland Holiday Inn starting on July 13th-16th 2008. I took the time and read the reviews regarding the hotel and took everything in. Some people stated on the reviews that the food was horrible and that the area wasn't safe. Here is an honest review that I hope helps everyone from a frequent hotel traveler. The hotel is outdated and is in need of a few face lifts including new carpeting in the hallways. The hallways could also use a bit more lighting but it isn't scary. The room was clean and came with a coffee maker, hairdryer, tons of towels (we had 4 adults in our room) and an iroining board etc. Our room was kept clean and we never had a problem. We stayed in the Eldorado building which if sitting outside on the small balcony (large enough for two people to sit) the sound of the freeway is noticeable. BUT, once you are inside the room with the airconditioning on, you can't even hear it. Our group didn't have any problem sleeping. When we arrived we were asked about taking tours and we simply said that we were there for business so we didn't have time-we weren't asked again and I never felt pressured or pushed to attend a tour. We took advantage of the coffee shop and I experienced an okay chai latte, but not a big deal. We had the breakfast buffet in the morning which costs $11.95. I personally felt that this was a bit steep considering what was offered and felt that if it was around $7.95 that would be better-but the food was good. The eggs were egg beaters but it wasn't terrible. The area surrounding the hotel is safe. We attended an event about three blocks up and was able to walk back to the hotel at 11:00pm without an issue. The only issue that I had was that we had to pay for parking. Now, I was only charged $11.00 a day vs the $13.00 I am hearing but I still think that this is ridiculous since I was staying at their hotel and already giving them money via the hotel room. This wouldn't make me not stay there again, but I would look for a place that maybe didn't charge as much. The location is not far from Universal Studios and there is a shuttle that is offered by the hotel to get you there. The shuttle does not pick up at the airport-please keep that in mind when making plans. I hope this helps..

<Content>Good location We enjoyed out stay at the Beverly Garland.Location:The location of the Beverly Garland is good鈥搄ust off the freeway with easy access to Disney (took us about an hour but the traffic is crazy). There are a number of Hollywood/LA tours you can book right at the hotel. The bus stops at the hotel to pick you up and you really don鈥檛 have to travel far. The shuttle to Universal is great BUT when you鈥檙e returning home at night remember that a ton of other guests will be returning as well and there may not be room for you (which means you wait for the next shuttle). FYI: spend the extra $$$ and take the VIP Tour at Universal. Great value for money and if you don鈥檛 book it you will probably spend your day hating those (and yourself) with the VIP cards who go right past you in line and who get to get off their trams and explore the sets while you sit on your tram and simply drive by. While at the Beverly we spent a day at Universal, a day touring Hollywood and a day at Santa Monica Beach (not a bad drive at all considering it is LA).Rooms: No fridge but otherwise fine. Nice, simple accommodation. You probably don鈥檛 want a room on the ground floor since these rooms are actually 鈥榙ownstairs鈥?and really only have a view of the hill they鈥檙e built into. We started out on the second floor and had sewage back up in the tub (gross, but they moved us immediately, no problem) and ended up on the first floor right near the pool. Very convenient. There is laundry in one of the buildings.Pool: Small but nice. Always loads of loungers. Snack bar and towels. There鈥檚 a hot tub and sauna too but we didn鈥檛 use these.Food: I liked Tula鈥檚. The menu had loads of variety and the prices were reasonable. Concerns: My concerns are not so much about the hotel but have more to do with the fact that I booked this hotel because of its review in Frommer鈥檚. Frommer鈥檚 stated that kids under 12 eat free. That didn鈥檛 happen for us and I鈥檓 not sure why鈥揑 was just told that we didn鈥檛 have that package. Maybe Frommer鈥檚 should indicate you have to buy a special package to get this. Also, Frommer鈥檚 indicated Free Parking. That also did not happen鈥搘e paid $13 a day I believe. Minor things, I know, but these were two reasons I booked here so I was annoyed.This is a very pleasant family hotel and a good location from which to sightsee. There鈥檚 really not much around the hotel itself (very residential) but I would recommend it as a base from which to do Universal and see LA.

<Content>Disappointed by the beg bug We chose this hotel because it was close to universal studios,it was the cheapest in the area and it provided free shuttle service to universal studios. The staff was nice and friendly. No problem with the sevice at all. The food was good little pricey but okay. The rooms appeared to be clean. The first morning I got up went to my aunt's room . She and her granddaughter were still in bed. I noticed a red stain on the sheet of the bed the 9 year old was sleeping in. I approached the bed and then observed little bugs. I smashed the bug with a piece of paper and it stained the sheet, looked like a blood stain. Would you know it BED BUGS. We called immediately to the front desk, we were told the manager was not on site. They sent up the engineer he checked behind the headboard with a flashlight. An hour later someone else came to the room and he tried to tell us that these bugs came in sliding door because it was open and that they were not bed bugs. Not knowing that we had caught them in a plastic bag and showed him the evidence that these were in fact BED BUGS. He finally agreed to not charge us for that night. Moved them to another room. After that our stay was good.

<Content>Lovely hotel and very quiet! My partner and I stayed here a few weeks ago for 3 nights and found it really nice. The staff were very friendly and the room we had was big and spacious. It is only about a 20 min walk to Universal Studios which was great and the subway/metro is right near Universal. We had the buffet breakfast each morning which was quite nice although I wished they had more continental stuff to choose from! Our room was cleaned every day we were there - I have no complaints at all - it was actually the quietest hotel we stayed in throughout our 3 week holiday - which involved going onto Hawaii and San Francisco!!

<Content>Great value for money and one stop from Hollywood Myself and three of my friends stayed at this Hotel as part of a miniature Californian tour. It was clean, the staff were friendly and I did not notice any noise from the motorway. The reason I chose this Hotel was its relatively close proximity to Hollywood. There is a five minute walk to the subway/rail station and then one stop and you walk out right at the Chinese theatre, this was perfect for us as we went out clubbing at the Tropicana and the Roosevelt Hotel.Overall this Hotel provides clean accomodation and serves perfectly as a base for those who wish to go out drinking in Hollywood.

<Content>Not the greatest Not that impressed but the price was low so I cant complain too much. The food was absoulely terrible. we tried both breakfast and dinner and both were disgusting! the hotel also had a funky smell and the rooms were not spacious. also, the neighborhood was not the best although they do offer a free shuttle to universal studies. their website pictures seem a bit decieving. it wasnt a terrible stay but just not what i expected.

<Content>nice clean quiet for a relasing break This hotel I picked was based on reviews I had read from this website, I was pleasnalty suprised at how quiet the hotel was and when I did arrive I was dealt with promptly, the hotel reception was nice and helpful but the concierge/ baggage handlers were a bit unhelpful and alwas trying to sell us tours, when a tour came to pickup a few people from the hotel I overheard the concierge asking for his cut (not nice to see or hear) and on the final day when we were going to the airport because we booked out own transfer they didnt tell me when they arrived and didnt open the doors or help with our luggage or anything like that.good point was its location to universal studios and the free shuttle that it took us to daily if we wanted it

<Content>This place can write the book on service We stayed here for a total of 7 days at the start  end of a Southern California / Nevada Holiday. The check in was fast  efficient. The room was huge  though located at the back overlooking the Hollywood Freeway was very quiet thanks to the double glazing.  Wi-fi access in our room was excellent. Free shuttle bus service to the nearby Metro station  Universal Studios is great, as was the discounted tickets for Universal Studios in the gift shop. I can't say enough good things about this Hotel, We booked through a company called Purely America  found the price very reasonable. Big thanks to Richie  all the front desk staff for helping us enjoy a fantastic holiday

<Content>Wonderful stay We stayed here for two nights in March 2008. This hotel was a wonderful surprise. The staff are very helpful, the concierge was brilliant and helped us get to Disneyland and also a private tour of LA all for very reasonable prices. The rooms were large and comfortable, we had a balcony which was a hidden extra. I couldnt rave enough about this hotel, i would recommend to anyone.

<Content>Above average hotel for business This Holiday Inn was good for the two days I was there on a two day business trip. Hotel staff was helpful and friendly. Areas of construction were not an issue. The catering at our seminar was provided by the Holiday Inn and was good. The beds were very nice and I had a great night sleep. It was close proximity to local area attractions. Overall I was pleased with my stay here.

<Content>A VERY GREAT EXPERIENCE!! We are two young italian sisters and we went to United States alone for the first time on Feb 2007 to see the Oscar event in real life. We decided to stay at Beverly Garland Holiday Inn and we had a very nice time there! It is not so close to Hollywood and you can't reach by walk the most important attraction of the town but with a short walk you can reach the subway that easily take you wherever you want in LA and surrounding area . The walk from-to the subway takes about 15 minutes. The staff is friendly and help you to do whatever in you, for example we had a problem to phone in Italy when we arrived and they helped us to show how to do it...they booked all the excurions for us and suggested which places to see. The rooms are big, with big beds for europen people, they were clean and nice. To enter in the rooms block you don't need to pass in front of the reception if you don't want, they have a separate access and you can enter only with your key-card. They have a swimming pool. They also have a restaurant very close to it, you can reach it in a very short walk. they offer breakfast and dinner ( the only thing is that the menu was always the same, but that's it ). Beside this restaurant there are not very close places to eat or to shop. Anyway, they also have free shuttle to and from the Universal Studios. Anyway, we suggest this hotel to people with a car because is very close to the freeway but we had no problems even if we did not have a car, so if you don't mind walking from and to the subway, it is a nice hotel. And then, you are in LA, close to the hotel there are typical houses, there is Starbucks ( not too close) and Los Angeles is simply amazing!!!

<Content>A Pleasant Surprise Was a bit skeptical about staying at a Holiday Inn but I have to say we were very surprised. Hotel was very clean, rooms seem new and updated and very spacious. Hotel Staff was very helpful.Has a good restaraunt on site and is convenient to Universal and Hollywood attractions. Beds are very comfortable. Pool is small but nice and very well kept.Would definitely go back again. Great for families, a great bargain considering the price.

<Content>Comfortable and Convenient My teenage daughter and I stayed at Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn while vacationing in the Los Angeles area. We visited Universal Studios, Hollywood, and Burbank, and found the hotel to be centrally located. The highlight of my experience of this hotel was the comfortable bed. Although I chose not to take advantage of it, the hotel offered a pillow menu giving us the opportunity to change the type of pillows we had depending on whether we slept on our back, side, etc. The staff was extremely friendly right down the the security guard. The room was a little small, but clean. The grounds were clean, and there were a lot of trees around the hotel. The only real disadvantage I could find to our room was the level of freeway traffic noise. The hotel is located right next to a major freeway, and I had a little difficulty getting to sleep the first night we stayed. I purchased ear plugs for our second night, but didn't end up using them because I fell asleep pretty quickly after sinking into our comfy bed. We ate at Tulas on our second evening. The food was pretty good, but a little overpriced for what we got. Overall, I considered our stay at this hotel a positive experience.

<Content>just okay This hotel is conveniently located to Universal which is why we chose it. We actually walked from the park one day back to the hotel. They do provide a free shuttle though. The hotel is very dated is needing updating badly. It was only so-so in the cleanliness area. It wasn't great, and it wasn't terrible. Very overpriced though.

<Content>Good value for Universal Studios Great location for Universal, easy to find, reasonable price for Kids Suites which - as they say on their website - are actually standard twin queen rooms with one of the beds replaced with screened of twin bunk area. Worked well and cheaper than 'proper' suites. Free wi-fi but charge for parking.Great breakfasts at reasonable prices.Pool was warm even if the weather wasn't - nice little sauna.Excellent tennis courts.Second time we have been - very happy and we'll go again.

<Content>Good Location. Nice Facilities We visited California to see my son, who is attending school near Hollywood. The location was great. Very conveneint access to most areas. The room itself was nice and clean. Tula's was average food, I thought the buffet breakfast was a bit high for what you got. We only ate there once. The maids are a little late in the day cleaning, they rarely got there until 3 or 4. The elevators were a little slow and parking is $11.00 a day. The grounds are lovely and they have a free airport shuttle. I would stay again.

<Content>Nice Hotel with Good Location I was nervous about staying at this hotel as I had read reviews after finding out where my hotel had been booked (won a trip to see The Police in concert so all choices were made for me).The hotel is a bit older, but it's a good, average hotel. The on-site restaurant had wonderful food even though it was fairly quiet there. The on-site bar was also fun (we'd been drinking and didn't know where to catch a cab to go to so just stayed there). The employees at both the restaurant and club were very friendly and helpful. If I had o go to that area again, I would definitely keep this hotel in mind.My only complaint, paying for parking which isn't noted on the website anywhere.

<Content>Great position for Universal Studios We stayed at the Beverley Garland for 4 nights, to see Hollywood and Universal Studios. The hotel has a cool almost woodland setting, yet is very close to the freeway (but no traffic noise!)Our room was pretty high up overlooking the childrens playground, which looked excellent for the kids! The pool area was larger than we expected. The restaurant, whilst in the style of a diner served excellent food. Our room was spacious, and airy with good A/C. The hotel is 5 min drive from Universal Studios, but when getting back, be careful that other guests who have been waiting shorter than you dont push to the front of the queue for the courtesy bus. Reception staff were excellent, but lack of a concierge was disappointing, but all staff were very helpful. If you wan to tour hollywood on the red buses, you can catch one at Universal studios, but note that the bus has no logo or livery and is a plain red single deck bus.

<Content>Nice room, $11 a day to park Booked this room on Priceline for $90 a night. The hotel is next to the 101 freeway and a 5 minute drive, or shuttle bus ride to Universal. The rooms are in two different towers which seem to be serviced by two elevators, one at each end. Elevators were busy at times. Rooms were clean and each had a small balcony. We had no complaints about this hotel except for the $11 a day parking fee. The Universal Studios shuttle only holds about 25 people, and for a hotel with hundreds of hotel rooms, our shuttle driver had to make several trips to pick up and drop off guests.

<Content>Okay hotel Stayed here for 3 nights. The room was smaller than expected, and it had a smell. Not sure what kind of smell, maybe because it was closed and had the air on, but we got used to it. The bed was a little soft. For the price, this was a decent hotel that was close to everything. I am a priority member, but did not get a welcome gift. I didn't know that I should get a gift. The shuttle to Universal was convenient, however, I wished that after 4 pm, it would run every hour. We had lunch at Tula's and found it to be very good. For the price, it was a decent hotel.

<Content>Close to Universal, Loved Tula's! Loved - Tula's restaurant. Free Shuttle to Universal. Welcome gift (priority club member). Friendly and helpful staff. Improvement needed - Rooms need updating. We had a Kid's Suite, which is really just taking a part of the room and partitioning it off (not all the way up to the ceiling). It was nice to have another TV, however; there was really no privacy from the children. Remote for the main TV did not work the entire time we were there, even though maintenance did try to fix it. We finally just used the remote for the 2nd TV as my daughter just mainly watched the Disney channel.Overall, the staff and restaurant make up for the need for updated rooms.Would stay here again.

<Content>Excellent value, staff, location, facility. First time on property. Stayed 5 nights for seminar at a gargantuan hotel a mile away. Am SOooo glad chose to stay here because it had much more of a small European hotel/country inn feel, e.g., staff friendliness and guest recognition, personable breakfast and dinner service in restaurant as well as room service, responsive and friendly housekeeping staff. Actually, ALL the staff were extremely friendly AND professional! Tula's restaurant onsite has excellent food and value. I had a breakfast and lunches at Hilton and Sheraton during mtgs and there is no comparison to Tula's yummy factor, service, portion and price. For dinner one night took waiters suggestion of chefs special (duck) and recommended wine pairing--great meal and evening. Re location: it's a pleasant 10 minute WALK to supermarket, chinese restaurant, starbucks and I felt very safe. I went for a dessert and coffee walk after late meeting at 1030pm and it's indeed an okay neighborhood to walk. Stayed 3 more nights a week later in August in a different wing and here's my take on the rooms, both times on the 5th (nonsmoking) floor:1. Bldg on the far left behind lobby is where I stayed for first 5 nights. Bathtup didn't work for baths so had to shower but all else was great--room size, comfy king bed and pillow choices, quiet location (facing garden/lobby). Probably due for remodel/update in future.2. August stay I was 2 bldgs behind the swimming pool/sauna area overlooking parking lot. Think it might be much more quieter and private than first bldg. This room was larger and nicely upgraded and seemed more like rooms I get when on corporate business account. Example of staff service, efficiency and personableness:I was stranded waiting for a cab company that kept saying it'll be 15 minutes and an hour and 4 phone calls later I was still waiting in the sweltering afternoon heat. At my wits end I called the hotel and Robin at the front desk expertly handled panicked guest (me), figured out where I was, called the cab company they usually use, had me wait in a specific area and a cab arrived 10 minutes later. During the 10 minute wait she called bacl to make sure I was where instructed to be and asked that I please let the front desk know when I got in so they knew I was okay and back at property. Recommend? You bet!

<Content>Great Stay and Friendly, Responsive Staff We stayed at the Beverly Garland for five nights in Aug, 2007. Even though they had made a mistake by giving our room to someone else which we discovered on arrival and check in, they immediately took care of it, gave us free parking and were very apologetic. The hotel is lovely, clean and quiet with a great restaurant attached. In fact the best food for the money we had in LA. The pool is very nice, large, well maintained and clean. I felt safe and away from the LA madness while we were there. The rooms are adequate and typical Holiday Inn fare but clean and functional. It is close to the 101 which takes you everywhere you want to go and five minutes from Universal Studios. They have a free shuttle to Universal which runs throughout the day.So glad we found this hotel.

<Content>This hotel far exceeded my expectation This was such a beautifuil hotel. The location is in a very safe, pretty area, so close to Universal Studios!The rooms weren't huge, but they were more than comfortable, and very clean. All of the staff was very friendly, everytime I passed someone in the hallway, they would smile and greet me.The pool felt like a mini paradise. It was beautiful, and the water temp was perfect. I only spent about 30 min. a day down there, but it was just the relxation I needed.Many different bus tours stop at the Beverly Garland, so if you are looking for a tour, you don't have to worry about finding a place to go, you just stand on the curb and the bus picks you up.Even the little restaurant had great food, service was a little slow, but that only gave us more time to enjoy the out door patio that was beautiful!I would definitely stay here again!!

<Content>Super friendly staff and clean rooms We only stayed one night at the Beverly Garland Holiday Inn and we wish we could have had more time. Very convienent location for Universal Studios. Our luggage was lost and the staff at the Beverly Garland fixed us (4 of us !) a goodie bag. This was not their responsibility but they did this without us asking. They contacted us as soon as our luggage arrived, late in the night. The airline (US Air) could have cared less. Super spot and great value.

<Content>Good Hotel We spent three nights there and had a nice time. The hotel has a good vibe and this is complimented by the extremely friendly service. The rooms are not huge, but they are clean, cosy and comfortable. Also the location is very convenient, you can reach universal or the walk of fame easily by car. The only negative was the size of the pool, way too small.

<Content>Good price/performance Comfortable, clean hotel with friendly employees. Good restaurant for your breakfast and dinner. Double rooms rather small but good for short stays. Five minutes by car to Universal Studios !!!!! Some rooms are rather noisy because it's located near the 110.

<Content>Very nice, convenient, clean We had a wonderful stay at this Holiday Inn. Very clean  spacious rooms, helpful staff. It is very near to Universal Studios (not walking distance but near enough) and other Hollywood attractions. Pool was small but clean. Restaurant was great. Nothing fancy, just clean, safe accomodations for you  your family and friends.

<Content>Third time around This is our third visit to this property, and have truly enjoyed each and everyone. Yes, the rooms could certaintly use an update, however, the service makes up for it. EVERYONE... from the front desk ( Monika, Chris,etc. ) to the bartender, Shannon, was wonderful. Margo in the giftshop was especially helpful. She was such a joy while we were at the pool, attending to our every need. Please have dinner at their restaurant, Tula's. The Yankee Pot Roast is the best I've ever tasted, and I'm really picky! I am always surprised at how many locals patronize this property for the restaurant  bar. That says a lot!!! Will I stay here again? You bet! By the way, the El Dorado bldg. overlooks the courtyard  pool if you request rooms 505-510. 508 is the best!!! Go  have fun, the FREE Universal shuttle is awesome, whether you're going into the park or just having fun on the CityWalk.

<Content>not so good! We checked in for a weekend at $176.00 per night. plus $11 to park each night. We had Cockroaches in our room and the carpet was so dankand nasty that you wouldn't dare walk on it bare foot (not that you would in any hotel). The burger from room service was good. Monday the rate fell to $149.00 a night. The kicker for me was as we were leaving they wouldn't let me use their luggage cart (without a bell hop, who was busy). As we were driving out of the gated parking lot (not for security, but to control $$) my card wouldn't work and the arm would not raise. We went to the Best Western Carriage Inn in Sherman Oaks. $114.00 a night and 5 times cleaner, rooms came with a fridge and the employees were great. Even if you are going to Universal everyday, I would stay at the Best Western and drive!!

<Content>Good place for a night or two in Hollywood! Stayed here for a night in April 2007 prior to flying back to the UK. Chose it mainly for proximity to Universal.This hotel is absolutely fine for a night or 2. It is dated and in need of some money spending on it but it is clean and tidy. Good level of in room amenities and security is good. On site coffeee shop and small store. The hotel runs a free shuttle to Universal and there are set times to and back. But, we found that you could ask for a special trip or additional trip and the guys were happy to oblige - fantastic service (a cab is $6 each way).As we only stayed for a night did not venture out and about. Drive to LAX is 60 minutes at 4pm and is easy - the Holiday Inn website will let you find and print directions).Car park at hotel $11 a day.Overall, it's not the best hotel I haver ever stayed in but it serves a purpose and I would stay again.

<Content>A Pleasant Surprise! I wasn't quite sure what to expect at the Beverly Garland, but it was definitely better than I thought it would be after reading some of the reviews posted here. The overall impression that greeted me on arriving was that it was quite dated. The Reception Staff were very helpful, and the staff in the Gift/Tour shop were extremely friendly and helpful. The room, on first impressions, was pretty cramped, but adequate, clean, and comfortable. We were put in the annex building which overlooked the freeway. The noise wasn't a problem, unless you left the balcony door open. The complimentry Wi-Fi connection for my laptop was excellent. We had a toilet blockage, but the Maintenance man was there within 10 minutes to fix it (this was at 10 PM). The restaurant at the front (Tula's) served some excellent food, and had an outdoor area where you could eat / drink when the weather was nice..which we did. You could also order room service from here. You would definitely need a car if you wanted to go shopping, as the nearest Mall was about 10 mins away by car and the hotel is a bit isolated, unless you are planning to go to Universal (the hotel runs a regular free shuttle throughout the day). We were only here for two nights as a stopover travelling from Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, and we did a tour to Tijuana on one day (which is another story), so did not feel the need to hire a car. Overall, it was OK.

<Content>Noisy! Not the place to stay if you want to sleep. The rooms were well kept. They are actually what a Holiday Inn should look like. Unfortunately, the ajoining door between rooms was the source of major niose. The next door neighbors were watching TV all night. I wouldn't have made much of it, but with thin walls and with an ajoining door, we could hear everything. The TV was on all last night there. I even tried to put a towel under the door. It didn't work. I was up until 5am. The housekeeping service also knocks on the door at 9:30am. When you get less than 5 hours of sleep, housekeeping are the last people you want to see. Also my key cards did not work the second night. When I went to the desk, they were 'fixed but when I tried again, only one worked. The staff was not overly friendly. I had to ask for my rewards perks, even though it should say so in the computer. The plus of the stay was the lady in the gift shop. She knew all about the tours and which would best suite us. She even wanted to save us money. Be prepaired to pay for parking. With AAA=$9, without =$11.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Excellent Service Was looking for a hotel that was convenient to Universal Hollywood, but didn't want to be right there next to the park. This hotel is about 2 miles from the park and offers a courtesy shuttle service.While it is an older property, it is well-maintained. Our rooms (2 rooms) were comfortable and housekeeping is excellent. Each room had a Juliet balcony overlooking the nicely landscaped grounds. The pool, while a bit small compared to today's mega-hotels, was morethan adequate as were the tennis courts and the kids' playgroundarea. The fitness center was minimal. The restaurant provides a very good breakfast buffet. We didn't eat dinner at Tula's so I can't provide any critique.The staff is outstanding: friendly, most helpful, and ever-looking to ensure our stay was to our expectations. Overall, I recommend this property. We will certainly stay there again when in the LA / Universal City area.

<Content>Wonderful, Just Wonderful I read reviews about this hotel just before leaving the uk and was overall impressed and then read one about the maid service being every 3 days and head lice!! what a load of rubbish that is, we stayed here for 2 weeks and the hotel room and grounds are spotless, the maids come in every single day with fresh clean towels and linen, they also hoover up and top up your free coffee etc etc if you have made any brews. unlike some of my experiences in spain, the maids also will not come into your room if u have put the 'do no disturb' sign outside your door, i had an off day during our holiday and was glad to see they adhere to your requests and dont still insist on coming in.also someone said there is not much around the hotel area, erm?? universal studios and city walk is only 7 min walk away to the tram that takes u up the hill. the red line metro station is also on route to universal, just go left out the hotel left onto ventura and left again across the freeway flyover. u will also pass a shopping complex on vineland just before ventura blvd which has everthing u need including a kodak shop incase u run out of camera batteries etc.the onsite gift shop prices are very respectable and the lady who works there during the day is superb at helping u if u want to book tours or airport pick ups.if u dont fancy the short walk to the metro and universal the 156 metro bus goes to hollywood/highland, which u can get from across the street from the hotel carpark entrance.resturant breakfast is excellent, with the only downside being that the buffet unlike other hotels is not free and u have to pay 11.95 per person for it before tipping etc. also they have 2 internet computers in the splash lounge which u just put 1 or 5 dollar bills in to gain your desired time u need for surfing.

<Content>It was OK! The hotel seems a little dated at first impression - but our room was just fine. The king bed was very comfortable and so were the towels.We stayed two nights. Our basic complaint is the hidden charge for parking ($11/night) that you are informed of at check-in.The restaurant is very nice. Good food, decently priced.Would stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Big rooms We stayed here for three nights on arrival in LA. Very big room and friendly front desk staff. Safe area and about three blocks walk to Metro stop. Free shuttle to Universal studios and excellent buffet breakfast and restaurant. Also has internet access in cafe also.A short cab or one train stop to Hollywood Boulevard. We were suprised how quiet our room was considering it was next to the freeway. We would stay here again.

<Content>hated the head lice I stayed at this hotel based on its proximity to Universal studios and it was cheaper than the Sheraton or Hilton. I was disappointed with the facilities, the hotel definitely needs a refurbishment, but it did appeared to be clean. Unfortunate I got head lice from stay. Notices in the room state that the linen is changed every 3 days unless you request it daily. I guess the cleaning staff must be enforcing this rule even if new guests are using the room.Definitely spoilt what should have been an enjoyable trip to the USA.

<Content>clean, comfortable but getting a little pricey... I've stayed here numerous times over the last four years. In the beginning, it was a bit shabby -- torn wallpaper, mold, poor ventilation, etc. -- but you put up with it because it was only $100 to $110 per night. Now, since a change in ownership, it's $140 - $150 per night. And parking is up to $11/night. The rooms are still a bit dated and uncomfortable. The restaurant has improved greatly -- though it's menu is limited. The bar, however, is still a disaster. Bad modern decor. It's not friendly or comfortable at all. The restaurant staff and the cleaning staff are very friendly. The gift shop staff is not. The front desk staff run hot and cold. It's a convenient place to stay, if you don't mind the traffic noise from the Hollywood freeway. If only they'd remodel and refurnish the rooms!

<Content>Dated and nothing nearby.......... I read a lot of reviews on this hotel and instead of taking heed of what others had said, I went ahead anyway! We wanted a hotel close enough to the Universal Studios and not knowing the area, opted for this Holiday Inn thinking the standard must me pretty much the same as others in this chain but found the rooms to be rather dated and a bit musty smelling. We arrived on Christmas evening, were told the restaurant would be serving and providing room service until 8pm, when we tried the number it went onto voice mail, I left and order which never arrived so my family went to bed hungry as there is nothing within easy walking distance of the hotel.However, the same restaurant had a lovely breakfast buffet although the children were charged for the buffet but ate free from the breakfast menu.A plus factor is that this hotel provides a shuttle to Universal Studios and is on the pick up route for Star Line tours and other tours companies so a car is not essential if you opt to stay here.We cut our stay short and went to Santa Monica Holiday inn, I could kick myself for not basing ourselves there from the outset and doing day trips to Universal and for the LA tour that we took! The staff were pleasant and efficient, the shuttle driver prompt and friendly and the restaurant staff good too. If you are going to Universal, there are plenty of hotels much closer with more going on around them and they look less dated than this aged hotel.

<Content>Comfortable beds, really nice breakfast Booked 2 rooms through priceline.com for a friday night $100. We stayed just to sleep for the night, the king size bed was very comfortable, the rooms and property overall are well maintained, older look but well maintained. Two exits from Universal Studios City Walk. We didnt use the pool but it looked very small for the size of the property. The best part of our stay was breakfast. The food was piping hot and especially loved that it was not greasy. We had eggs, home potatoes, bacon, toast, french toast, fresh fruit, freshly squeezed orange juice, pancakes and omellettes. Good breakfast spot, they even served Seattles best coffee if you asked for it. Otherwise you got folgers. I would definitely stay here again for a short visit. I may even drive by and have breakfast if im in the area.

<Content>so so hotel stayed there in oct 06 with husband and 21 year old daughter. reception staff not overly friendly but polite. waitresses,shuttle bus and gift shop staff very friendly,helpful and welcoming. we were given a room in the furthest block from reception on the 4th floor. long corridors, abit gloomy and very quiet. would not have liked to have walked back to our room alone and would not have let my daughter. it felt a little bit eerie and too remote from the main part of the hotel. room was big and clean though and had a small balcony overlooking the car park! free shuttle bus to universal/citywalk and will drop off/pick up from metro too. on second day access key to complex and rooms would not work.after traipsing back to reception was told we were only booked in for one night. had to show them invoice to convince them it was two nights. finally gave us updated keys but no apology for inconvenience or attitude. hotel was quite a way out from centre of la which at first was a little disappointing but after going into the centre and seeing the amount of homeless and druggies was glad we were staying a little further out. would not return to la as second visit now and not too keen on it but if i had to ,would return to beverley hotel as long as i was with a couple of other people. decent enough hotel as long as there is a crowd of you. ask to stay in part of complex nearest reception.

<Content>Very Mellow, Comfortable Hotel, But A Bit Pricy This hotel has a shuttle to universal studios-free, it stops at about 9 pm though, it is a great big hotel, it is quiet for the most part. It has a great pool outside. The staff is very helpful and the rooms, beds and pillows are very comfortable, they have no fridge or microwave in the rooms though. It is pricy, but worth it if your budget allows for it. The restaurant has very good breakfast.

<Content>ventalation problems The landscaping was nice, the people were nice, and the rates were totally reasonable. The restaurant and bar also had very reasonable rates. However, the building with rooms has serious mold and ventalation problems. I could barely breathe in the hallways and could only manage to survive in the room with a towel on the door crack and the sliding glass door wide open. The last night someone was smoking on a nearby balcony and that woke me up at 2am (they were quiet--it was just the smell). The first two nights I woke a few times from noise. I asked for a room on the side not facing the freeway, but the other road was super loud too. Both these problems wouldn't have occurred if I had simply closed my window--but, seriously, they have a problem with the air. You could see peeling paint and wallpaper in the bathrooms and in the vending room on each floor it was obvious. I'm not sure what the solution is--again, the layout of the grounds is very nice so it'd be a shame to raise the building but if it was my house I would.

<Content>The Place to be in North Hollywood! Just got back from a five night stay at the BG Holiday Inn and thought it was comparable to a Marriott. This facility is self-contained; pool, restaurant, coffee shop, and bar all on the well-manicured premises. Great central location for touring Hollywood. Reasonable rates and friendly staff. Only downside was the[--] in the blond wig holding a mop who knocked on the door at 2 a.m. one night claiming to be the Beverly Garland and asking if we needed house cleaning service. Maybe this was just part of the Hollywood experience.

<Content>Great base for seeing LA We were very pleased with our stay at the Holiday Inn Universal Studios (formerly known as the Beverly Garland). Although it is a bit noisy due to proximity to Highway 101, it didn't stop us from sleeping and the proximity to 101 meant driving around was easy. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the pool area was great and the food in the restaurant was excellent. Altogether great value for money.

<Content>Switched Hotels to stay here!! I came to LA for a competition and was staying at another hotel. My mom and I came to eat at the Beverly Garland restaurant one day and to see some of my team mates compete. The restaurant was very inexpensive (something I wasn't expecting!). We took a tour of the grounds and then went to the gift shop. I asked the lady working for some information on bus schedules. She gave me all the information I needed plus told me some other things that were very useful. After the competition I stayed on 3 more days and switched to the Garland. The room wasn't very big, but for me it was nice. I liked the individual balcony. The service I received at the Beverly Garland was better than the service I received at the other hotel (and that one was more expensive). The workers were very pleasant!! And the restaurant was great! I didn't utilize this, but they charge for parking - $9 a day. I don't understand why they would charge for that but I think that would be my only complaint if I had a car while visiting. (thus my above average rating). BUT the buses run right by the hotel and it's easy to get to the many places to visit in LA for $3 a day. I would definitely stay again.

<Content>Excellent Accomodations Recently returned from a 5 night stay at Beverly's Hotel. If you must stay in North Hollywood and like a smaller hotel with excellent, friendly service, this is the place for you. The location is close to Universal Studios and shuttle service is available throughout the day. The hotel is literally 2 min. off the 101 Freeway. Stayed in the Portola building and enjoyed a large, spotless room on the 6th floor. The entire property is immaculate and the reception staff couldn't be more helpful. Several times, they printed out requested directions from their computer. The pool is easily accessible and is clean and quiet. Parking is $9/night - reasonable for the area.Tula's (restaurant) has a great $11.99 breakfast buffet, or you can order ala carte. Beverly's is a pleasant place to stay - and is one of the nicer Holiday Inn properties around.

<Content>scary room I stayed at this motel after reading positive reviews on this site. Overall, the room was ok but it was scary because of the lock. It looked like someone had tried to break in as there was a deep break in the door where the security latch was. In addition, the door was loose and would move if you pushed against it even with the double locks in place. When I mentioned my concerns, I was offered an engineer but, because I felt that nothing short of a door replacement would help, I decided to wait it out as we were only there for another day. I liked the double sinks at the bathroom - this helped tremendously when we were getting dressed to go out. The dark hallways and block walls added to the scariness of this hotel. Not sure that I felt 100 percent safe and would probably not stay here again. Maid service was also inconsistent and minimal. By the way, I'm not a paranoid type person so it was unusual for me to be scared at this motel.

<Content>Girl from giftshop/people from reception every day v茅ry unfriendly!! Hi everybody!I just came back from a holiday trip to Los angeles. I was on my own. I went in total to three different hotels. My first hotel was awesome; people from the reception were incredibly friendly, wanted to help me with everything!My second hotel was Beverly Garland.TERRIBLE!Even the manager, i have never seen somebody doing so unfriendly to their guests.The girl from the giftshop, what was she thinking? She showed me that she didnt wanted to help me [she did this also to other guests] and IF she arranged something, she did everything wrong [few examples:]* she arranged a tour for me what wasnt available that day. I said that to her [!!] but she said it was confirmed and this was a exception. She refused to call the touroperator for me again. I went to that touroperator by myself [Starline tours] and I was right!! They said that the tour wasnt even available. I already paid for it, and it was all a waste of time.* I lost three very important irreplaceable things in my taxi. I asked them to help me, and i have waited literal 3 hours in the gift shop, she needed three hours to make a phone call to the taxi. And, believe it or not, after all that wasting of time [I wanted to see LA, not the gift shop~] she called the wrong taxi, while I said so many times to her which one it was. The reception promised me to call the right one. The day I was leaving, they still havent done it, i have explained my story literal 8 times. They were not interested at all.* My shower was broken. They promised to send someone, 5 hours later still nobody have went to my room.Location is quit isolated. Some people who have been there are describing it as very quiet, well i am describing it as isolated.The aircondition is making a lot of noise.A nice thing is that every room has a little balcony and also a nice thing is that there is a restaurant next to the hotel with friendly people.I will not go to this hotel again. The one most important thing I noticed in Los angeles, was that everybody was so kind! Everyone is willing to help, everybody is greeting other people. So I was very surprised that the staff of this hotel was so rude. My other two hotels were awesome with very very kind people. So this is probably an exception.

<Content>Comfortable but EXTREMELY NOISY!!!!!!!!!!!! I have good news and bad news...First .. the good news... The staff at the Beverly Garland is very friendly and courteous. The pool temperature was very comfortable with plenty of towels and lounge chairs. The shuttle to Universal Studios was timely and convenient. The beds and pillows were comfortable, and the room was clean. I especially loved the overstuffed easy chair -- extremely comfortable!Now...the bad news..This was our 2nd stay at the Beverly Garland Holiday Inn. We must have stay in a different area last time, because I don't remember the freeway noise being so LOUD. I kept checking the sliding door - thinking one of the kids might have opened it, but no, it is just so loud from the constant noise of freeway traffic. My husband went to the front desk around 11:30pm to request a quieter room. The person he spoke to said no 2-bed guestrooms were available, and said we were in one of the quieter room. Needless to say, we didn't sleep well. The rooms are not cheap, we paid (CSAA rate) 144.00 (plus sc) per night and $9.00+ for parking. We reserved a 2-night stay, however we actually checked out of the hotel before the 2nd night. (We only stayed one night instead of two). The women who finalized our bill was very nice, and she understood us wanting to check out early, and allowed us to do so without a penalty for cancelling our reservation. I just wanted to go home and get a 'good night sleep'. I figured driving 6-hours home was better than going 8-hours with that noise!!! Overall, the Beverly Garland is a decent place, the kids loved the pool, and the staff is very nice. I highly recommend asking for a room far away from the freeway. Would I stay there again? Only if I can be guaranteed a room facing furthest away from the freeway.

<Content>Two Nights of Noise We spent two nights here while visiting Hollywood and Warner Bros Studios. At first glance the hotel looks O.K...My husband and I both thought it reminded us of the sort of place we stayed in as kids, during summer road trips with our families. (i.e. very 1970's kitsch) Once inside, the rooms are just o.k. Once you hop into bed after a long day of sight seeing...Look Out! It really sounds as if you are sleeping next to the Daytona Speedway. The beds are super shaky (i.e. if one person moves the entire bed sort of tilts) We thought we could mask the freeway noise by keeping the wall unit A/C on all night but it's set to a thermostat. It starts with a loud bang and stops with a thunk... all night long. It's better to just try and deal with the non-stop traffic noise. If you bring your own pillows from home, make sure that they don't have white pillow cases. Our pillow cases and one of our pillows vanished the first time housekeeping came to change our linens and haven't been seen since. We were promised that they would be mailed to us when they are found.On a positive, the hotel restaurant was superb. The staff was very polite throughout our entire stay. That said, I don't think we'll be returning anytime soon. For an extra $30.00 a night we should have stayed at the Sheraton.

<Content>Kidsuite was great! On a road trip to Hollywood with my 14  12 year old kids (1 boy, 1 girl) we stayed at the Beverly Garland Holiday Inn. The staff was very friendly (even returning my phone after I left it at the restaurant and wasn't able to come get it myself until the next morning). The kidsuite was great, though their selection of games  DVDs is extremely limited (glad we brought our own). It was great to have an empty fridge instead of a mini-bar fridge. Only hitch was not fitting on the Universal Studios shuttle the first day. I wasn't told seating was limited so didn't hurry to get in the front of the line. We didn't fit and I was told no standing and I'd have to wait for the next shuttle. But we needed to be at the park for our VIP tour time, so we had to pay for a cab. Then on the trip home, the same shuttle driver let 2 guests on without seats (standing).

<Content>Kids Suite A Plus...For Kids... We had originally booked a king bedroom and upon arriving with our very active 2 year old, they offered to upgrade us to a Kids Suite which includes twin bunkbeds in the kids area and a queen bed for the grownups. It seemed like a good idea and we eventually made it work for us with some mishaps and adjustments. This suite is for KIDS, toddlers only if you are forewarned. Basically, these are baby proofing issues that are not the norm for older kids. As always with toddlers, lots and lots of supervision is necessary. Most hotel cribs are too small for a toddler so she would have ended up sleeping with us in a normal room (hence the king). We ended up having to go out to buy a safety rail so she could sleep in the lower twin. Once the safety rail was in place, everthing was fine. The reading lights attached to the wall for the bunk beds get very hot, and curious 2 year olds can burn their fingers. I ended up unplugging the whole contraption. You HAVE to put the latch over the door, because even locked, they can get out and they are off. Then, if the latch is on and they try to open the door they could get their hand/fingers caught if the door closes. Ah, yes and the bunkbeds. On day 3, she discovered the ladder...it is NOT detachable.Now for the plusses. Yes, there are quite a few. The queen bed was very comfortable. Being able to put our daughter to bed in a separate area of the room and still read or watch tv was a real treat after other hotel stays. The restaurant food and service were very nice and other than the usual hassle of dining with a toddler, we enjoyed ourselves. The staff was very helpful, friendly, polite, etc. We got plenty of clean towels, the hotel was clean and attractive, the grounds were pleasant and attractive. There is a grocery store within walking distance if you need supplies, not just a minimart. Room service was handled well. One minus outside of the kid stuff. The terrace outside our room was on the highway side of hotel. The road noise was unbelievable. I only opened the doors once. That was enough. Fortunately, the terrace doors are sound proofed, I think. The terrace would have been nice otherwise (except I'm sure my daughter would have tried to climb the railings and I would have had to close them anyway).The splash pool adjacent to the regular pool was the perfect depth for our daughter. She was able to stand with the water chest high and after getting more familiar with it, enjoyed herself tremendously several times during our stay. Of course, most of the time I was in there with her, the rest of the time, I sat on the edge with my feet in. The diameter was about the size of a small hot tub. Unfortunately, I learned they were considering converting to a hot tub. Overall, we really did enjoy our stay. If I had older children, the Kids Suite would have been awesome.

<Content>Wonderful Place To Stay! I had one of those Traveler publications with a discount coupon for this hotel, and I made a decision to stay there until I read some of the negative reviews on this web-site, so I continued to look for a coupon for another hotel in Hollywood.When I arrived in California with my mom and young niece, we stayed in San Diego with family, before driving up to L.A. After showing my cousin the coupon book, he told me to stay at the Beverly Garland Holiday Inn instead of other hotels near Hollywood Blvd. because that area isn't safe at night. I took his advice because he used to live in Hollywood.I am certainly glad I listened to my cousin! The three of us loved the hotel, the room faced the tennis courts and was very quiet, we saved parking money using the shuttle provided by the hotel for Universal Studios, my niece ate free, and the staff was so friendly we really hated for our three day stay to end. My niece keeps asking to go back to Hollywood and stay at the hotel, and I am planning a return trip this summer.

<Content>Nice Hotel, Safe location We stayed at the Beverly Garland Holiday Inn on Sunday, March 26, 2006. There was four of us and the price with the advance purchase came to $136.00/per night...$155.14 with taxes. $8.00/per day to parkService was very quick and staff was friendly. The snack/gift shop has maps, shirts, snacks and you can book tours from there...example...tour of the stars homes, the shuttle will come and pick you up from the hotel. Hotel also has a restaurant. Later at night my daughter was hungry but we didn't feel like going into the restaurant to eat or pay high prices for room service, so we decided to place an order and pick it up ourselves at the restaurant. We placed an order with the restaurant and they said you can come get it that it is ready now and by the time we walked down there, it was ready, that was nice and saved us money.Nice, clean hotel and the location is safe (some areas in Hollywood are scary), it is close to Universal and about 5 miles from the Hollywood walk of fame and about 7-8 miles from Farmer's Market and the La Brea Tarpits.Negatives would be... The price of the hotel (but consider the area) and the hotel could improve/update the hallways.I was in California for about a week and stayed at other hotels if you would like to look at those reviews.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel. Breakfast is Wonderful!! This is a great hotel and very close to universal studios. There is free scheduled shuttle daily that takes you to universal and picks you up, as well. There is a small gift shop right inside the lobby that sells shirts, souvenirs, postcards, and even stamps to mail your postcards. They also have maps and brochures of nearby attractions and also you can buy tour tickets right here in the lobby. Any additional items you may need may also be purchased at the gift shop (tampons, cigarettes, etc.) The restaurant on-site serves wonderful food at decent prices. We had breakfast there, it was wonderful!! The price is $11.95 per person and that includes your OJ or whatever drink you prefer. The buffet consists of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, biscuits, and several other breads, fresh fruit, and even cereal!! It was well worth the price. Also, they have a great dinner menu. I got pot roast it was about $10.00 and came with carrots and mashed potatoes. We also bought a fruit cup to go it was $2.99 and had cantaloupe, pineapples, strawberries, and grapes in it鈥攜ummie!!The room are great and clean. Housekeeping always had it looking great when we came back from our long day out in Hollywood. The rooms all have balconies with 2 chairs outside. The rooms have coffee makers, irons, and hairdryers. The television is neat. It has nin64 games you can purchase time on. There is also pay-per-view movies and internet on you tv screen.There is a nice heated pool, and a kiddie pool. There is also a sauna in the pool area. You have to use your hotel key to get in-so don鈥檛 forget your key!! In the lobby, as you walk in, there is a couple of love seats right beside a flaming fireplace where you can sit and await your tour bus to pick you up.i highly recommend this hotel!! Please email me if you have any questions for me.

<Content>Garland's was Great - for the Price We stayed at Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn for 4 nights in early March of '06 as part of a Southwest tour package (4 nights hotel and air from Little Rock was about $700 for two - what a deal!). We chose this site because we wanted to Do Hollywood and Universal. The Hotel is about 24 miles from LAX, right at Vineland exit, and good driving directions are given on the site (note to hotel: it would be more helpful to have approximate driving distances included for each stretch). Glad we made the drive late at night - those 12 lane highways can be quite intimidating. The property is beautifully landscaped - nice pool, but weather was cold and rainy while we were there so we didn't use it. Yes, the noise of the freeway was constant (I actually thought our balcony door was open when we entered our room), but we just cranked up the heater (yes, heater), which helped. Bed was comfortable and room was clean. We were rarely in the room during the day, and were so exhaused at night after doing Universal, Price is Right, a CBS Studio filming of According to Jim and Ashes and Snow exhibit (wonderful) at Santa Monica Pier (it's there only through May) that we simply collapsed at night. A free shuttle is provided to Universal. We used it and it was right on time. Also, ate breakfast at the restaurant there one morning - excellent garden omelette - huge portions. Buffet breakfast looked great, also (about $12 including drinks). Free USA Today, free in-room coffee-maker, but NO refrigerator).  Our last night three guys manning the desk were rude when I asked for a quiet restaurant dining recommendation, but I blame this more on their young age, ignorance, and desire to show off for each other (Duh - like McDonalds?). Turns out we found a great restaurant nearby on our own - Zack's - turn left on Ventura and it's a few blocks down on right. Nothing fancy, it was QUIET, inexpensive, and had great food (Hazelnut chicken and salmon, two glasses of wine - under $50). Wish we had found it sooner.

<Content>Accouning person is so rude. 1. My hotel bill was supposed to be charged to my company's corporate card but instead they put the charges to my personal credit card even after telling the front desk many times during check-in.2. When i wanted to rectify their problem, i tried calling the Accounts department(Mr Cornejo), he is so rude and doesn't want to accept their mistake 1st place and kept arguing, what they did was right and they can never put charges to the company who reserves the hotels and it will be put in credit card on the person who is actually staying.During check-in i gave my credit card for any incidental charges.3. I stayed in the same hotel a week ago, at that time they did rightly and now he says its not possible and was so rude.4. Above all the worse thing is you have to pay for the parking($9 a day)5. Rooms looks very ancient and feel you are getting a in a dungeon.6. Elevators are pathetic.

<Content>Don't need to do it again Okay, but some problems probably explains it best. The beds weren't the worst we've slept in, but they definately weren't the best, if you don't mind a little 'rolling into the center'. The problem...noise. The traffic noise was so bad in the first room they tried to give us I thought something was running in the room. The second room, which was less noisey, sounded as though someone was non-stop vacuuming in the next room. It is definately not a hotel for you if you are looking for quiet. The landscaping, I bet, is gorgeous in the summer.

<Content>conveniently located to Universal Studio We spent four nights at Beverly Garland Holiday Inn from 11-15 to 11-19, 2005. We loved the location and Holiday Inn shuttle bus can take you to and from Universal Studio and Metro station. No need to rent a car for staying this hotel. we took metro bus and train to and from LA international airport(LAX), around two hours only if you are not in a hurry. Metro train can take you to Hollywood walk of fame and downtown LA or even Long Beach.  Holiday Inn cleanliness is about average. Elavator inside pushbuttons are really dirty, no one seems to care. I was advised by previos tripavisors that requesting to stay at Eldorado building without freeway noise. We simly heeded the advice.  Overall, you can not beat the location without paying a lot more than this Holiday Inn.

<Content>Needs Hollywood facelift The hotel needs to have a facelift, Hollywood style!! The rooms and corridors need to be modernised, feel very stale. They are very clean, which makes it all look better. The bar and restaurant are excellent, food very good, and service in the restaurant brilliant. The reception staff have a weary look from perhaps dealing with lots of people being tourists in Hollywood!!! One was very helpful, full marks for customer care to her. The hotel is surrounded by busy roads, which are incredibly noisy, the glazing does not deal with this at all, which proves the hotel would benefit from a modernisation programme.

<Content>Lovely hotel The rooms were beautiful and clean. Each room had a balcony and due to the low rise buildings and the landscaping, the hotel had homely and relaxing atmosphere that makes one feel like one is staying in a garden villa. Definitely one of the best hotels I've stayed in. The rooms were not cheap but if you reserve online beforehand, you can get some good deals.

<Content>great stay We just returned from the Holiday Inn Beverly Garland and were nicely surprised. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful. The gardens were in full bloom and were beautiful. We requested adjoining rooms and loved it. The rooms are very spacious. There were four of us, two adults and two children (13  6 years old) and we each had our own double bed. Having two bathrooms was very nice too. We did face the freeway but it was white noise to us. The only downer was the breakfast in the morning. It was buffet but it seemed under staffed. A bit confusing. I don't know if the restaurant remodeling had anything to do with it. Room service was available and delicious. I highly recommend the nachos. Bueno!!

<Content>OK if you can stand the traffic noise The hotel room was fine given the price we paid. The bathroom was small and very basic. The biggest problem is the traffic noise. We had expected that the noise would die down by about 11 pm - but it didn't let up all night! If you have a room that doesn't overlook the Interstate then, I would imagine that you would have a fairly pleasant stay. The location is good for Universal (2 minutes on the free hotel bus)

<Content>3 Days in Hollywood Right on the doorstep of universal studios - one of our primary reasons for going - the Beverly Garland Holiday Inn was Ideally placed; as we found out venues and attractions are spread over a wide space in L.A, it's a big place. Public transport is not good and taxi's are expensive if you have a lot of travelling to do so hire a car and fight with the traffic. The holiday Inn was a warm and friendly hotel with very comfortable rooms and had the look and feel of a latterday 'High Chaperal,' for those of you old enough to remember the show. It has a small outdoor pool and the restaurant served good food and a wide breakfast selection. If we were in that neck of the woods again we'd stay there.

<Content>Not fantastic but not bad! We stayed at the Beverly Garland twice during our holiday to LA, on the first 2 nights and last 3 nights. We booked the first 2 nights from home on the internet and got a really good rate, and were shocked to be told $129 per night walk-in rate, so my first comment would be book online if you can! (we did have a hotel discount brochure which apparently was only valid for 1 night so got the first night a little cheaper, but still double the online rate)As for the hotel, there are 2 buildings, on our first stay, we stayed at the one down a hill (can't remember its name) and the second stay at 'eldorado'. The first building smelt very stuffy and smoky whereas the second smelt clean and fresh. That seemed to be the same with the rooms also, the second being much cleaner, fresher and all-round more comfortable. I would rate this hotel as a 3 or 4 star, depending which building you stay in. Rooms were well equipped, and the staff were very friendly and helpful.I have no complaints about this hotel at all, we had no problems when there but did prefer the eldorado building on our second stay much more, and would choose this building if we went again. The rooms were just so much nicer and brighter. In regards to noise as mentioned in previous reviews, we had no experiences of this except a helicopter circling the area one sat morning, but it is LA!I would recommend this hotel. but perhaps not the other building unless you don't mind smelly hallways and stuffy rooms.

<Content>One thing after another... 1) Rooms are not clean, in my book anyway. The carpet in my room looked well worn, and smelled like a wet dog! The surface areas were clean, but I couldn't get past the carpet!2) They failed to mention the $9 per day parking fee until after I was checked in! The thing that really griped me was that they left the security gate arm up during the majority of my six days staying there. What's the point? 3) I posted a no service tag on my front door. They complied with that, however, when I did ask for housekeeping service, it was never done! When I returned to my room that evening and had NO towels and an over-flowing trash can I was irritated! The electrical engineer came up and brought me T.P. as well as changed my garbage. How embarrasing!4) After we needed to extend our stay for several days (yes, we are glutons for punishment!) the staff failed to tell us our room key and gate key had to be re-activated! I only found out after trying to get into my room @ midnight and be denied. I don't want to talk about how bad I needed to use the restroom!5) If you like the waters temp. near Alaska then this is the pool for you! My kids wouldn't go into the pool since the heated water was freezing! The manager agreeed that it was not comfortable for him either, and agreed to turn it up a bit. Yeah, right! It never happened!6) Ice machine on our floor was broken for four of the six days we stayed. When reported to the front desk we were told that they had one on every floor. Who goes for ice in their pj's? I do and it's bad enough going across the hall in pj's never-the-less down the elevator! NOW THE GOOD THINGS...1) Free USA Today M-F delivered to your room!2) Most property staff is great.3) Free shuttle to Universal Studios and City Walk seven days a week4) Restaurant on-site stays open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.5) Gift shop downstairs (gifs and food items)6) Great pillows!7) Lounge type chair w/ottoman in room/desk/two phones/coffee maker  had it's own counter, not kept on the sink like many properties/balcony/ tennis courts/ down the street from grocery store with many shops and Starbucks.8) Travel coupon accepted from magazine. Room was discounted from  $105 to $89.9) Had a Beverly Garland sighting our first day!

<Content>Absolutely loved my stay at the Beverley Garland Holiday Inn.North Hollywood Recently stayed at the Beverley Garland which was very conveniently located for Universal Studios/Walk of Fame and tours.The room was very comfortable and lots of space with a balcony and also very clean.The staff were so helpful and one of the front desk staff must have spent about 30 minutes advising me where to go,directions etc.The Restaurant staff and manager also bar staff were also very friendly and helpful.I enjoyed my stay so much and the room rates were a bargain!I cannont wait to go back!

<Content>We liked this hotel! We stayed recently (Apr 6-9) and I was so freaked out about arriving to this hotel and finding some awful place, but was so relieved to turn the corner and find a nice, shady, high-rise hotel with several buildings (several hotel building pods, I guess you might say). We went after most spring breaks were over. No crowd in the lobby or at desk. We were checked in promptly, and our request for a quiet room away from any freeway noise was given no problem. We stayed in the Portola Building, 6th floor. Elevator was easily accessible on both ends of the building. The room was large, nicely decorated (yes, not modern, but cozy). the balcony was nice to have, with chairs and a table. No screens, but that wasn't a problem. The room was very clean, inside and out. Three pillows to each bed. Nice easy chair, lamp and side-table by the balcony for sitting and reading. Nice desk - wonderful lighting. Clean bathroom. Small coffee bar area (unfortunately, no mini-fridge); outdoor sink and mirror as well as inside the bathroom so you don't have to wait to do hair/makeup. Nice pool area - heated pool - I was excited to see what I thought was a jacuzzi hot tub, but it was a small wading pool. They need a hot tub... The shuttle is busy, but if it is full, he takes them and comes right back for you. You don't have to wait another hour. Frankly, we walked home one night. It isn't that far if you like to walk. This is also just in walking distance to a very nice market complex - Ralphs, with Jamba Juice, Starbucks, places to eat, etc. I think the folks who wrote not nice things are clean freaks, people who expected a four star hotel (The Hilton is up the hill). This place is just fine. Everyone was nice. I would encourage the hotel to put in mini-fridges, and turn that wading pool into a jacuzzi.

<Content>Disappointing This was the first of three hotels used on our trip to California and was by far the poorest. The rooms were ok but the noise from the freeway was constant and the windows had double glazing which had the noise reducing qualities of tissue paper! I would strongly advise the management to replace these as they are useless.The lift nearest our room went out of service which meant a trek to the opposite end of the wing. I was not impressed and would not recommend to others.

<Content>Definitely not the greatest This place appears great on the surface, but if you're a clean freak or just even picky, you might not be happy. After thinking that our room seemed ok (definitely decorated in the late 70's?!) I discovered that the shower had cracks in the tiles and was peeling, and it was very difficult to turn the water on for myself and my children. Also, after trying to kill one of the bugs flying around in the room, I ended up swatting the lampshade and a huge pile of dust flew off. After that experience we looked a little bit harder at the room and even found a gigantic spiderweb up on the ceiling near the curtains. Totally gross. Room service pizza was disgusting - about an inch of grease sitting atop the pepperoni - we had to take tons of Kleenex and sop it all up before we could even try it and that still didn't help. Then the $9 pizza turned into over $16 somehow on the final bill. The day we wanted to go to Universal we got there 15 minutes earlier than they said the first shuttle would run over there and there was already a shuttle full of people on and leaving. We were not allowed on and were told to wait. The $9 they charge per night for parking is actually $10 after they add the tax plus some entertainment tax of one kind or another. My kids liked it (of course - they're kids and not paying), but believe me....you can do better!!

<Content>Good, convenient location.... My husband and I stayed at this hotel 3/18-3/22/05. The hotel was clean enough... pretty mobbed in the lobby and we had to wait quite a while to check in after a long flight. The room was clean enough and so-so as far as accomodations. The telephones and internet connection in our room didn't work. We had to call down to the front desk 4 separate times before we finally got the phones to work. The internet never did function correctly. The hallways and carpets were pretty worn out and seedy. The gift shop was supposed to be open all day and into the night but we tried to use it about 8 different times and found a closed sign listing what time the clerk would be back --pretty aggravating. They advertised a heated pool, whirlpool and sauna. The pool was chilly and full of leaves. The whirlpool was cool too and the sauna was unusable--piled full of outdoor furniture. The good things I can say about this place--- the location was great for our visit--close to Universal Studios-close driving distance to Hollywood, downtown LA and a nice drive to Santa Monica and Malibu. Plus, the place was pretty laid back and relaxed at least. It was not as nice as I'd hoped but I did enjoy the stay because of the great location.

<Content>Great stay location for Universal A very nice option for anyone going to Universal City Walk/Amphitheatre/Studios. Enjoyed the room, the newness apparent in the appointments, from shower curtain to carpets, to three pillows on the bed!, the balcony access with its fresh air. Room service took a tad long, but food was satisfactory. Pleasant aesthetic style in room design. Complimentary shuttle option to Universal, tho we didn't know it was on a set schedule (once an hour) so it ended up not being convenient for us to make use of this time. Very easy access off the 101.

<Content>Hotel was nice Nice comfortable rooms where we spent 6 nights. Nice landscaped gardens but a little noisy from the Motorway near by. However, rooms were reasonably sound proofed so had no problems with sleeping. Plenty of parking, but found $9 a day charge, somewhat steep. Would recommend asking for a room overlooking Ventura Blvd as I'm sure this would be quieter (something I did not do). Would stay there again.

<Content>Very pleasant We moved from a different hotel and were very pleasantly surprised at how well we were treated at this hotel. The staff was accommodating and the room was very nice at a very reasonable price. The restaurant that was attached to it had a great breakfast and very nice people working there. All in all my wife and I were very please. We certainly would stay there again.

<Content>Rename it to Hoover Hotel - iot sucks that much This was probably a nice hotel before the freeway was added only feet from our room - literally we couldn't hear ourselves think and had to turn the tv up very loud to drown out the constant and I mean constant stream of traffic just outside our window.While it may be true that we are country folk with different ideas about noise, I cannot imagine that any sane person would not be driven mad in a short time by the constant and droning high decibel intrusion that filled our every moment in that over priced over hyped over the hill (literally - hollywood my foot) poor excuse for a room.The so-called kid's suite was no more than a cheap piece of plywood or such that was thrown up in a normal-size room and annoyingly plastered with cheap rundown and blatant Hollywood Universal Advertising- and as as such was no more than a broom closet for kids and not much of a bonus or perk worth the extra money. Except for the 1/4 illusion there was not much of a separation as we were led to believe.The amusements for children were also pretty much non-existentent except for whining about all the things that there were not to do. However anyone with a skin condition that thinks that they can be cured with heavy chlorine therapy, you are in luck because the pool is open for business. Come on in!Management was non-existent and as a previous reviewer stated - they were always in a meeting -and over the course of 3 days no one could be bothered to call us back and address our concerns.Never again and never should you - what a rip!

<Content>We will stay at Beverly Garland's Hotel again Myself, my husband and my son stayed at Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn for 4 nights and enjoyed it very much. The room was a bit larger than most hotel rooms, and it was very clean. The pool was beautiful - we went swimming at night when the pool was lit up as well as the trees around the pool area (it was also heated which was perfect). I had no problems with the staff - they were very helpful. We enjoyed this hotel the best out of our trip to 3 cities in the States. As for location, it's not a beach hotel, but it only took 30 minutes to drive to Santa Monica Beach from there. It's close to Hollywood Boulevard, and the shuttle to Universal Studios was good since we didn't have to pay for parking at the theme park ($15.00). The shuttle lets you off right at the entrance. Also, if you buy your tickets to Universal Studios from the hotel, you can use them for two days instead of just one. There is noise from the 101 freeway, but I didn't notice because I was too tired from sightseeing all day. As for the hallways being dirty, I didn't find them horribly filthy - and besides, I wasn't sleeping in the hallway so it wasn't that much of a concern. To sum up, we will definitely be staying there again.

<Content>sadly disappointing the distance description from the hotels web site from the hotel to universal studios must have been as the crow flys rather than on foot or by car!!the hotel has roads on three sides of this hotel, when we entered our room we both thought the window had either been left open or had no glass in it---but it did have glass and it was shut, the noise was unreal. we quickly got another room in the only part of the hotel described as quiet.the rooms were sadly dated and the carpets in the hall ways were dirty and they obviously don't have hoovers that go up to the skirting boards as there was a think layer of dust round the carpets.the staff were pleasant but this hotel has seen better days.

<Content>We were pleased Our family spent 2 nights at the hotel in August and were fully satisfied. Hotel is well maintained, well located, and suitable for families. Kids ate free in the hotel restaurant.Upon arrival, the standard room we had reserved was NOT available so they immediately, without asking: a. Gave us a mini-suite--same price b. Free parking for our whole stay (an $18- savings c. Two passes for 2 free dinners in the hotel restaurant.Our stay was otherwise uneventful. I would certainly consider staying here again.

<Content>Never Again....Spend Extra  Booked for 5 nights, stayed ONE! Nice landscaping, but that's all it had going for itl. Booked King Executive Sweet, but our room was given away and nothing comparable was available. 2 Adults  2 kids, we got 1 bed and 2 had to sleep on the floor. Next day, we were promised a new room, they never delivered. Mgr.  desk clerks conversed in Spanish in front of me, so I couldn't understand, and never gave me the room I needed,. Never, never again. Went to Holiday Inn, about 2 miles away on Cahuenga Blvd. and it was the best I've seen. Beverly, check what goes on in the hotel that bears your name. These people were not pleasant.

<Content>What's up with the bad reviews?? Stayed 2 nights July 24, 25. I read so many bad reviews. There is NO hotel we found this nice for the money. I am so thankful we chose this hotel. Yes, it's an older hotel. I felt like we were in a luxury resort. Our room was on the side facing the traffic.... Shut the door, you can't hear anything. Yes, they even have crooked toilets.... On purpose. Who wants to hug that wall ?? Great idea. Staff was great and extremely helpful. The only thing negative I would say is that if you eat breakfast in the hotel and in a hurry. Don't eat there.This hotel was beyond our expectations. Thank you Beverly Garland.We even tried to come back the following weekend....No rooms available.

<Content>Okay I just got back from a week's stay here. We ran into no problems. If you are used to more upscale hotels I would stay away from here. There is no 24 room service and the hotel bar does not open till 5pm It is a great location for visting Universal and I also made it down to Disneyland in an hour. We had a room in the back and it was very quiet. The grounds are very nice what you would expect for a Southern Cal hotel. The room was clean. Bottom line if you are on a tight budget with kids this is a great place. If you are used to more higher scale hotels then this is not the place for you.

<Content>Next time, I will stay elsewhere. Upon arrival at this hotel, we were informed that the room we had booked months in advance, would not be available because the people before us never checked out. Dispite this, they put us in a room (4 people mind you, in a room with one king size bed.) Management was notified and we were moved to a quiet room with 2 double beds. The noise from the traffic was quite annoying at best. The next day we were told we would be moved to the room we had orginally booked ( a kids suite) and that we should go ahead and enjoy our stay and our things would be moved and waiting for us. This was not true. Had to stop at the front desk upon our return and check with the front desk to see if the original room we had booked was available. It was, and we were promptly switchced to this room. The advertised 2 room suite for kids is a joke. It is one room with a wall enclosing the so called kids suite. Even though they did try to compensate us for our inconvenience, I will choose to stay somewhere else next time.

<Content>Stay away at all costs!! I will never return to this hotel. I made the reservations online and paid extra for the breakfast rate that was supposed to be a free breakfast at the restaurant attached. Well the free breakfast wasnt anywhere near being free - i paid another $20 on top of it!!Also, when we arrived, they did not have the room i requested. They were not fully booked either. I spent half an hour at the front desk asking why everything was so different from the reservations specialist i spoke to.The front staff was unhelpful. When we finally did get to our rooms (they were supposed to be adjoining for our teenages - the kids were all the way down the hall and around the corner !!) I realized that i had not received the breakfast vouchers so i called the front desk and they told me that i didnt have that kind of rate.So i brought down my email verification and they argued that it was their standard rate - even though i had a confirmation that showed it. They told me i would have to talk to the manager who was of course in a meeting at 5:30 in the evening!!I asked them to call the 800 Holiday Inn line and I talked with someone from the customer care center - they were the only helpful people I dealt with. They basically told the manager to take care of all the problems.After realizing how bad the rooms were in terms of length I asked to be moved. They moved me to another room - but this one smelled like the Marlboro Man lived there for the last ten years. The manager insisted that the room was non-smoking...right...We ended up not moving a third time only because i was so frustrated and exhausted. The hotel is icky 1977 and even our toilet was crooked in the room. It was awful - I think Motel 6 would have been better (and i hear they leave the lights on!!) - oh yes and the food in the restaurant stinks....

<Content>Outstanding Everything Hold on to you hat for this one. Yes I've read some of the less favorable reviews and was a little reluctant to stay there, but let me tell you I was very surprised to see great accomondations, yes I had a room facing traffic but unless you sleep with the patio door open, I didn't hear a thing. 3 other couples went along and had various views and no one had complaints about anything.The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, I had a few conversations with the on site assistant manager Dwight, and he was very helpful with anything we needed. The restaurant and bar had good priced meals and the bar well that's telling to much but I wasn't let down. Thanks guys, see you next year....................
