<Content>Excellent hotel, can't go wrong We stayed eary November in the hotel. We took a bus from the airport to the hotel, for only 5E each. The drop-off in Plaza Catalunya was a simple three blocks away. The hotel is very modern, very clean, and very cozy. The rooms have a decent size, the bed is very comfortable, and the bathroom has all the amenities you could need.The front desk service is nice enough (at least to Barcelona standards), although not terribly helpful regarding the area.One drawback is that internet access is very expensive. As for the area, go to las Ramblas and take leisurely strolls around the area. The Carrefur Express market is great to stock up, and we love Pan  Company for a quick snack (Subway with a Spanish flare). Note that on Sunday almost everyting is closed (which didn't make a lot of sense!).Overall, the NH Calderon is an excellent option and I would return to it (this was our second stay there).

<Content>Great location in the city The hotel has a great location near the Ramblas and the Catalunya square. At the same time it's not in a crowded area so you can sleep at night.I was in a superior room I believe (or else they have really incredible standard rooms), for which I didn't pay the supplement, as I'm an employee of the chain. It was spacious, well furnished and modern. bathroom was great with a separate area for sink/wardrobe and toilet/bath.We didn't had much of a view but it was not annoying as we were always outside.The pool on the roof is great.Staff was helpfull and friendly except one girl who really needed to review her guest service skills.

<Content>Great Location in Barca Stayed in this hotel in early April. Online booking and requested - early check in, high floor (on the grounds that if there are views you might as well enjoy them) and non smoking. Arrived around 12 noon and met with friendly check in staff. all requests supplied. Room was above average with nicely divided bathroom. Free safe and honour minibar. Breakfast was excellent with a greater choice of fruits/breads than most hotels. Hot breakfast was available on request. Bar was nice and relaxing after a lot of sightseeing before heading out again at night, but maybe a little too quiet for some. Didn't eat in the hotel at night as nobody ever appeared to be in the restaurant. Weather wasn't warm enough for rooftop pool. All staff always had a greeting no matter where they met you and particularly the breakfast room staff. ( breakfast was served until 11am which was another plus) Barcelona itself was everything one could wish for with lots to do and see. However eating out was something of a chore. Most restaurants closed down from 4 until around 8.30/9pm. This didn't really suit our plans/way of eating etc. And when they did open the (presumably) better ones filled up immediately. Food was indifferent and not cheap but then again it is a major city and probably no worse than most others. As for tapas bar , if I never seen another one ..........

<Content>Good Hotel Great Locations Stayed at the NH Calderon with my family for the half term break. I had stayed in NH chain hotels elsewhere on business and had always been impressed and the Calderon did not disappoint. We had two twin rooms, next to each other at the end of a corridor which was ideal for us with our two boys. The rooms were a bit on the small side, but not to the point of being a problem, and were very nicely appointed. Bathroom facilities were particularly good. The key feature, however, was the location. Just a few hundred yards from the Placa Catalunya and the top of the Ramblas, but far enough away from the Ramblas to be quiet and safe. Lots of nearby Tapas Bars and restaurants, and local shops. However avoid La Raca restaurant across the road from the hotel - they just open packets and heat them in the microwave - we realised just in time to abort a meal there. Excellent coffee and breakfast at the Comtal Cuitat at the corner of Rambla Catalunya just yards from the hotel. Happy Grill at Placa Catalunya was great for a family meal.Staff at the Calderon were very pleasant and helpful. We didn't try the food in the hotel given the local amenities. The only problem with the hotel was the risk of noise from neighbouring rooms. The walls are paper thin and the you can hear the TVs and conversations from neighbouring rooms (this was ideal for us to know whether the boys next door were behaving!). The wooden floors add to the noise. Over a five day stay we only had one problem when out neighbours came in at 2 a.m. and started talking - waking us up. So it is a bit pot luck whether you are next to quiet guests or not.We will stay at the Calderon again next time we visit Barcelona, simply due to the great location.

<Content>Excellent hotel This is a great hotel in an excellent location, just off Playa Catalunya. Our room was on the 8th floor, and had a nice view of the city. Bathroom was spotless, and had a good selection of toiletries provided, including toothbrushes, razor  shaving cream, and body buffer. Didn't have breakfast there, but had food at the bar, which was excellent, although a bit expensive compared to what's available in nearby tapas bars/restaurants. Staff were pleasant, and most spoke English. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Surprisingly Dissapointed Just came back from a 4 night trip. Incredibly disappointed and shocked to find good reviews about the same hotel I had stayed in. The only positive about the hotel is its location. It is a few blocks from Las Ramblas and close to other popular spots. We were able to walk to the Sagrada familia, the Cathedral and Museu Picasso from there, approximately 20 minutes. Also close to the metro. There is a bus for about 3.75 from the airport that stops in front of the hotel; one of my coworkers took it, approximately 30 minutes by taxi. Taxi is about 30 bucks each and that includes an airport surcharge. Hotel room is very small, two twin beds make up a double room. I was a literally a few inches from my coworker. There wasn't much room to walk around. We were on the third floor. Our other coworkers were on the 6th, and that room was much larger(same twin beds) Room was extremely hot during the day even after someone looked at it. When we complained at the desk we were told that we werené¥æª in America and the air conditioning isné¥æª the same, even though the lobbyé¥æª temperature was acceptable. Almost every person at the front desk was rude and unfriendly. They never looked up, never smiled, and never greeted you. Ié¥æªe never experienced anything like it, was very surprised. When the front desk clerk heard me speak Spanish after a short conversation we had in English, I was admonished because I didné¥æª speak my pathetic Spanish first. This type of behavior does effect your mood even if you are trying to make the best out of it. Phone message system does not work. They left us a written message underneath our door, hours after the phone call. WORST OF ALL, THE HOTELé¥æ©² COFFEE WAS TERRIBLE, YUK. Breakfast selections were decent. Walk to any coffee shop/restaurant in the area and youé¥æªl be extremely satisfied with the coffee. Barcelona is very beautiful and defiantly worth a visit. Good customer service will not be found here, there has to be better hotels.

<Content>Nice location!!! I stayed at the Calderon for 2 nights a few weeks ago and was very happy with the hotel. We had a room on the 10th floor with an excellent view of all of Barcelona. The room was decorated nicely with dark wood and mirrors. The front desk was pleasant and helpful and the lobby was very pretty and modern. The pool on the top floor has excellent views of Barcelona as well , although we did not swim. The location is great a 7 minute walk to las ramblas and is right next to Placa de Cataluna which has many restaurants and lots of action. When I was in Spain 2 years previously I had friends staying here and they loved it then so i took their advice , tried something new and was very happy about it!!

<Content>Clean, Good service, good location Nice, clean and fairly new hotel, good location (central) and quiet.Stayed for few nights in january, wasn't fully booked (i assume)... because the sauna and other facilities wasn't occupied the time we stayed there.Sauna for 2/3 persons, with outside shower, men /women divided. Swimmingpool on the rooftop.Rooms are clean, tidy , as all the NH hotels.

<Content>Great hotel, superb location Cannot say enough about this hotel. I was concerned when I booked it that it was cheaper than other 4 star hotels in the area, but on arriving we were so surprised. Location is superb, right in the middle of things yet quiet. Rooms are huge and very modern. No noise from busy Barcelona streets. Lovely rooftop pool and terrace which we didn't use ( it was February!), but was a lovely escape from the city. Would highly recommend this hotel.

<Content>A little pricey but almost perfect Can't say much bad about this wonderful 4-star hotel. Great location - right on La Rambla just above the Placa Catalunya. Beautiful buffet breakfast (at extra cost). A really nice feature was the double, double-pane windows. That is, two double-pane windows with an air space in between which results in total quiet even though it's on a really busy street.Only one complaint. They had a computer downstairs for internet access which was a pay-as-you-go deal at 50 Euro/cents per minute (!!!). That would mean 15 Euros for a 30 minute session of reading and answering email.. That's almost $40 per hour!! An Internet cafe down near the port on La Rambla charges, I think, One Euro per hour and that's considered expensive. Other than the inconvenience of de facto no internet access, it's a great hotel.

<Content>Good hotel for business travel Spent 2 nights in August for a business trip. The location is perfect, in terms of being in the city centre. Took advice of others and requested a room at the upper floors. Not only are these brand new, clean and spacious, but also you get an incredible view from all windows.In the event that you can not get a upper-level room, I suggest taking a trip to the rooftop. If not for a swim, at least for the spectacular views.Also the room had nice extra touches, such as nh-smints and extra bathroom amenities such as comb and shoe polish. Only thing unfortunate is that the hotel, for some legal reasons, is unable to deliver an iron + board to the room. I therefore had a very crumpled shirt to wear. On the other hand, there are plenty of shopping opps just outside the door, that one can always buy a shirt on the spot.My rate did not include breakfast, which was just fine. When you walk out the main entrance and take a left, there is a lovely cafe/bar about 10 metres down where you can have an excellent service of coffee, pastries and juice.Would definately stay at this nh hotel again.

<Content>Hotel or Hospital We experienced this hotel during the first long weekend in June of 2006. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. My partner has been staying at this hotel for close to 10 years and always selects this property for our visits to Barcelona. Four years ago, I joined him and fell in love with Barcelona and this property. The area is awesome and it's location near the Ramblas is fantastic. I am sad to say that this hotel is not worthy of my affection  we were both MAJORLY disappointed  disgusted by the staff, the rooms and the general property. In summary, point by point.1) pool is crap with no more than 8 or 10 pool beds2) spa is closed on weekend - despite the hotel being 100% full3) room was small and filthy4) staff were rude with unprofessional telephone manners, incapable of eloquently responding to issues5) not possible to internet in the room - missing necessary cables to connect laptop and when we called down to ask we reached some kind of caveman who was never taught how to communicate on a phone let alone to guests. Shocking to speak to someone who communicates like an ape PLUS did not have any knowledge of computers.6) rooms are small, using every space - when I was working on my laptop (without internet - needed to check emails from work but could not) and could not open the desk drawer which was unable to be opened completely cuz of the space.7) We asked for a quiet room and were given a room directly in front of the elevator- front desk not very smart about floor/room layout.8) Changed rooms and was then given a room without a bathtub - how DARE they charge 155 EUR for a room without a bathtub. Front desk said they were unaware that that room did not have a bathtub (only a shower).9) Third room has 2 tiny beds together which resembles hospital beds with giant wheels that moved and rolled around anytime you moved - UNBELIEVABLE!10) On our last night, the wheel of one bed broke off and the bed would tip over if I moved. Could not fix it because it had a broken screw. Did not bother to call maintenance since it was 2AM and doubtful that the hotel actually employed staff to help with these issues since most of the general services were lacking staff. I have digital photos to show proof of the shabby bed conditions.11) carpets in the halls outside our rooms (and on the 3 floors I visited) were all filthy and not vacuumed during our entire stay. They had completed a renovation phase (with unfinished walls in front of elevators and buttons not functioning etc. etc) and seemed to lack any sense of style to complete the job.12) We noticed that the room also did not display any fire escape route behind the doors which is quite illegal but not a concern for this property. I also have pictures of this and will forward to the authorities.13) On the day before our flight, we wanted to check in online for our flight the following day but, as mentioned earlier, we were unable to get internet access in our room so we tried the mini-business centre off the lobby - WHICH ALSO DID NOT HAVE ANY STAFF. There was another guest using a computer for over 30 minutes so we used another computer since there was nobody around to guide us. Five minutes into our task, some front office staff member came shouting into the room HEY HEY HEY .... to get our attention, rather than politely addressing us as guests should be. He proceeded to shout us and tell us that we should NOT be using this computer. So I responded by advising him that there is not staff or signs anywhere informing us - plus the computer was turned on so how were we to know. He continued to be angry so I asked for the manager IMMEDIATELY. But he disappeared and the manger never came so we walked away after 20 minutes of waiting and found ourselves thoroughly disgusted by this point.These were just a few of our experiences, we have many more along with some lovely digital photos to document the poor state of this hotel. WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE and I will be sure to share my message with everyone I meet and on every travel forum I can find.Happy travelling everyone.

<Content>Overall good hotel for business or pleasure The Calderon is in a great central location for sightseeing and business. I had a renovated room on the 7th floor which was clean and nicely furnished. There is a nice fitness center on the 11th floor as well as an outdoor pool and lounging area with great views. The lobby areas are small but very nice. Breakfast is as good as it gets in Europe. My only complaints were the laminated floors in the rooms which are extremely noisy when walking with shoes (walking in the next room sounded like it was in my own room)and the exorbitant Internet access fees which seems to be the case everywhere in better hotels. The more stars, the more you pay for all the extras. Doesn't seem right.

<Content>FAB location I stayed at this hotel as part of a large group and we couldn't figure out why some people thought it was great and others hated it - until we worked out that as of about floor 5 upwards, the rooms have been completely renovated! Below that level, it's very 70's style with wood panelling and old, dirty-ish bathrooms; above that level it's new, modern and lovely. Request a high-level room and you can't go wrong... it's in a great location near the shopping strip and plaza de cataluna and only 5 minutes walk from the metro. Only complaint I would have (other than the older rooms) is the staff - they were not very helpful and when my suitcase, which had been lost for three days by the airline, finally arrived, they put it in someone else's room and then denied it was there! hmmmm!

<Content>One of NH's finest ! Stayed here for 2 nights in late December 2005 and found this to be an excellent hotel. Rate was about 110 Eur for a double room (w/o breakfast). Rooms were very spacious, bright, very well decorated, comfortable, simple but with class. Common areas are vast and comfortable, very important trait in a city such as Barcelona where after a long day strolling (either shopping or sightseeing) you'll want to wind down. Location is very good, right on Rambla Catalunya, about 200 metres from Plaza Catalunya and 100 metres from Passeig de Graciè¿.This is a genuine 4 star hotel with very good service, just a complaint regarding breakfast which at 17 Euros is very pricey but then again that is NH practice and basically industry practice as well.

<Content>poor rooms- definately not 4 star stayed at nh calderon end of august 2005 for 2 nights after cruise. Booked online with alpha rooms who had cheapest rate - æ¢112per night including breakfast. First impressions were good, check in quick and polite staff, we were given room on 2nd floor after previously requesting a room on upper floor, room was dark- tired and not over clean. When asked to be moved to a better room we were told that we had a very cheap rate and that they had nothing else available. On further investigation we realised that the hotel was under some refurbishment as the top half of the building was out of use, except for the rooftop swimming pool. Hotel is in a good position for shops and sightseeing etc and when rooms are refurbished it will be worthy of 4 stars - to sum up - breakfast buffet was very good and roof top pool also good but needs more sunbeds and chairs as i counted only 8 sunbeds which were all taken when we used the pool - did not think we got value for what we paid considering the vast amount of hotel deals in barcelona. Give it a miss until all work is complete -- trip advisor user - brighton sussex uk

<Content>good quality hotel in excellent location I stayed in this hotel several times, and the last time was mid january 2005 (I will return mid July).This hotel is belonging to the NH hotelgroup. The founder of this hotelgroup later on sold his chair and opened the AC Hoteles, with even more eye for detail and guests'needs.The building is from the seventies and was completely refurbished. The NH Gran Hotel Calderon has a private arts collection, which you can see in the corridors and the lobby. The hotel is a good 4* hotel wih all modern ammenities, although some rooms are rather small. Rooms all have private bathroom with great bath products, make-up mirror, hairdryer. Rooms have private safe (electronic), minibar, interactive tv with games and pay tv. Bar: nice, but not a lot of people make use of it, so it's more a quite area to read a book in stead of a cosey bar.Breakfast buffet is just great, with great variety (dietic and normal food, fresh fruit juices, etc...). Eggs: they cook them as you wish.Normally they have apart from the outdour rooftop pool an indoor swiming pool (ground flour - with sauna and gym) but last time I went there they were refurbushing and constructing a SPA on the rooftop near the outdoor pool. Guests, however, were given an alternative: free entrance to a nearby gym.Location is superb: near the Ramblas (the hotel is situated on a shopping street - Rambla de Catalunya - which is the prolongation of Las Ramblas), near major shopping areas: El Corte Inglès, Portal del Angel and Passeig de Graciè¿ (more luxurious shooping) are just arround the corner.Eating out: on the corner a great tapabar, worldfamous in Barcelona: Ciudad Condal!!!! Opposite a decent restaurant: La Tramoia. In the neighbourhoud: Citrus / Jean Luc Figueras - 2 Michelin stars/ Tragaluz, El japonès...The location is also superb for sightseeing: just around the corner: las ramblas, gaudi-monuments such as La Pedrera and Casa Battlè´¸, Plaza de Cataluyna where you can take the BUS TURISTIC (hop on, hop off)...Public transport: metro and train and busses: Plaza de Catalunya (less than 100m). Also on the plaza de Catalunya you can take the AEROBUS to the airport for 3.50 euros. Great value, because has very few stops (max 3) and is specially designed for passangers with luggage.This hotel can be recommended both for business as for leisure!Enjoy your stay! I certainly did and that's why I always return.

<Content>Fair hotel in good location We spent three nights at the NH Calderon in March 2005 and think that the location is great. Two minutes from Las Ramblas and five minutes from the best bars in the city, we couldn't have asked for more.The rooms were decent and clean but unimaginative. Nothing to rave about or complain about. The food in the hotel was awful and every lunch time the guest lifts stank of bad fish. Not a pleasant experience.Also, there seemed to be a lot of building work going on while we were there, which meant lots of noise. This started at 8.30am and continued through the day. This was annoying, but as were out of the hotel most of the time it didn't spoil the trip. The fitness centre was closed for refurbishment, which was frustrating, especially as we were not warned of this before our arrival.Overall, I could not recommend the hotel as the place was so unexceptional. However, if you get a good deal on the room rate, the place isn't bad and it is in a good location.

<Content>Okay to visit I looked at the other reviews before writing this one, and have concluded that in general, a 4-star hotel in Europe must not be a 4-star in most of the states - maybe I've been spoiled and expect too much. Anyway, with this in mind, I was very open in terms of what the Calderon had to offer. In general, I was pleased. I stayed there with a group in March, 2005, so was able to view several types of rooms. The rooms were smaller than we expected, but clean and neat, and we had cleaning service daily. The location of the hotel is excellent; two blocks from Las Ramblas - major shopping, clubs, restaurants (including the one in the hotel which does have a fabulous, varied and very filling breakfast). Although the pool and gym were closed for renovation, it was way too cold for the pool anyway, and the hotel provided provided passes to a gym across the street. The staff was also very sweet and helpful accommodating a bunch (at least 20) of excited tourists all talking at the same time, trying to find the best way to tour Barcelona, see museums, exchange money, shop, eat, etc. Oh, if you've never visited, take the official tour - and your camera!

<Content>Perfect location Ideally situated with Catalunya Square and Las Ramblas a mere 5 minutes walk away. The hotel is way above average although caters more for the business man. Breakfast is unbelievable with a choice to suit everybody from cereal and fruit to eggs, bacon  sausage. We stayed at the NH Caulderon over new year and was very disappointed to find that they were not putting on any new year celebrations, considering the hotel was full. The restaurant closed at 9.30pm on the 31st with the bar closing at 10.30pm!!!! The receptionist recommended 3 restuarants to celebrate new year with the cheapest meal starting at æ¢95, increasing to æ¢210 - way out of our budget. The rooms are immaculate and we loved the free shampoo, soap and shower gel we got each day. Breakfast doesn't start till 7.00am so bear that in mind if you have to check out earlier. They will not provide you breakfast before that time unless you pay extra for room service (a bit frustrating when we pre-paid for our room to include breakfast!)All things considering, a really comfortable hotel in a perfect location but a bit formal. A cheaper, less luxurious family run hotel would suit me better.

<Content>Excellent Location Did'nt know what to expect for Euro 84 per night but we were pleasantlysurprised, excellent location on the fringes of Las Ramblas but central to explore this fantastic city. The hotel is clean, functional with all the usual amenities of a four star hotel. We stayed for three nights our aim to take in as many sights and soak up the atmosphere of Barcelona, this we did but will come back for more... and to the Hotel Calderon.

<Content>Good location, rooms are fair, service is a letdown For our first trip to Barcelona we wanted a place to be close to Las Ramblas but not too noisy. As far as location is concerned, the hotel was great: walking distance to every major attraction, restaurants, shopping etc. We were upgraded to a better room as a courtesy since our room was not ready on time and when it was ready we refused to stay there because it was claustrophobically small. The bigger room was OK, the service was a letdown (the room wasn't vacuumed once!), but the buffet breakfast, included, was very good. Overall, the place is average at best and we would not consider staying there again.

<Content>Great Hoel We spent 3 days at the hotel in August 2004. It was very clean and well located; close enough to La Rambla but not too close that there was any noise at night. The rooftop pool was great after being out all day in the heat. Staff was friendly and helpfull.

<Content>Good 4* hotel Myself and three friends stayed at the Calderon for three nights and found it excellent. The staff were helpful and polite and the facilities were more than adequate. The pool area on the roof isn't huge but it's clean with fantastic views and the pool itself provides great respite from the heat. The location is fab - right next to the shopping area and La Rambla. You can also see the Gaudi apartments, the Catherdral and the Gaudi Church from the roof top. It's close the the metro station and there are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. The only niggle was the breakfast - while it is a lovely selection of food and drink beautifully presented unless you completely stuff yourself you feel slightly ripped off at the 17.50 euro charge every morning! However, we would definitely return to the Calderon, especially at just 110 euro per night.

<Content>Great location I agree with the July 13, 2004 visitor. I have been to Barcelona five times and stayed here on my last visit in June 2004. The location is the best thing about the hotel. It is a great value for a chain-type hotel if you get a deal on the room rates. We had a triple so our room was quite large. The bathroom was huge and the room was very quiet. We didn't eat here, but ate at the numerous places nearby. It is close to transit-bus, and metro, and near the airport bus stop. There is an internet cafe nearby, a high end convenience-type store open late hours across the street, and major shopping nearby. Don't expect much for service, and you won't be disappointed. For first time visitors, I would recommend it as it is in a safe area with lots of places to eat nearby and close to many transit options. Also of major importance during the summer is the superb air conditioning. The roof-top pool offers great vistas of the city.

<Content>Clean, Modern Hotel, Good Location Searched endless sites trying to find a suitable hotel for my stay first stay in Barcelona and plummed for this one after being messed around by Rivoli Ramblas. What I did realise was that whats good for some is not for others. My opinion of the Calderon was that it was a clean, comfortable and modern hotel, well located for sightseeing and shopping. Pass.de Gracia is the main shopping district and is one block away. The tube stations of Pass.de Gracia and Placa Catalunya are 5 min walks. The airport train stops at the latter and only costs 2.25 EUROS. This hotel seems to be run by a chain similar to the Marriot or Holiday Inn. We stayed on a Room Only basis for 110 Euros which was a discounted rate. The room was well decorated with Dark Wood and black marble the main features and a large marble bathroom. It was spotlessly clean with TV, remote radio which played music throughout room and into bathroom. If you can get a good rate you cant go wrong with this obvious 4 star hotel. Only negative was that out of the 3 reception staff we spoke to only one was smiling. The others were not rude or unhelpful just seemed miserable. This was the only negative point and relatively minor as we didnt need to rely on them at all.

<Content>It's okay but you can probably do better. The hotel is conveniently located for sight-seeing, walking distance to Las Ramblas. It has a carpark but it is not on-site. The rooms are narrow mainly because of the clunky furniture and the windows don't offer much light. For a four star and at those prices, I would look elsewhere but if you are a business traveller, it is pretty standard. Also close the windows especially on Friday and weekend nights as the street outside can get rather noisy!

<Content>Unforgetable visit This was the first time that I had been to Barcelona and the hotel was superb. The rooms were clean, the meals excellent and the staff just could not do enough for you. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona as it is within easy travelling distance of all the major sights.
