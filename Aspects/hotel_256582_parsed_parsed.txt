<Content>Perfect spot We arrived at Medina Harbourside on Christmas day - our family that live in Sydney had organised lunch and as the apartment had a full kitchen they came to us. On checking in we were advised our room would not be available till 2.00pm we were shocked as we had been advised we would beable to check straight in. We then advised of all the food we had with us and the two behind the counter advised they could store it in the kitchen at the restuarant next door. We were very disappointed on prompting again I asked could they not check with house keeping I then got a flat no it wont be ready and you cant check in! It was Xmas day for goodness sake could there not be some compation and a bit of friendlyness. When the gentle man was on the phone the younger man on the desk could see our prediciment and picked up the phone then came back with you room is ready we were so appreciative we beleive that the first gentleman had the 2.00pm rule in his head and would not budge that was disappointing. The young man then organised a trolley and helped us unload the car of luggage and food and took it up for us. After that experience we were rapt we were in a back unit on 3rd floor, so no views but the double glazing did the trick no noise at all and also was cooler with the sun off the room for most of the day. The house keeping was ok and the room was done every day with light clean. We were there for 9 days and got a couple of full cleans in that time. The position of the Medina is fantastic and New Years Eve was a easy 1 minute walk to watch the fire works. We only had one other gripe the swipe cards were very sencetive an often did not work. We definately will be staying there again.

<Content>Quiet getaway amongst the bustle Spent 4 days at the Medina Grand Harbourside December 2008. Room was a good size with all modern amenties which enabled own cooking etc. Stayed on the second floor (no balcony) but absolutely zero traffic noise and that was with a busy expressway directly alongside. Air conditioning allowed a controlled temperature. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Right next to busy Darling Harbour with great restaurants and shopping and easy walking distance to Circular Quay and CBD. Most enjoyable stay. Highly recommend.

<Content>Great place for families We started our trip to Australia with a three-night stay at the Medina. We had two connected rooms - a room with a Queen bed, table and chairs for two, bathroom and small kitchenette, and a second suite with a bedroom with two twin beds and a lounge with a sofa and tv area, a table and chairs for four, a bathroom with a washer/dryer, and a full kitchen. A balcony with seating ran the whole length of the room, offering a view of the aquarium and the harbor beyond it. We found the rooms really comfortable and the kitchen was great. We bought groceries and had breakfast in, and the kids had dinner in one night while we hit the town. We also had cocktails on the balcony at night. The hotel is near the bustling Darling Harbour area with lots of cheap and cheerful places to eat, and it is an easy walk or ferry ride to the Circular Quay where the Opera House is located and where you can catch ferries to the Zoo, Manley, etc. There is a pool and a gym. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Our rooms were not inexpensive but it was a great start to the holiday and we saved money by not having to take the entire family out for three meals a day. It was also great being able to head out again with clean clothes when our stay ended. One word of caution: the area is a popular nightspot, and on Friday and Saturday nights we could hear people heading home from the bars until 4 a.m. If you are a light sleeper and you will be there over the weekend you might want to opt for a room facing the back.

<Content>Great but not strictly harbour side! We spent 8 nights here and it proved to be a great base for exploring Sydney. Our visit was a mixture of work and pleasure and the spacious one bedroom serviced apartment quickly became a great home base for us. The accommodation is fitted in a modern style to a level well above average. It has a bit of a corporate feel rather than a cosy feel - but that suited us. We had basement parking for a fee - but reasonable considering this is central Sydney. Access to food is easy, be it to prepare yourself or take away delivered by local restaurants. The hotel has no restaurant of its own - just a breakfast cafe, which is ok but nothing special. The best feature of this Medina is its closeness to Darling Harbour and all the attractions there. It is one block back from actually being 'harbour side', so the name is a little deceiving! You will not get a great harbour view, so this is not a place to people watch from. But as a great value, good quality hotel bang in the middle of Sydney, offering great value for money, it will take some beating.

<Content>Great Location and Accommodation The location is great. It's close to everything, Darling Harbour, Aquarium, Pubs, restaurants, China Town, CBD shopping, Fish Market (20 min's walk). Ferry is very closeby to take you to Circular Quay and other beaches. The room was very clean and almost had everything I need. I'm not fussy with the small room size, cause most of time I was not in the room anyway. I got a room in the quiet side with a balcony (room 54). No noise even though the property is located along a main road.This is not a 5 or 4 star hotel (maybe not even a hotel). It's more like a self-serviced apartment. It's very comfortable to stay here, and considering the price I paid, I'm very happy with the overall experience. I think I'll come back again.The only thing not very smooth is the way they charge your account. I booked the room on Medina's website, and I thought I paid for the accommodation already (cause I provided my CC details online). But it turned out that the money wouldn't be deducted until arriving. I had to re-check my CC statement online to ensure I hadn't paid for the accommodation before I provided my CC details again. There is a computer nearby with the access to the Internet. After I checked out and fully paid for my accommodation, the hotel still withheld certain amount of money and release the amount after 5-7 working days. It's quite confusing and takes me a while to understand.But overall everything is cool.

<Content>What a fantastic Hotel in a great location We booked via the Medina webiste and got a great deal, it wasn't last minute either so it was great to get a good deal when we planned ahead.We had a One bedroom apartment and were extremely happy with the size of the room and the quality of the furnishings and apartment. Everything was in working order and the housekeepers must do a great job as the room was spotless.The staff were really friendly and helpful with all of our needs, going out of their way to book us into a restaurant nearby and hailing taxis for us when we needed them.The Hotel is in the best location at King Street Wharf at Darling Harbour - we could walk to restaurants, bars, the Mall and the Rocks.I would definitely stay here again, nothing was too much trouble and we had a relaxing and comfortable stay.

<Content>Darling place on Darling Harbour Our family of four stayed for three nights in a two bedroom apartment on the sixth floor of the Medina Harbourside Hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful, rooms appointed very nicely and everything was extremely clean. We had a great view of Darling harbor with a 5 minute walk to the monorail station. We would definately stay there again when we return to Sydney.

<Content>Very nice hotel overall. We stayed here for 4 nights during the Australia winter, and booked it mainly because I wanted a one bedroom apartment in a good location that was fairly priced. And the Medina met all those factors. There are two televisions, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. Location was excellent, right next to Darling Harbour and a 5 to 10 minute walk from all the major city centre shopping areas and restaurants. The sights are sort of spread out, but still on average a 20 minute walk from the hotel. There is an excellent Japanese restaurant called Akaneya nearby that has the best soft shell crab. Wagamama鈥檚 and a convenience store are literally right next door. The apartment was very spacious, with a nice bathroom, and even has a balcony. The only downside is that the couch was too small, and there are not enough TV channels.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at this hotel in May 08 and had a one bedroom apartment facing the harbour. Not particularly impressed with the decor but it was in a great location on Darling Harbour and was more than adequate. However we did return to the hotel for one night in June before flying home and was very disappointed with the room. It was facing the front and therefore we got all the noise and fumes from a motorway. In addition although the room was a non smoking it was situated on a smoking floor. So when our neighbour was in the hallway smoking, the smoke drifted into the apartment. Would stay again but would make sure we stipulated a harbour facing room and a non smoking floor!

<Content>close to restaurants my boyfriend and i stayed at this hotel in june 08 and booked through a travel agent.where the hotel is situated - it was SO hard to find.when we got to our rooms, our bags werent there and had to call for them to be brought up.the room was very big- and we just had the standard room. everything was very clean and the bathroom. and i was impressed with the sound proof doors that led to the very noisy street.restaurants and others attractions, such as the aquarium and wildlife place are right next to the hotel ( our balcony looked right into the wildlife place ) and i would suggest casa di nico - an awesome restaurant 30 seconds walk from the hotel.the bed, sloped when you slept on it- and our power all went out when we plugged in their iron.the front desk wasnt too helpful, as we asked for directions from the hotel to paddy's markets.the girl tryed to help but led us the wrong way, and we had to pull over and get directions ourselves.you would think they would know how to get places 10 mins away from the hotel.one good thing though, is you needed to use your room card in the elevator to access your floor - which is good security also.i would probably stay here again for the location - but would want to try another few places first!!but i will be coming back for the restaurant!!

The room I was in was a very odd shape and was a bit small, probably due to it being one of their cheaper rooms. The furnishings were all nice as was the bathroom but I was disappointed that there was no bath and only a microwave.The area itself supposedly goes crazy on weekends but the hotel is a street away from the harbour and pretty quiet. I didn't really like having to walk across the walkway bridge and down the street lift to get to the hotel at night especially by myself as it didn't seem very safe. I had been looking forward to using the gym but it turned out to have antiquated equipment and some of it was broken. There was only 1 treadmill and 1 bike so I suppose they don't get too many long termers.

<Content>Excellent place, great rooms and location! Fabulous place! So near The Rocks, it's just a walk away through the backdoor. A convenience store is nearby for everything you need and the apartment is a perfect size with a kitchenette in case you don't feel like going out to eat (but being so near the Rocks, who wouldn't?!).Service was good, they hailed taxis for us whenever we needed them. Just a walk across the bridge was the Four Points hotel where our conference was held so it was perfect for both work and play. Victoria street is a little bit of a walk away but it's not too taxing.Definitely a fantastic place, highly recommended.

<Content>Fantastic location and service I've just returned from a conference in Sydney and was lucky enough to be booked into this aparthotel by my company. I had a two bedroom / two bathroom apartment all to myself and a nice view of Kent Street from the main bedroom. The staff were wonderful - very helpful and polite, and the breakfast was great too (although this isn't included in the room rate). The location is also awesome - a ten minute walk to Darling Harbour and a five minute walk to George  Pitt street - perfect!Would definitely recommend this one to anyone who is visiting Sydney.

<Content>Great Hotel for Work or Play I only stayed here for one night but I was shocked by the HUGE room and the balcony. Was very clean, updated, bathroom immaculate. Staff were so friendly. Apologetic my room wasn't ready even though i had arrived several hours before check in. When a bellhop wasn't avaiable the front desk girl actually carried my bags up to the room herself! Never heard another guest. Proximity to CBD is good, a little more on the fringe of tourist attractions but buses/stations are less then 5 minute walk.

<Content>Great Location This hotel is in an excellent location with Darling Harbour and the business district (if you are working) right on your doorstep. I had an executive studio on the top floor (6th) which had good views across the harbour and surrounding areas. What i would say is do not expect miracles with this hotel, it is basic and possibly in need of modernising. However, my room was kept clean to a relatively good standard and I had fresh towels etc every day. The best way of describing them is serviced apartments as opposed to a hotel. The Lime cafe which is the hotel's restaurant is poor at best - expect waits of up to an hour for a cooked breakfast - there are far better cafes/restaurants/food outlets within a short walk anyway. There are two supermarkets nearby but be warned they are not cheap - think they are cashing in on a captive market. Overall a pleasant enough stay but nothing you could get excited about; an excellent base for exploring the city though.

<Content>Fantastic Ideal location Situated at Darling Harbour, had a one bed aprt. Just walk outside and your at the harbour, which has 100's of really good resturants, with fantastic food. Hotel next to Wildlife centre and the Aquarium. Hotel was exceptionally clean, and the staff could not have been more helpful. Everything was spot on.

<Content>Much better than a pokey little hotel room! Our STUDIO PREMIER GRAND QUEEN apartment was spacious and contained everything a long distance traveller would require ... washing machine and drier, dishwasher, medium sized refrigerator, cooking facilities, dining table and 4 chairs, lounge, desk, broadband internet connection (extra charge), and 2 tv's.Not a great view, but the double glass sliding doors provided great soundproofing.A great location (only 100 metres from The Sydney Aquarium, and adjacent to the King St Wharf and it's ferries, water taxis, bars and restaurants).Much better that the 5 star hotel just up the road (and at a reasonable price).Would definately stay here again.

<Content>Great hotel in a busy buzzy location Darling Harbour is a wonderfully buzzy area, with masses of restaurants, attractions and shops, so it's a great place to stay. The Medina is right next to Wildlife World and the Aquarium and directly adjacent to many of the quays where the tour boats and water taxis depart from. Ideal. If you want harbour views, though, be sure to get a room on the top (6th) floor otherwise your view will be obscured by the building between the hotel and the harbour front. Our very nice suite had a smallish but perfectly comfortable bedroom (with a TV rather neck-achingly mounted on a stand in one corner at ceiling height!), sitting/dining room area with open plan kitchen and spacious bathroom with bath/shower, sink and, inside a cupboard, washing machine and tumble drier. Our daughter slept on a not-too-uncomfortable (though slightly institutional looking) put-you-up bed which we easily moved the furniture in the living area around to accommodate. The suite was well equipped, the furniture all comfortable and the standards of cleanliness impecable. We discovered two light fittings weren't working and both times someone promptly appeared with the correct bulb and profuse apologies. Breakfast in the restaurant is fine but not fabulous. The pool and gym are smallish but very well maintained. Would we stay there again? Like a shot!

<Content>enjoyed our stay We stayed here for 8 nights and enjoyed the hotel. The only caution would be that not all the premier harbourview rooms actually have a good harbour view. Our first assigned room looked out at the back of the aquarium and there was only a glimmer of the harbour at the far end of the balcony. When we complained to staff.our room was switched and was much better. Note that this hotel is located behind the aquarium and other buildings so is not directly at the harbour. The kitchen facilities were good and there was a good grocery store about a five minute walk away. The pool was an outdoor one, but had a covered roof and 3 walls, so was still pleasant to swim in, even though the outside temperature was cool The pool was about 4 feet deep throughout so good for swimming lengths, but not OK for kids who would want to dive, etc. It was clean and I took full advantage of it often!The location was great, right near Darling Harbour. I had to attend a conference, and I could take a scenic walk from the hotel to the convention centre along the harbour's pedestrian walkway and this took about ten minutes or so. As well, the ferry to Sydney Harbour was almost outside the door of the hotel.Staff were friendly and professional. We would stay here again if the opportunity arose.

<Content>So close to everything Right next to Darling Harbour yet due to excellent sound insulation, almost no noise from the numerous bars and restaurants close by. We stayed in a very comfortable one bed apartment with full kitchen, not that we needed it much due to proximity of such great restaurants.Five minutes walking to the retail centre of Sydney, or Harbourside Mall, ten to Paddys Markets.Would happily stay again
