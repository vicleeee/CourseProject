<Content>Service??? Hotel itself was ok, nice clean rooms and comfortable bed, a bit noisy because it is next to the opposite to the Central Station, but overall good.Service seemed great too, but twice we were told lies. First we asked are Paddington markets open on Sundays? Answers was yes, walked all the way there and suprise suprise only open on Saturdays. Next day we asked is there bus to Bondi from Central Station and answer was yes. The receptionist even told us the number 333, easy to remember. But there is no direct buses from Central Station to Bondi and yes 333 does exist, but from Circular Quay, which is other side of the city....So not too impressed with the knowledge of the city, if you don't know find out or admit that you are not sure. Please don't just make things up!!

<Content>Enjoyable stay This hotel is easy to get to from the airport. The train takes you from the airport to central station and then its a five minute walk.There are close and frequent buses and trains to Circular Quay or else its 30 or 40 minutes walk.The hotel room was spacious and clean. When I arrived the wardrobe door was not attached. Within 5 minutes of me phoning reception someone was there and fixed it immediately.There are tea and coffee making facilites and a fridge. Milk was replenished daily. The air con worked and the windows opened.The room had 2 queen beds which were very comfortable and the bedding seemed clean.I was attending a conference in the hotel. The conference was well organised and the food was good. The hotel restaurant was closed due to renovations but the bar had a good happy hour and reasonably priced and tasty food. Room service food was also pretty good but a bit more expensive.

<Content>Lovely place! I stayed here with my boyfriend for 3 nights in a standard double room. It is located 5 minutes from central station  just off Elizabeth street. It is only a few minutes walk downtown. The hotel is not decorated quite as modern as many of the hotels in Sydney, but it is clean and welcoming. The bedrooms are spacious  the bed comfortable. The bathroom is clean and has what you need. The swimming pool is lovely. It was empty the time we spent there so had it to oursleves. It's clean and not too cold! There's a spa pool  a sauna too. The hotel also offers massage for a price too I think. There's a nice sundeck - but it was raining when I was there so didn't get to use it. There's also a small gym. The hotel is safe  secure. The staff are friendly. the place is clean  the rooms are comfortable. Highly recommended.

<Content>Great Location, Nice Clean Rooms I stay at the Citygate Sebel roughly once a month for business, and it's generally a good stay. The rooms have recently been updated - some with beech wood furniture, other's with a more modern and sleek black finish. The bathrooms are very pleasant now, modern, clean and well appointed. The internet, as other reviewers have mentioned, is expensive ($25 per day), but on the flip side the parking ($10 per day) is relatively cheap for a location so close to the city. In way of location, the Sebel is perfect. Aprox. 20 - 25mins from the airport and roughly five minutes drive to Darling Harbour / Harbour Bridge  the Opera House etc. The staff are friendly and courteous, though a little unprofessional and not particularly organised. It's often the case that the left hand doesn't seem to know what the right hand is doing, so if you have any issues expect it to take a few phone calls to different departments to get them sorted out. Room Service food is fine - not spectacular, but what can you expect from room service? Restaurant breakfast is standard bacon  eggs etc.. Again, nothing special. Can't comment on dinners as I haven't eaten there for anything other than Breakfast. There's a courtyard located at the end of the hallway on level five that's open from 6am to 10pm, but take note - if you're in a room on level 5 they do NOT have mini-bars - you need to get a Smart Card from reception to use a vending machine located in the corridor. Full mini bar in rooms on other floors. As other reviewers have pointed out, there are minor renovations going on in the foyer and reception areas, but they don't get in the way of anything. At the bottom of the street, no more than fifty feet away is a Seven Eleven, and there's a bottle shop about one hundred meters up Elizabeth St. toward the train station. Plenty of restaurants near the area, and a very quick (maybe five minutes) walk into the heart of the city. Overall, a good hotel for the cost, all the facilities you could want, comfortable rooms and friendly staff. As I mentioned I stay here generally once a month and, whilst I've had a few minor issues (more so in my recent visits), in most cases the hotel has been more than adequate.

<Content>Enjoyable stay at the Citigate Spent three nights at the Citigate from the 4th -7th June. We booked this hotel through Wotif website, it was listed as the secret hotel, located in the CBD, 4 star rating. You don't know whqt hotel it is until after you booked it. We paid $ 140.00 a night and were very happy with it.Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. We were given a large room on the 9th floor with 2 queen size beds, it was very clean and tidy. We did have some problems with internet which still have to be resolved. Paid $ 15.00 for two hour interent access but also seemed to have been charged for downloads. Not sure if this is correct or not.Also found the temperature of the shower to be a bit disconcerting. It changed from cold to hot frequently without touching the control and could be dangerous if a child was showering.Overall we were very happy with the hotel. It is very central, close to the train station (about a 6 minute walk), we took the train to the International airport and that was very easy to do. We also attended a show at the Sydney Entertainment centre and one at the Capitol theatre and both were about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Would stay there again if got the Wotif rate.

<Content>Surpassed our Expectations !! Visited Sydney from the south coast for a spot of shopping with a girlfriend and we couldn't have been happier at Citigate Sebel (unless we could have stayed longer than our 2 nights). The location was great for an easy walk from Central Station, into the city, Chinatown, Darling Harbour, Oxford Street, etc. Even after dark we didn't feel uneasy walking around the area. We found all the staff very professional and welcoming - happy, friendly and helpful. Our room was perfect - comfortable and clean, and the facilities were great. We made use of the gym, spa and sauna after a day of walking around the city and enjoyed a relaxing drink on the sundeck too. Enjoyed the great value buffet breakfasts too. Couldn't ask for more !! We will certainly be back again and recommend Citigate Sebel to our friends.

<Content>Value and friendly service My wife and I stayed here for two nights recently. We were a bit concerned after reading mixed trip advisor reviews. We didn't get the upgrade that many other reviewers have mentioned -possibly because were allowed to check-in around 11 am (well before the 2pm advertised check-in time - which was much appreciated). We found the staff efficient, friendly and helpful. Rating for this establishment seems to vary between 3 and 4 stars depending on which website you look at. We rated it nearer 3 than 4 and the tariff reflects this. Room was comfortable and clean. At night, there was a bit of traffic noise from the street below but after walking our legs off all day we had no trouble sleeping. The hotel is located close to public transport and it was only a short bus ride to Circular Quay. As in many big cities, the area around the central train station is often not the most salubrious part of town and we found that to be the case here. On Friday and Saturday nights the surrounding precinct seemed to have its fair share of vagrants, drunks and the 'ill at ease' but then again maybe that's just Sydney ! It wasn't a real concern for us as we were out and about with a group of Sydney friends but it may be a concern for older travellers and those travelling on their own. We thought that the hotel was good value, transport is handy and the friendly helpful staff were a plus.

<Content>Couldnt have been better! I recently had an appointment in Sydney. I booked this Hotel for 4 nights, and I was highly impressed!The staff were friendly, courteous and professional and I really appreciated their assistance with all the questions I had for them. I also appreciated the free newspapers every day. I had an executive room with a cloud king sized bed, which was incredibly comfy, and the room was newly refurbished, with modern, muted colours and very clean. I WAS on the 4th floor....yes, that floor that has the pool on it, but I never once smelled any chlorine and I have to say it was very handy to hop out of the pool, put my waffle weave dressing gown on (supplied by the hotel) and wander down to my room!It was in a VERY convenient spot (about 5 mins walk from Central station) and we walked to Chinatown for dinner, to the markets and a host of cafe's and shops in the area. The last night I was there, I had a Thai massage which was absolutely fantastic. The massage ladies were really lovely and they did a great job of getting rid of those sore areas (especially on my back) with professionalism and good humour.I would absolutely recommend this hotel and I will be back!!Monica McSween

<Content>Let down by lacking communication (of all types) Booked this hotel based on prior reviews and fantastic location in relation to proximity of Central Station.Upon first impressions the room looked modern, spacious and clean and the reception was friendly.Visit was spoiled by issues with Internet Connection in the hotel rooms and the failed attempts by the front desk staff to communicate the issue and to provide resolution.Management where not responsive to requests and suggestions around improving the front desk processes to ensure business travelers where aware of known internet connection errors up front and to ensure staff where advised of help desk details to pass on to guests (only received the Sebel IT help desk number after 3 calls to the front desk).Would have given the hotel another chance once refurbishment was complete...won't after my experience with the staff.

<Content>Decent... If the rate is good A good, central option if you get a good rate... I paid about $140 AUD for the night and it was close to central station (great access by train from airport), close to the entertainment districts and most other areas of Sydney you'd want to see.Room smelled a little stale - almost as if it used to be a smoking room, but bed was comfortable...TV had poor reception and the decor of the hotel looked a little dated. Foyer and reception looked very inviting though.Spent little time in the room, and would recommend if you were going to use this hotel as a base, rather than spending too much time in it.

<Content>Good value if you book online We booked with a website called not 1 nite and we got the room for $130AUD per night.From reading the other reviews, it looks like they tell everyone the get a free upgrade as we were told the same thing as soon as we checked in. The hotel has some minor renovations happening at the moment but other than that, this is a fantastic place to stay in Sydney. The facilities are modern and the renovated rooms have all the mod cons that you would expect from a Sebel hotel. The only points that I was disappointed with were the expensive Internet connection in the room ($25 per day) and the quality of the food could be improved as well, the pizza was very poor and the desert came out of a frozen packet cake. The gym is a waste of time and has limited equipment in it. The treadmill sounded like is was being strangled to death and the there were only 6 different weights exercises available. Other than that the staff were very friendly and it is located right next to central station in Sydney which makes it easy to travel to on the train from the airport. It took us between 15 to 20 min to walk from the Citigate Sebel to Circular Quay and Darling Harbour so it is not far out of downtown Sydney at all. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and recommend that you make use of the pool, sauna and spa too for a night there.

<Content>Nothing special The best thing about this hotel is the location. Very central to everything and close to Chinatown for some great restaurants.Very average room, adequate but nothing special.Reception staff not very helpful and didn't even have a city map to help us.Managed to get a cheaper rate on a last minute site, so ended up pretty good value for inner city.

<Content>Good Value We booked this hotel through lastminute for a cheap price of around $130 a night. On check in we were told we'd been upgraded to an executive room, however it looked pretty standard to us. Recently refurbished it was still a little rough round the edges (no toilet roll holder?) and drafty windows. The main problem with the room was it was on the third floor, directly above what must be a bar or function room. Both nights people were stood outside talking and smoking. The smoke could be smelt through the drafty window, and conversations heard, making it hard to get to sleep.Other than that, it was comfortable with a small bathroom and large TV. Best thing was the location - only a few minutes walk to Central.

<Content>Hotel fine...but the service~! The Citigate is in a reasonable location and is quite well appointed. The room I stayed in was clean, well fitted out and very pleasant. On this basis, the hotel provides good value for money, at least at the discount rates available online.The service, however, was appalling. It was completely unprofessional and almost laughably inept.For example, when I arrived I requested internet access. I was told that this was available in the room (though the price, I should add, was absolutely absurd). When I got to the room, there was no cable.I rang downstairs and was told that one would be sent up. After half an hour, and very sick of waiting, I went down to reception to get a cable myself. After a long wait (both receptionists were in a nose-to-nose fight with a Chinese tour leader), I was eventually handed one. I took it up to my room....to find that my keycard no longer worked. Back to reception and more waiting.6 hours later, as I was just drifting off to sleep, the reception desk rang.....apparently, they were 'too busy to bring a cable up to me and could I please come down and pick one up?'. I pointed out that I had already been down (many hours before) to pick one up...and they hung up on me. Charming folk.Unfortunately, the whole stay was like this.Anyway, not a bad hotel and it would be a fine option for a cheap Sydney stay in a reasonable level of comfort were it not for the truly awful service.

<Content>Great hotel Stayed at the Citigate Sebel for 6 nights over New Year. Couldn't complain at all about the hotel, staff very friendly, facilities in the hotel very good, safes in the room whih was a plus. We were pleasantly surprised with a free upgrade! Central Station is across the road which is a main station will take you to most places, including Circular Quay  Bondi Junction. There's a bus stop round the corner which will take you there to. It's maybe a little bit out if your wanting to stay near the main shopping and eating hubs, but Darling Harbour is about a 20 minute stroll away and the buses take about 5 mins.

<Content>Loved the Citigate Sebel My family stayed at this hotel for one night and had nothing to complain about. We found a great deal on the internet but as we had to book 2 rooms with 2 different bedding configurations, found this very difficult to do thru the net. Called the hotel directly and explained the situation and they matched the low internet price  also included breakfast for us all. Rooms were spacious, the pool area great after a long drive to Sydney, breakfast was a real feast and excellent quality food. Would happily stay here again

<Content>Easy to get to location I stay in the Hotel once every month (for the last 3.5 years) for business and have never had any problems. The rooms have always been clean and tidy and have everything I need in them. The rooms have recently under gone refurbishment and all the ones I have been in now have LCD flat screens and new trendy bathrooms. I did point out in a feedback form I was given that they should have at least 1 full lenght mirror in the room, like they used too.It would have to be the easiest reasonably priced hotel in Sydney CBD to get to from the airport link train, get off at Central and it is 1.5 blocks away. I even take my family here now when visiting Sydney for fun.There is a secure parking garage ($10 a day) on the premises.Only thing I don't like about Citigate is it doesn't have a loyalty program.

<Content>Citigate Sebel - worth the money! A great hotel situated very close to Central Station - perfect for getting around. The hotel itself is clean spacious and all round value for money. We got a free room upgrade so I really cant complain. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. The down side is that the hotel is in an area that could do with some regeneration. This hotel is close to China town and within walking distance of the main shopping areas, including Oxford St so perfect for the tourist.

<Content>Basic...but does the trick! My overall experience with this hotel was nothing memorable, but ideal for anyone on a budget and has basic needs. The exterior is pretty plain on the outside. The reception area is simple and basic. Some areas of the hotel look a little dated, but still looks like some effort has been made to maintain it.The room itself is pretty standard, with all the essentials of a room. Again, nothing too flash, but comfortable enough. The bathroom was nice and clean. The room had a window, but given its location, there is truly nothing to see outside.The hotel is located near Central station, which isn't much use unless you need to travel by train somewhere on a regular basis. Plenty of buses just close by as well. Chinatown is a nice easy walk. The city centre is a little bit more of a walk, about 10 minutes away. Overall, this is a decent hotel for a 3 star standard. It does the trick, if all you're looking for is a bed and access to the city.

<Content>Disappointing I stayed at the hotel a couple of years ago and was very happy. This time was probably the last time...I asked for a quiet room and was given a room next to the elevator (a colleage checking in at the same time was also given a next-to-the-elevator room). So I went back to the reception desk and requested a different room. I got a room on a higher level which appeard to be fine apart from a disgusting looking ironing board I asked to be repleced. When returning to the hotel a few hours later the whole floor was incredibly noisy. Imagine you're in a small room and someone is vacuuming... the friendly reception guy gave me a room just opposite the hotel's aircon which turns on and off periodically! The next room (3rd attempt) was better but nothing exciting. Noise insulation of the front door is almost non-existant. Almost like participating in every bit of waiting-for-the-elevator chatter. The pool/sauna area was closed for renovation but this was not disclosed when booking the rooms! Using another hotel's facilities was possible but no sauna either and a 20min walk away.

<Content>Good overall experience We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights over the weekend. We live in Adelaide, Australia and were flying over to Sydney to meet my cousin who was visiting from the UK. We were looking for a hotel for a weekend away that was handy for all the attractions and not too expensive and I think we found it.We had previously stayed at Simpsons at Potts Point in Sydney (number 1 on trip advisor) and we were surprised to say overall we found it comparable. Although it does not have the individuality and charm of Simpsons, the staff were all very friendly, the hotel seemed well maintained and there was a good selection at breakfast (although I agree with a previous report that the cooked breakfast items are only luke warm). The hotel also seemed very quiet when we were there even though there were plenty of guests at breakfast and in reception and we had a great couple of nights sleep.The location in relation to the train station and airport are great, only a 10 minute train ride from the airport.We were booked into a deluxe room but on arrival we had been upgraded to an executive room (not sure why) which was spacious, had a sofa and a chair in and a massive bed. Having read previous trip advisor reports on the hotel and the comments on the chlorine smells from the swimming pool I asked not to be put on the 4th floor and explained why and the receptionist smiled as though she knew what I was talking about.The only negative comment was the shower was fixed on the wall and was not very high. My boyfriend and I are both tall people and especially my boyfriend struggled slightly when having a shower, but this would not put us off returning.Overall a good value experience for a weekend away and we would return again.

<Content>Improvement needed This was the second time I stayed here. The first, a year ago was okay. This time wasn't up to scratch. The phone in the room didn't work and couldn't be fixed. The staff were cleaning my room before I had checked out even though my bags were still in the room. The hot food at breakfast was only luke warm. Mine may have been a one off bad experience but it was disappointing. The apology was sincere but I wasn't sure the problems would be addressed.

<Content>Good location, nice facilities Stayed for two nights begining of June 2007.After staying at a 5star hotel 2 nights prior (see my Shangri La review), could notice the difference in hotel ratings.The room was large and comfortably furnished although the lack of valance around the bed made the room look a little cheap(which it wasn't). It was a 'refurbished' room (not sure which decade that occurred in).Pool, Sauna  spa facilities were in great condition and well serviced (better than Shangri La in my opinion).Staff were friendly, courteous and helpful. Had a couple of issues with the access card failure. I did notice in the lift that there was no security and anyone could travel to any level.Location was handy to everything and quiet, so would suit over 30's weekends away and business travelers.What I didn't appreciate was the false fire alarm at 7am on a Saturday morning. Having said that, the siren was loud within the room and could have waken the dead :-)A good overall experience and would recommend.

<Content>Great Sydney Weekender Brilliant choice of hotel for our weekend in Sydney. Excellent location for all public transport and shopping. Reasonable rates but paying an extra $10 for an upgraded room on a higher floor was definitely worth while. Plenty of choices for food and bars nearby so didnt try the hotel restaurant. Very helpful concierge and reception staff.

<Content>Citigate Good Standard Good Location Satyed at this hotel on 2 separet occasion for 4 then 3 nights after going out to the Blue Mountains. The location is excellent - its a short walk to Darling Harbour and the Bus route to ferries runs at the corner of the road. The main train station is just up the road and depsite being so close to everything its still pretty quiet. We stayed with a breakfast included which was a buffet style but hot plates for the bacon and sausage and other full english items. staff were polite and helpful - not that we had many problems - apart from when we left - although prepaid my credit card got charged for the stay - a quick phone call sorted it but something to watch for. all in all a good hotel the best ones are down by the harbour but if your looking for slightly cheaper but within reach - this hotel although basic is worth a look.

<Content>I found Citigate Sebel to be fine Stayed here while on a business trip and the hotel was booked for me so I was apprehensive after reading earlier reviews. However I was pleasantly surprised by a very clean and comfortable room. It was a larger room than many others I have stayed in and quite OK for my stay. Service from the staff was consistently good and it is close to Central Station which was only a 10 minute ride from the Airport.Not where I would choose to stay for a romantic weekend but more than happy to use it for business visits.

<Content>Rooms Smelled of Chlorine We booked a standard room and were extremely disappointed to check in and find that our room smelled strongly of chlorine -- it was on the same floor as the pool. When we complained at the front desk, a hotel representative snootily told us that there were no other rooms available and that a room like that was their standard. Then he turned his back on us. Despite that we had already paid for our hotel stay, we decided that it was better not to risk our health in a room smelling of chlorine and checked out that same day. Good thing we were still able to get a booking at Sofitel Wentworth. It was only upon hearing that we were going to check out that the hotel representatives offered us an alternative room. Apparently they were not fully booked as they originally claimed. We did not accept.

<Content>id go back here I really loved the Citygate Sebel. I stayed for one night, and we booked this hotel for the locaiton. Its really easy to get to from central station.The room was quite nice, very clean and we had a large balcony.The indoor pool and spa were great. There is an atrium next to them and you can get access to the roof from this area.overall, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back.

<Content>Smelly, dirty, stuffy... I stayed for one night at this hotel in January. In Australia that's the middle of summer.I had asked for a non smoking room, but somehow ended up in a smoking room. When enquiring about being moved to a room I was advised that wasn't possible. This despite the vacancy being advertised outside of the hotel.On top of that I was on level 4, outside the swimming pools. Unfotunately the rooms aren't adqueately sound proofed to block out the noise of teenagers dive bombing in the pool.I attempted to get the airconditioning to work to no avail. When I rang down to reception (again) they treated me like I was stupid and told me how to use the remote control. Upon explaining that I had tried that already they finally agreed to come up and take a look. After about 1/2 an hour of hanging out of the ceiling it was declared that the system was broken. I was told they would be back shortly to fix the problem. Sure enough they were, with a screwdriver. To unbolt the windows and open them so I could have some air. Along with that came all the Sydney city traffic noise.The room itself was dusty and gave me horrible hayfever as a result.I would never stay here again and must say that I was thoroughly disappointed.

<Content>Need to fix up the basics! I got a deal off Wotif to stay at the Citigate Sebel when going to Sydney for the Australia Day Long weekend. I have used the Citigate before so knew that it wasn't a five star. The room was nice but was pretty annoyed that basic expectations weren't met. Firstly, our access key didn't work properly - the light went green but the door wouldn't release- not a big problem until you come home late and then have to go down to reception and get them to come up and help you get into your own room. We weren't the only ones who had this problem, we passed another couple in the hallway having the same problem as us! It took the staff person numerous go's before they could get it open either.Also our TV didn't work (well one channel was available, the remote wouldn't change channel and you couldn't change it on the actual tv either) Called reception, they sent up someone with spare remote which wouldn't work either, so they said they would have to get maintenence to come up and fix it but couldn't guarantee how soon it would be done! Filled out a feedback form just to let them know that these were the only things we weren't happy about and asked them to call us - a month later and still nothing.......

<Content>Disappointed to Say the Least I have stayed at the Citigate before and felt good enough about these visits to return to the hotel last week. After this visit I feel very different about this hotel.I checked in at 11.30pm after a 15 hour flight from the US. I was handed a key for a room on the 3rd floor. On opening the door to the room I was greeted with the most noxious smell of stale cigarette smoke you can imagine. Yuck! It didn't occur to me to have to ask for a non-smoking room as EVERY hotel I stayed in during the past four weeks was completely non-smoking. I guess I could have called down to ask for a different room but I had already been told that more than half of the hotel had lost its air-conditioning due to a fault in the system, just what you need on a balmy summer's night!I agreed with myself to live with the stench as I would only be in the room for 12 hours or less. When I finally got into bed I found that one of the pillows was dirty as the cover had not been changed. I could smell the BO of someone else on the pillow! In the morning I discovered that there was no soap provided for the shower, nor was there any conditioner for the shampoo. To add insult to injury, there was no pen to complete the guest comment card which had been left strategically on my pillow! How ironic??When I checked in the very polite staff member asked if I would like to partake of a buffet breakfast in the morning for $15, I agreed and he explained that he would add this to my bill, all I had to do in the morning was tun up at the hotel's restaurant which I did in the morning. I was greeted by a less than polite maitre de who challenged my right to breakfast. I explained what had happened on the previous evening and he very authoritatively stated that he would need to check me out. Obviously he thought I was trying to scam him. By the way, the breakfast was very enjoyable with the best coffee I think I have ever had at a breakfast buffet. I kid you not!Anyhow, this whole experience left me feeling very jaded and determined not to return to this hotel. And I agree, this place would be lucky to score a 3 star rating, I think it deserves a 2 star at best! The room I had left me feeling like I had entered a very basic and poorly maintained motel in a backwater. There are a lot of hotel choices in Sydney which offer a far superior level of service and standard of accommodation, make sure you use them!

<Content>Average - but value for money and we enjoyed our stay Stayed here for a Fri and Sat nite with my partner in early Feb.Hotel is adequate 鈥?not particularly brilliant, but nothing much wrong with it either.Area is fine and seems quite safe. Hotel is located right near the corner of Elizabeth and Albion and buses go past the front door鈥bout 2 mins walk around the corner to Central station. About a 10 minute walk (up hill) to Surrey Hills to Bars, Restaurants shops etc.Staff were more than accommodating and friendly鈥?Were very gracious in storing our luggage after we checked out 鈥?and again when we return to collect a pair of shoes out of our bag. Staff member went to great lengths to hail us a cab on Saturday evening to which we were most appreciative.Our room itself was very nice鈥pacious, modern furnishings, clean carpet and linen, bed was comfortable 鈥?bathroom was modern. The only complaint regarding room would be that the water pressure in the shower was terrible and the shower head was far too low. Cable TV channels, playstation and internet access was great.We were allocated probably the worst room possible location wise 鈥?directly in front of the elevators (people in elevator could see into our room as we opened the door), on level 4 which is the pool level, and consequently we had tiles rather than carpet in front of our room which cause a few noise issues. We also have a drinks machine right beside our door. Breakfast was fairly standard 鈥?hot items: scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, potato etc then cold items, breads, cereals, pastries, fruit, yoghurt etc. We only paid $10 each as part of our room for breakfast 鈥?and I wouldn鈥檛 bother if you are charged any more than this 鈥?you can get something much nicer for about $15 in a local caf茅. Staff were friendly and accommodating.Overall 鈥搘e enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider coming back. Next time I think we鈥檇 ask for a room that wasn鈥檛 in front of the elevators 鈥?being on level 4 itself wasn鈥檛 a problem.

<Content>Citigate Sebel is OK Good location; near the central railway station which was just a 10-minute train ride to all of the tourist hot spots. Hotel was fine--larger rooms and clean. Go to the corporate website for probably the best rates without prepaying. Good restaurants in Surry Hills within walking distance.

<Content>Acceptable but not impressed We stayed there for 3 nights. It is very convenient and easy to find. We think that it is only a 3-star hotel. We lived on 4th floor and felt a strong chlorine smell because of its swimming pool.The room is acceptable. It is clean but not beautiful.The breakfast buffet is ok. A lot of fruits are available.

<Content>Fantastic and cheap! The Citigate Sebel was fantastic! My boyfriend and I were on a very late flight from Perth to Sydney and arrived just after 6am in the morning. We went straight to the hotel and even though check-in isn't until 2pm, they let us check-in early - no extra charge. The staff on the front desk were polite and couldn't do enough to help us. The hotel is near the Central train station which saved us heaps of money on cabs (but good luck working out the train system!) There are cabs everywhere and we never waited more than 5 minutes for one.Our room was clean, light and airy. You can adjust the air-con if it's too hot or too cold; the bed linen was clean; there were extra pillows in the wardrobe; fluffy towels in the bathroom - two per person; we had a TV, phone and broadband internet connection; tea, coffee and milk supplies were topped up daily; the bathroom was clean with a huge shower; and the view of the city was great!I've heard that Sydney has a bit of a bed bug problem at the moment but I had no problems at all in the hotel bed. No itchiness, no bite marks, nothing. Breakfast was great. We had the continental breakfast included in our package deal and that was more than adequate. Fruit, toast, cereal, pastries, etc. It was an extra $5 if we wanted a cooked breakfast but we were happy with the continental buffet.The only downside to the hotel is that it is in the business area of town and is a bit of a walk to get to any nightlife as most cafes close when all the workers from the nearby buildings go home. However, the hotel is next door to a place called Cipps Bar  Grill. The food there was excellent, cheap and its open til late. All in all, I'd highly recommend the Citigate Sebel. It was cheap, clean and had really friendly staff. Would I stay there again? Absolutely!PS: If you go to Sydney, then I'd highly recommend Majistic Cruises - the lunch cruise was brilliant with amazing views of the bridge, opera house, all the bays etc., the Garden Buffet restaurant at Star City Casino, and the Skywalk on top of Sydney Tower - the dusk walk was one of the best experiences I've ever had!

<Content>Our Stay, March 2006. Assuming that a Ritz-Carlton is a 5-star hotel, the Citigate Sebel Sydney is a 2.5 star hotel - much like a Holiday Inn in the USA. It is NOT a 3 or 4-star hotel. Its location is abt 2 blocks from the Central Railway station and we never felt scared to venture out at night though it does get rather quiet and we never did stay out past 10pm. It is a hotel for budget travellers. Please note that all standard rooms (floors 1-4) are smoking floors. Non-smoking floors are an extra US$20 per night. The hotel is clean. Our room was clean and spacious. There was a small fridge, TV and we were provided 2 bath towels daily. Requests for service were prompt. We felt that the staff was excellent and polite. Do remember that you are at a Holiday Inn and be prepared to walk to the train station and to walk everywhere else. If you are looking for room-service, marble bathrooms and Frette linens, please look elsewhere. The indoor pool was small, heated and clean but full. The gym is a small but adequate room. Overall, we felt we got what we paid for but would stay closer to the Opera House if we ever returned.

<Content>Okay if you like to itch The location near Central Station is great, the price is good if you get one of their specials and the rooms are a good size. Overall it is an ok place but you can do sooo much better for the price.We chose a stay for five pakage off their website but since it was not working well (that should have told us something) we made our booking via phone. Their staff assured us that the price would be the same but we were overcharged by $100. They originally tried to overcharge by more than $349 They threw in breakfast to try and make us happy but considering the very average breakfast served it was not really a fair trade.Not all their staff are of much help if you need assistance (we were lucky that we knew alot about Sydney as we are Australian, I pity any international).Rooms are well air conditioned but the hallways can be stuffy and warm. The shower is over a deep bath, a bit tricky if you are travelling with someone older. The biggest reason for this bad reveiw is not the bad staff or stuffy corridors, or even the overcharge. The fleas or bugs in the carpet that bit me and caused red blotches all over my ankles and feet is the main reason. Staff were less than concerned, even at check out.In short, save the money and your legs, stay at one of the many other hotels in the area.
