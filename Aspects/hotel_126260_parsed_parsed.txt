<Content>Felt like a queen! I recently took my 2 daughters and best friend to New York for the holidays, and wanted to treat them to a first class experience. Let me first say, that I have stayed at several different hotels in New York over the last 10 years, and I have never experienced the quality and class that this hotel represents. From the entry into the courtyard with the fully decorated trees, to the elegant foyer and staircases in the entryway, we felt like royalty returning home! The pictures on Trip Advisor don't begin to show the elegance of this hotel. The beds were like sleeping on a cloud, they were so comfortable, it was hard to get up and leave the room each day. The location being so close to Rockefeller Center, and all the shopping one family could survive-the New York Palace Hotel is one to not miss. Although it took a bit of a splurge for us this visit, the deals can be found through Trip Advisor, and we will hopefully return in the spring just to be pampered again!

<Content>Beautiful Hotel This hotel is wonderful, it looks beautiful from the outside and has the interior to match. I contacted the hotel prior to our trip as it was a surprise present for my girlfriend and on our arrival we were given an upgrade......WHAT A VIEW!! Our room looked over St.Patricks Cathedral, amazing. The rooms were large and clean with a great TV and bed with a lovely bathroom with great toiletries. The hotels concierge were very helpful and always offered their assitance and the staff were very welcoming. If you want a beautiful hotel in a top location this is the one for you, I will definitely be visiting the New York Palace again in the future.

<Content>Lovely Hotel and a Great NYC Location! If you are spending Christmas in New York City, the New York Palace is a perfect location. It is across the street from Saint Patrick's Cathedral and a short easy walk to Rockefeller Plaza. (Note: If you wish to attend Midnight Mass, you must send for tickets two months ahead of time. We didn't know that, and the hotel concierge was not able to assist us with tickets.)We did have some trouble with our reservation. Our room was not ready early as we had requested, by one hour. It was not even ready an hour after check-in time. The front desk staff was not particularly accommodating, but the night manager was called after my complaints, and he offered us an upgraded room that was ready immediately. This was very nice, but still a bit disappointing. Our original reservation was for adjoining rooms with friends we had not seen in quite awhile. In the future we will make our request more urgent, and it should be noted that rooms on the west side of the hotel (32nd floor) have fantastic views. The east side on that same floor looks at a brick wall.The hotel lobby was very comfortable and a fun place to people watch. The Christmas decor was elegant and the outside lights and trees were better than Rockefeller Plaza. This hotel had several great photo spots!The concierge desk made reservations at a very nice restaurant in the theater district for us. We noted that they often recommended premium seating and high priced eateries, but this one, Bistro Milan, was perfect. We tipped the concierge who assisted us, but most people did not. We wondered if this was because so many of the hotel guests were from other countries where tipping is handled in a different manner.It is a busy place, and meals at the hotel can be very pricey. We chose a deli around the corner for breakfast, but we enjoyed dinner at Istana, the hotel restaurant in the lobby, which had delicious food, and was great for people watching. We will try the more formal restaurant, Gilt, on our next trip.The rooms were lovely and well appointed with robes, slippers etc. The housekeeping staff did an excellent job. They were always courteous, quick, and efficient. Turn down service in the evening was a nice touch, with robes on the bed, ice, and chocolates. The bed and linens were comfy and felt very clean. The pillows and duvet were excellent, and the towels nice and thick. Warning: don't pick up the goodies in the refrigerator or on the bar. When lifted up, a scale makes note and you will be charged.Parking was pricey but convenient. Once parked, you could not take the car in and out without extra expense, but driving was not necessary. We walked to some excellent restaurants, stores, and the theater. This hotel really has a great location. It's close to Times Square as well, but it offered a much quieter and more elegant atmosphere. The few times we wanted a cab the doormen had them waiting for us.Overall, our stay was very nice. The hotel was beautifully decorated, elegant yet comfortable. It was a busy place, but not so busy that one would be overwhelmed. There was lots of security, some very obvious. We will put this hotel at the top of our list when planning our next trip to NYC.

<Content>Wonderful time at the palace. Stayed at the palace for 4 nights and can't fault a single minute we were there. My partner booked the trip as a suprise for me and prior to arriving e mailed the hotel to inform them the trip was for a special reason (proposal). They e mailed him back saying they would try to give us an upgraded room with a good view. On arrival we were put in a room with a fantastic view of the cathedral and also upgraded our room only package to include breakfast every day.Room was a really nice size, although mini bar pricy so we bought drinks from local shops and took them back to room. On 1st night we had complimentary bottle of water and chocolate covered strawberries left in the room with the turndown service. Molton Brown toiletries were replenished twice a day with maid service and room always spotless.Reception staff, doormen and concierge always polite and friendly when we were on our way in and out during the day.Hotel location brilliant. Within 10 minute walk in various directions of Broadway, Times Square, Central Park, Grand central station and Rockafeller Center. The Empire state building only 20 minutes walk too.All in all fabulous time had by us both and would never stay anywhere else in New York.

<Content>The Palace Concierge Saved the Day I did not stay at the Palace Hotel but I was so impressed with the service when I had breakfast there that I was moved to write a review. At the end of breakfast at the Istana which is in the lobby area, my four year old girl decided the world was ending because her candy cane broke. She was crying uncontrollably and disrupting pretty much the entire lobby area. I hustled her out the front door to try to calm her down. Immediately the concierge (named Bitan I believe) came out and talked to my daughter until she was calm. He brought her a cup of water and a teddy bear and the tears were forgotten. They were so kind and helpful that I would stay at the Palace next time I'm in New York.

<Content>Exceeded expectations Although I asked for a room with double-beds, because priceline only had 2 guests instead of 4 (our kids), they booked a room with a king bed. The hotel was very accomodating, although they did not have any rooms w/double beds, they gave us an extra large king room with 2 cots for the kids. It worked out great! Staff VERY accomodating, got a deal on the room, and was convenient to everything. (Be careful, everything in this hotel is expensive--Parking $50/day, internet, spa, etc.--we could not even afford to eat in the hotel's rstr's). The view of St. Patrick's cathedral was out of this world, not to mention the view down 50th (could see Radio City and Rockefeller center!) Downstairs on the subway level of Rockefeller Center were plenty of places to eat (cheap), including a Starbucks, and had a great view of the ice skating rink. Best Christmas vacation ever.

<Content>The Palace is still a Palace The New York Palace is indeed one of New York麓s top hotels. I stayed there last June for a few nights and from the moment we walked through the front door we were treated like rayalties. Although we walked in wearing Jeans and cardigan we were treated with dignety and rescept and one never got the feeling that that the staff look down on you whatever you were wearind, something that does happen at some grand luxury hotels. We stayed in a deluxe king corner room and the room was pleasing and it spacious decour made it fell lager than it麓s 350 something square feet. Both the common areas of the hotel and the room combined opulence from a bygone era with modern amenities like in-room climate control and a 40 inch plasma.We ate at the Istana restaurant twice and although there was nothing special about the food, the swift and very polite service made up for it.The New York Palce in not generally considered to be one of New York麓s top hotels. People have told me that it麓s nothing compared to the likes of the Peninsula, The Plaza or Ritz-Carlton central park but I beg to differ! The location of the Palace is excellent much better in fact than the upper east siders (pierre and peninsula). The Palace manages to be a great luxury hotel without an attitude snobbery or selectiveness. Sure, it麓s not as glamorous or flamboyant as the Plaza or Peninsula but with glamour comes excruciatingly tight security and the occasional snobbery so for me the New York Palce is one my top choices for New York accomodation.

<Content>Lovely Hotel My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights over Thanksgiving, the hotel is beautiful and well located, we requested a view of the cathedral, which they gave us - it was amazing!, the room was spacious and beds extremly comfortable, excellent house keeping and lovely Molton Brown products in the bathroom - the only fault would be the overpriced lobby bar $15 +tip for a small glass of house wine, but i guess that is to expected of a hotel of this standard, also stay clear of the mini bar - unless it is on expenses or you are a millionaire! Apart from that our stay was great and I would love to return one day.

<Content>Fabulous hotel Wow! Husband and I stayed for a night this past weekend on a recommendation from a friend. We were able to check in early (around 12). Very friendly and efficient staff (front desk and doormen). Lobby is fantastic- decorated beautifully for the holidays. Gorgeous views of the cathedral from the center hall. Room was super clean and fairly large by nyc standards- i'll post a few pix later. Bed so comfortable- slept great! Good location- we were able to walk to TImes Sq - Rockefeller Plaza - etc... Absolutely would stay again! Small word of caution-- may have been an oversight but we were overcharged for drinks at the lobby bar. We ordered 2 glasses of Merlot. Bill charged us for 1 merlot $14 and 1 cabernet savignon $24. Restaurant downstairs is pretty pricey for just ok food- ie we had lunch - burger, caesar salad with shrimp and 2 glasses of pinot grigio for $150 w/ tip. egads.

<Content>Beautiful 2bdrm suite. Great location. We stayed with our extended family of seven at The New York Palace Hotel over the Thanksgiving holiday, for five nights. We enjoyed the towers portion of the hotel, rooms 4701 and 4702, looking east with a view of the river. The suite was decorated art deco style with a large dining table, living room, full bare catering kitchen (no place settings, flatware, pans, toaster, etc), and half bath in addition to each bedrooms' full bath. Free internet was provided by the hotel, I don't think it's free in the non-tower rooms of the hotel, but is in the lobby.The beds were extremely comfortable, towels large and fluffy and services offered were abundant.This is a beautiful hotel, close to Times Sq., Rockefeller Plaza and the Theatre district. I highly recommend the Palace for a wonderful NYC experience.

<Content>Suberb, can't fault anything! I have stayed in a number of Hotels throughout Europe and America and am confident to state the New York Palace was the best one I have stayed in to date.The location of the hotel is excellant with excellant views of the Cathedral and a short distance away from Times Square and Mid town. I found the location of the hotel was a pleasantly quieter area to that of Times Square.The entrance of the Hotel is grand and has the wow factor. The Christmas tree outside the Hotel was astounding.Having read previous reviews I was a bit worried about the lobby area so opted for a room in The Towers.The lobby area was nothing to be worried about, yes you had a lot of people hanging around, but this did not bother me or my party. The reception staff to The Towers were great, nothing too much trouble for them, the hotel room was brilliant, clean and comfortable.The entire trip was a pleasure, all staff were polite, very professional and nothing was to much trouble for them.I would advise anyone to go to this hotel, but remember the saying,  you pay for what you get.

<Content>Amazing Hotel For the final part of our honeymoon my wife and I spent 3 nights in the New York Palace.We had a fantastic stay in New York, we both love the city and can't wait to return.The New York Palace is in an amazing location with a beautiful views of the cathederal. We were fortunate enough to get upgraded to a room with a view of the cathederal from one of the very helpfull and friendly members of staff. As stated in previous reviews nothing seems to be too much bother for them. The room was really good and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept on.I can't say enough superlatives about this hotel. I would recommend the New York Palace to anyone staying in Manhatten.

<Content>Wish I could have stayed a month!! What an amazing hotel!! The staff, room service, and rooms so unbelievable. From the moment I arrived - I was greeted as family. Every Staff member that I came in contact with was friendly and very accomodating. My Room was beautiful and spacious. The Hotel was located next to everything and was very safe and secure. There is just not enough to room to write all the great things that I love about this hotel. I hope that I get to go back and I hope that it is soon.

<Content>The best hotel I have been to New York alot, but always stay in lots of hotels because i never find one that is right. Now i have found New York Palace, i will always stay here.The lobby is so beautiful, and special, i feel like the king when i was walking around. The rooms are also of a very high quality, and make me feel relaxed and happy after long day of work. Out of my window, i could see a magical church, and i thought that there is no better view in NYC.The staff are very good and they make lots of things happen very quickly...if you want taxi, there is taxi, if you want flowers, there are flowers...nothing is too much trouble.

<Content>Moderate stay at the Palace Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Palace. It was our first trip to New York. Room was spacious and clean. Bathroom small, had to shower in the bath tube. Can you believe this in a 5 star hotel??!! Perfect location. Short walking distance to 5th Avenue, Times Square and Central Park. Couldn't be better.But we were not happy with the staff. Unfriendly!! Furthermore, the hotel was very crowdy due to an annual global investment conference. Won't return to the Palace. Not worth the usd 500 per night.

<Content>Love the Palace! Just returned from a weekend trip to NYC to see the Christmas Spectacular at Radio City. We chose the Palace for our one night stay. You cannot get better than this! When we arrived the staff was so friendly, even making a big deal over my daughter who is 8. We had booked an American Girl package and she received the cutest little pink bed, pillow and blanket that she could take home. We even purchased an extra for a friend of hers! When we called to ask for one, housekeeping brought it up in an American Girl Place bag within 10 minutes of our request. Our room was on the 23rd floor, with a beautiful view of St. Patrick's. We were just a couple of blocks from Radio City, Rockefeller Center and American Girl Place so we could walk and shop and sightsee all we wanted. The staff was amazing, and the room was beautiful! Gosh were the beds comfortable! The room was large, with a large LCD TV, control panel by the bed for heat,air, lights, etc, and any request we had was taken care of immediately with such positive, friendly attitudes! A special thanks to Britan - who checked us in, and made my daughter feel like a princess! We left our luggage at the Bell Desk, and called ahead about 20 minutes to let them know we were coming and our luggage and car were waiting for us. The courtyard is beautiful, and the grand staircase........Thank you New York Palace for a trip to NYC we will never forget! We will definitely stay at the Palace when we return to NYC!

<Content>Excellent Hotel! After traveling with 3 kids ages 9, 10  12 through Europe for 2 1/2 weeks, our last stop was New York for 6 nights. It could not have been a better place for us to end our trip!! The hotel was fantastic and the staff was excellent. The doorman and concierge were very helpful during our whole trip. We obviously needed a laundromat after being in Europe for so long and the concierge recommended his, it was fantastic, my husband and I got to truly experience being New Yorkers! The location is unbeatable, we walked everywhere and the view of St. Patrick's cathedral topped off our stay. We went during 4th of July weekend so we got an excellent deal which included breakfast. Breakfast is super pricey so this was definitely an added bonus. We will definitely stay here again! My boys loved it!!

<Content>Pampering I went with a few girlfriends last March, and had a great time. A splurge, but worth it. The hotel was so well located and we walked and walked and shopped and shopped. It is New York, so expect to pay about twice as much for everything. If you keep that in mind you'll have no problem here. I have been to manhattan several times and always try different hotels. Not coming back will be hard to do.

<Content>Fantastic location Arrived here early afternoon. Got an excellent room with a view of the cathedral. Spacious (for NYC) room. The staff throughout were fantastic - nothing was too much truble.The best bit was the location - so easy to get anywhere. The subway just two blocks away, but most places of interest were walking distance away.Definitely try and stay here if I go to NYC again.

<Content>Nice but pricey The NY Palace is in a fantastic location and is very comfy - the beds are amazing - I wanted to take ours home!If you stay in a deluxe room make sure that you get breakfast included in the rate. Breakfast was tasty but expensive. We were lucky enough to have complimentary American breakfast meaning we could choose anything from the Istana breakfast menu. Breakfast for two can easily come to $100 - $8 for coffee, $10 for juice... that's $36 before you've had any food!We didn't use the well-stocked minibar since it was so expensive - a bottle of water was $10, the same bottle cost just $2 in the shop across the street (warning - items will be charged if you take them off their stands for over 30 seconds even if you don't use them!).We splashed out on the Palace for our honeymoon but got the feeling that we didn't have enough money to stay there! If you have plenty of cash left over after having payed for the room you'll be fine. It's a shame that the more you pay for a room, the less you get included! Other, cheaper hotels we stayed at on our trip all had complimentary water and wifi - not a big ask.

<Content>feel posh and stay here! Good location if you want to walk to the shops/central park and really easy to get to other NYC attractions.Great hotel, good food, room standard etc. But at this price, you'd expect this?Only annoying thing was having to pay $16 per night for wifi access. I mean. What a rip-off. Wifi is free now in every other hotel I stay in.even the $80 and below price.

<Content>4 Perfect Nights in NYC I took my mom to NYC to celebrate her 70th birthday. I looked at over 20 different hotels in the city and finally decided on the Palace for location, reputation and recent reviews. We were not disappointed! The location is superb and the check-in, staff, concierge, maid service, etc. were friendly and professional at all times. We booked a package that included an American breakfast each morning. The food was mediocre (w/ stellar service) - I would recommend many of the other little coffee shops in the area. There is a Starbucks across the street as well. The breakfast can run upwards of $80 for two people if it's not included in the room. Per all the other reviews, the rooms were spacious and clean - the bathroom was larger than most NY hotel rooms. The health club was large with state of the art equipment and a gorgeous view of St. Patrick's. The locker room and showers were great w/ bathrobes, lots of fluffy towels and a steam room. We went to 3 Broadway shows and enjoyed all of them! Our choices were The Little Mermaid, Legally Blond and Orange/Osage County. One thing we noticed is that it was really cold in all of the theaters so bring a jacket or scarf to wrap around your shoulders. The Palace provides a complimentary shuttle to the theater district at 7:30 each evening. However, it's only a 15 minute walk over to the theater district. We took the shuttle over and walked back. We did a self guided walking tour of SoHo and Greenwich village one morning and then went up to Central Park to walk around and people watch. We were also fortunate to encounter a huge street fair on Broadway that spanned about 5 city blocks - it was fun to check out all the vendors and bargains. Another day was spent with On Board Tours of NYC - we booked a 5.5 hour city tour which covered most of Manhattan along with a ferry ride to Staten Island. This was a great way to see all the sights and get acclimated to the city. The bus only accommodates 32 passengers so it was nice to be with a smaller group. We also took the bus up Madison Avenue to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. We had lunch in the museum cafe, however, I would not recommend it to anyone - 2 salads, 1 wine, 1 coffee was $75 - a meal with a memory but a hit on the AMEX. It's nice walk back to the Palace from the MET. We exited on the upper west side and followed Columbus Ave. all the way down and thru Central Park. We were blessed with amazing weather so we took full advantage of being outside. NYC is a wonderful place - We felt extremely safe wherever we went.

<Content>Can't get much more NY than at the Palace The location is superb, the staff is overly friendly and the building itself is a NYC landmark. If you are visiting NYC as a tourist, this place is worth the splurge. The rooms are modern and comfortable, but the best feature of every room is the OUTSTANDING view. Even the gym faces St Patrick's Cathedral. I would definitely recommend this to hotel to anyone. To see for yourself, I made a video of my stay:[--]

<Content>Big rooms, quiet and comfy beds. Good visit. I have stayed many times at the Palace for work over the years and it was fine but never wowed me. Was in NYC for fun last week and booked in for 2 night given I knew the rooms were spacious and it has a good location. After walking around NYC all day, great to come back to a a big room, big comfy bed and peace and quiet. Although didn't interact with the staff much, the guest service team were super efficent and helpful producing all the tourist info i needed. The Palace might not be an exciting place to stay if you want the latest NYC style or a trendy hotel bar, but when you want a good night sleep and comfortable place to decompress after a day out and about, think it fits the bill.

<Content>Loved it Our first time in NY and had been concerned with comments over size and quality of NY hotel rooms. BUT this hotel was lovely. We requested a high floor and had a great view out over the cathedral and to the rockerfeller building. Bed was huge, bathroom a little dated but lovely and hotel very clean. Staff very helpful and we felt very safe here. We got access to the gym changing room to freshen up before we came home (night flight) and I would definitely return there. Yes its not cheap BUT its location is excellent and I would highly recommend.

<Content>Would definitely stay at the Palace Again Great hotel, I would definitely stay here again. Even though it's a huge hotel, it doesn't feel like it. Everyone is friendly, helpful, and efficient (I stayed on a Tues-Weds). In its price range (I paid $385 for a week night on business), it was fantastic. The room was spacious, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and I had a partial view. It was quiet and the relaxing music already on when I got to my room, and the chocolates next to the bed were a nice touch. It isn't ultra luxurious like the St. Regis, for example, but in its price range it cannot be beat. For such a big place, they seem to put a lot of thought into making your stay comfortable and inviting. I already said it but the staff was really great - they handle your bags quickly, make change, get you to your room, get you a cab, all without being asked. It's great and a good location too. Only positives to say about this place (to provide context: my other recent stays are: Four Seasons Boston, St. Regis New York).

<Content>Incredible Weekend Get-Away!!! We had a remarkable weekend at The New York Palace Hotel. Interestingly they housed many of the folks from The UN World Conference so security was HIGH, but they were great about preparing us for this and it was not a hinderence. Acutally, it was kind of exciting. The hotel, which is a grand house and a modern hotel - amazingly combined, offers the old word style I was looking for along with modern/contempoary flare. I wanted to be pampered and I was not dissapointed. The staff were perfect and our pre-theater dinner at Gilt was one Ill remember for a long time. Our room was huge, comfortable and attention to detail was evident everywhere. The location couldnt have been better. Madison Ave, a quick walk to the theater but NOT in the chaos of the theater district which was great. Im in NY quite often for work and for the art scene, but this time I wanted NY to be a get-away, relaxing and restful. I've returned to NH well rested, with great memories and feel it was a great value.

<Content>No nonsense quality We stayed in September at the end of a multi location stay and found the New York Palace to be a great hotel.To be fair even if you are out exploring all day its nice to come back to something that is consistently good quality and comfortable.We only ate at the hotel once as we anted to try the different choices in New York but when we did treat oursleves to breakfast in our room it was very nice.The staff were very helpful and upgraded us to a room with an amazing view (to be fair I imagine all of the rooms have an amazing view!) the bed was really comfy and the room surprisingly spacious for New York, with great air conditioning.Good mid town location!

<Content>truly 'palatial' My partner and I just returned from a Labor Day Weekend at the New York Palace and everything was outstanding: the room, the service, the location, the bed, everything.I assumed NYC was all non-smoking, as is Illinois. When we arrived we were given a smoking room but we were quickly changed to non-smoking with no problem.The room was huge by NYC standards with a great picture window view of the city.Not inexpensive, but worth it.

<Content>Dissapointed Yes, hotel is grand and location is excellent. Still the general feeling in the hotel is more business-oriented than pure luxury. The concierges were always extremely busy (and to be honest not very helpful), staff in the bar and restaurant seemed a bit frustrated and room was nothing special. All in all the hotel lacked accommodating atmosphere - not a 5-star property when it comes to the level of service.

<Content>New York Palace: location can't be beat The New York Palace - formerly the Helmsley Palace - consists of a modern hotel tower built in 1980 above the historic 19th century brownstone Villard mansions behind St. Patrick's Cathedral.The public spaces are in the restored mansions, and are opulent - if a bit small. The aptly-named Gilt bar/restaurant off the lobby is a wonderful place to grab a drink and is dripping with Renaissance-revival gilding and frescoes.The hotel rooms are in the modern tower, and their size and price vary. Nightly rates climb for rooms facing St. Patrick's and for rooms on a higher floor. I recently stayed on the 39th Floor, in an Executive-Level room, and the views of the cathedral are quite spectacular.The bedrooms, furnishings, bedding, and amenities are what you would expect from a 4-star hotel, and are similar to a Ritz-Carlton in size and quality. The bathrooms are on the small size, however, and although immaculate and updated, probably could use a renovation.One odd feature in the rooms is an outdated control panel which rests on one of the nightstands. It must date to the hotel's opening in 1980, and I've never seen anything like it in another hotel. The panel has gold buttons which control all of the lights, air conditioning and heating, and even a privacy light outside your door. It might have seemed futuristic in a Jetsons kind of way in 1980, but is quite anachronistic in 2008. The light switches throughout the room are similarly styled and can be confusing to figure out.One small downside: The picturesque courtyard of the Villard mansions in front of the hotel has lately become a tourist attraction, as it is prominently featured in the TV show Gossip Girl. So you will often find yourself working your way past groups of tourists to get to the hotel entrance.Regardless, the service, location, views, and ambience cannot be beat.

<Content>Wonderful, Beautiful This was my first trip to the Big Apple and thank goodness a friend recommended this hotel. The minute you step in the door until you leave the service is wonderful and attentive.The location is great, just a few blocks from Time Square with easy walking to the Broadway plays. I really cannot say enough good things. My husband, son and myself agree on this hotel and would stay again without hesitation.

<Content>New York Palace , a good experience My second stay in New York this summer after a previous stay at the Mandarin Oriental. Honestly these two hotels are completely different in all the details. My favorite one was by far the Mandarin but just for main position I did prefer better the location of the New York Palace , very close to my main shopping favorite area and just a short walking distance from Saks. Everything at the New York Palace was right ; the Junior Suite Room in their Towers Section was very nice and quite large. Very comfortable room with a beatiful bathroom ( with Acqua di Parma samples , really Nice !! ).. While I was at New York Palace I did not try the hotel restaurants. I had just the breakfast. It was quite expensive with a very limited menu and with service slow and not particulary friendly.. So not a great experience. The people working at the Concierge of the Towers was very nice and very helpful , thank you. So a good experience in New York , not my favorite hotel for style and accomodation but nothing to complain about it.

<Content>Pure luxury for summer fun in NYC We spent two nights at the New York Palace Hotel as a special treat for our wedding anniversary. We do not normally frequent luxury hotels, but we were able to get a good deal (at least for NYC) for a weekend in August ($345 per night plus tax). The hotel most certainly did not disappoint! First, the location is wonderful---we generally prefer to stay in Midtown Manhattan because of its central position and proximity to the theater district and one of our favorite restaurants (Becco). This particular trip took us all around Manhattan, from Battery Park to the Upper East Side. We made use of the subway a lot and appreciated the convenience of the hotel to the 51st and Lexington stop. Before we even arrived at the New York Palace Hotel, I was impressed based on my experience of their customer service when I phoned in advance to inquire if there were DVD players in the rooms. I was very courteously informed that although most of the rooms do not have DVD players, an engineer would be pleased to set one up for us. This was great because we were able to watch our wedding DVD, which is a tradition on our anniversary (and it looked even better on the large flat-panel television in our room). When we arrived at the hotel, we were awed by the beautiful lobby and restaurant spaces, especially the main entrance, which faces St. Patrick's Cathedral. The view of the cathedral from the gilt lobby area is truly magical (made us feel as if we were in Europe). I had stayed in the Waldorf=Astoria for a bachelorette party the previous year, and although I found the common spaces there to be lovely, I'd have to say that the New York Palace beats out the Waldorf, especially given the view of the cathedral. We were also extremely pleased with the room itself---it was shockingly large by NYC standards and chock full of every amenity we could imagine. Beautiful wood and marble-topped furniture, a large flat-panel television mounted on the wall, a huge closet with lots of quality hangers and a full-length mirror, an extremely comfortable king-sized bed, extra-large fluffy towels and bath robes, a mini bar stocked with premium liquors and snacks, etc. We also always love those room-darkening curtains that make it seem as if you're in a cave even when it's bright and sunny outside (great for sleeping). The turn-down service at night was memorable as well (delicious chocolates). All in all, if you can afford to stay in a hotel like this, by all means do! You will feel truly pampered and will surely enjoy the central location as well as the historic opulence of the interior and exterior spaces.

<Content>Wonderful hotel, location and service I took my 9 year old niece and 17 year old daughter for a weekend in New York and stayed for the first time at the New York Palace. We wanted to be close to American Girl Shop/Show, as well as shopping and the park and this hotel was the perfect choice. They provided a bed for my niece's American Girl Doll and the service, friendliness, helpfulness, of all employees was perfect. The room was beautiful and we had a wonderful view of the Cathedral. It was a hot weekend, so we requested a fan and they immediately brought us a small air conditioner that was quiet and really helped with the heat. We ate breakfast and lunch in the hotel, really expensive, but the food was wonderful. I would not suggest eating breakfast in the hotel because of the cost, but there is a wonderful cafe next door that is reasonable. The beds were so comfortable and, even though they were double beds, it was comfortable for two in a bed. We would definately stay here again. Additionally, we saw Jersey Boys...awesome!!!

<Content>Oh My Goodness, Great Value! The New York Palace Hotel (formerly Helmsley) is a Grande Dame of the Upper East Side. Right on madison avenue across from Saks and St. Patrick's Cathedral it has a beautful courtyard out front. The restaurant Gilt for dinner is fantastic as well as the Madison Room for breakfast. The rooms are brand new and a decent size. Two big beds. View of the church and on a high floor. Great value for NY!!!! Definatly would go back! The staff and concierge were extremely helpful and friendly too!

<Content>Excellent Location - Superb Service Stayed at the NY Palace with my girlfriend for three nights in Jan 2008.When we arrived by taxi, we had a little trouble with the driver since he had no change. The bell captain immediately helped us out by paying the cab for us - which was a fantastic gesture in my opinion.Check-in was a little inefficent as they didn't find my reservation at first. Leaders Club privileges were not granted and my request for a room with a view was not observed. The room was huge by New York standards, the bathroom was great and the furnishings luxurious and tasteful. The beds were soft and comfy. The Concierge and the staff were friendly, professional and handled every request in the best possible manner. We always got the best table when table booking was arranged through the hotel.The bar in the hotel is great. Go there for a drink. Generally speaking this is an excellent mid-town hotel with fabulous service - I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Very good hotel We booked this hotel for a luxury 3 day stay in NYC, before going onwards elsewhere. We were not disappointed. Our room was sumptuous, the hotel interior exudes quality and the hotel lived up to its 5 star status. Staff and service were excellent. The hotel location on Madison Avenue is pretty good - 5 minute walk to Central Park, 10 minutes to Broadway and Fifth Avenue. As a City Centre Hotel, the Lobby was typically, - I felt - modestly sized. Our room outlook was, in the main, to the wall of an adjacent building, and on floor 23, with part views of distant streets below. In a City hotel however, this is to be expected. Food in the restaurant was excellent, though my only minor quibble is the restaurant lacks a little in ambience. As would be expected for its quality, this is a fairly expensive hotel, and be aware that in hotel dining is pricey. To conclude, and in summary however an excellent hotel which we are happy to highly recommend

<Content>WOW! Fabulous Hotel! My family and I stayed at the NY Palace for two nights. There were two adults, two teens in a double room. I can't even describe how fabulous this hotel is! From the moment we checked in we were treated like royalty.( We had just gotten off the train from DC and didn't look like royalty.) We were greeted warmly, given a wonderful room on the 9th floor. Although not a real high room, it was directly across from St. Patricks cathedral and had a great view of many buildings and the street. There was plenty of room for four people. We loved it! It was a little noisy in the morning if the window was open from the cabs honking but not too bad. Everything is first class, the furniture, linens, service, bath products etc... We have stayed at many fine hotels across the world and this was truly one of the nicest places we have ever stayed in. The location is great and the staff are not snooty as they can be in some nicer hotels. The beds are comfortable, room service was really fast and the food was great although expensive. The bellman told us if we liked coffee in the a.m instead of paying for room service coffee, he called and had them send up a coffe set up, which was a full size coffe maker, on a silver tray with cups, silverware, a pitcher of cream, sugar and of course coffee. Great tip. Also, the woman who checked us in told us that it cost 15 dollars to access the internet from the room, but that it was free in the lobby. So if we needed to use the laptop we just went down to the lobby and plugged in and sat in their very comfortable chairs. There were plenty of places to sit and to plug in. The hotel is just lovely and clean and well maintained. We were so thrilled to have found such a gem and can't wait to stay there again.

<Content>Very Nice Hotel This hotel is the nicest I have ever stayed in. I travel a lot and this one trumps all the others. Great location, great service, great beds. Rooms are very spacious, but do smell a little stale. The staff is the friendliest around. The wifi is way too expensive, but they offer free service on the first 2 floors and have lots of chairs to sit in. I would stay again in a second.

<Content>manhattan holiday My parents and I stayed at the palace for 8 days. The room was on the 15th floor. It was not too shabby. The beds were comfortable. Every night before I go to sleep, I had a view of St. Patrick's Cathedral on the foreground while Rockefeller Plaza was on the background. It felt surreal. perhaps it was best for a hollywood movie. didn't go around the hotel that much since 5th avenue was just a block away! during daytime there are lots of people walking around the area. especially along 5th avenue. but at night it becomes quiet. there is not much to do. no nearby bars or lounges to chill. since the hotel is near 5th avenue, the best time to go around that area is from 8pm onwards. its when all the tourist seem to vanish! there are tons of good restaurants in the area as well. just to name a few, gilt, four seasons, aquavit, le grenouille, figs and olives, etc. in the palace its all about opulence. don't expect some chic or comtemporary hotel. it is one of the landmark hotels in manhattan. just the entrance along madison avenue speaks volumes. its a bit uptight for younger people but older couples or businessmen will enjoy this hotel. my only comment is that they didn't provide us with complimentary water during our stay..overall it was a memorable stay.

<Content>Very swish! My partner and I stayed in New York for 4 nights en route to see his brother and wife in Austin Texas. We wanted to stay somewhere central and to have a bit of luxury and found a good rate online for the Palace. We weren't disappointed. For a first visit to New York, the Palace is in a good central location: close to Central Park, shopping on Fifth Avenue etc. However in hindsight we would probably have preferred staying in Greenwich Village or East Village - still central, but away from the noise (you can still hear those taxis loud and clear even 34 floors up!) and the hustle and bustle of Midtown. The Palace is an extrememly fancy hotel which deserves its 5 stars. The courtyard and lobby are very glamourous and the front desk staff very helpful. Our room was a corner standard room which was extremely large and had fantastic views out of St Patrick's Cathedral and double aspect windows which made it really light. The decor was classic and smart - not chic and trendy like a boutique hotel but very sophisticated. The room was really well equipped with a very cute little clock radio/MP3 player which had soothing music built in. The bed was very comfortable and huge! The bathroom was a little disappointing as it was a bit dated, but still very clean and well cared foor. The room was also impecably clean and the housekeeping was very thorough. They even left really sweet little touches like chocolates on the pillow with their free turn down service. All in all we were impressed by the quality and service of the hotel and would recommend it. I would however recommend taking earplugs if you are a light sleeper as you can here the traffic of New York's streets even 34 floors up and it is a constant presence all through the night!

<Content>Charming hotel We stayed here for 5 nights at the end of July, during which time we got married in the Empire State Building. We arrived at the NY Palace tired and hot after a long flight. The staff were very welcoming and friendly. When we arrived in our room, we were amazed by the fantastic view of the cathedral 21 floors below us. The amenities in the room were fantastic, particularly the Molton Brown toiletries. The health club was also very good and it is well-positioned for central park and the major shopping districts. Times square is a 15 min walk away. A word of warning though - the hotel bar and room service is very expensive - probably better to stay here and eat/drink somewhere else if you don't want to spend a month's wages on a drink. Other than that, fabulous.

<Content>Pure Luxury Enjoyed a fantastic long weekend in the New York Palace back at the end of May. The first thing you notice as you walk in is a real feeling of old world oppulence. The whole place oozed luxury. The next thing to highlight is that, to a man (or woman) the staff were the most helpful of any hotel I have ever stayed in. A special mention for both the bell man who offered, then organised to get our room changed for us to give us a better view (looking right over St Patricks which was stunning) and to the concierge service who never failed us, whatever the question was.I was expecting a small room having read various reviews about New York hotels but our room was very large and spacious, fantastically clean and looked as if it had been very recently refurbished.For those fans of Gossip Girl there are also plenty of familiar locations to try and spot.The location is fantastically central with Saks and the Rockefellar Centre only five minutes walk away.It was expensive though so would we go back ? In a second !!

<Content>Great Hotel How neat to check into a hotel when Secret Service has someone there- we never found out who it was, but that tells you who stays at the Palace. Great location, great service. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The noise from the street below was barely audible. The fitness center is nicely appointed and has a great view of St. Patrick's cathedral. The bar inside the Palace is really amazing.....go have a drink just for the experience.Great birthday stay at this hotel- I will never forget turning 29.

<Content>In need of refurbishment I stayed in the Palace in July whilst on the business trip. This is the fourth New York Hotel I鈥檝e stayed in and I would rank it as a middle of the road sort of place. The room was spacious enough, though the decor tired and in need of refurbishment. There was a stale smell in the room, coming from either the carpets or air-conditioning system. Given I鈥檇 had to take a 15 hour flight to NYC, I didn鈥檛 have the energy to ask for a change in room. The TV remote control was in a fairly dirty condition, being sticky (the thought of what was stuck to it fills me with terror!) and having had most of it's lettering rubbed off. The bedside light switch control box was in a similar sorry state. In fact, I was woken up 2x during the middle of one night by the lights switching themselves on. Luckily, the hotel management discovered that it had been due to an electrical fault in the control box, rather than my room being haunted! Being a lone businessman with a tight schedule, I often find myself getting back late and eating in the room when im away on trips(what a sad life). The room service was fairly efficient, though menu limited in choice and dull in taste. The food selection was also not cheap! The main plus point for the hotel was that the location was convenient for business and shopping in the mid-town area. The staff service was also better than the average in New York. Ranking the Palace versus the other hotel's i've stayed in so far in New York, I would say it is superior to the Waldorf Astoria (where the room size and condition was even worse), but lower than the Ritz Carlton, which I thought was excellent..... I cant remember the 4th place, but it wasn鈥檛 good. In terms of my own personal global rankings im still yet to find any hotel in the US that can touch anything in Asia in terms of quality and service. The only one which comes close in my opinion is the Mandarin Oriental in San Fransisco.

<Content>Great stay in NYC Loved the Palace. Stayed for three nights with the wife and 9yo kid on the 39th floor - incredible city views - executive lounge was great for breakfast, light lunch and snacks during the day, drinks and desserts at night - made the huge hotel seem small and private club-like. Food was good, also. Staff in the executive lounge were great, friendly and helpful, and the free computer usage was really convenient and useful. Room was a nice size - beds very comfortable. Cute little kid's sized plush terry robe was provided for my daughter. Bathroom, although small - was still nice. Great shower pressure and water temp. Small stain spotted on the bedspead on check in was changed immediately. Otherwise, the room was very clean.After a day of shopping, the nightly turn-down staff (inadvertently we think) threw out some boxes and bags that held unopened purchases - specifically most of the stuff that we bought for our daughter to go with her new American Girl doll. As soon as we noticed, we called the front desk. Security was at our door in minutes, and they quickly found all of the items in a sealed trash bag. We really appreciated their quick response, their repeated and sincere apologies, and I was just glad that we got everything back as it saved me a return trip to the store!Staff throughout the hotel were extremely polite and helpful - from the front desk which quickly checked us in at 11 a.m., to the bell men and door men who got us cabs and town cars in seconds. Only minor disappointment was the gym, which, although nice, was smaller (and more crowded) than I had expected. It still was convenient though to be able to get in some sort of workout without having to leave the hotel.The hotel is in a most amazing and incredibly convenient mid-town location. Sure its expensive, but we'd stay again for sure!

<Content>loved the new york palace We had an absolutely wonderful stay at the hotel in July. Wonderful staff from when we got out of the cab for our stay until we got back in a cab for our departure. Very friendly staff throughout. The room was wonderful, the bedding was extremely comfortable. We do not have a negative thing to say about our stay and we are hoping to be able to stay there again.

<Content>Absolute luxury Stayed at the hotel over the Easter weekend with 2 friends as a treat for my birthday. The hotel is fantastic. Really luxurious. The staff are very friendly and always helpful whether they are recommending places to visit or simply calling a taxi for you. The hotel rooms are lovely, huge tv, loads of room, very nice toiletries left every day in the bathroom, enormous fluffy white towels and the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in. We were left chocolates every night and the night before Easter Sunday we were each left a Lindt Chocolate Bunny. Such a nice touch. The location is excellent on Madison Avenue between 50th and 51st and right opposite St Patricks Cathedral.I would love to go back again.!!!!

<Content>Worth the money - and great location and service. My family and I spent a week at the Palace and from arrival to departure the staff could not have been more helpful. We were in the tower on the 49th floor - great room and view - spacious and fantastic beds and soft sheets. The bar is fantastic - a beutiful old gilt room - great for a pre-dinner drink or light food if you don't want to eat out. Lots of little extras and good turndown service with your icebucket filled. The rooms are expensive but worth the money and you can see that money has been spent on quality fittings and extras. To run a hotel of this size to this standard must take a good management team - I know as we own a hotel ourselves. I take my hat off the the staff - the whole experience was very professional. We then went on the Ritz Carlton in Miami - not a patch on the palace and very money grabbing with lots of hidden costs and food and drinks were very expensive for the quality.

<Content>Glam New York Palace We stayed here for 5 nights over the New Year period. This hotel is simply superb. From the moment we stepped out of our cab, we experienced true 5 star service throughout.The rooms are huge. Ours directly overlooked St Patrick's Cathedral and in fact, we could see all the way down to the Hudson river. The beds are extremely comfortable, there is plenty of storage space and the bathrooms are also nice.For me it comes back to the service though. We were celebrating a birthday during our stay and before leaving the UK, I contacted the hotel via their online concierge. I wanted to book a table at an exclusive restaurant, so exclusive in fact that it does not have a telephone number. You normally have to arrive at about 6.30pm and hope! I still thought it was worth a shot and to my surprise, the concierge came through for us. We had a fantastic time.If you are after exceptional service and old style glamour, then this hotel could be perfect for you.

<Content>A worthy 5 star Wow what a great hotel. I stayed here on business and all I can say is that is was one of the best hotels I have stayed at. While the room was definitely above average, it was the service that blew me away. I would definitely stay here again. We stayed on the 21st floor and had a nice sized room. I had no problems with air quality or attentiveness of the staff (and I called them a few times as I left some items at home). Also, everytime I saw a staff person they asked if I needed anything and how my day was going. Overall a great hotel, and it was a nice change from the standard NYC hotel.

<Content>Great location, great staff, but getting tired We were quite excited when we booked to stay at the Palace. Many of our high-end business colleagues had been long time fans and our expectations were set sky high.We were therefore a little surprised to find a grand hotel becoming a little tired around the edges. The rooms need a spruce up and the bathrooms need replacing. Similarly, the public areas had seen better days and the spa was worth a miss.On the plus side, the staff were incredible and the mid-town location is outstanding. The Gilt restaurant is really very good and the bar area trendy and Manhattanesque.For business travellers, the executive lounge is good with three pc's, large enough to avoid overcrowding and with plentiful food and drink (although my wife [--] about the fake champagne).All in all it's good, but not perhaps as great as it once was. We will nevertheless return in October.

<Content>Fabulous Service, Unbeatable Location First and foremost, the service at the New York Palace is fabulous. From the concierge to the laundry service and everyone in between, the staff was helpful, efficient, friendly and made us feel at home. The housekeeping staff was wonderful. We enjoyed the nightly turn down service as well as an exceptionally clean room and bathroom. If we needed anything, all we had to do was ask and our needs were met quickly and with a smile.Our room was on the 20th floor overlooking St. Patrick's Cathedral... a beautiful view. We all spent a lot of time looking out the large window. The bed and linens were very nice and were changed daily. We enjoyed being able to control the lights from the bedside table with a touch of a button. The bathroom was clean and nicely appointed and served our purposes well. We loved having a really great shower head and plenty of hot water. A vent fan would have been welcome addition.The elevators were fast and we never waited more than a few seconds to go up or down. Fresh flowers were displayed in the lobby which is beautifully decorated and well-kept. The historical aspects of the building appealed to us... The original part was built in the 1880's.If we could change anything at all about our stay, we would have to agree with other reviewers that the breakfast was expensive, but not of excellent quality. The service in the mornings seems a bit harried... Some things were very good, while others were just mediocre... not quite worth the steep prices. We did have one supper at Itsana and thought it was very good and the service was perfect. One of the most outstanding qualities of the NY Palace is the location. We were very pleased with the fact that we were able to walk almost everywhere we went. We were adventurous and took the subway once and there is a terminal just a minute or two from the hotel. We look forward to returning to the NY Palace in the future and have already recommended it to friends.

<Content>Outstanding Service I consider myself a world traveler. This hotel was outstanding for my stay from July 3 through July 7, 2008. Service could not be better. e.g.---I called from the lobby for ice to be sent to my room.By the time I got up to my room on the 33rd floor, the ice was there. The amenities were quite perfect. The Istana for breakfast, the bar in the late evening, the front desk, the houskeepers,the concierge desk---were all eager to please and I hope to return to the Palace again. It was my first stay. No matter where I was in the hotel, all employees seemed to stop and say Hello and can I help you?  The training of staff must be a huge task......and successful.I was able to get a good rate including breakfast for a 4 day weekend by calling the hotel directly. Our daily breakfast would have been quite costly (in my standards) if we had not had a package....

<Content>Overall good effort. Even in New York... For years the primary corporate hotel of a former employer, the Palace is where I sent and visited clients and family. After finally staying there myself for a week, I can report back favorably (and disagree with my mother's bellyaching circa 2002). It costs a lot at rack rate but the Palace delivers comfortable rooms and consistent service.Being a hotel guest in a city you've lived in for a long period is not representative of the typical traveler's experience. Expectations are higher because you know how to do things yourself, yet requirements are actually lower for the same reason. What impressed me under these conditions was how the Palace avoided the pitfalls of some other New York hotels I have suffered through: the staff were attentive rather than apathetic, the facilities were meant to be used e.g. the well-appointed gym, and the room was properly maintained and showed no ill side effects from its advanced age.The location is perhaps the biggest positive in what is clearly a top choice for both business and leisure travelers. I noticed a significant number of Spanish-speaking guests and I could see that many staff were equipped to serve them in their own language. This speaks well of the way in which the hotel is managed. It may not be a true luxury hotel, but neither are its rates. That suited me just fine, and I will be back for personal travel as well as for business.

<Content>Great Hotel, Amazing Location We stayed at the New York Palace for four nights in late June. The service was impeccable and the room was very well proportioned. Our room was on the eleventh floor and looked over the roof of another building. (Not a great view but if you looked to either side of the window, it wasn't so bad.) The beds were very comfortable and the linens were nice. There was a huge flat-screen TV in the room which was fun. All of the lights in the room were controlled by a control panel on the side table by the bed. The control panel was a little confusing because some of the lights couldn't be controlled by the panel, but we eventually figured it out. The breakfast at the hotel was amazing but a bit pricey (on one day, it was $82.00 for two people.) Breakfast was included in our rate but we went over the breakfast credit every day. (The orange juice was $10.00 a glass, no wonder we went over the breakfast credit!) There was a bit of a mix up when we checked in, we reserved a room with two beds and the man at the front desk said that the only room they had available was with one king-sized bed. (I was travelling with my teenage son and there was no way we were going to sleep in the same bed!) We insisted that we booked a room with two beds and that was what we were going to have. He eventually found us a room with two beds. Overall, the New York Palace is a great hotel and I would definetly go back.

<Content>Don't bother Think long and hard before choosing this hotel for your stay in New York. We stayed in the Towers section of the hotel. On the positive side, the rooms were huge, and there was never a crowd at either the front desk or the conceirge desk for the towers rooms (very different than the complete chaos in the other section of the hotel). The rooms were dusty and had an old building musty smell that they tried to mask with their cleaning supplies; we switched rooms to one which was somewhat (but not completely) better, but not what I would expect from a hotel with this rating. The manager was very courteous and was clearly trying to please (however, trying to get in touch with the front desk/manager was near impossible as the guest service line wasn't answered until after at least 20 rings.Don't bother with the included breakfast option- service was horrible, and the food not much better. Soggy toast, no butter, cold and slimy eggs, etc. There were many plates hardly touched going back as they cleared tables around us. Service and attentiveness at breakfast was at best a 2/10 (ie., very little chance at getting a refill on your coffee.)Having stayed at several other hotels that are part of the Leading Hotels of the World network, this hotel isn't close to that league.

<Content>Great location-but an expensive cuppa Joe! Fabulous hotel. Attentive hotel staff. Very convenient location.So-So- food and room service. Very expensive---If my memory serves me right I paid $8.00 for a cup of coffee. I would stay there again but not eat or drink there.

<Content>Good Choice Recently stayed four nights at the New York Palace.Location is faultless.Check in was quick and efficient although charmless. Receptionists face might have cracked if she'd smiled! Was given a room with the iconic view over St. Patrick's Cathedral so all was forgiven! Room was palatial and very comfortable. Exceptional beds with premium linens and plenty of closet space, large flat screen TV and good quality toiletries in the bathroom. Bathroom was not as palatial or luxurious as room which was a little disappointing but it all worked very well and nothing was lacking, plenty of towels too, if a little thin. They don't seem too bothered by the environment here though as they changed towels (and bedding) every day whether needed or not. Turn down service was very professional.Avoided breakfasts having read previous reviews but the astronomical cost was off putting anyway. This seemed not a problem to a lot of people as there were lengthy queues for breakfast each morning. We used the numerous delis surrounding the hotel to get a take away breakfast to eat in the room - sounds tacky but we were by no means not alone in doing this either!Public space is limited and rather gloomy being in the original mansion but still very impressive. It frequently got very crowded and uncomfortable. We had dinner in Gilt, the hotel's 'signature' restaurant also located in the mansion part of the hotel. There were seven of us and the service was attentive, presentation very good and there was an astronomical bill at the end and I thought quite frankly not worth it.However, enjoyed the stay and would recommend without hesitation.

<Content>LOVED THE PALACE!! Stayed at the palace for four nights and had an amazing experience. Yes, it was expensive (average $500 per night, not to mention nearly $60 per night in room taxes!), but for NYC it was not unreasonable. I LOVED the room, loved the location, loved the service we received. Everything was first class. It was a special occasion and I asked for a nice room - they told me to reserve a corner King room with a view of the cathedral. It was about $50 more per night than the standard room but it was well worth it. I asked for a room on a high floor since I am sensitive to sounds at night. They gave us a lovely room on the 28th floor - it was quiet and quite large - 350 sq ft. The bathroom was marble and everything was very clean. They brought a complimentary cake to the room since I had told them we were celebrating my birthday. The bed was soooo comfortable. All in all, a great stay. I would love to stay there again someday.

<Content>Excellent location The Palace's mid-town location is perfect for visiting Fifth Avenue and Rockefeller Center and offers relatively easy-access to Broadway (10-15 min walk.) Their package which includes parking and breakfast is great and they've always let us check in early. Also, concierge very helpful making special dinner reservations.

<Content>Welcoming and acommodating We traveled with our 2 yr old and wherever we were in the hotel, she was greeted and welcomed. The Executive Lounge is a great benefit. The locker rooms were comfortable, even though the gym was a bit small if you did not want to work out on machines. We would definitely return for their service and the midtown location.

<Content>Nice stay at the Palace Managed to get a good rate with breakfast with Expedia for Memorial Day weekend.The NYP is a great hotel with a good location. The room was large with an even larger TV. I had breakfast in my room every morning and it was very nice. However the breakfast is $120.00 for 2 people if it is not included in the rate which is very expensive. The only negative with this hotel are the extras as others have pointed out. Car parking was $60.00 a day and a drink being $8.00. I also called for a taxi to Newark airport and the hotel said they could arrange one for $170.00. I took a yellow cab for $70.00 in the end. I stayed at the Sofitel last July and would probably go back to the Sofitel next time as I found it better overall, however the NYP would come a close 2nd.

<Content>Good 4 * Hotel in NYC Stayed for four nights on a family trip to NYC - picked this hotel based on TripAdvisor ratings. Good sized room (incl large bathroom) for central New York and well placed for everything you'd want to do on a short trip. Staff mixed - some very friendly and helpful, others a little bit cold. Have stayed in top hotels around the world, both on business and vacation - this is a good 4* hotel but a good bit short of 5*.

<Content>Loved It! You Get What You Pay For It's expensive, but I saved some money using Travelocity. In New York, you have to pay for space, and at the Palace Hotel you get it. Our room was roomy, completely quiet, and immaculate, with windows that actually open (a crack), and a large bathroom (has anyone found a hotel room with a big bathroom in NYC for under $500?). Beds totally comfortable. Incredible view of St. Patrick's cathedral, awesome location near EVERYTHING. Giant hotel lobby with comfy chairs and piano player adds to the experience - much more fun than places with depressing front desk area. Hotel has a ridiculously expensive gourmet restaurant, and an expensive excellent restaurant. Internet access $16, glass of orange juice $10, in-room movie an insane $25 - pick your extras carefully. Staff extra polite to the point of being frightening. Disliked: room was somewhat hot even with AC on, and bathroom had no fan / vent.

<Content>Very Elegant We stayed at the Palace prior to a NYC cruise departure. There was not one thing we did not like about this property. The location is fantastic; the hotel is within walking distance of many of NY鈥檚 most popular attractions. The room was clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. We had an amazing view of St. Patrick鈥檚 Cathedral. All the staff could not have been more friendly and charming. Ana at the front desk sent us a bottle of wine because it was our anniversary; very thoughtful and a complete surprise. We had only one minor problem; for some unexplained reason the (flat screen) TV would randomly turn off and would not turn on again. We took it as a sign we should be wasting our time watching TV in such an exciting place. This is a premier property and it is clear that the staff truly cares about the comfort of their guests and is committed to providing world class service.

<Content>The best hotel in NYC!!!! This was my wife's 1st time to the city and our 7th wedding anniversary. The staff was terrific! Everything was smooth from start to finish. When we checked in, our room was ready earlier than expected. We had a wonderful man check us in and out of your establishment. He was very kind. We loved the chocolate covered strawberries that were brought up to our room for our anniversary. We were very suprised and thrilled. Our view was also amazing! They made this trip a special one.

<Content>A Real Palace The New York Palace is stunning in every way. The rooms are wonderful, really clean, spacious, and very comfortable, I can't fault them in any way. The staff are polite, helpful and although sometimes not overly friendly at first meeting, I found a smile from me went a long way towards making them smile more too! The location is fantastic, how near Sak's can you be? Central Park is a fifteen minute stroll away, Times square about ten minutes, and Rockefeller Centre literally across the road!Okay, it's expensive, but in this world you get what you pay for, and the Palace is definitely worth the cost!

<Content>Best stay in a New York hotel I stayed in the Palace during the last days of April, together with my husband, our son and his wife. We had reserved two bedrooms in the tower section of the hotel. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a two bedroom suite, which was fantastic and very big, with terrific views. The service was just incredible, everything we asked for we got it in no time, even a microwave!! We were assigned a butler (?) who showed us to the room. His name was Papa and was extremely kind and competent, and made our stay totally enjoyable. The only but is the price of the breakfast. Completely outrageous! But there are plenty of restaurants around. So, no big problem!Location of the hotel could not be better. We were walking almost everywhere. Check-in and check-out were very quick. And during our stay the staff seam to know us because everyone addressed to us by our names! So we hope to come back to this magnificent city very soon and stay again in the Palace.

<Author>Vacuum77
<Content>So called luxury with a huge price First of all I have to say that the lobby was astonishing. Unfortunately other things about this hotel weren't as good. The staff was extremely friendly. Friendly to the point that it seemed extremely fake. There was one exception: at the business center we got treated extremely coldly and arrogantly.I have been travelling around the world a lot and I have to say that the worst and the most expensive breakfast that I have ever had was served here. First the quality of the food, just horrible. I only once tried the continental breakfast which was included in our fare. It Included The worst tasting muffin I have ever had with few croissants. All this for a ridiculous price of 50 dollars for two (plus tax + 15% service). So after that horrible experience we tried the American breakfast. Not much better but at least you got your stomach full and of course had to pay more (64 dollars for 2 plus tax + 15% for the service). The scrambled eggs were tasteless and about half of the time cold. They were overcooked all the time. The potato rosti they had was also cold almost every time. And everything needed salt and pepper to taste anything at all. You would expect the food to be better quality or at least fresh when they prepare it just for you. Or that they should be doing but the quality of the food tells otherwise. Every breakfast buffet even in the cheapest hotels has been so much better than this. For me good food means better mood. So my every morning was ruined with this junk.We had our room in the 21st floor. It was a corner room so very spacious and nice. There was nothing spectacular though. The bathtub was small for two people. So no romantic baths together. The main complaint about the room was noise. The street below is very busy so bring your earplugs. I think the noise isn't that much of a problem higher up. Now that we are complaining I must add that the TV was extremely poor quality. The image was extremely distorted at the sides. I wouldn't expect poor quality in a 5 star place.As an American Express Platinum/Centurion cardholder do not expect too much of the room upgrade promised in the Fine Hotels  Resort -program. Although the hotel had a higher catecory rooms available we weren't upgraded to that (only given spacious corner room). After complaining about it they promised to upgrade us to higher room gategory but no amenities included in that room gategory wouldn't be given. So in our case it would have meant only a smaller room few floors higher up. So we decided not to 'upgrade'.So if you have plenty of money to waste and don't mind spending like crazy then this is your place. But if you want value for your money then you could choose so much better. One example of their outrageous prices was the use of internet. 19 dollars for 5 minutes of internet + 2 prints. One last warning that I can't emphasize enough. Avoid breakfast here at all cost!

<Author>ArgonautNY
<Content>Great, but not the same This was my second stay at this propert y and although the structure is beautiful and magnificent in its own right. the service the second time around left much to be desired especially after how well me and my fiancee were treated during our initial stay back in february. The difference was clear from the moment we arrived. Our first time there, there was a bell hop ready to help us with our luggage to the front desk and then get us to our rooms in comfort. This time around we were left to fend for ourselves.The evening turn down service is nice but we had a dandy of a time trying to find where the cleaning lady left the pillows (they were hidden behind the curtains). My next complaint was with the concierge, who you would think would be somewhat knowlegeable with the local area but when asked for a good place for an informal brunch type breakfast he was at a loss. They push their restaurant on you and the food is above average but the prices are astronomical and the portions are miniscule. Luckily I found a great place called Murals on 54 that serves a fantastic continental breakfast buffet for around 20 dollars and its just a short walk away at 65 west 54th street. Another peeve was that although there are all these options when you book as to what floor you are on and the bed selection they told us when we got there that they did not guarantee the bed selection (and yes i went directly though the hotel.) So be wary that if you only book one room and plan on having two queens beds between you and your travel mate, guess what you may be spending some time closer than you think. The rooms however are consistenly some of the cleanest around and yes I would gladly stay ath the Palace again, and hope the visit resembles my frist more than my second.

<Content>Great Hotel, poor Breakfast and Drinks service I checked all the websites for the best price then called the hotel directly and they were cheaper and included free american breakfast!The hotel is great, large room, beautiful lobby, convenient location.Negatives were, small bathroom, poor breakfast with small portions and lack lustre service.We were also disappointed when we ordered two Manhattan cocktails from the bar and they were so strong we could not drink them, so ordered a different cocktail and was still charged for the cocktails that we did not drink. Poor show.

<Content>great place for one luxurious night If you can afford it, I was great. Got a deal of ONLY 395/night==415 after the Javits tax, etc. For one night arrive early and ask for late check out. There is a wonderful deli across Madison--Reuben's which can outfit you with great breakfasts and fresh soups that you can walk back with.

<Content>This is the New York Experience you have been looking for This hotel is an absolute gem. Classy from the word go and the epitome of five star service.The check-in area was fully staffed so we got seen to quickly, the luxurious room had a spectacular view and we just couldn't find fault with anything. My only minor gripe is the in-room charge for internet useage. If low-end hotels can give this away why not these guys? ($16 a day)We took advantage of their executive lounge and the food was excellent as was the free wine. The views from the 39th floor were again incredible. We also ate at 'Gilt' which was almost flawless marred only by the loud, boorish lot sitting right next to us. Food was unique though.A very special New York experience which I can't recommend highly enough.

<Content>highly recommended Stayed at this hotel with my husband for 6 nights at the end of March in an Executive room. I would thoroughly recommend the Executive rooms, as you have access to the Executive lounge for breakfast and snacks throughout the day. The room was clean, the staff very helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. My only moan would be that the bathroom was very small, and there was no extractor fan, therefore everywhere got steamed up. Also, we kept getting the smell of cigarette smoke coming through a small vent from guests in the smoking rooms which was awful.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We were going to New York to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary. My husband booked the NY Palace directly and told them is was our anniversary and he wanted a good room. From the moment we arrived staff were friendly and courteous. Our room was on the 35th floor and it looked directly over St. Patricks Catheral, the view was just great. Our room was very big with Queen size bed, very comfortable. Shortly after we arrived room service arrived, the hotel management had sent up complimentary bottle of champagne and box of chocs, which I think was a very nice touch and very much appreciated. We stayed in NY for 5 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it, its a great city. The hotel is in a perfect location, within easy reach of all main attractions and of course shopping. The concierge gave us very good advise on places to eat. Would definitely return to NY Palace when I come back to NY.

<Content>Great hotel, great location We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The location is great for sightseeing and shopping. The New York Palace is just one block from Fifth Avenue and Saks. Also Times Square, Central Park, the theatres on Broadway, Grand Central Station etc. is all within 10-15 min walk from the hotel. We had a standard deluxe room on the 22nd floor, with a lovely view towards Fifth Avenue, and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Our room was really spaceious, and had nice dark wood furniture as well as a really comfortable bed.The room had a marble bathroom, with tub, shower in tub, and one sink. It was clean and delicate, but not very modern in style. The marble was black/white, and the shower/toilet/sink all had gold details. So maybe a little bit outdated in style, but really nothing to complain about.All in all we loved this hotel.

<Content>This is the BEST! This hotel lived up to all the reviews. We stayed for 4 nights in a deluxe room. My husband had emailed them a couple of days before to let them know it would be our 15th Wedding Anniversary. We were give an room with a wonderful view of St Pats Cathderal. On our 1st night they brought wine, cookies and the most wonderful chocolate dipped strawberries I have ever tasted!The conceige were fantastic and helped with EVERYTHING. Also any thing we asked for in the room was delivered in secondsThe location is great - basically I can not fault the hotel - the only small thing is maybe the bathroom fittings could be updated but that is a really small issue.Can't wait to go back!

<Content>loved this hotel I stayed at this hotel with my husband and 16 year old daughter.Check -in was very quick and a porter took us and our luggage to the 18th floor(not that we had much luggage as it was left in Terminal 5 at Heathrow only to be returned 2 weeks later)The view was ok , not on the cathedral side but that was fine. The room was very well appointed and the beds were extremly comfortable. We were out most days so the hotel was really only used for sleeping in and we didn't eat in the resturants.It was very handy for the Rockefellar Centre, Saks 5th Ave , Tiffanys etc .We were there for 4 days and loved it .Be wary of taxis back to the airport and ask the price before you get in .We paid $85 to get to Newark and we are sure that was too much as the driver was asking us how much we had paid when we arrived but we pre-paid our transport in the UK and naivelly told him this.All told a great experience and would most definately go back to this hotel

<Content>loved New York Palace we stayed with the whole family (4children age 8,12,14,16) for 6 days in this hotel and I really can recommend it. Our rooms where on the executive floors. Nice clean and spacious rooms with a beautifull view on St Patricks cathedral. with the executive rooms you have on the 39 floor a private floor where you have complimentary American breakfast. nice buffet (every day the same but enough choice of fresh fruits, eggs and pastries) .complimentary lunch is also a small buffet with delicious wraps and sandwiches, soup and dessert. really nice, meanly for businessmen but very comfortable for families also. great location on Madison avenue. Staff also very friendly and efficient. We definitely would go back!

<Content>Good Hotel for First Timers to NY First ,the negative:I booked an executive corner room, and when we arrived we were allocated a room on the 33rd floor. The lock was broken on the door and so we had to wait a while to be given another room which was on the 27th floor.We were not happy with this as we were paying for the executive floors which are above the 31st floor . It was late and we were tired so we agreed to use that room for the night. The following morning we got a message to say we were now being allocated another corner room on the 35th floor. why am I complaining?well the attitude of the porter was unreal, he used rude words about the lock , he was argumentative with me when I expressed my unhapiness about the room and at no time were we given any apology by a member of management. We were charged full amount for the 5 nights we stayed there nevertheless a gesture of goodwill would have been nice.The positive. Excellent location, executive lounge very good for breakfast and snacks /drinks during the day. Great view especially for first timers like us.Clean and comfy beds. Only for the above I would have written a glowing report.

<Content>Absolutely superb My wife and I have just returned from a five night stay at the New York Palace. Even before we left the UK, the hotel was extremely helpful in answering our questions and booking restaurants etc, When we arrived, check-in was swift and friendly and within minutes were were in our thirtieth floor executive room, which was spacious, extremely comfortable and well equiped with fine views over St Patrick's Cathedral. I would strongly recommend the executive rooms as benefits include use of the executive lounge, which serves complimentary buffet breakfast, drinks, lunch time snacks, tea, evening snacks etc etc. We ate at the Gilt restaurant the first night and the food was superb by any standards. We found all the hotel staff friendly and efficient and the food excellent. The hotel is superbly located. My wife and I consider the hotel excellent value for money and strongly recommend it to anyone visiting New York. We can't wait to return

<Content>Faultless experience, beautiful hotel........... Just returned from our first visit to New York and were totally thrilled with this hotel. From our initial check-in, I immediately knew we had made the right decision; charming staff, quick and faultless process, all requests met (non-smoking room, good view etc). The room itself was perfect - very nicely decorated, excellent size and totally spotless as well as a spectacular view overlooking St. Patrick's Catherdral. Our package included breakfast which is served until 11.00am, and was a real treat. Turn-down service included chocolate bunnies being left on our pillows (it was Easter after all!), and background music turned on for your arrival back at the room.The location was also perfect with a leisurely 15 minute stroll taking you to Central Park, and less than 5 mins onto 5th Avenue.If this hotel is available, I really wouldn't consider staying anywhere else. I can't imagine how the quality could be beaten, and at such reasonable rates ( we got 4 nights for the price of 3 as park of the New York Holiday Package). Don't bother wasting your time looking elsewhere - this is the tops!

<Content>Adored the New York Palace Visited New York for the first time last September and was more than delighted by the experience, especially the hotel. Staff were courteous, polite and very helpful. The room was superb in fact I could not fault this hotel in any way. I have travelled extensively throughout Europe and this was the best hotel to date.

<Content>NY Palace is Awesome! This hotel is awesome. I stayed here March 22-24, in town to see the Jersey Boys. This was a birthday trip for me, and the hotel had a birthday cake and fresh fruit for me when I checked in. I stayed on the executive level, and the lounge is to die for. The food and drinks, which are all complimentary for this level, were amazing. I look forward to staying here again!

<Content>Perfect in every way We try to get to New York a couple of times a year to shop. We almost always stay on Central Park, but decided to try the New York Palace. It was definitely a good decision to try this excellent hotel. Check-in and check out: We arrived at about 11 am and they were able to check us in and provide a room right away. The doormen and front desk personnel were very helpful and pleasant, and check in was a breeze. We checked out right at noon expecting that everyone would be doing the same. but we had no issue and were able to complete the transaction in minutes.The room: Space, comfort and traditional elegance. We booked a corner room, which at 350 sq ft, was large by NY standards. It had a gorgeous view of the Cathedral, and windows on two sides. The bed was very comfortable - firm, but not overly so, and the bed and bath linens were very nice. The shower had great water pressure and Gilchrist  Soames toiletries. Bedside controls for lights, temp and request for privacy. The room was quiet and we never heard any nosie at all from the street or other guest rooms. Instead of the keycards almost every hotel uses now, the Palace issues keys. I have no idea why this was such a nice surprise - maybe the novelty, maybe that it was that it was in line with the elegance of an earlier era. Hotel facilities: The fitness center and spa on the eighth floor featured cardio machines that look upon the Cathedral and are equipped with individual cable tv screens. They provide courtesy bottled water, earphones, towels and a full locker room. Though we brought our own, we were amused to find we could have borrowed athletic shoes and clothes had we forgotten them! The Gilt bar was quite an amazing mix of old and modern, with ornate high vaulted ceilings, and a thoroughly modern bar featuring a lighted scuplture behind one end. We ate room service breakfast, which was quite good (and available as part of a package.) Elevators were a bit slow at 'rush hour' but that is nothing different than most high-rise hotels.Location: It is a block from Saks and a short walk to some of the best of Fifth Avenue, including Henri Bendel and Bergdorf Goodman. But it is a bit of a walk to Barneys and the higher end boutiques on Madison Ave. Overall: This hotel was elegant, comfortable and provided understated service. They offered varied rates and packages that were on par with similarly rated and located hotels. We could find no fault with this hotel whatsoever and look forward to visiting again.

<Content>Fantastic Palace Just back from a long weekend over Paddy's day and this hotel is up there with some of the finest i have ever stayed in. The staff were all more than happy to help and always met us with a smile.The hotel is fantastically placed 1 block from 5th Avenue and about 5 mins from Central Park.Food was excellent, however, we preferred to eat out just to make the most of the trip.Great hotel but look around the web and see if you cant get it any cheaper than you find at first

<Content>Absolutely Loved it! My husband and I stayed there for our tenth anniversary in January and are heading back this weekend. The staff was amazing! My hats off to Stephanie (Towers Front Desk Agent), David (Towers Concierge) and Brian (bellman). They went over and above to make our stay special. The rooms are large and beautiful and the beds were amazingly comfortable for us. Our room overlooked St. Pats and we could see the ice rick at Rockefeller Center. This was a great location because we could walk to so many tourist spots. Room service was quick and tasty, staff extremely helpful and pleasant and the hotel a hidden gem.I highly recommend this hotel!!

<Content>Perfect Location...Best Beds in the City!! Arrived Sunday at noon and room was ready. Stayed till Wednesday 3/5. stayed on 22nd floor overlooking St Pats. Just past St Pats is Rockafellar (sp?) Center. You can see both clearly and they are a VERY short walk away from the hotel. the photos of the hotel are nice but they do not do it justice. The lobby area is busy but maintains a crisp look throughout the day. Management at this hotel is to be commended for its cleanliness!! The location of The Palace is among the best. You are 3-4 blocks over from Time Square, 5-6 blocks south of Central Park, across the street from St Pats, 1 block down from The Rock...Easy walk to get a cup of coffee and check out the Today show....I know..it sounds goofy but I have to say it was cool having coffee at Dean and Daluca and checking out Ann Curry and Al Roker...More so Ann Curry! There are 5 star restaurants nearby and neighborhood deli's around each corner. Easy to eat for $8 or $80.The absolute best part of The Palace was the bedding. I am not sure what they use or exactly how they get the bed just right but they have perfected it. The pillows are full but not too hard. The sheets are crisp and the comforters just the right weight. The room temperature was easy to control from the bedside table. Another neat feature that is not always found in 5 star hotels is lighting controls for the entire room on the bedside table. This place is hitting on all cylinders. All things considered..location, things to do, cleanliness, comfort, service, and anything else you can imagine, this could be the best overall hotel I have ever experienced.

<Content>Lovely hotel and great location Just got back from the new york palace. Stayed for 4 nights in one of their standard rooms which I have to say for new york was very good lots of space and very comfy bed. If you are undecided whether to stay in the standard or executive room I would go standard. You only miss out on a view and a breakfast. We got a very good rate with hotels.com 鈧?54 + tax. As mentioned before the hotel is perfectly located. We ate out the whole time we were there as there is so much to choose from. If you like your breakfasts and want to treat yourself, book the BLT market restaurant at the ritz on central park south. Its not cheap but is worth every penny. Breakfast was the best I ever had. Also for all steak lovers there is nowhere else but Peter Lugers in Brooklyn (15 min taxi ride). We were told this would be the best steak we ever had, having been told that about Smith  Wollenskys (very poor), I was a bit skeptical but they were right. Melt in the mouth so please do take a trip there but be warned you have to book a few weeks in advance, we could only get a late table on a sunday night, apparently very hard to get a fri or sat. The Gilt bar at the hotel is nice for a cocktail before heading out to dinner. We didnt eat there but it looked very nice.I would stay at the palace again, I found little to complain about. The check in area and part of the lobby needs a bit of an update but overall you will be very pleased. Enjoy.

<Content>Great Hotel Great hotel. Wasn't expecting too much after paying such a good rate on one of the last minute sites. After reading so many complaints about thin walls and noisy streets in a lot of the NY hotels, we were pleasantly surprised to find not only was the room quiet, but also extremely large for a deluxe. Add to that, a 42 plasma and a great view of St Patrick's church and we really couldn't ask for more.My only complaint was that the service wasn't great. When we first arrived, they didn't help us with our luggage from the taxi and they didn't offer to bring the luggage up to our rooms. The lady that served us was also rather moody and didn't raise a smile thoughout the whole checking in process. Having said that, we were more than happy to carry our own luggage to our rooms as it meant we didn't have to tip anyone. But for those who expect this kind of service for a 5 star, be prepared to carry your own bags. Overall though, if I did come back to NY, I would be more than happy to stay here again.

<Content>Great Hotel, Great Location The hotel was fantastic, the staff were very friendly. I e-mailed the hotel prior to arriving to ask if it was possible for a room with a view of the cathedral as it was my boyfriends 30th and wanted to make it special, they upgraded us for free to a larger room and the view was amazing - they even left a birthday cake in the room. We didn't eat at the hotel as there were plenty of choices around. Would stay there again. We had a late flight back home and the hotel looked after our luggage and offered us a room to freshen up before we left for the airport. The location is ideal - within walking distance of Times Square, Central Park, Empire state.....

<Content>A true palace in New York City This hotel is surely a palace, with the ultimate in customer service. My husband and I were treating my parents to the opera and overnight. Not only did the valet remember my husbands full name, but in addition the valet introduced himself to my parents, got there sir name and rememberd that at check out. The hotel rooms are large for NYC. The location cannot be beat. I would suggest asking for the bed and breakfast package, as this includes a full American breakfast in addtion to overnight valet partking. Treat yourself, you are worth it!

<Content>Fab weekend This hotel was recommended to me by my agent and although a little more than I wanted to spend I'm so glad I did. From the moment I walked through the door this hotel made me feel good. The room was newly decorated, large and luxurious. The guy that showed me to the room was welcoming and proud of his hotel. Lovely bathroom, big comfortable bed with the softest sheets and a great TV. They even brought me a DVD player within 5 mins of requesting it. Best hotel i've stayed in New York. Great location too.

<Content>Way Nicer Than Expected! Did an overnight here last month with my nine-year-old daughter. As a former NYC resident for 16 years, I was completely predisposed to stay at the Four Seasons until I checked on the prices--YIKES! Knowing that the location of the Palace would be terriffic for our theater plans and shopping, I booked a standard room at the rate of $295--same price that I would get on one of the travel sites, and less than half of what they were getting at the Four Seasons. Valet parking and check in were friendly and efficient. Room was a bit on the small side, but offered lovely views over St. Patrick's from the 24th floor. Bed was fluffy and comfortable, and everything was very clean--trust me, I'm very picky on that account. Amazing concierge was able to score us a last-minute reservation at Bobby Flay's Bar American. Booked on a Saturday night at 5:30 for a 6:30 reservation. Impressive. Room service prices were what you'd expect for a major metropolitan hotel--we opted out of the $40 continental breakfast in favor of a quick bite at the Dean and Deluca in Rock Center.Overall this was a very pleasant experience and I would not hesitate to return to the NY Palace in the future.

<Content>Excellent. Highly Recommend. Yes expensive, but worth it! First, the breakfast. So many of the reviews focused on this, and missed the wonderful thoughts on the hotel. Yes, the breakfast is outrageously expensive. If it is not included in the room rate, then avoid. There are places nearby. If it is in the rate, go for it. It is very good (although the only option is the American Breakfast, but it comes with toast and croissants along with the eggs, etc). The line downstairs? Yes, but so what. We got around this (thanks to the reviews in warning of the long lines) by ordering room service. Breakfast and reading NY Times overlooking St. Paul's.....tough to beat. You will find they tack on a bunch of costs (i.e., tax, service); no worries as it is included.Now the hotel. Fantastic. The rooms were fantastic; large, great ammenities and great view. The pillow and sheets were wonderful. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful. The lobby was something to see. Definitely would stay again.Our only complaint is that it was not a great location for the subway. Good location for Central Park and 5th Ave, but the subway was a few blocks away. Word on walking. Street to street is a short walk; avenue to avenue is long.Tip: Best way to travel from JFK is to take the Air Train to Jamica station and then the E train. Cost is $7.

<Content>Great location!! My wife and I stayed here for one night and it was a good experience. Check in was very quick, was offered an upgrade to a room with a view to St. Patrick's Cathedral. However, we turned it down because we would have had to forgo our king bed. The room is big enough, a little smaller than something you would find in Vegas, but large for NY standards. Nice bathroom with some lux marble accents. I loved the 42 plasma screen tv. Upon arrival we found that the foyer light in our room was not working. On our way out to walk around the city we told the concierge about the problem, when we came back a couple of hours later, it was fixed, very quick response time. We skipped room service and any meal at the hotel and must have saved hundreds of dollars, except for the $18 dollar drinks (berry patches) we had at GUILT, the hotel restaurant and bar. Yes, we felt guilty (pun intended) afterwards. All in all it was a great stay, the location itself justifies the price of the room. You are literally in the middle of it all.

<Content>Fantastic location  The Palace has the best midtown location. Our room had a fantastic view of St. Patrick's Cathedral and Rockefeller Center. The bed in our non-smoking room was so comfortable and really high quality. We were greeted by the doormen during our weekend stay (they are the friendliest doormen we've ever encountered in New York!). Our check-in was delayed due to the line of guests but it was efficient nevertheless. We dined in the lobby restaurant called on Friday night and enjoyed a relaxing meal although the hostess could have been more friendlier and attentive. The Gilt Bar is a very smart and attractive space and is packed on Saturday night. We enjoyed our brief stay (we normally stay at the Waldorf and the Library Hotel) and the service at The Palace is friendly but not pretentious.

<Content>fairly expensive but totally worth it! I was in New York for work, and stay at the Palace for 3 nights. Wonderful hotel. It is a bit more expensive than most, but totally worth it in my opinion. First - the location. My room had a view of St Patricks Cathedral, which was sunny and lovely every morning. That you can walk out onto 5th avenue and enjoy the best shopping in NYC is amazing! And it is a short walk to central park up 5th avenue. The room itself is well-appointed - large flat screen TV, the most comfortable bed you have ever slept in, and turn-down service with relaxing music and slippers next to your bed. A great touch! Rooms are quiet and you can't hear your neighbors, which is important. I reall enjoy having drinks at the bar there, since it is comfortable and the service is great. Check-in was quick and efficient, and the people helping with luggage are great to point out how to work all the amenities in the room. My room rate included breakfast, which you can order as room service at no extra charge which most people do not know. Breakfast was GREAT - toast and pastries, eggs, coffee, fresh juices, etc. When room service delivered they even opened my curtains so I could enjoy the sun. I know a deli is cheaper, but it is really luxurious to eat breakfast in bed after a long day! I highly recmommend the spa there as well.As for restaurants within walking distance - I really enjoy BLT steakhouse. And for drinks in a younger and more lively atmosphere with music, try the W hotel. The hotel is definitely close enough to walk to times square if you want to catch a broadway show, but if you are wearing heels like I do it is a quick and easy cab ride - the hotel does a great job of keeping a long que of taxis at your beck and call. Try the Palace!

<Content>It's truly palatial The Palace is just that. A palace in the center of Manhattan. the rooms are impeccable and the service is as well. But perfection does not come cheap. Expect to pay and arm and a leg, but you do get what you pay for.

<Content>Perfect location ! HI ! We are just back from NYC my husband and I and we had a great time there ! The hotel is just behind the ST Patrick's Cathedral and our corner room had a breathtaking view on it.The location is just perfect if you are there for just a couple of days since you are right in the middle of everything (5th Av, Rockfeller center, Central Park, Times square...) so you save a lot of time.It was wonderful, the hotel was awesome !!! and our view so romantic and fascinating...

<Content>Big room, great location The location is great - right behind St Patrick's Cathedral on Madison and 50th, Walking distance to central park, the museums etc- if you like a good brisk walk! Of course all the shopping and restaurants a easy walking distance as well. Our room was very large, particularly for New York, and had every comfort you would expect from a 5 star. lovely Bathroom, great bed, pay per view movies etc. News flash - the mini bar and room service are outrageously over-priced. My husband didn't really like this hotel because he thought it was pretentious - I've yet to come across a 4 or 5 star in new york that isn't though! We paid a good price for what we got, I was really pleased with it.

<Content>Faultless stay at the NY Palace Flew to NYC on Silverjet (probably the best airline trip I have ever experienced!) for a long weekend.From the very start we were looked after very well by the courteous and friendly staff at the Palace.We upgraged to stay on the Executive level (30th floor and above) and got a great corner room on the 33rd floor with an amazing city view.This also gave us access to the Executive lounge which as part of the price served great breakfast, lunches and evening snacks as well as complementary bar from 5.30pm - well worth the extra cost and strongly recommended.The Concierge recommende several great restuarants (the River Cafe was wonderful) during our stay and all the staff were very helpful throughout - We will be back in NY again and will definately go Silverjet and stay at The Palace!

<Content>Not bad for NY - nice sized rooms I would still prefer the London NYC and the Le Parker Meridien, but location is awesome - 51st/Madison.Room size is very nice - nice large room, king size bed, and the shower is not bad considering old NY hotels. Not a great hotel to entertain in, food is not that good, and the bar is tiny.I would stay in this hotel because of location, and because the rates are not outrageous for a NYC hotel. The room was pretty hot, turned the air down to the lowest temp, but still it was a bit stuffy - again goes to fact NY hotels are old and not modern.

<Content>the palace is brilliant, beautifull and very very friendly,superb! my family(2 teenage boys and my nine year old daughter and husband) all stayed here from january 22nd to 28th jan.i booked this hotel because of tripadvisor and it was spot on. the new york palace was wonderfull,i had already booked my room and been given a total price which i was happy with but a couple of days later my daughter asked me to change it to the american girl package , i had to email the hotel to do this as it wasnt available tru the hotel website,i got a reply from Shaista from nyp and she said she would be happy to change it and gave me the same room for less!, yes the rate was less,this is customer care at its best,a day before we arrived i emailed the hotel again to ask if it would be possible to get a room with a view of st patricks cathdreal and guess wot we got the middle centre of the hotel room 2020, superb views of st pats and rockerfells saks ,ect ect, my daughter was presented with an american girl gift, we went on to spend just under $2000 in AG and she loved it,the beds we slept in where extra comfy and the bathroom was huge loads of space,the previous review of this hotel states that he wouldnt give this hotel a 3and half star,well we are a well traveled family and we only stay at the very best hotels some times you wont get everything your asking for, we have been to millions of 5 star hotels the world over, even the burj al arab, and i would put the personel care we got at the new york palace above the servis of the burj, yes its true, the only gripe i have with the nyp hotel is one night i ordered room service ,a kiddies burger and curly fries and a pizza cost $92 ,and it was inedible ,thats a rediculous amount of cash for a snack for two! the hotel needs to address this but apart from that i will come back to this hotel to stay again and again.WELL DONE NEW YORK PALACE.

<Content>Not a 5 star property Checked in and out on the same day. Let's start with the good... lobby and location, near Saks and Rockefeller Center, large room by NYC standards, good mattress and flat screen TV. The bad...long lines at front desk with abrupt and unfriendly clerks.The room was extremely dusty, hair and stains soiled the linens, thin walls, old bathroom fixtures, 1970's feel to hallways and elevators, questionable carpet, generic decor. I checked out within two hours because my breathing was becoming compromised due to the dust and old ventilation system. I don't understand the great reviews this hotel has received from other guests. Could it be that they don't know what to expect from a true 5 star hotel? This is not a five star hotel as advertised. I would give it 3 1/2 stars. Unless you find a very great rate (under $300.00) and don't spend much time in the room it is just not worth it.

<Content>On the whole a good stay I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on this site. I was booking for a group of 8 people (4 rooms) for our belated Christmas trip. I had done all the organising and found the check in staff extremely helpful and fast. Check out was also extremely fast and painless. The breakfast element of our package was extremely good. The food was lovely, great selection, even our vegetarian traveller got to eat something different each day! On the whole i could not fault the hotel, setting or most of the staff. But i have to say that the grumpy so and so who came up to collect our bags before our departure really brough our trip to a bitter end. He was not happy that he had to come to 4 seperate rooms and grumbled alot about it even though we were all on the same floor and we had just 1 bag each. Then when we asked if we could store our bags as our flights were later in the evening he was not happy at all. We did not tip him and he felt he had to be sarcastic right up in my face. He was the only issue we had with the hotel everyone else was perfect but although i would love give the NY Palace 5 stars i can only justify 4.

<Content>NY Palace the best with American Girl Place A friend and I took our daughters (ages 8 and 9) in August 2007 to the New York Palace and the package day at American Girl Place. We chose the NYP for the AG trip because it was the closest to AG (about 1.5 blocks away) and, of the hotels AG has for packages, it was less expensive (believe it or not!). Late August weekend is less expensive, I think. We only stayed one night.The hotel was fabulous. We were on the 14th floor overlooking St. Patrick's. We drove from New England, and the valet took the car and we were on our NYC adventure! Everyone in check-in was very friendly. They wowed our girls with their questions and knowledge of the AG dolls and the girls loved the attention.The room was larger than I expected. Ours had 2 double beds in it like a standard hotel room, but it was more spacious around the edges. We were able to check in at 1pm, the staff was able to find rooms nearly next door to our friends (there was 1 room in between). They were ready and we settled in for a few minutes before we were off to walk around midtown.When we returned in the evening, my daughter was just thrilled with the little American Girl bed and satin blanket that was turned down on her bed, along with her own bed. She loved the slippers they put out for her and wouldn't take them off! The AG bed is part of the package and you take it home when you leave.The view was just amazing. At night overlooking St. Patrick's, with Rockefeller Center lit up behind it was great. My daughter and I just sat at the window until long past her bedtime just taking it all in. I had never stayed overnight in Manhattan, just been there on day trips when visiting relatives on Long Island. So this was very special for both of us.When we were leaving the hotel staff was very helpful. They retrieved our car much faster than I expected, maybe 15 minutes. I went to the concierge to get information about what was the best way to drive out of Manhattan and was put in contact with their head dispatcher for drivers and I chatted with him and he was very helpful. I think we will both remember our special weekend in NYC forever. And the New York Palace helped make it that way.I want to try and return with my whole family soon.

<Content>Fabulous Location We chose this hotel because it is not the typical chain hotel like Four Seasons etc. Sometimes with these once you have been to one you know what to expect.The lobby is very none descript and not at all like the picures on the internet - the entrance off Maddison Ave is the grand elaborate one - we arrived on the 5th Jan and all the christmas decorations were still there - very pretty.Check in was very efficient if a little expensive - tips for taxi driver, door man, man who took luggage to reception, then man who took us up to our room, then man who brought our luggage up to our room all within the space of 20 minutes of arriving when you are still getting used to the new notes and havent always got small amounts at hand.Our room was large, immaculatly clean and overlooked St Patricks cathedral - the view at night was stunning. The bed was huge and after hours of shopping and sightseeing we fell into what felt like a giant white marshmellow - it was so comfortable.We stayed 5 nights room only so didnt really use the hotel for much other than sleeping in. We did have a drink in the lobby bar - the service was shocking but then another night we had one in the new restaurant bar and that was very nice - decor was fantastic.We did use the concierge who were all very helpfull and managed to get us booked into all the very best restaurants - use the Zagat guide book if you like good food - quite a lot of the best ones are within walking distance of the hotel the best being Le Bernadin - truly sublime (no problems walking round at night) iIn the rooms there is a concierge guide which is very helpful and does give some fantastic recommendations for all sorts of things- its nothing to do with the hotel- its a list of recommendations from a variety of 5 star hotels in the city and was very informative.We did enquire about a show with the concierge who said they have to use an agency and quoted $1200 for two of us - yes one thousand two hundred dollars to see Jersey Boys - we declined.All in all we really enjoyed our stay here the hotel is a fantastic location, Saks is just over the road on Fifth Ave, Central Park is a ten minute walk away and the rooms have a stunning view at night are big, comfortable and spotless. Cannot ask for much more !!

<Content>lovely hotel - crazy weather - nice trip We decided to take our 3 daughters to NYC for Spring Break 2007. We wanted this to be a very memorable experience for them with shows, great restaurants and typical kid friendly sight seeing in Manhattan.We even caught a bit of the St. Pat's Day parade the day we left. We have family in Manhattan so that makes it nice to find good, reasonable local eateries and such. We decided on The New York Palace primarily b/c of location. We wanted to be Midtown, but not in the heart of Times Square (done that - just too crazy for me!) It is located adjacent to St. Paul's Cathedral - a sight we all wanted to visit. The hotel is lovely, quite beautiful, really. Our room requests were met perfectly, something I always try to be prepared to NOT have happen. 2 Adjoining/Connecting rooms with 2 bathrooms is a MUST for my group (1 dad, 4 women!!) and they accomodated us beautifully. We just could not get the view of the Cathedral AND the room set up we needed but that was definitely fine (I'm alwasy cautiously optimistic b/c many older hotels just do not have these accomodations which are first come, first served). Our rooms were very spacious - even more so by NYC standards (something we warned our children about ahead of time). A small bath in the very large corner King room w/a seating area and a large bath in the double queen connecting room. Beautifully, traditionally decorated in blues and yellows - soft, comfy linens, lots of pillows- very clean. Our maid service was lovely and friendly and helpful. Concierege service is some of the BEST we have ever experienced anywhere. Doormen best in the city with helpful tips on subways (a must for my kiddos) and cabs. NEVER had a problem getting a taxi at the Palace. Did 2 shows - a matinee and an evening show. Conierege made great arrangements for us to eat lunch prior to matinee and next door at the FANTASTIC steak and seafood place b/4 our evening show. Actually, except for our first evening with family and a quick bite of Pizza (the BEST) near Rockefeller Ctr, the Concierege staff made all our dining arrangements and they were wonderful. Would recommend to others Serafina for dinner (Italian-adults and kids will love) as well as the Chinese restaurant around the corner-quite fantasitc! Nice, handy Starbuck's across the street from hotel.We experience some crazy weather - 70s when we arrived, sleet and snow 2 days later - caught in rain and sleet walking to hotel from evening show (hint:if it's raining after a show - you will NOT catch a cab!! take an umbrella - nice big ones offered by the hotel). Had great fun stopping into a Duane Reade drugstore to buy cheap caps and gloves - very handy! We did the girl stuff and family stuff - American Girl Place, Sernedipity (skip this hyped location), Dylan's Candy Bar, Hershey's Times Square, Central Park Zoo, Natural History Museum, Rockfeller Ctr, etc. Skipped Canal Street with the kids (though my oldest has been with me prior to this trip) but quickly passed through China town. So much to see and must return. They LOVED it. The hotel is SO pricy, though, I don't know if it will be in the budget to return to such lavish means. We actually DID experience the $12 glass of orange juice at breakfast in the hotel along with the $10 bagel with cream cheese (this was not room service, but in the restuarant). However, booking with American Express granted us a free lunch in the restaurant which would have also been quite pricy, but was good food. It also allowed us to take advantage of late check-out and was what probably guaranteed our room arrangement as well. Book the New York Palace if you can afford the price tag. You will not be disappointed!

<Content>Great hotel and excellent service We stayed at the Palace this past weekend and it was a wonderful experience. We booked a package that included breakfast. We ordered our breakfast in our room every morning and it always arrived on time and was good. The food and drinks are extremely expensive at the Palace. I was glad we had a package including breakfast, otherwise 2 breakfasts would have cost over $100. Everyone at the hotel was extremely helpful and very, very nice. They have a well trained staff. The hotel is in a wonderful location. Our room was nicely decorated and had a big flat screen tv (probably 42 inches). The beds were very comfortable. We also ate dinner at Gilt one night (the hotel's restaurant). It was very good. They were able to fit us in at the last minute, and still got us out in time for our play.I was exceptionally happy with our stay at the Palace and will definitely go back in the future.

<Content>Felt like a princess at the Palace I am a 14 year old girl writing this review, so if you're ever wondering what a teenager thinks of the hotel and it's service, you should read on.My family and I checked into the hotel on January 3rd, and luckily for us the beautiful Christmas displays were still up in the lobby. Even after they were taken down on January 6th, the lobby still looked amazing. As soon we reached the checkout desk we were greeted kindly and many staff had friendly conversations as we were waiting to be checked in. Surprisingly, our room was ready immediately, which was a plus. The room was beautiful as well and above my expectations. The room service menu was overpriced, but that was irrelevant to us because we didn't use it. We didn't see anything wrong with the room. It was very clean. We also had a fantastic view of the St. Patrick's Cathedral.The next day at breakfast we had to get in a huge line because there was only ONE person seating people! When we got in, we had an overpriced breakfast. It was over $100 just for the 3 of us. It wasn't even that great of one either, they gave my mom sour milk and it took a while to get the food. The next day, though, the breakfast wasn't so bad.Another dislike we had was that when we were checking in the lady talked us in to getting one bed for my parents and a small cot for me instead of two beds, because I wouldn't be staying there for two of the four nights. However, when we got back late at night we found the bed wasn't even in there! It was no problem though because it only took them about 10 minutes to bring the bed up and set it up.The last tiny dislike we had was the fact our phone was broken for a while. Whenever we got a call and picked up the phone it would just keep ringing and we couldn't talk into it. We called down to the front desk and the phones were immediately fixed while we were out the next day so it was fine.The one tiny thing you should be warned about is that there is a button in the room that turns on the 'Privacy' light on your door, which tells the maids not to come into your room. We did this once accidentally and as a result the maids could not clean our room... :POverall I'd have to say that I LOVED the hotel other than those few tiny things. I had a great time while I was in New York and staying in such a beautiful, classy hotel only made the experience that much better. I would come back here if I ever went back to NYC.

<Content>Great facilities I stayed at the Palace on a business trip as my usual hotel was full. I found the lobby a bit impersonal, the welcome a little muted and had to queue to check in.The room was big, comfortable and well furnished although the bathroom was a little crowded with very little space around the basin to put any personal toiletries.The best bit about the whole stay was the Executive Lounge which can be accessed by guests of certain rooms. The lounge was large and welcoming and staff were friendly. Not only did it provide a good quality free breakfast every morning, snacks were provided during the day, including in the evening, along with coffee and drinks. As a lone business traveller who hates room service, I found it a perfect place to pass some time and would definitely consider staying at the hotel again on future trips.

<Content>Best Hotel in NY city This is the best hotel in New York City (of course, I've never stayed at any other hotel in NY before so I guess my opinion is very narrow)However, just walking through the beautiful courtyard and lobby every night when returning from the bustle of the city is worth the extra cost. Rooms are huge and the turndown service is an added bonus. Restaurant was decent but not the greatest (it was part of the package so I had no real qualms).EVERY FIRST TIME NEW YORKER SHOULD STAY HERE as it is the perfect location ideally situated to all Midtown touristy areas. After staying here, you will realize that Rockefeller is the REAL heartbeat of New York (not Times Square).

<Content>Faultless Every since using Tripadvisor to help select hotels, we've not had a bad stay anywhere and the New York Palace was no exception.We stayed for 4 nights in early January and could not find fault with any aspect of our stay there. It's a very plush, grand hotel, which is in a great location and all the staff we encountered were helpful, very friendly and courteous - true pro's! Despite not asking for one, we were given a room on the 26th floor with that amazing view of St Patricks and the Rockefeller Centre. The bed was just enormous and was a treat for our aching limbs at the end of each day. The rooms are a great size and provide good extra's such as a proper hairdrier (not one of those contraptions that looks like a vacuum cleaner that needs the button permanently depressed to make it work!!) plus iron, ironing board, robe and slippers, free safe and a massive flat screen tv.The menu was outside what we prefer to pay (we got a fantastic package deal on hotel and flights thru lastminute.com hence selecting the hotel) so we choose not to eat there and can't comment on food. But there are so many great eateries in the city, that it didn't bother us. For those Europeans that wake up at 5am every morning before adjusting to local time, you get a newspaper hung on the outside of your door each morning. Sit back in the massive bed, plump up the cushions and relax!Will be back again one day!

<Content>Magnificent hotel in the heart of NYC! This is my second time staying at The Palace, and what a palace it is! My husband and I spent 5 nights and we had a lovely room on the 23rd floor overlooking St. Patrick's Cathedral and the bustle of NYC. Every aspect of the hotel is impeccable from the attentive doorman and bellman from the minute we arrived (and every time we left and returned back to the hotel) to the gracious receptionist and concierge staff. Each employee thoroughly knew how to pamper returning guests as well as tourists and locals as well.The hotel is close to everything and even in the brisk of January, a walk to Times Square or 59th and Lexington was a breeze. The hotel is right on Madison Avenue which compares in shopping with Robertson Blvd in LA or Oxford Street in London and is a mere block away from 5th Avenue and shopping extraordinare including Saks, Barneys, Henri Bendel and even H  M. There are numerous places, from $ to $$$$ to eat but one must try the hotel's signature restaurant, Gilt with a 3 course price fix menu of approximately $70 and well worth it. A short cab ride will take you to Soho, Greenwich Village, Little Italy or Chinatown (all within blocks of each other) for great choices in dining and shopping (my preference!) The hotel is in back of St. Patrick's Cathedral, which if one is lucky, provides a spectacular view from west side of the hotel. If you are a gym fanatic, you will also have a birds eye view from the excellent gym and equipment located on the 8th floor. The hotel even provides gym apparel including sneakers if you didn't bring any with you. The hotel provides free wireless internet access in the lobby and sometimes on the second floor, although both areas can be bustling during the day with guests. You can also access from your room for $15 for 24 hours which is a great deal as well.The room was very spacious for New York standards and approximately 300 sq. ft and it was more than fitting for all the luggage we brought and the extra 2 that was brought back, completely full. The bathroom was fitted in marble and had a great tub for soaking as well as a shower. The flat screen 40 inch tv was a nice touch in addition to the extremely comfortable bed and pillow top, very modern and chic. If shopping is on your agenda and if you have the time, a trip to the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets would be worth the time. The hotel concierge can provide you the tickets for $39 round trip via Gray Line Bus Tours departing from Port Authority and the outdoor outlet has basically every designer you can think of including Gucci, Ferragamo, Jimmy Choo, Saks, Barney's and Neiman Marcus.I can't think of a nicer place to stay which provides excellent service and is right in the middle of everything New York and without a doubt, I would absolutely recommend this hotel.

<Content>Totally gorgeous From start to finish our stay at the New York Palace was perfect. Before going we emailed the hotel directly to ask for a room with a view and we most definitely got one. Our room looked out over St Patrick's Cathedral and was gorgeous.Everyone at the hotel was incredibly helpful and made our stay very pleasant. I will stay here every time I go back to New York.

<Content>Excellent and friendly service We stayed at The Palace for three nights and totally loved it. The staff was amazingly friendly, helpful and professional. The room was quite large for New York, nice view, comfy bed and pillows, flat screen TV, etc. All in all a lovely place to stay, if not a bit on the stuffy side. The bathroom was a tad small, but it was still quite comfortable.Location is great if you want to be near Central Park, 5th Avenue shopping, and Rockefeller Center. The hotel is directly behind Saint Patricks (not my favorite thing to visit but my family seemed to like that).My only warning is the cost of breakfast. The American breakfast was included with our room (thank god), but if one dallied from that and ordered a la cart, the cost became staggering. $10 for a cup of coffee, OR glass of orange juice, OR a muffin (yes, $10 for EACH of those things). You get the picture. Our omelettes and oatmeal dishes were quite tasty however.All in all I would stay there again if i wanted to be in that neighborhood. A rarity as the uptown shoppers are briefly entertaining but mostly tiresome. FYI the best hot cocoa on the Eastern Seaboard is at Rockefeller Center however. At La Maison du Chocolat. It will certainly set you back, but that's a cup that is well worth it.

<Content>Spectacular in every way! My family and I stayed here during the holiday season for 4 days and do not have one problem with this place. It was one of our best experiences through and through. The staff couldn't have been friendlier, even remembering our child's name whenever returning to the hotel. It was very clean and decent size for a NY hotel.From helping with bags, to the restaurant, to atmosphere, this hotel was a homerun! We strongly recommend to anyone considering.we've stayed in many hotels in NY and this by far was top of the heap.

<Content>Best Hotel in Ny Me and my mom have stayed at some of the fanciest hotels in New York. We have stayed at the Ritz Central Park, we have stayed at the Trump, we have stayed at the St. Regis, and we have stayed at the Plaza; and none of them are as nice as the Palace. We just recently stay at the palace for new years, and it was amazing. My mom payed $400 dollars a night for a room that was just as nice as a the Ritz for $2000. The service here was the best service I have even seen; and I have stayed at many 5 star hotels. The only thing I found to be a problem was check in was a little slow. But then my mom told me that was because they gave a complementary upgrade to a nicer room. This is the best hotel in all of Manhattan.

<Content>Fantastic Hotel! Amazing view - beautiful rooms - top service! We have just returned from a short stay at this hotel and it was every bit as good as many other Trip Advisor members have said - absolutely superb and excellent value for money for the quality of the hotel and being in New YorkI looked at all the rooms whilst there so will comment on the differences which would have helped me make my decision when I was bookingFirstly we had a normal hotel room in the end that was upgraded on the night to a corner suite - it was very very good for $345 per night - very spacious - extremely clean and well appointed - very traditional in decor - remember to ask for a west side Cathedral view - the main hotel rooms are on the first 38 or so floors with the exec lounge on the 39th floor - the exec lounge is fantastic - very classy and elegant with excellent presentations throughout the day - as good as any of the Ritz carlton lounges we have stayed in and with a fantastic view being on the 39th floor - our room was on the 20th floor which was fine until I saw the view from the Towers Rooms!! Huge picture window on our 20th floor room with an amazing viewThe Towers Rooms have a separate entrance and a choice of traditional or modern decor - I preferred the modern one - the rooms were fantastic - all the latest amenities and beautiful black marble bathrooms - latest look beds and linen and latest plasma TVs (although our room on the 20th also had great facilities and plasma screen!) If you have the extra approx $200 per night to spend then it is worth it as these rooms are beautiful and the one I was shown on 47th floor had the most amazing cathedral and towards the river view - simply breathtaking - very luxurious - my favourite towers room though was the junior suite because the bathroom was so fantastic! Again all beautifully done in black marble but the junior suites have huge walk in shower cubicle that the others rooms done have as well as a large (not double) bath - I loved the junior suites but not sure how much they were - the proper suites were amazing but in all honesty even if we could afford them they are a bit too big for a short break!The staff are superb at this hotel - room service was fantastic even at 2am when we arrived - we will definitely be staying again at this hotelIt is in a superb central position within easy walking distance of the main attractionsThe public rooms are a little bit dark and my only suggestion would be for some more inviting bars and public rooms in the main hotel lounges as they are all a bit dark - the Gilt Restaurant however looked very good and I think has a michelen star!I havent seen rooms of this standard and size in New York at this price - although still expensive I think this hotel represents excellent value for money - I just wish it had an indoor pool and spa like the peninsula and some more attractive main lounges and bars and then it would be 100% perfect but that is being very very pickyThank you to all at the hotel for a fantastic stay - we will be booking for December 08 shortly!

<Content>A Magical Experience An absolute delight and class act. This hotel provides the quintessential Manhattan experience. I was originally booked at a very nice albeit less glitzy hotel (it's one block away on Lexington) but saw a similar price here and thought, why not go all the way and experience Manhattan the way it's intended to be experienced - to the nines! This is an excellent hotel for the firsttime visitor like myself, but I would also consider returning. The only other place probably to top this hotel could be The Plaza, though I don't know how it could top the Palace. There's no pool, but if you have the time and energy to swim in New York while on vacation, then you're not seeing enough of the city.The view was stunning - was on the 21st floor - massive St Pat's Cathedral. Did not see the Kennedys though.Sit in the lobby for 20 minutes - it's an experience - watching the people, observing the opulence of the place etc. Maid service twice a day - the first day I raced in and threw everything everywhere at 3:30 pm with only a few daylight hours left, took a shower (high pressure shower head, no low flow here!!!) then went to Saks, Rockefeller and returned around 9:00 pm to find my room cleaned, toothbrush and paste sitting on a facecloth on the counter, mints on bed etc etc. I had left my wallet thrown across the bed with (lots) of cash in it (forgetting about the maid service)- nothing was taken. Check out took about 14 seconds and I'm not joking. No line up even the day after New years. Try the room service once; skip the minibar - it's no fun paying $8 for a vitamin water. Go to The Food Emporium  buy yourself at the end of a day. Or don't - it's only money!Perfect balance between anonymity and personal service. Will try to return late in the Spring for another take.

<Content>Palace good and bad The position is great. The rooms are spacious but there are some drawbacks. The lobby is like the departure lounge of a busy airport. The room service is extremely expensive. The concierge is overworked and needs to be chased up. However, the pluses considerably outweigh the minuses.

<Content>Treated Like Royalty at the Palace We stayed four nights at the Palace over New Year's Weekend. Everything was perfect. We booked a king tower room on the hotel website. I took the advice of another on this site, and let them know that we were celebrating my 40th birthday. We got upgraded to a tower king suite. It was huge, with fantastic views of the cathedral, rockerfeller center, 5th avenue. The bedding was plush and wonderful, the bathroom was very big and had nice shampoos/soaps, etc. Everything was in very good taste.Breakfast was included in our rate. We could either have room service bring it or eat in the restaurant downstairs. We chose to have it in our giant suite. The bill was $105 for two American breakfasts, plus delivery charges!!!! Fortunately it was all taken off the bill at check-out (as per our breakfast plan). The breakfast was fine for free (coffee, juice, eggs, bacon or sausage, breakfast breads or toast, fruit, potatoes) but I could not imagine it being ok for $105.We had dinner one night at Gilt in the Palace. It was very, very good. Really exceptional food, and lovely atmosphere. The concierge and reception were all very helpful, and it was nice having our own people for the tower rooms. More personal service. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Christmas Elegance We stayed here last night and loved it. We paid $445 through the company web site. The room was clean and large and had a wonderful view of St. Pat's. They let us check in early (11am) and check out late (1:30 pm) and kept our bags till 4pm. We had room service for dinner and the food was great ($134 for 3 without alcohol). I highly recommend this hotel. Perfect location.

<Content>Will return again and again had a great stay in a fantastic facility. Very friendly staff. Our stay on the concierge floors got us free food and drink at a high level of quality on the weekend of the NY Marathon. The hotel was filled with an international cast of people. The scene in the lobby was a show in of itself.It is the best midtown place we have ever stayed. We went up town and caught the show at the Carlyle Hotel,.Bobby Short lounge that was to die for.

<Content>Great Hotel But Packages Are Overpriced Excellent location - Midtown. Great holiday hotel. We stayed at the NY Palace 10 years ago. When we returned in Dec 07, the rate for the same type of room, 37th floor, had almost doubled. Our rate this trip was $925 per night, which was to include American breakfast, light lunch and evening hors d'oeuvres in the Executive Lounge on the 39th floor. When checking in at 12:30, we were told that the Exec Lounge was full and would not be available for lunch until 2:30 or 3:00. The breakfast buffet was very basic, nothing extra, nothing fancy. On 3 of our 4 mornings there, the lounge was overcrowded with guests standing over others, waiting to take their tables. There were kids running and grabbing tables before others who had politely waited. The staff was indifferent to this problem. Even when asked, they did nothing to assist in finding tables for waiting guests. There was no wait list. It was an unorganized, uncomfortable mess every morning. Same for the Light Lunch. (Remember: $925 per night for this.) The hotel was simply unable to honor the accommodations that their guests had paid for. OK - that's enough fussing. Otherwise, this extremely expensive hotel is great. The west view of St. Pat's Cathedral and Rock Plaza is incredible. The bed and bed linens were really nice. Clean, quiet, nice sized room. The Doormen, George and the other George, were terrific, as were all of the other employees of the hotel. The lobby is really beautiful. Restaurant Istana was fantastic!! We will stay again in April 08 but will not pay the higher rate for the Executive Lounge package. It was not worth the money. Other NYC restaurant recommendations: Erminia Italian, Gigino's at Webster (great view of Stat Lib  Ellis Is and great italian food, chef is from Positano IT), River View Cafe in Brooklyn, a must for the most romantic view and great food, but $95 prix fix menu.

<Content>Great Stay I thought this was a lovely hotel, and it met all of my expectations. The room was quite large, I was expecting something much smaller for a New York hotel room, but it was quite a decent size. The view of Saint Patrick's was beautiful. The concierge and bellhop staff were incredibly helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. Definitely an ideal place to stay during the holidays.

<Content>Everything we expected and more. My husband, son and I stayed at this hotel for seven nights in October 2007. From the moment we walked in we were treated just how it should be from a hotel of this standard. Nothing was too much trouble, whatever was asked of them, they delivered. As it was my 40th Birthday when we were there they upgraded us to a suite, very nice gesture. The Towers are something else, pure luxury. A fabulous grand lobby to sit in with a drink and just chill after coming in from a busy day sight-seeing. Taxi's are always available at the hotel at all times of day and night. The beds were so comfortable, I had to drag myself out of it every morning. Housekeeping were very attentitive and promptly brought whatever we needed to the room, lots of extras like DVD/CD players, fridges, ice etc. This was our second trip to NYC and it really was worth the extra expense to stay at the New York Palace. We will definately stay here every time from now on.

<Content>Delightful! I booked this hotel based on the strength of its Tripadvisor reviews, and was not disappointed. My husband and I arrived at the hotel at 8am after an overnight flight from the west coast. The front desk clerk found us an available room and allowed us to check in early, which we appreciated. We had booked a deluxe room, and we were assigned a deluxe room on the 23rd floor. The clerk apologized that she did not have a view room available that early, but promised to provide my in-laws (who were checking in later in the day) with a view room. As it turns out, our room had a nice city view, although it was on the opposite side of the building from St. Patrick's Cathedral.I was initially concerned that our deluxe room (the hotel's base-level room) would be worn and dated compared to the other, more luxurious levels of rooms and suites offered at the hotel. Not so. The room was spacious, elegant, and totally updated. It had many wonderful amenities, including a large flat screen television and a lovely marble bathroom with excellent water pressure. The king size bed was oh-so-comfy, perfectly outfitted with crisp white linens, fluffy pillows, and a down comforter (no yucky, scratchy bedspread here!) I think the picture of the deluxe room on the hotel's website must be an old picture, because the bedding and furnishings looked more like that pictured in the executive room.The room was spotless and the maid service was unobtrusive and friendly. We returned each evening to our room to find the curtains drawn, the lights dimmed, soft music playing, the bed turned down, and chocolates on the pillow. Gotta love turndown service! As other posters mentioned, the prices at the hotel bar and restaurant are breathtakingly expensive. To us, it was worth the extra cost to sit in the beautiful surroundings and sip an evening cocktail while watching the assortment of people coming and going through the lobby areas. There is great people watching at this hotel. The hotel is decorated beautifully for the holidays, and the friendly staff passed out complimentary hot chocolate, hot apple cider, and cookies one afternoon. We found this very welcoming after a chilly day of shopping and walking about the city. Our package included an American breakfast for two in the hotel restaurant, which otherwise carried a $30 per person price tag. The American breakfast consisted of cold scrambled eggs, decent toast, decent bacon or sausage, and truly awful hash browns. We ate it on two mornings, and went elsewhere the other two mornings we were there, even though it was basically free for us. It was not very good, and was most definitely NOT worth the money if you are paying out of pocket. All in all, we had a wonderful experience at the New York Palace and we would return in a New York Minute!

<Content>Mother Daughter trip to remember I have sat down to give my opinion of the New York Palace. First off I would like to say this is my first review. I am only going to talk about the hotel and do another review on the whole trip in the forum.We arrived at the Palace at 11:30am check-in was quick and efficient very kind. Our room was not ready but told us it would be ready by 1:00pm. Arrived back at the hotel at 2:00 room was ready. Ah my god, the view is amazing, we each had our own little palace bed which we slept like princesses. We had club level rooms which are well worth the price had breakfast, wine and dessert there everyday.Breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, french toast, alot of different fruits and of course pastries. It would have cost a fortune to eat that good every morning. And every afternoon we arrived my daughter and I would go up and have a glass of juice for her and glass of wine for me.Desserts were strawberries and whipped cream and all sorts of little petits fours. Rooms were very large and clean, the service was twice a day (morning and turn down).We didn't eat at the restaurants but one night I ate the hors d'oeuvres at the Club and my daughter ordered the chicken fingers and curly fries which were from the kids menu but there was like 4 chicken fingers and alot of curly fries (very good). I could go on but the only thing I have left to say is you get what you pay for. We felt like royalty the whole time we were there never felt like we didn't belong.If I would go again I hope I can next year with my other daughter.

<Content>Died and gone to heaven Me and my family have just spent the most fabulous 5 days of our lives at the New York Palace. Every single aspect of our stay was perfect and I would recommend it to any kind of traveller-family, business, romance or whatever. It looks absolutely stunning from the outside, especially at night with all the twinkly fairy lights outside. As soon as we arrived the men helping us out of our car made a huge fuss of the girls (aged 8 and 10)and told us to get right round to Serendipity for a frozen hot chocolate(which we did-it didn't disappoint!) When we arrived in our rooms and looked out of the window we nearly fainted-what a view!!! I would have jumped up and down on the bed but have a bad back so the kids did it for me. Straight out of the movies-St Paddys straight ahead and skyscrapers all around, with of course the famous yellow taxis whizzing up and down the road.I could have stood right there for 5 days, and it was always fantastic to come back to after a busy day. We didnt eat at all in th hotel, and contrary to what another reviewer wrote (what a moaner) there are some fab places to eat nearby. I would particularly recommend the Prime Burger restaurant-literally round the corner-which looks nothing on the outside but is the real McCoy-a genuine 1950's diner with a dinky sliding tray that you push open in order to sit down, and then close over your lap. The kids loved it and it was dirt cheap, brilliant for breakfast. I could go on and on about the place, indeed the whole holiday, but want to try and be helpful. Dont take any notice of those reviewers moaning about the staff, some people are never satisfied.I found them relentlessly helpful and pleasant when I asked numerous times about directions to places, etc. One even phoned a store to check its closing time as it was getting late-I hadn't even asked him to. On a couple of occasions the stunning staircase and the outside courtyard were being used to shoot a very glamourous looking movie by Warner Bros, which the kids kept trying to sneak into. How cool is that? And on the day we left Brooke Shields checked in-thats not too shabby either! So go on book it and treat yourself or someone special. Its worth every single penny.

<Content>Royalty at the Palace My Fiancee and I stayed at the New York Palace to celebreate a birthday. As it was our first stay in New York and a special occasion,we chose the Palace based on location, reviews and recommendations....WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED.For anyone travelling from the U.K. wanting to be treated special, feel safe, be close to most major attractions, I can only recommend this hotel.Upon checking in, we requested a view overlooking the Cathedral. The ever efficient staff gave us a room on the 27th floor overlooking the Cathedral... one word AMAZING!The location of this hotel is great, one avenue off 5th (shopping heaven), a 10 minute walk to Central Park, Rockefeller Centre, Times Square (just a few minutes further), the rooms are clean, large and very well furnished, the staff are very helpful, and the surroundings (the courtyard) very inviting.If we come back to New York, we will definitely be staying here again.

<Content>5 Stars? According to who?! As a former Hotel Hopper in Manhattan, always trying to find the best hotel I thought I had found my home...NOTUpon check in on a Friday evening at 7PM OUR ROOM WAS NOT READY. Having stayed in hotels across Europe, arriving at 8AM I have ALWAYS had a room ready by 10AM or Noon at least.To not have the room ready at 7PM at this level of hotel is beyond absurd. The woman at the desk was unhelpful, condescending, and downright rude at times. At NO TIME WHAT SO EVER was any attempt made to rectify the situation, or any gesture made by the hotel for their shabby service.Furthermore, I was not given the room I booked. I booked two executive King Rooms and my sons room was on the executive level only. When I went for breakfast in the executive lounge, I was escorted out as I was not in an executive room, only my son was (of course it was all being paid by MY American Express card).My son's room had a large turquoise stain on the carpet, and THE LOCK ON THE DOOR was falling off (missing a screw)At a hotel that is as highly regarded as the Palace is, it is shocking that this would happen. From the staff who could really care less about the guests, to the rooms that lacked proper maintenance, for $600.00/night. I would THINK TWICE about staying here again,to top it all off the Palace Lobby was like a ZOO at all hours of the day.

<Content>Great Hotel I have often used TripAdvisor to pick out hotels but this is the first time I have written a review. This is a great hotel. It is located on Madison Avenue and is within walking distance of Central Park, the Theatre District and of course the shopping on 5th Ave. The rooms are large and comfortable, however it is the staff which make this an exceptional hotel and the main reason why I am posting this review. I had a fall whilst crossing a road in New York and hurt my knees, face, hands  a tooth. The Security/ Guest Services staff at the hotel were amazing in that they supplied antiseptic creams  plasters, they recommended an emergency room and even cancelled our dinner reservations for that evening when it became clear that we wouldn't make it. The mail desk staff also faxed through documentation to our insurers for us. Nothing was too much trouble for them and I can't thank them enough.When I return to NYC ( to catch up on the sites I didn't get a chance to see this time!!) I will definately stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Absoutely fantastic We arrived at the hotel a day earlier than planned (don't ask!), but this did not pose a problem for this fantastic hotel. We were shown to our room on the 19th floor overlooking the Cathedral and we had access to the executive lounge on the 39th. All of this by 11.30 in the morning meaning we had all day to explore NYC before heading off to a show in th evening.The hotel is in a fantastic location, is in excellent condition, and the service in unparallelled with any other hotel I have stayed in. The staff could not do enough for you, going out of their way to ensure your trip was memorable.We are already planning our next trip to the New York Palace Hotel.

<Content>Excellent Location, so so service I stayed at this hotel when it was owned by the Helmsleys, they were great and then service levels started to fade. So I changed for the St Regis and Omni Bershire. Since these two were our of budget range, a friend suggested I try them again and my opinion is that the location is still one of the best in New York. However it is a large hotel and it shows in their service. I pulled all three bags from the cab to the front desk and took myself (and the bags) to the room when checking in. Basically there were so many people that they did not have sufficient staff. When checking in a line of 6 or 7 guests and only two people where working at the front desk, later more came in and were able to speed things up, waited around 15-20 minutes. Room service was very good quality but extremelly expensive (I believe a $30 hamburguer is above average I think)Excecutive level access is well worth the investment, great serve there and the food was very good. By the way, I pulled all my bags for checkout as well.Will stay here again basically because of location.

<Content>Perfect Wedding Week Our wedding party and many friends/family stayed at The Palace during my wedding week and the entire stay was absolutely perfect. The staff would help with anything that we needed (and that sometimes was a tough task)! The rooms were gorgeous and spacious; the views--stunning; the gym was also a plus with great views, tons of equipment and lots of space. My friends, family, husband and I had a spectacular stay here.

<Content>Fantastic Staff We were traveling with 8 teenaged girls for an 18th birthday celebration. There were 10 of us all together, and that is not easy with taxis during the weekend. Our issue was trying to get to Vento's in the meatpacking district in time for our reservations, and we were already late. George K, an exceptionally intuitive doorman saw the distress on our faces when we could not get enough cabs...he came to our rescue and suggested a limo - how perfect to start the celebration! Thank you, George.Our group was treated royally by everyone on the staff; our accomodations were luxurious and comfortable. The massage at the spa on Sunday morning was a delight. On Saturday evening after the play the room service staff brought the girls special goody trays which they loved. It was a brilliant celebration!

<Content>Absolutely Terrific My wife and I stayed at the Palace for 6 nights and we were not dissappointed. The whole hotel oozes class and is absolutely beautiful.The rooms are well appointed and large by NYC standards and the maid service is great.We had a west facing room on the 16th floor and the views were spectacular. From our window we had a panoramic view of St. Patricks Cathedral and the Rockefeller Centre. You are also a short walk from Central Park and Broadway. We didn't eat in the hotel but found a good deli just across the street. The  Prime Burger does a great breakfast and is quite cheap for the area. We were never more than $20 for our breakfast.We enjoyed the hotel so much we have booked to go back next May.I have some great photos which I will post shortly.

<Content>New York Palace is GREAT! We have made 5 or 6 trips to NY and have never stayed at a bad hotel. But, we have found that there are things that we really love to do and so I wanted to get a hotel close to that. The NY Palace is 1 block off of 5th Ave. It is immediately behind St. Patrick's. It is maybe 3 or 4 blocks to Rockefeller Center. It is no walk at all to Central Park. To get to Broadway it is maybe 6 or 7 blocks. I walked it easily in high heels. It is expensive. I think we paid $600/night for 2 nights and $450/night for 3 nights. But it is gorgeous. It was my husband's birthday and our anniversary while we were there and they sent us a beautiful bottle of champagne and a cheese and fruit platter. In case you are a Gossip Girl fan, this is the hotel where some of the characters live. Part of the series is filmed there.

<Content>Treated like royalty at the Palace! We arrived early on Friday Sept 28th at the Palace. It was a crazy weekend to be in NYC with the UN meeting just wrapping up. Our room was unavailable for early check-in so we were taken up to the 8th floor to clean up and arrange our bags. The bell man was very helpful and our children liked the service in the spa area very much. When we returned to the hotel we were told that we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite in the Tower! Our original reservation was for a modern double room at the Tower, so this was quite a big move. The room was spectacular! Huge living room with giant flat screen television, dining room, kitchen, and additional bathroom. The bedroom was very large with a nice full size bathroom and walk in closet area. This definitely was one of the nicest rooms we have ever checked into and we travel quite a bit. It is also the first time we were able to upgrade in NYC to a better room with the AMEX card. The breakfast was quite expensive even with the complimentary continental breakfast attached. We ate in the restaurant 3 times during our stay of 4 days.The location is perfect for families. Great shopping, museums, and theater all in one spot. Every time we entered the Tower we were greeted by name and the smiles were quite genuine. I would highly recommend the Tower at the Palace hotel to anyone that wants to be pampered.

<Content>Simply magnificent! I have nothing but great praise for this hotel! The staff is just great and very helpful. The location is fantastic right near St. Patrick's and many other shopping areas on 5th avenue. Room service was great...parking is valet right next door. Of course, this hotel is more expensive than the average one in Manhattan but in my opinion it is worth it. Absolutely wonderful! Nothing else to say!

<Content>A treat Big, well-appointed rooms, first-class beds  bedding, great midtown location. I'll never again settle for the big-name Manhattan hotels with the fancy lobbies  dingy, dated little rooms. I was there during a slow hotel week in the city, so I was able to get a sub-300 rate on one of the discount sites, and so it was also a great value. Word of caution - They double-billed my credit card for the cost of the room, but quickly took care of the problem when I brought it to their attention. My only other complaint was the annoying canned sales pitch their reservations clerk made when I called to inquire about rates, which was a tactic unbecoming such a first-rate place.

<Content>Great Location We stayed at the Palace in September 2005. This hotel is located on Madison between 50th and 51st and is nearSt. Patrick's Catherdral, Grand Central, and Times Square. Very close walk to Barney's, Saks and Central Park.The rooms were suprisingly large for Manhattan and very clean. Overall a very nice stay and a terrific location.

<Content>Great Place to Stay! Staying here was part of the fun of going to New York! Sak's is half a block, Rockefeller Center is two Blocks. Resturants galore are within waling distance along with an easy stroll to Central Park, and easy access to the Subway to reach anywhere in the City. The rooms are spotless, the staff friendly, helpful and nice to kids. St. Patricks is right accross the street. There is a Starbuck's right across from the side entrance(those guys were also fun and informative too), but Istana in the hotel also has great breakfast, a wonderfully friendly wait staff, great coffee, and a yummy breakfast menu. Hope we can stay there again sometime.

<Content>Recommended I stayed in the Palace with 7 friends from college for two nights in October of 2006. It was a reunion for us, and we were looking to splurge a little and for a spot where we all could gather together comfortably. After tons of research, we settled on the Palace. (Our decision was helped somewhat by the fact that one of us was able to arrange a discount through her company.) Four of us stayed in 2 of the deluxe rooms, with 2 beds in each. And four occupied a suite in the towers, where we all congregated together when not out and about in Manhattan. What's not to like? It was very luxurious and felt very New York. We even shared an elevator with Stevie Wonder.

<Content>Quality And A Great Location We stayed here with our teenage son and were very comfortable in an exec. room with two double beds on 34th floor overlooking St Patricks Cathedral ,This was an upgrade by the hotel from the standard deluxe room and it was large and of high quality.I would say all the hotel staff we came across were very helpful and highly professional.The hotel has a great location ,most sights being walkable .Some good places for breakfast nearby, one of the cheapest and best Cafe Metro for simple self service , a Starbucks and Rosens for full breakfast service. Did not eat in the hotel although can recommend Gilt Bar for a drink.Booked our hotel and sightseeing package through NYCVP.com which was good value.

<Content>Excellent! I stayed at this hotel between 23rd and 28th August on the back of Trip Advisor reviews and it really lived up to the hype.Nothing was too much trouble for the staff there, from the concierge, reception staff, maids and waiters. Absolutely first rate service.Had an executive room overlooking St Patrick's Cathedral which was fantastic and also granted access to the executive lounge. As others have noted, this was well worth it. Breakfast, lunch, afternoon snacks, evening nibbles and free evening bar all made it worth while. Especially if you're out and about locally and need a quick break back at the hotel! Well worth the extra money and would strongly recommend it.Hotel is perfectly positioned for fifth avenue shops and only a short walk from Central Park, the Empire State and Times Square, plus pick up points for the many city bus tours.Didn't eat or drink in the hotel restaurant and bar (the executive lounge did all this!) so couldn't comment but everything else spot on.

<Content>Great hotel I just spent three nights with my wife in the towers. The room was perfect and the view, spectacular! (St Patricks and Rockefeller). Room service breakfast was much better than the Itsana restaurant, so if you can avoid it.Public places, lobby, resaurant etc, are quite small I would have prefered more places to stay.Service and concierge at the towers excelent!

<Content>Treated like Royalty at the Palace 10 of us stayed here for 5 nights from 21st August. Four couples had rooms on the 15th and 16th floors facing St Patrick's cathedral and the fifth couple, our hosts for the visit (to celebrate a 40th birthday), stayed in a corner suite on the 47th floor of the Towers. From the moment we arrived we were treated exceptionally well by every member of staff we encountered. The rooms in the main hotel were large, clean, very well decorated and had extremely comfortable beds. the Tower suite was a wow in terms of both decor and views over Manhattan.Our booking through Amex Platinum service included breakfast each morning in the Istana restaurant, a complimentary lunch for 2 during the stay and late check out on the last day.The food in Istana was very good for both breakfast and lunch. We also had the most amazing in-room dining experience on the night of the birthday, when a team of 4 chefs led by the hotel's Executive chef cooked a seven course dinner in the Tower suite(most of it prepared in the suite's kitchen, or in front of us at a specially erected station in the suite's dining area - if there are any foodies out there, I will be happy to share the menu with you - it was unbelievable!.) We have eaten in fine restaurants all over the world but this dining experience surpassed anything we have encountered before. Even though it is an experience that not everyone will avail of, I think the food and service we experienced were a testament to the general standard which can be expected by any guest at the Palace. If you are looking to celebrate something special in real style, this is the place to do it!

<Content>First Class Hotel We stayed at the hotel with our 2 Ten Year Old Nephews and the hotel was absolutely perfect. They were very kid friendly and very accomodating. All of our special requests were met with smiles. The hotel was really clean and super comfortable. I have stayed at the hotel may times before and have always been pleased.

<Content>Outstanding! Outstanding is the only word to describe this excellent hotel!! We had two rooms for our family of five and access to the executive lounge on the 39th fl. This is the way to go for breakfast, lunch or evening coctails. Well worth the extra money.I have stayed in many NYC hotels and would rate the Palace at the top of the list.I am spoiled.

<Content>Could do worse, could do better I booked two rooms 3 months in advance: a smoking room and 1 non-smoking. When we arrived, they did not have a smoking room available.The rooms themselves were decent for a New York City hotel, but nothing special. The location is fine in the heart of midtown. The gym was okay.We booked a car to take us to the hotel from Newark Airport. Not exactly worth $250. Old Caddy Escalade, unbelievable traffic going crosstown.Breakfast for 4 in the Madison room is about $200, but it's kind of worth it because it is a great atmosphere. There aren't really any other options in this part of town for breakfast anyway...another drawback of NYC.I'd recommend going with a newer property or something downtown like the Soho Grand if you have this kind of money to spend on your hotel

<Content>Great Hotel in Manhattan Great Hotel in midtown. The rooms are large, modern, and new. Lobby area is very nicely set. Close to places on the East Side. St. Patrick's Cathedral is on the next block. Try to get a hotel room between the 9th and 12th floors to get a good view of the Cathedral. Subway stations are about 2 blocks away on Lexington, not really near, but not that far either. Would stay at the hotel again. Rack rates are pricey, but if you can get a room for less than $300 night, that's a good rate.

<Content>An incredible hotel We arrived on July 20th for a short anniversary trip. Meeted at the door by the bellman, very nice and helpful. Front desk was very nice. We were escorted to our room on the 30th floor. Got to our room......WOW! It was late, but our bed was turned down, chocolates on the pillow, soft music playing, slippers by the bed and ice in the ice bucket. The next morning we went up to the executive lounge for a quick bit of breakfast. The food and service was very good. Compliments to the the chef! (By the way, if your from the South, he will make you grits!) We sampled the food most all day at the executive lounge, simply because of convienence and our lack of time. But everything was incredible. Our room was overlooking the catherdal and you could see for miles. We loved this hotel, because of location, price, service. I would highly recommend and definitly stay at when back in NY.

<Content>Fantastic! Great location! What a great hotel! Very beautiful inside and in the courtyard. Greatviews of the cathedral from our hotel window. The room was very cleanand the bed was a dream to sleep in- a real pillowtop mattress and high quality sheets and pillows. The fitness center was GREAT! Everything you would want and headphones with your own personal TV. One complimentary beverage (water, juice, sports drink) and fruit also given. If you forget yourathletic shoes, you can even borrow some from the hotel with socks.The hotel was very close to shopping and restaurants. A Starbucks wasacross the street for coffee.Used the Concierge for recommendations on dining and transportation.Very helpful and friendly.

<Content>Fantastic Fantastic Fantastic I stayed there on the Memorial Day long weekend and it was absolutely fantastic! Requested a room with a view of St. Patricks and they were more than happy to oblige. The room was large, clean and luxurious. However, the main thing that impressed me was that they allowed us to use the health spa facilities to freshen up after we checked out, since we had a later flight. They were very accomodating, allowing us to use the robes and giving us complimentary beverages. What a great place!

<Content>Best All Round Hotel in NYC i've stayed at numerous NYC hotels: St Regis, Carlyle, Mark, gramercy park hotel, W, Royalton, Tribeca Grand, Soho Grand, michelangelo... when i had a choice of any for a 3 month business stay in nyc the New York Palace beat them all. It isnt chic, it isnt hip: It is however extremely efficient for the business traveller/family traveller to nyc. Standard Rooms are, for NYC, very large. Room service is excellent. Other services are outstanding (have your suit/shirts picked up pressed and returned in 90 minutes 24 hours a day) The gym even provides clothes and shoes for your workout! Concierge is also great at this hotel.I cannot recommend it highly enough for travellers.The only minor (i stress minor) issue at this hotel is that its tough to get cabs between 5pm and 6pm due to its location in midtown manhattan, but that can be said for any of its competitors too.tip: for a view ask for a room facing the Cathederal on Madison.....

<Content>Topnotch, wonderful service, room and location My wife and I stayed at the Palace for a weekend of both business and leisure. I was attending a meeting while my wife spent time enjoying NY. I came by car and the Doorman waved me into the garage driveway, as we were parking at the hotel, where a bellhop and parking valet met us immediately. This was very convenient as we were able to get out of the car and have our luggage swiftly unloaded while we were inside and away from the traffic on the street. While the weather was excellent for our visit, this could be a particular virtue if your visit is during poor weather. Access the main entrance on 50th street R off of Madison Ave. You will pay for the convenience as the parking rate is $50 a night, without in and out privileges, which I suspect is typical for the top NYC hotels. The car valets were very quick and efficient and the front desk and bell staff were cordial, professional, and welcoming. Our room was very clean, well decorated, and comfortable. We were not in a tower room but we overlooked the street. From the 24th floor there was no noise at all and the room was very well insulated. The only ultra-modern touch was a large wall-mounted flat-screen TV. A fresh bucket of ice was in the room. Elevator service was very good which is a plus in such a tall hotel. As part of my meeting I attended a buffet breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the Villard Mansion part of the property and the food service, quality and presentation were excellent. This is clearly a fine, service-oriented hotel and I would stay here again.

<Content>Best hotel for easy walking to shops, broadway, etc. We've stayed here many times in both the hotel  the tower. the Tower has extraordinary large rooms for a new york city hotel room. The best thing about the hotel is you can step out and easily (and safely) walk to 5th Avenue, Rockefeller Center, Broadway all within a few blocks. The Concierge desk is great also. PLEASE don't bother eating at the restaurant-there are too many other wonderful places in the city if you want to spend the money  effort. I've also stayed at the Plaza and others and keep going back to The Palace.

<Content>Nice room but lacks 5 star service We were upgraded to a junior suite. I requested a modern decor room and they gave us a classic decor. These floors and rooms are dark and we thought depressing. They moved us to a modern room but on the smoking floor. It did not smell bad so we stayed. Thr suite was nice with a flat screen and view over St Patricks and Rockerfeller Center. We had to call for ice three times before it came. Weasked for a rollaway for one night but told them not until turndown so we could get ready for dinner without it in the way. It came 5 minutes later. Several other rquests did not happen or were delayed. I would go back to the St Regis

<Content>New York Palace - not worth the money Beautiful lobby, good size rooms - But a lot of flaws for the moneyWe booked a tower suite for $880 per night. For that we got:A room with a makeup mirror over the toilet  no arm to move it out so you could use itA small shower with no shelves for shampoo, etc - just a wire basket attached in the cornerOnly 2 pillows on the bed for sleepingA printer/fax/copy machine that could not be used with a laptop. When we called we were told we could print from a flash drive on another floorDoormen who did not give us the message that our car was waiting a a different entranceDoorman who only opened the door once during a three day stayNo exhaust fan in the bathroomHousekeeping that did not make up the room until late in the day. So after walking around New York all day - when we came back at 4 or 5 to rest for the evenning - we had to wait for housekeeping to make up room - very annoying.And - probably the worrst - a concierge that told us how hard it was to book a pre theatre dinner (we made the request 3 hours before show time) When we left for the evenning he did not even make a suggestion for us! We found a restaurant with only a ten minute wait ourselves!Best - Tom at the small bar in the lobby, Makes a great drink  good conversation.Would definitely not stay there again!! Too many good hotels in New York City.

<Content>Worth a visit. Booked this Hotel as something special for parents 50th Wedding Anniversary. All staff extremely helpful, making sure we had all we needed. Classic old style decor, big rooms with nice bathroom, ask for view of St Patrick's Cathedral if available. Good location, near to everything without being right in the middle of it all. Had a great stay, and would recommend this to others. Close to Rockefeller Center, which has a wide variety of eateries underneath, and would also recommend a visit to their Observation Deck as is much better than the Empire State.

<Content>Wonderful hotel This is a wonderful hotel, probably the best we've ever stayed in, lovely spacious room and bathroom, and the friendliest and most helpful staff, with no exceptions. Its location is excellent too. Well worth paying extra for access to the executive lounge. Even the heavy rain couldn't dampen our enjoyment as the hotel provided huge umbrellas free of charge for the duration of our stay. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and will definitely stay there again!

<Author>gjlhtkhytmku,
<Content>better than expected New York Palace Hotel - New York city.Stayed 3 nights April '07.Having spent endless hours reading through lots of reviews on hotels in New York to make sure i made the right selection to suit our needs, i decided on the New York Palace. My email correspondance with Brian in the hotels reservations department was very encouraging as he was helpful and always prompt with responses. However nearer the time of our arrival, on checking other guest reviews, i was a little concerned, a few were negative about their stay. I shouldn't have worried, we had a fabulous stay at the hotel, i had paid an extra 30usd per night to guarantee a room with a view, which was spectacular, looking out onto St Patricks cathedral and worth every penny. The location of the hotel is also very good with easy access to Broadway and 5th avenue.The staff were always happy to assist in any way they could at all times.The hotel has a very warm and welcoming ambience.Unfortunately we did not eat in the hotel as it was very expensive but the concierge was able to recommend some nice restaurants for breakfast and dinner in the vicinity.If i had to find fault all i would say is that it is quite old fashioned, but we found that endearing, and the lady at the desk when we checked in was not particularly friendly but never the less very efficient.I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and will definately return there on future visits.

<Content>Perfect for a family Spent a week with our three children in a suite located in the towers. the room was perfect, great space which is unusual for New York, beautiful view, excellent location. The staff was professional but not really friendly except for the staff on the floor. The room service food was acceptable but too expensive for what it is , the bar located in the corridor is not nice and the new one is very cold and unfriendly. But the reception area is really nice. So it is a good option to spend some in NY and feel at home but don't expect too much from the staff.

<Content>Great hotel, but try to find packages Stayed at the Palace over Easter weekend, this is my second stay at this property and will defintely no be my last. Booked through the hotel's website and goot a good deal (stay 3 nights and 4th is free). Even though I find no fault with the hotel per se I do think that the regular room rates are not justified. If you can't find any type of promotion you'd be better off staying at the Pierre or Four Seasons for a similar rate. Still, this is a good hotel: location is excelent (try to get a Cathedral view room), rooms are huge by NY standards and with very comfortable beds and furniture (although a little dated), public spaces are wonderful, staff is professional and very helpful, but not on par with the rates they charge. Gilt is a wonderful restaurant, one of the better meals I've had in NY in the last few years, and the Gilt bar is hip and trendy in a very exclusive way (similar to the Campbell Apartment but no throngs of crowds here, very sedate and civilized). The hotel's casual restaurant is very small and can get very crowded for breakfast (don't order room service, same hidden charges and surcharges added an extra $40 to the exact same order we had in the restaurant the day before). The hotel caters to well heelled families mostly Spanish, British and Mexican, touring and shopping due to its proximity to landmarks and Madison Ave. and Fifth Ave. stores, but has every amenity you should need in a business trip. All in all, try to pay under $400 a weekend night and you've found yourself a great deal on this place!

<Content>Excellent stay (except for the slow shower drain!) My husband and I stayed here for one evening in April. We live in the tri-state area but were seeing a concert that night and didn't want the hassle of schlepping back home late at night. Everything was as expected for a hotel of this class. The rooms are done in an elegant but corporate way. The service I encountered was excellent. Plus the location is really ideal for anything in Midtown or Times Square. My only complaint was the very slow drain. Slow drains are just gross. The drain marred an otherwise excellent hotel stay.

<Content>Suprise Birthday, The Best. We had had a one stay March 31st to April 1st. I booked the room on line with the hotel and had the most knowledgeable reservation rep. named Joseph. I booked a one night package that gave me free parking, breakfast, the best Tower room with a view of the cathedral and $100 at Saxs Fifth. It was all a surprise for my wife and she never knew anything about it unit I pulled up to the door of the hotel and they escorted us in. From the minute we arrived the treated us like royalty. The towers privet check area was the best and the front desk workers made us feel like family. Everyone from the bell man to the door man and made it a great experience. The room in the towers was the best, from the chocolate cover strawberries to the surprise birthday cake from management, personal business cards, and letter head, it was awesome. We had room service for breakfast and it was served better than sitting in a restaurant. The complete facility was very clean and run like a true palace. The management of this hotel should be proud of the way this hotel is run and I can鈥檛 say enough about this place. Thanks NY Palace Hotel for a great time. We will ber back.

<Content>New York Palace was fantastic! My husband and I stayed at the New York Palace for four nights on the first leg of our annual holiday. This was my first time in New York my husbands second time. The New York palace lived up to all expectations, large rooms, first class service and we were lucky enough to get a room overlooking St Patrick's Cathedral which was a bouns. If you like steak then we had the most fabulous steak situated next door to the hotel, i think it was called Morrello and Porchello's this was one of the best steaks that I have eaten, however a word of advice don't order a starter as the steaks are huge double the size of any that I have had in the UK. I can't tell you what breakfast was like at the hotel as we eat at deli's which were great value.I highly recommend booking a show in advance of your trip. I decided to book for Mary Poppins 6 months in advance and we got really good seats - the show was excellent! I also recommend the Rockerfeller centre the view from the top is amazing.  We also did a helicopter tour which was ok rather expensive for what you got. If we had went to the Rockerfeller centre before the helicopter we probably wouldn't have bothered with the helicopter and saved ourselves $300.There is so much to do and see but if you are going to visit New York then I highly recommend the New York Palace as the place to stay.

<Content>Absolute Gem! New York Palace Hotel is an outstanding immaculate hotel. The lobby is elegant and staff is extremely courteous and helpful. Free wi-fi internet is available in the lobby and the best part of this hotel is by far the room size. I travel to NYC weekly for business and have had numerous hotel rooms half the size of the Palace's. The Palace room size trumps NY Hilton's executive suites and their Hilton Club apartments. The rooms are definitely older and more traditional in style however . Nonetheless, definitely worth the money if you can find a good deal. (~ $300) On busy weeks I've seen the prices jump two-fold which has forced me to other hotels - but I will always stay at the Palace whenever possible.For general comparison - I've stayed in Midtown at Hilton New York, Astoria Waldorf, Millenium Broadway, The Muse and The Royalton for a min. of 1 week each.

<Content>Much better than expected Went for the long President's Day weekend with my family of four.We often head down to NYC from Boston. This time, I booked the Palace through the Leading Hotels of the World Leaders Club Program. Highly recommend joining it. They found me an unbelievable rate of $295 per room. I requested adjoining rooms for my children, with two single beds (they are 12 and 15). The Palace came through with every request. We got excellent, and spacious rooms. Rooms 1211 and 1210. Not a great view but the rooms, baths and space were more important to us. I do not recommend eating breakfast there. Ridiciously prices . The concierge found other great places to eat.I also recommend the following:If you love sushi, you have to sit at the sushi bar at Sushi Yasuda.It it extraordinary! Pricey. But so worth it. We also went to the newly re-opened Russian Tea Room. Fun. Limited menu. Very russian, of course. But our family just had a great time.** Of note, in December my husband and I booked the Mandarin Oriental in NYC. It is outrageously expensive and our room was tiny! And I believe I asked for a Delux upgrade. It is certainly modern and interesting, but I was shocked at the size of the room and bath.That is why I was delightfully surprised at the price and the size of our connecting rooms at the Palace.

<Content>As Wonderful as Ever! This was my fifth stay at the Palace. The first stay was seventeen years ago. If anything, this property just keeps getting better and it was near perfect on my first stay.I stayed in a two-room suite in The Tower. I was with my mom (late 50's) and my three children (9,8, 5). I'm in my mid 30s and well travelled.The room was newly updated and done with a modern flair. The space was fantastic! The bathrooms were huge and decked out in marble and top quality fixtures. The beds were heaven. The housekeeping - superb! The view was amazing for our rooms on the 42nd floor. We faced St. Patrick's.Room Service was very pricey for what you got but hey...that's kind of expected in this type hotel.The location of the hotel is great.. Close to shopping, plays, the Rock and more!I've reviewed several hotels for this site and this is one of the best.

<Content>Great stay We had a lovely room with a fantastic view of St Patricks Cathedral. The concierge desk were very helpful with all our queries and probs. Very clean, good size room, plasma tv... Great location for everything. Loved especially the view and the massive windows. Only prob is we were on the 15th floor and you can hear the traffic noise very clearly. So if you are a light sleeper do not take the rooms overlooking Madison Ave.Overall very happy and will go back.

<Content>Great!!! Just got back from weekend away in NYC with some girlfriends. We loved the NY Palace Hotel. We had adjoining rooms on the 9th floor. I can't say enough about the Palace. The front desk staff is wonderful, very friendly and accomodating, there was a bellhop immediately available to take our luggage from us and show us to our rooms. We ate outside the hotel so I can't comment on the restaurants or the food at the hotel. Rooms were very clean and spacious. An all around great stay and would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Not what I expected PROS:- Front desk staff was great.- Bellhop accompanied me to my room and provided a verbal tour of the hotel and its amenities- good touch.- Room was clean and great views.- Very convenient location.CONS:- Plumbing: Bathtub drain and toilet flush were VERY slow - Double bed was EXTREMELY uncomfortable. Was up several times because of this and I am not the type that is picky about hotel beds. This was the most uncomfortable hotel bed that I have ever slept in.- There was no Comment Card in the room for me to give feedback.BOTTOM LINE:I love luxury and was really looking forward to a pampered stay at the Palace, which has a great reputation- I was disappointed.

<Content>Fantastic, so romantic Came for a 4 day break with my husband to have some time on our own ( we have 3 children) and couldnt have chosen a better place. We stayed in a room in the Tower section of the hotel and it was huge, with a big flat screen tv on the wall which we felt was a great touch. The only downside to the room was the shower and bath. the bath was quite small for such a large room and the shower was really slow, not a power shower as you would expect for this standard of room.Breakfast was included in our stay but only up to a spend of 30 dollars so you had to pay extra for coffee / juice exetra which was a bit misleading.Room service was very expensive 21 dollars for a pot of coffee!! and drinks in the bar were generally more than normal.The stafff were exeptional. no faults whatsoever. they were always polite and willing to help with everything. the conceirge recommended some great restuarants.The location couldnt be better. right on top of 5th ave.all in all we had a great stay and would go back if we returned to new york.

<Content>A True Palace! A return visit for my boyfriend and I to New York after a fantastic time Christmas/New Year 05/06.We arrived at The New York Palace around 4pm on Thursday 28th December 2006 to be greeted by the very friendly and welcoming door men. Our luggage was taken care of and we were directed to the main reception area to check in. Though extremely busy, the service was spot on and everything was taken care of straight away for us, our email before hand had been worth while, (I recommend this to ensure a magnificent view!) as we were given a room high up and looking over St.Patrick's Cathedral which we had requested. We were briefly shown around the absolutely wonderfully decorated hotel and then taken up to our room. The room was immaculate, very nicely furnished and surprisingly big for a city hotel. The view was breath-taking especially at night, St.Patrick's Cathedral, the fwell known yellow taxi's beneath us and Sak's to the left - what more could you want! Room service was excellent, we quite often bought some wine to drink in the room as the prices downstairs were quite steep, so ice buckets were requested and were with us within minutes, always by a friendly member of staff!Location wise, we couldn't ask for anything better, minutes walk to everything uptown and if not, the subway was just around the corner. A truely FANTASTIC hotel, we were very sad to leave. A deffinate on our return list, it`s a must!! A true Palace!!

<Content>Nothing special about the room but good service Spent two nights here. The service was generally good. My major disappointment was the room - after asking for a high room with a view, we had a high room that looked across 60 feet to a solid brick wall. This was a Saturday/Sunday stay and I know some rooms overlooking the cathedral were empty. Why irritate a customer like that? The bellman were great - always on their toes to help you. Ate two meals in the restaurant - food was good; the service was generally good although late one night the wait staff appeared more interested in talking and switching to breakfast than serving. Concierge was knowledgeable and helpful.

<Content>What a classy place I went to the Palace right before New Years so it was a busy time for them. Even so, I felt as though they still provided me with everything I needed (though I didn't need much) and were always friendly and courteous. The rooms are well sized and more than comfortable. The slippers were definitely a nice touch along with the dark chocolate for turn down. Really worth the money if you want to stay at a great hotel and at a great location.

<Content>Amazing holiday, shame about the receptionist!! Upon arriving in New York my partner and I were very excited about our first trip to the city. When we pulled up outside the hotel we were greeted by the bellman who were extremely attentive and friendly. Unfortunately this was not the case as we aproached reception! While checking in the young lady at reception who was very cocky and rude then infomed us that they required a $500 payment via credit card for use of fridge and phone which we had no intention of using! As a young couple we had saved for many months for this trip and after paying over 1000 pounds each we had not expected this additonal cost. She then rather arrogantly asked for it in cash which we were not wiling to do as this was our spending money for our trip! Her atitude was then to tell us that it was company policy and told us that should we not make this down payment then there was no place for us at the hotel! As you can imagine after 10 hours of travelling we were both slightly worried and angry, not a good start to our holiday! After speaking with her manager we were informed that it would be waivered but for the remainder of our stay we both felt that reception staff were rude, abrupt and very cold towards us! Great location and the bellman and concierge staff were fantastic extremely helpful. My partner and I will both be returning to the city just not to this hotel!

<Content>Night of Horrors I stayed at the Palace Hotel in New York City with my family at the end of December, 2006 I picked this hotel because of its location to all the holiday sights. I can tell you that I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. After a long day of seeing the sights, having dinner and enjoying a play all I wanted to do was get into bed and sleep to get ready for the next fun filled day. As my whole family fell asleep, I layed there and began to hear scratching in the walls that surrounded my room. I am from the country and know those sounds ,,...they are the sounds of rodents! I heard them scratch all night. It was really creepy and at one point the sound was so close I thought it was in my room. I complained to management in the morning but all the Front Desk Manager said was they would investigate and let me know. The apology she gave me was insincere and almost dismissive. She gave me her card and said she would contact me in two days after they investigated. It has been a week and I have not heard from them and do not think I ever will! I will never stay at this hotel again. Our family travels thoughout the year and in all the hotels we have stayed at, I have never ever heard rodents or been treated by management the way this hotel treats its guests!

<Content>Pure Quality, if you don't mind the high cost Stayed here in September for a week. Had a great room overlooking the church (17th floor). I was in NY on business and found this hotel ideal, service was good and the bar area was impressive.This is an excellent hotel and is quite stunning inside, but you do pay for it - (my room rate was of around $600 a night).Overall very happy with the hotel, though I must admit the 9 clean towels I got each day did seem a little excessive and I had to laugh at the cost of bowel of cornflakes delivered to my room for $27.

<Content>Excellent - as usual We have just returned from a four night stay at the Palace and as usual stepping through the doors takes you to another world, away from the hustle and bustle of NYC into a world of good taste and luxury. This was our third stay and I can only say that each stay has been perfect. We stayed as usual in an executive room which gave us access to the remodelled executive lounge which is even better than it was before - better food presentations, free business internet access and excellent private concierge facilities, got us a reservation in Balthazar for that evening!!!The rooms are not the 'height of fashion' with plasma TV's et al, but are comfortable and luxurious as one would expect from a hotel of this calibre.The only slight critisism I could find, which I have found each time we have visited is the front desk /check in staff are somewhat cold and aloof, but as we only see them briefly to check in I can cope with that.

<Content>Overall good but pricey We had stayed here before some years ago but found the standard as good as previously although the rooms seem to have shrunk in size! in particular the bathroom was very small for a $600 a night hotel even in NYC. However the bedroom was ok although we had an interconnecting door which when the room adjacent was occupied (fortunately on our last night only) allowed tv noise.through ----at 6am! We complained but got no compensation. We paid for the Execurive room and were therefore allowed acess to the drink and dining facilities on the 39th floor-a good option if a bit expensive. Breakfast there was included and was excellent and there was also good internet access. You could have drinks all day and there were various snacks as well.The location is excellent ,near all the Stores and the staff were 1st class-the bellman had been there over 20 years so they must look after them.The lobby can get crowded but is very impressive ,especially if you use the Madison Ave entrance.We stayed for 6 days and will return.

<Content>Terrible Front Office Manager at the Towers The staff at this hotel are usually helpful and nice but I had the most horrible experience with a lady who called herself the front office manager of the Towers, which is supposed to be the more exclusive part of this 5* deluxe luxury hotel.I arrived at 11:30 am and was told that my room was still unavailable. After a very long flight, fatigued  jetlagged, I coordinated with the reception staff (who are all very nice and helpful) to get the smaller of my two-room suite arranged first so that I could get a much-needed rest first -- and then housekeeping could take their time with the main suite.Unfortunately, housekeeping did not take care of this in spite of the many staff assurances that they were doing this, and in spite of the fact that I was waiting there in the lobby for hours.Instead of apologizing for this housekeeping oversight, this so-called front office manager refused to acknowledge that housekeeping had made a mistake in not cleaning my rooms first as requested. This is a 5* deluxe hotel and I was staying 7 nights in a two-bedroom suite; all I wanted to do was to try and check in an hour or two earlier (it was already 2:20 pm) as I was exhausted. I did not think this was so unreasonable.Instead, this lady manager kept repeating hotel policy about check-in times (in spite of the fact that about 15 people all checked in for the night within the 90 minutes or so that I was sitting in the lobby, and aparently their rooms were ready!) and even had the gall to say to me that if I wanted to check in earlier than 4 pm next time, I should think about paying for the night before as well. She said this with a straight face to someone who had already booked a two-bedroom suite for herself for a week.This woman was completely devoid of customer skills, especially for a front office manager of a luxury hotel. All it could have taken was an apology, a promise to find out what happened, and an offer of a drink or a cup of tea compliments of the house (which the concierge kindly did) to make things better. Instead, she had to make me feel that it was my fault for wanting to check in early and that she did not have to do anything about this.Needless to say, they have lost a customer for life and gained a lifetime of bad PR. I have stayed in luxury hotels all my life and have never been treated this way before. This hotel manager is a disgrace and this check-in experience (which should have been good, as the actual reception staff are wonderful) on my last visit completely ruined my stay.

<Content>Excellent Hotel in a Great Location Stayed for 2 nights earlier this month in an executive room (access to executive lounge on 39th floor with excellent breakfast buffet, lunch and snacks and drinks all included). Corner room on 38th floor was very spacious. Excellent fitness centre on 8th floor overlooking St Patrick's Cathedral. Friendly and efficient staff throughout. Executive lounge is a great feature for breakfast and pre dinner drinks in the evening. Would be delighted to return to this hotel in the future.

<Content>Fantastic experience Just got back from our trip to NYC. My sister-in-law took and I took our girls for an early birthday trip to see the Rockette's Holiday show and a day at American Girl Place. From the minute our girls stepped foot in the hotel, they were made to feel like princesses. Every staff member we encountered was friendly, helpful, and considerate. The doormen struck just the right note with the girls, the bell hop brought up a surprise for the girls (their very own bathrobe for their American Girls doll which was extra special since we had not signed up for that package), the concierage gave us great recommendations for dinner with the girls (Ellen's Stardust Diner is great fun, great food, fast service). We arrived at 10 AM but within an hour we received a call on our cell phone that our room was ready.Every request we made (ice, extra pillows, etc) was filled quickly. The room was large enough for 4, overlooking St. Patrick's on the 15th floor. The bathroom was spotless, the towels large, and supple. Loved the extra touches like putting the towels on the floor so our feet wouldn't have to touch the carpet when we got out of bed. The slippers and bathrobes were great. The large flat screen TV that swiveled was great so the girls could watch TV in bed to wind down after a couple tiring, exciting days.Best of all was the location. We were able to look out our window and see the beautiful St. Patrick's cathedral and the Radio City sign. We walked to Central Park, Radio City, and lots of stores in between. With girls turning 8  9, there was not one complaint about being too tired. Everything is so close and convenient.We loved it and hope to do it again soon!

<Content>Great Hotel My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights whilst on honeymoon in New York. We had a lovely room on the 16th floor overlooking St Patricks Cathedral.Maid service was excellent, concierge was fantastic and the reception staff were great.Bellboys were ok, however we found them more interested in chatting amongst themselves rather than helping customers.We had lunch at the restaurant on the last day which was not very good at all. It took about half an hour for a waiter to come and take our drinks order and then another fifteen minutes to get our food order taken. We were a bit diasppointed as it wasn't what we expected in the restaurant of a first class hotel!Overall, i would definitely stay in the New York Palace again, I just wouldn't eat in the restaurant!

<Content>big rooms, great view We'd read some less than enthusiasic reviews, so were a bit apprehensive. However, our room had a fantastic view looking west over the cathedral, and really quite a lot of space for a NY hotel. The taxi-getting and baggage service was very good, by and large. The Gilt bar is great fun (very expensive, though). Technology a bit old fashioned: had to ask for working remote control, and one day, internet access will be less than US$15 for 15 minutes. Great location.

<Content>A Great Hotel This is one of the better hotels in NYC. We were able the check in early, and a bellman whisked us up to our room on the 22nd floor. We booked a standard king and it was wonderful. Very large, nice bathroom, very nice compared to the Waldorf or The Essex House Hotels which are in the same price category. My husbands company paid for the room, but the rate was a bit high ($510 per night, plus taxes), we would never spend that much out of our own pocket. Overall a nice luxury hotel.

<Content>Lackluster Luxury-ish I am accustomed to staying in NYC hotels of this category, and at first sight, the Palace stands tall. The building, the lobby and all public areas are outstanding. I stayed in a room which was $545, probably among their lower priced rooms---but still, it represented a severe drop in quality from my first impressions. It was basically a completely ordinary room, ordinary furnishings, cheap old fashioned tv, nothing whatsoever which would give you the impression of any level of luxury. The bedding was well below the standards of the chain hotels which seem to pride themselves on bedding these days. The Palace bed had thin, cheap feeling linens, a completely average blanket, all what you might expect at the most ordinary Sheraton. Even the bathroom lotions and potions were ordinary, private labelled, just like you'd find in a Hilton or Marriot. There wasn't even a thermostat in the room! I should add that the lobby staff is abundant with bellhops, but every time I needed them, I had to interrupt their constant chatter among themselves. And finally, at checkout, there was $60 of food charged to my account which I had never purchased. They fixed it, but still, this is not how fine hotels operate. Take a look at the St. Regis if you'd like to enjoy luxury done right at a similiar price.

<Content>cockroach in my room! Whilst the location of the hotel could not be faulted, we did enounter a few problems that could not be overlooked during our stay..From the outset we were not happy with the cleanliness of the rooms (we had booked two rooms - one for myself and one for my parents). Both rooms were in a similar condition. On my penultimate morning, i awoke to find a cockroack in my bathroom. I was absolutely disgusted (not to mention quite scared!) but managed to trap the thing under a dustbin!I then called reception to ask that the matter be resolved ie if someone could come up and remove it from my room. I was told it would be dealt with immediately. Howver, this did not happen. In total i had to make 3 calls spanning an hour and my parents had to make a complaint at reception (thereby interrupting their breakfast - there were waiting for me at breakfast downstairs), for any kind of resolution. It was after after an hr, 3 calls and one complaint and that my call was returned and i was told i would need to move rooms as they would have to call an exterminator. I had to pack all my belongings with the cockroach still under the bin as no one ever did come up to remove it! i found this to be ridiculous for a so-called 4-5 star hotel (depending on which sites you look at). I have stayed at many hotels as have my parents and we have never enoutered anything like this before even in hotels with lesser star ratings and certainly not when paying such a large amount for two rooms!! No kind of gesture was offered to compensate for a cockroach being in my 拢1600 a week room and the fact that the hotel had been so incompetant when trying to resolve the matter. It was only when my mum pointed out that we had in fact wasted half a day dealing with the matter, moving rooms etc,,, and that she felt that we should thefore be allowed a late checkout that any kind of gesture was made, and were allowed this small priviledge. I feel that a hotel with such a good repuation should have been forthcoming with any gesture, rather than us having to ask.It seems as though they were hoping a hollow apology would suffice.In addition to the cockroach incident, my parents had to wait over an hr for some glasses to be brought up to their room (the maid had removed them but not left any replacements). My dad needed the glass in order to be able to take his medication with water yet the hotel was not even able to provide this simple service.Upon checkout the lady at reception tried to charge us for the late checkout which had been granted to us due to the cockroach in my room. When my mother informed her that the manager had said we could leave at any time. She responded.rudely saying 'You SHOULD have left at 12'. It was only when my mother asked her to ask the manager that the matter was resolved. Although even then, she did not apologise for her rude and abrasive manner.The only positive things i can say about this hotel is that the location is great but there are also a great many other hotels in the vicinity and i would advise anyone to choose any one of those over the New York Palace. The staff at breakfast were lovely as was the lady at the concierge.i will be returning to the New York in January but needless to say, i will NOT be staying at the New York Palace.

<Content>An Exceptional Experience Our stay at the Palace Hotel in NYC was exceptional from the moment the bellman opened our car door to the front desk check in to our beautiful room overlooking St.Patrick's Cathedral and the NY skyline. We were treated wonderfuly - everyone was sincerely nice, and helpful and professional - a great blend. The room was spotless and nicely appointed and we had access to the Concierge Lounge. From a full course breakfast, to a full luncheon buffet to hot and cold appetizers and open bar, we almost didn't need to eat out. The staff there were also very pleasant and the food was great. This hotel has everthing one would need for a delightful stay in the city.The location is perfect and the rooms are so quiet - a real treat given the noise level at most hotels. This hotel has earned its exceptional reputation.

<Content>Showing some wear, but a class act I used to stay at the NY Palace all the time on business 5-8 years ago, and now usually stay at other hotels. I stayed there last week for the first time in a while due to the convenience of its location. I always enjoy seeing the familiar faces of the doormen, porters and other professional staff members at this very solid hotel. I will say, however, that the decor is starting to wear down. Carpet, upholstery and paint were all showing signs of heavy use over the years in my room and on my floor. With numerous fresher options in Midtown, and standard rooms running easily $700/night all-in, I think the management should really consider a freshening program. Even the elevator buttons are scratched up.

<Content>Palace exceeded expectations! I recently stayed at the New York Palace for 5 nights during a shopping trip to NY with my daughter. We booked one of the newly renovated executive rooms with access to the executive club. On arrival the lobby was rather busy as it was for most of the duration of our stay but we were checked in almost immediately. We were allocated a room on the 31st floor with a terrific view of the cathedral and the city. The room was also bigger then we expected (especially by NY standards) but the bathroom was really quite small, and in my opinion not big enough for two people to share (for example there was only one sink, for a hotel of this calibre I would expect twin sinks). However, I would just point out that when the hotel says 'renovated' rooms I think they mean they have just installed new carpets and wall paper, as the furniture, linen, curtains etc. did not look too new, although overall the room was in very good condition. The beds were very comfortable and the room clean, however, on the second day we noticed a slight problem with out room in that certain areas of it had a slight smell if sick. We contacted reception making them aware of out problem and they were very apologetic and rather embarrassed at the problem and promptly moved us to a room on the 33rd floor with the same view. We only ever visited the executive club for breakfast so didn't really take full advantage of it, but the breakfast was superb and we made sure that when we did eat there we ate in large volumes! But if you plan on eating most of your meals in the hotel I agree with other reviewers that executive club access would be great value.The staff are very attentive and arrived almost immediately if we phoned to request something to our room, and made sure that all our needs (e.g. alternative bedding due to allergy to feathers) were taken care of. The concierges and doormen seemed helpful but were often very busy and I think it would probably be better if there were a few more of them around.The hotels location is just perfect for shopping, and apparently it is good for sight-seeing as well, but with so much shopping to be done we had more pressing activities to be completed.Overall, our stay at the Palace was great and I would definitely recommend it to anyone travelling to New York- We're looking forward to hopefully returning next year!

<Content>Executive Level A Must!!! My best friend and I spent 5 days and 4 nights at the New York Palace on the Executive Level. It was well worth the extra money for this level due to access to the Executive lounge. This lounge offered breakfast, lunch, cocktails, internet access, and numerous other ammenities during our stay. The staff in the lounge were especially thoughtful and catered to your every need. There was one in particular, named Juan, who was so cordial and greeted us everytime we went there (which was at least three times a day). We never ate in the restaurants in the hotel, because they were quite expensive, and why would we, when we had the lounge. I did order a cheeseburger at 11 PM from room service that came out to $75 (yeah, that's correct, for one cheeseburger and a bottle of Fiji water), that was quite good, but I could not complain about the price, we were getting free food in the lounge. The room had two double beds, very clean (excellent housekeeping staff) and comfortable beds. The view was less desirable (a brick wall), but the bell hop called the front desk to change the view, but they did not have anything for the amount of nights we were staying. We did not really care about the view, because everything else was fabulous. Manhattan was great, and we would definately stay at the Palace again, just maybe ask for a better view next time.

<Content>Beautiful Hotel I booked this hotel for one night while I was staying in the city with my cousin. I must say every worker I came in contact with was very helpful and cordial. I had requested two doubles, non smoking, higher floor, facing Madison Avenue, St. Patricks Cathedral. When I checked in at 4:30pm, standard check in is 3:00pm. They tried giving me a kind bed, but I said I wanted two doubles, then they were going to give me doubles in a smoking room. I told them no smoking and they said it would be twenty minutes. That was the only thing that bothered me, but they were very nice about it. However, once we arrived in our room everything was fine. We were on the 28th floor Room #2819 overlooking St. Patricks Cathedral, it was beautuiful. The room was spacious, and we had guests visit us and it never felt cramped. I would stay here agian in a heartbeat, I recieved a cheaper rate through my corporate account, so it was worth it for me.

<Content>I found the service wonderful My husband and I stayed at the hotel for a long weekend. We were greeted very warmly by ALL staff and were very pleased when we were not only able to check into our room by noon, but we also had the requested view of the chuch front and center.Each day we stopped and spoke with staff. I found the concierge so friendly and interested in what we were doing. I often stay at the Waldorf andImust say i felt the service here was even better. the rooms themselves are luxurious if standard , my husband liked his remote control bedside. We usually book suites at the Waldorf which we do enjoy when traveling with our son.I only write this review because from the manager who graciously extended our stay in our lovely room at a moments notice even though i was told the hotel was full by the front desk, to the maid who let me into my room when I locked myself out, to nice man at the entrance who when he had not been able to give us attention for a cab allowed us a wonderful ride in the hotels car to the theater we were made to feel special and welcome each time we returned to or left the hotel..My husband says I am very particiular and I know I am not easy to please .... but .they really did. Thanks to all for making my anniversary perfect and hello from the Virgin Islands

<Content>Amazing Hotel! The hotel was amazing. There were a few disappointments, but none that ruined our stay. We booked 2 rooms on a high floor with early check in. We were placed on the 22nd floor, but were not able to check into our rooms early. In fact we weren't able to check into our rooms until 1pm. Not too big of deal. We asked the concierge for breakfast recommendations and took a little walk after. The front desk said they would call once the rooms were available. Around 1pm, we returned to the hotel and checked on the rooms. It appeared they were ready an hour earlier, but the hotel neglected to follow through with a phone call. The bellman was very nice and gracious and gave us a complete tour of the room. Everything was forgotten once we entered the rooms. The view directly in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral and Rockerfeller Center was beautiful. The rooms were cleaned right away once we left for the day. Beds were turned down every evening. Fresh towels were placed in the bathroom daily. Laundry service was expensive, but very good. When requesting to have our shoes polished we were told it would be complimentary.Room service was extremely expensive. $100 for a small pizza, a chicken quesadilla, and cheesecake. Expensive as it was, it was the best room service food I've ever eaten. The doormen were very nice and courteous and went out of their way each time to secure taxis that would take our group of 5 together at the same time. Check out was at 12pm, but we were about to sneak out around 12:30pm. The lines at the front desk were very long between 11am-12pm. Around 12:30pm it appreared that everyone had either finished checking out or checking in and I was able to check out within 3 minutes. The same bellman that took our bags to our room was the same bellman that arrived to bring our bags down. He checked the entire room to make sure we had not left anything behind and was nice when he did find items that we had. All in all, the hotel was wonderful. The hiccups were neglible compared to the room perks and the pleasantness of the hotel staff. I will definitely stay at the New York Palace again and have already begun to tell all my friends about my great experience.

<Content>Faulty Service Based on the previous TripAdvisor reviews, we had looked forward to a stay at the Palace for quite some time. While the hotel is quite grand and impressive in the public areas, the rooms are just ordinary compared with the many other hotels where we have stayed in NY. Our rooms were not in the Towers, so I cannot speak to the quality of those accommodations. The main complaints with this hotel are related to the service at the front desk. Guests are not greeted in a friendly manner, and none of the agents ever cracked a smile. We had booked one of our party's rooms for two nights, and the other two rooms for one night apiece.When we checked into the first room (the two-nighter), we asked about getting a room on a higher floor because of previous TripAdvisor reviews we had read. The agent informed us all of those rooms were completely booked, although it was still fairly early on a Friday. The bellman who brought us to our room made a statement about the hotel not being very busy for the weekend, so that raised some questions about why the front desk had given us a different story.The next afternoon when the other two groups from our party arrived, they were told their rooms were not ready yet, but one of them was being inspected and the other was in the process of being cleaned. We returned around 4pm to the bad news that the rooms were still not available. Check-in is clearly advertised on their website and other marketing materials as 3:00pm. As it turned out, the rooms didn't end up being ready until almost 6:00pm. You can bet the hotel would charge guests for an additional night if they were to check out three hours late! Six of us ended up getting ready in one room for an evening at dinner and the theater.On Sunday morning, we were finally able to resolve all these issues with a manager, and received a fifty percent discount on two of the three rooms. This required several return trips to the front desk, however, as the agents stated up front that the manager was not available to speak with guests about anything.I would like to think these service issues were not the norm, but would be very hesitant to return to the Palace.

<Content>Great location, beautiful building but disappointing! We stayed at the New York Palace Hotel for 5 nights for a special celebration, having done a lot of research to ensure our trip was not spoilt by a disappointing hotel. The location was great. The view from our room (overlooking St. Patrick's Cathedral) was breathtaking, both day and night, and exceeded our expectations. The combination of historical mansion and skyscraper provides a luxurious and unusual hotel for New York and the interior is beautiful. The housekeeping was exceptional and the housekeeping staff were both professional and friendly. We were very happy to leave them a tip. However, the food in the Istana restaurant (casual) was extraordinarily expensive for its ambiance, with breakfast items individually priced (coffee at breakfast $7!). The atmosphere was more like an airport waiting lounge than a luxury hotel, with various business people coming in from outside the hotel for breakfast meetings and people walking through carrying coffee purchased from nearby franchises. Each day, we were asked if we had made a reservation (for breakfast in a hotel we were staying at at significant expense!). Even on Sunday afternoon, when we just went for a cup of coffee (there being no refreshment making facility or provisions in the room), we were surrounded by three groups of businessmen having business meetings and making notes. Consequently, we did not have dinner there. We tried to book for the luxury restaurant but did not succeed as you could only ring at certain times, you could not call in to book, you could not make a same-day booking and we did not want to waste our precious time hanging around. I had read comments before our visit of guests who had felt they were treated really specially. We were greeted on the first day by one of the porters who went to great lengths to explain everything in the room and that he would be looking after us for the whole of our stay. We tipped him - but never saw him again. The staff were always professional and competent, but we ended up feeling resentful of having to tip all the time, just for people to do their job. Although it is a large hotel, and I didn't really expect anyone to remember our names, it would have meant a lot to us if someone had asked if we were enjoying our stay. That would have made our total stay there special, instead of us just staying in a special building. Unlike the business and wealthy guests, we won't be able to afford to go again, so it's a shame it was disappointing.

<Content>Average 4 stars hotel, service leaves something to be desired Location is good, close to 5th avenue (shopping district) and office blocks on 6th Ave.Overall this is only a 4 star hotel at best. Rooms are a bit dated and this is evident in the bathroom (shower falling apart, tap not working properly). They are clean and spacious though. But service is a big let down. I was allocated a room next to the lifts which was unbearably noisy. Everytime the lifts go past the floor one can hear the loud noise and also feel the vibration. I asked for a change of room and had to speak to SIX people before being transferred to the manager (everytime had to explain the situation again). One of the female staff I spoke to even told me that I have checked in for a few hours already (and why not complain earlier if there is a problem) and so there is nothing she could do!! I left the room straightaway to take advantage of my limited time in NY and was surprised that a staff at a supposedly 5 stars hotel could make such a comment when customers report a problem.

<Content>The Name Says It All The name says it all...this hotel is a palace! You walk in and the check-in area is very boutiqueish and charming. Once you get checked in you walk into the main lobby, and your jaw drops because it is so beautiful. A grand staircase to the mezzanine surrounds it. It offers a marvelous view of St. Patrick's Cathedral. My room was on the 34th floor and had an amazing view of the East River. Elevators were frequent and fast and make your ears pop! The service couldn't have been better...all the staff were friendly. Only complaint was that it was a bit of a walk from the subway. Still, this hotel is a hands down winner!

<Content>Excellent 5star hotel We stayed at the New York Palace on the 6th April 2006 for 3 nights. We found this hotel perfect for a 3day break in the big apple. The room was big enough for a family of 4, well looked after wilth a splendid view of New York. Maybe business travellers are far too fussy but for a family break you won't beat this hotel.

<Content>great hotel This is a great hotel close to everything. The only problem we had was the rooms on the oppisite side to the church which face the air con units which go on all night and are very loud. Once we swapped rooms to the other side it was much better. Breakfast was very expensive but there are lots of places to eat near by . Rooms were spacious and very clean.

<Content>The Palace Loves You Back We've stayed at The Palace four or five times over the past ten years. Have always had an outstanding experience. Impeccable service -- I love the absolute quiet of their hallways and the service lights so you don't have staff bursting into the room for which YOU are paying. Their doormen are an experience unto themselves. The jokes and the patter are so NYC that you wouldn't even have to walk up to 5th Ave. (did I mention the fabulous location and the view overlooking St. Patrick's Cathedral?)to get a taste of the city. These guys ARE the city!Anyway. We have had great experiences there. Once I flew cross-country and arrived at the registration desk, reached into my wallet...and had no credit card! It was a horrifying experience but the staff was kind and understanding and allowed me to go to the room and unpack the jacket in which pocket I had left the card (long story, stupid me). And they say New Yorker's don't have hearts? But the best experience of all was our most recent visit when we traveled with my mother-in-law. We were only staying in the city for one night. We had reserved our rooms well in advance, but when we arrived, there seemed to be some kind of problem. We were directed to the Tower registration area, which confused us, since we were only staying one evening. It turned out that the hotel was extremely busy that evening, and in order to accommodate us, they put my husband and me in one enormous suite on the 40th floor and my mother-in-law in another enormous suite across the hall. Each suite had a full kitchen, a dining room table, beautiful living area and lovely bedroom, of course. The view was stunning -- all the way to the river. NONE of us wanted to leave the next day!Great hotel, great service, holds up over time. Don't forget to tip the door men!

<Content>Think Twice WE stayed at The Palace because of the good reviews here, and it was in the American Express Platinum Program. If you like a VERY stuffy, Snobby staff this is the place for you! If You like a room service menu where a bagle w/creme cheese is $25, a glass og OJ $10 this is the hotel for you! The first day were were awakened to drilling and our entire room vibrating. When we called to complain we were greeted with a basic who cares attitude. We were not told upon reserving or upon check in we would encounter any construction noise. We were told The manager was out of the country, we later found this to be a a lie. The bad thing is that this is an independantly owned hotel so there is no where to complain with a problem. WE have stayed at the finest hotels in NYC and never encountered attitude like this. We came back from a day of shopping to find our lock completely hanging out of or door. We were left with a screaming baby in the hallway for almost 1/2 hour before help arrives. They never even said sorry. When you stay at a Ritz or St. Regis here you are treated much differently, with respect. If there is a problem they fix it, not here. They treated us like second class citizens. THink twice before wasting your money.The Rits or St. Regis is the way to go.

<Content>Overrated... We stayed at the Palace for 8 nights during April. We had requested early check because flight from Australia was arriving early and also requested a high floor room. We were able to access our high floor room upon arrival.Room was good (as it should be). Room service was also good.Like the previous reviewer, concierge desk was always busy and they were generally always on the phone. Unlike the previous review, I found the male concergie staff to be rude and unhelpful and the female helpful. Front desk staff also rude and unhelpful. I noticed one front desk lady (with hair done like she had put her fingers in an electric socket) being so rude to a guest it was embarrassing to be standing within hearing range.I thought the food was average and disappointing particularly given the price.But the hotel probably gets away with these shortcomings because of the location. It is very central and within easy walking distance of a lot of major areas. We would easily walk to the Broadway restaurants and theaters, major shopping areas and Central Park.Overall, OK but expected more.

<Content>Fantastic on all levels I just spent two fantastic weeks at the palace hotel in a beautiful towers junior suite. I nearly stayed at the waldorf and I am so glad I didn't. Everything was perfect- the bed was so comfortable, the staff were polite and friendly, the food was high quality and very fresh, the location was safe and perfect for an after dinner stroll. My only hesistation was the concierge desk was always to busy to approach and when you did finally get through I found the women concierge unpleasant and snappy to talk to. Apart from this,I will definitely return.

<Content>simply fantastic!! I researched many hotels in new york before choosing the palace! I took my girlfriend here for her 21st so i wanted it to be special and it was! The hotel is perfectly located to get to most places by foot. Make sure you ask for a view of the cathedral and get as high up as you can. You will have a view of 5th avenue and radio city as well as the beautiful St Patricks cathedral. All the staff are friendly and efficient. Dont be tempted to have room service unless your lucky enough to be able to afford the hefty bill! If you choose the palace you wont go far wrong!

<Content>What a hotel!!! I was there for St Patricks Day 2006, so the location couldn't have been better, right next to 5th Avenue and St Patricks Cathedral. The hotel is a grand master, with a beautiful lobby and staff that couldn't do enough for you. They never hold out their hands expecting tips, but work hard, remember your name etc. The rooms are lovely, I was on the 35th floor with a view to die for, over the cathedral, WOW!! The hotel location is very good, 15 mins walk to Times Square, 10 mins to Grand Central Station, 5 mins to Rockafella. Room service is more expensive than I've ever seen but you dont have to pay these prices if you dont want to! The turn down service and maids were especially good, what a feeling ona cold night to return to the room to find the bed turned down, robes and slippers out for you, tv remote on the bed side table. Loved the hotel, will be back again and again!!

<Content>Excellent Outstanding property. A million dollar view. Insist on a high floor.Very expensive food - basic breakfast is about $30 a person - but options around the hotel at much much less.Wonderful service and luxury with a fine location.

<Content>What can one say its a palace My husband and I have been lucky to stay at the Palace on several occasions.Its such a gorgeous old world hotel and makes you feel so special as soon as you walk in.We always have room 2915 its incredible...such a big deluxe space,stunning bathroom with incredible views of St. Patrick Cathedral.Its incredibly clean and the staff do a fantastic job in keeping it that way.All the staff where fantastic from the men out the front to the front desk,and the staff that service the rooms.Its located in a fantastic part of town, right in the heart of midtown...close to all the sights.Great shopping and wonderful restaurants.Be warned as magnificent as this hotel is its not called the Palace for no reason.From in room dinning to breakfast down stairs the prices are fit for a king.After a night on the town we got back and requested some room service,2 serves of French fries and sparkling mineral water we were amazed by the $50 bill that came with it.All in all the hotel is incredible and worth every dime.Perfect for special occasions.

<Content>A great hotel, beautiful view We stayed at this hotel based on Trip Advisor. The lobby was gorgeous! The men outside the door were very kind. The front desk on check-in was very helpful! The room was okay, I was expecting a bit more extravagant for the price. It was clean, but a bit dated and worn. Upon checking out, they do NOT have express check out as they want you to pay your charges seperately???I did not get that as they had my debit card/Visa numbers at check in. I was on a schedule so I hurried up to the desk(everyone waiting in line,at least 10 people) were NOT happy. I said I did not have any extra charges, she checked real quick and let me go, but then I received no final bill.That was my problem. I did not expect such a long checkout line, all the hotels I have stayed at, always have express checkout.

<Content>Good Quality We had bookd the Palace for my sisters wedding which was being held in Ny , we had booked 4 rooms for 5 nights and got quite a competitive rate , so all was good.Generally rooms were large , well appointed , clean as they should at no matter if its a 2 or 5 star.Got great views of st pats Cathederal from the room. Staff were all very propfessionl,courteous and friendly, Accommadation staff deserve extra mentioning for being so good at their jobs and have a friendly down to earth mannner.Food prices in this property though are exorborant, $100 for two burgers and fries??? All in all a good property, ideally suited to the middle aged client, will stay in the W or similar on the next trip, untill I reach the 50 + age bracket!

<Content>A special place for a special occaision Stayed at the Palace for our anniversary. Everything was perfect. Our room was ready early as requested. The suite was very well appointed and had a magnificent view over St. Patrick's cathedral. Room service breakfast was an extra special treat on this trip. The food was great and everything about the service and presentation was just so.

<Content>Fantastic Stay at the Palace I chose the New York Palace from the reviews on Tripadvisor, for a special visit to the city to celebrate my partner's birthday. It was magnificent and she was thrilled! We stayed in a deluxe room on the 21st floor overlooking St Patrick's Cathedral. The room was bigger than expected and although the bathroom was on the small side it was immaculate. We dined out - food is expensive in-house - but the location is so central that there are limitless options available within a mile of the hotel.The staff were very efficient and courteous. When my attempt at accessing my email account froze, the engineer arrived immediately and refunded the fee. For a special occasion, or just a comfortable stay in the City, the New York Palace will be difficult to beat!

<Content>Palace is Great Our stay at The New York Palace was very pleasant. It was during Christmas and it was so beautiful. We could not take enough photos in the lobby or with the great big tree in the courtyard. The location is great. A few blocks from shopping, theatre.The room was very nice, but it was not relaxing. It was very formal and the color scheme of gold and navy seemed a bit much. The furniture was very nice. My last few stays in New York were at the Sofitel and the rooms are more modern with white bedding, duvet, down comforters, lap blankets and simple color schemes made it feel more inviting and homey. I have to add that I did choose the hotel because it was formal which I prefer, but it did seem cold. The view from our room at the Palace was awesome. I have not stayed in the tower, but plan to in the future. The staff was very friendly. My first day, it was raining/drizzling. I started for the door with my kids and the concierge came running over with a huge golf umbrella that was complimentary. I stayed with my husband and our two kids and we will stay at the Palace again.

<Content>The palace lives up to expectations........ We have just returned from a four night stay at The Palace and it really is a wonderful hotel. Our room on the 31st floor had a breathtaking view of St Patricks Cathedral and was spacious and very well appointed. Little extras like the complimentary bathrobes, slippers and toiletries added a very nice touch. Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful, always greeting you by name. The only slight criticism we have is that we booked an executive room and just prior to departure we were advised by our booking agent that the executive lounge was being refurbished. The hotel offered us complimentary american breakfast in Istana and 2 free drinks each evening in the bar but I am not convinced this fully made up for the lounge being unavailable. In addition we did have a couple of embarassing moments when hotel staff didn't appear to have been briefed on the offer and failed to recognise the executive card we were issued with on check in. All in all though we will definitely go back to the Palace. Having stayed in a couple of other NY hotels I can honestly say that the Palace is miles better!

<Content>Don't think This is the first of my reviews, but my time here has been unusual to say the least. I must preface this by saying that I usually book my travel on my platinum card which gives extra benefits such as: 4:00 PM check outs, continental breakfast, room upgrades, etc. I did the same for this trip but there was a slight mix up with the reservations, however,during the morning of my first night AMEX did what they could to deal with the situation promptly, when the management showed how little they had trained the staff. In order to get my regular rate instituted the assistant manager indicated that they had to move me, and refused to work with AMEX. I went down to see if they were really serious about this, and in-deed they were. They felt that for a $20.00 dollar breakfast that it was worth it to move me. I explained that it was going to cost the hotel more to move me then to keep me where I was as well as it being an inconvienence. The Assistant-Manager insisted that there was nothing she could do for several minutes, and as I turned to leave, she offered my breakfast. I couldn't believe my ears. Could this be the same person, who said she had no options? I indicated that at this point, she had crossed my personal line of good taste by wasting my time, and indicated for her not to bother. After packing my bags for the move and handing the key into the front desk and asking when my room would be ready, the chap who had been standing beside the Assistant Manager during our discussion, indicated that the room wouldn't be ready until 3:00 PM. I couldn't believe that they would leave a guest without a room for several hours, and he indicated he would get back to me if something was available sooner. He promptly called back after determining that a room was available immediately, another definite error, that no 5 star rated hotel should make. I then called American Express and asked to move to the St. Regis or The Ritz. Once the hotel got wind of this, all of a sudden my room was not changed, and everything was left as it should have been. What is particularly distressing is this hotel is rated on par with the Bel-Air Hotel, the Ritz, and a few others, and I'm wondering who rated the hotel. The rooms are large, but definitively worn around the edges. The only good experience was with a Concierge named Mark, who was excellent. There are so many excellent hotels in this city that are worthy of an excellent rating, this unfortunately is not one of them. I enjoy staying in great hotels and don't mind paying for the experience. This was a waste of hard earned money.

<Content>The Palace is incredible!!! All I can say is...WOW!!! This hotel is the very best in terms of location and service!!! My hubby surprised me with a trip to NYC for my 50th birthday. He booked a weekend package in the Towers that included breakfast. When we got there to check in I just happened to mention it was my birthday and we were upgraded to a corner suite in the Towers that normally goes for $2500 a night!!!! Yipee!!! It was an amazing suite with incredible views of the city. (We saw Mariah Carey as we were waiting to check-in...she was staying there while her apartment was having some work done on it). AND everyone at the hotel was so very, very nice and accomodating....not stuffy at all. Everytime we got off the elevator and passed by the Tower desk they would call us by name and ask if there was anything they could help us with that day. One evening in particular when we thought we were never going to get a cab because the number of people waiting for one was so immense, the Tower concierge went out of his way to find us other transportation!! If he hadn't done that we would have missed our play for sure! When I go back to NYC I will definitely stay at the Palace again!!

<Content>A Superb Hotel We stayed here for three nights over new year 2005/2006.We stayed in a tower room with an East view.The service from absolutely every member of staff we were in contact with (and there were many) was absolutely first class.The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holiday season and looked really lovely, especially the main entrance.Service for those staying in the Towers is very personal, with staff always referring to you by name.The room itself was superb, with a breathtaking view from the 53rd floor. The storage was vast and the bathroom excellent with a very good range of toiletries.The hotel provided us with a magnificent place to stay and made for a wonderful trip.

<Content>Great Location During Transit Srike My daughter and I visited NYC for her 18th birthday. We stayed at the New York Palace, which turned out to be a convenient location during the very inconvenient transit strike. The hotel was clean and decently decorated (for $400+/night, it should be clean). The room was slightly above average in appearance and good-sized. We stayed on the Executive Level -- which provided free breakfast, snacks, cocktails and desserts all day long. Very convenient, but no one ever checked to see that we were had Executive Level privileges. I think anyone could have walked in and had the run of the place. Although I told the hotel in advance it was my daughter's birthday, they did nothing to acknowledge us in any way. The location was great -- only a couple blocks from Rockefeller Center, across the street from St. Patrick's Cathedral and within blocks of good shopping. The staff was pleasant, if not overly helpful. I think if I were to return, I'd stay elsewhere just because NYC has so much to offer.

<Content>Magical! I booked a 1 bedroom suite (deluxe, not tower room) with a view of St. Patrick's - for my husband, teenaged son and myself for 2 nights (Dec. 25  26). Upon arrival we were upgraded to a corner suite (9th floor) which I believe is larger than the regular 1-bedroom suite. It also had 2 full baths as opposed to 1 1/2 which the regular suite has... a very nice thing indeed!!What can I say about this hotel... EVERYTHING was absolutely magical - from the breathtaking lobby and courtyard to the room with a view - to the fitness center - to the friendly, professional service!I can not comment on the hotel's restaurants (Istana  Gilt), as we did not dine at either (I don't mind spending the money to stay in a great hotel, but I don't get spending a small fortune on food). We ate dinner at other lovely more reasonably-priced restaurants while we were out on our daily adventures. It is worth noting that a 30-SECOND walk from the hotel will bring you to a wonderful cafe/grocery market called Delmonico's where we had breakfast both mornings in addition to picking up coffee, water, soda and some delights for noshing.If you want to stay in a very special, magical place while in New York City, I don't think you can go wrong with the NY Palace!

<Content>5 Star Service and Hotel!!! WOW!!! This vacation at the New York Palace was amazing! But before I get into detail, let me tell you about the service. The service was amazing!!! They were there, right be your side if you needed help with anything. The maids were nicer that nice, the front desk gave you ratings that were reasonable, and the all around service was superb! Now, let me tell you about our room. We stayed on the 36 floor and overlooked the Cathedral of Saint Patrick! It was to die for! Our room was always neat from the cleaners, and the beds were confortable, unlike some other beds that we have slept one before. Room service was at your door giving what you asked for in minutes, maybe even seconds. Beyound our spectacular room, you have to have the permission to rest and eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, appetizers, and desert on the exectutive lounge. It was worth it to be able to eat and lounge up there overlooking the cathedral once again. Beyound the luxury in our room and executive lounge, the spa and excersice rooms were amazing. I took a nice refreshing sauna with showering and robes and slippers. Though, you must be 18 and older to use them both. Now, to the excercise room. While working out, TV's were hooked up to the tredmeels and other equipment so that you could enjoy a nice movie moment. Or if you would rather not watch a movie or TV you are able to overlook the cathedral once again with an even better view of when in your room and executive lounge.Well thats all I've got to say for this hotel, but it was so worth it!!! We went to New York City 2 times before our third trip and we stayed at the Trump Tower and Plaza, but they could not top this 5 star service and hotel!!!

<Content>Clean, comfortable and great location - but not 5 star I booked two rooms for Thanksgiving week - one for my immediate family and one for my parents. Check in went smooth. The staff smiled, made great eye contact, and before the week was over - some were even greeting us by name. Our rooms were on the 49th floor, over looking St. Patrick's Cathederal. Clean, quiet and comfortable. The bed linens and towels were the best. We requested a refigerator and a crib, both were brought promptly. The location of the Palace was wonderful, we could see ice skating at Rockefeller Center from our room. We had easy access to Central Park, the trains, gorgeous 5th Avenue, and Radio City Music Hall. A 24 hour deli was on the same block. A Zagat rated Steakhouse, Italian, Japanese, and Chinese restaurants were all just a few steps away from the hotel. This is a top notch hotel. However, it is not perfect. On Friday after Thanksgiving, the water main burst. The water was totally shut off, meaning no use of the restrooms / bathrooms for a few hours. During this time, the exclusive Towers section had only one elevator operating instead of two. As for our personal experience, if you want to get picky - (and I will since this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel) the hotel house keeping staff failed to leave washclothes two days in a row, our room lacked a hair dryer and even though we called requesting a dryer, none was ever delivered. The bathroom was too dark - even with all the lights on, it was dimly lit.Finally, we returned to our room on Saturday night, exhausted, after having been out all day - only to find that our room had not been cleaned. I made 4 phone calls and a visit to the Towers' front desk - over an hour later - before anyone came to clean. The lady who came to clean our room that night was pleasant. She said that she had only just been summoned to clean (though I had made the initial request over an hour earlier). By this time, it was 10 p.m. Overall, the staff was exceptional, knowledgeable and friendly. The service was not obtrusive, but welcome. For example, when we were about to go outside during a rain, the doorman anticipated our need and handed us umbrellas. Everyone on staff was not quite up to 5 star par - as there was a Towers desk clerk who seemed out of place. Two times during the week, my questions to her seemed to me to be an interruption of her personal talkings (once to co-workers and another time, she was on the phone, whispering / laughing). Even during our conversation, she seemed a bit indifferent, curt.As for hotel dining, I have no comments. We did not order the $19.00 eggs (two eggs, no sides) or the $37.00 breakfast from the room service menu. The prices might be right for New York, but seemed too high for my tastes - particularly, given the multitude of restaurants nearby.I don't know that I am qualified to say what is or what is not a 5 star, but I was disappointed with the Palace's fumbling of some of the fundamentals, i.e., cleaning a room and not bringing a hair dryer upon request.

<Content>We Will Return Thoroughly disagree with previous poster. I have stayed at many hotels over the last 25 years, for business and for pleasure, the Ritz Carlton, Park Lane, Omni Berkshire, St. Regis, W at Time Square, Hyatt at Grand Central, the Kitano, to name a few, and for a few reasons, the Palace was the best.Stayed at the Palace the weekend of November 5th. It was a family trip, the first time for our 13 year old daughter. We stayed in the executive section. Very nice room and perhaps only a little bit better than the hotels I just mentioned. What we really enjoyed was the included breakfast buffet. (Free if you are staying in the executive section.) There were eggs, many pastries, sausages, bacon, fresh fruit with huge blackberries and raspberries and three kinds of juices. It was tough to cram that all down! We also enjoyed the health club which far surpassed the best health club in Chicago. Each machine had its own TV. Very impressive. Perhaps, if I had stayed in the Palace on business, I wouldn't have had a chnce to appreciate the breakfast or the health club. But for those reasons, I'm sure we will return. (I never found any reason to stay at any of the above mentioned hotels more than once.)A couple of things. As alluded to by one of the previous reviews, the breakfast room can be a bit of a free for all. The attendance far exceeds the number of tables. Also, the breakfast is free for two people. If you are a couple with a child, the charge for the third breakfast is $35! When in New York, you've just got to go with the flow!We sampled a couple of restaurants very close to the hotel. Cinquante which is right across the street was very good. Also, we really enjoyed Il Menstrello, a block away. There is a 24 hour deli next door for when you just need a soda or a snack.The staff could not have been more welcoming or polite. We will go back.

<Content>Nothing More than a Fancy Sheraton/Marriott I just spent the night at the NY Palace while in Manhattan on business. No doubt, the lobby of this hotel is beautiful. I found the room itself though to be nothing more than a dressed up Sheraton or Marriott hotel room. Nothing special about it at all. The bathroom, in particular, was as average as they come.....location is good, but for the money there are better rooms to be had in Manhattan.....

<Content>Beautiful hotel - breakfast low value This hotel is beautiful and the service great. The rooms are big and well decorated. The breakfast is low value - you get very little food for 拢40 a person! The location is great - just behind St. Patricks cathedral and off 5th avenue.

<Content>Two perfect stays... I stayed at the Palace twice this year, once in May and once in October. I got a room in the Towers the first time, the second time a Standard one. Obviously, Tower rooms are larger and have better views hence the price difference is justified. The standard room was more traditional in terms of decoration and the only thing that bothered me a bit was the size of the bathroom - on the smaller side for such a hotel. But I can only join my fellow travellers who write top reviews on this hotel - it is probably one of the best in NYC. Service, location, gym, rooms, are perfect. I will certainly be back.

<Content>Pampered! I spent over 2 weeks at the Palace on a corporate trip, and my lucky boyfriend tagged along. I checked in at 8am and tried to wrangle an upgrade to the Towers, but wasn't successful unfortunately! I did ask for a room on a higher floor and got one on the 13th floor which gave me a magnificent overview of the cathedral, away from the traffic noise below. I later found out that my colleagues ended up in rooms on the 3rd floor, ha!My boyfriend tasted almost every item on the room service menu and he can attest to the great food served. Service is impeccable as you would expect from a luxury hotel - security was tight as well, and you need to show your room key to gain access to the lifts. The gym is spectacular for a hotel gym, very large, new and clean - and it is never full up so you don't have to wait for equipment. The clientele at this hotel is quite mature, and everybody was always dressed well. On my weekends off, it being in the midst of a sticky NY summer, I felt very out of place in my denim shorts and flipflops! But the service I received was the same thank goodness.The Palace is in a brilliant location, about 3 blocks away from Fifth Avenue, and 1 block away from the subway. And if you're there for business, it's 4-5 blocks away from Park Avenue. Walking to Times Square took me about 15 minutes.So if you want to pamper yourself but don't want to overly splurge on your accommodation, the Palace is the way to go! There's also a gourmet, top class, internationally recognised restaurant in the hotel - Le Cirque, which I unfortunately didn't get to try, but I have read great reviews of the food.

<Content>A Wonderful Experience ! I Loved The Palace We checked into hotel after checking out of The Peninsula hotel. We were greeted by a friendly, warm and professional staff at every turn. The rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable. The service is top-notch and very professional without being stuffy. The lobby area is warm and inviting, and a great place to sit and mingle. The hotel restaurant is also very good and the waiters friendly. The spa and fitness center is huge and very modern. The fitness center offers gym clothes and sneakes in case you forgot your workout gear. This is the best hotel in New York and we will never stay anywhere else. We loved this hotel.

<Content>The only place to stay in NYC! Our family just returned from an amazing weekend in New York City with the highlight being our stay at the New York Palace Hotel. We stayed in the Towers, an area of the hotel that has it's own concierge, check-in desk, valet, and personal butler for each room!On arrival we were upgraded from our Junior Suite to a Corner Suite, an apartment sized room complete with a kitchen, dining room, living room, full bath, half bath, and separate bedroom with a king sized bed! The view was breathtaking! Our room looked down onto Saint Patrick's Cathedral and we could see directly down 50th all the way to the Hudson River on the west side! Everything was outstanding, from the more than luxurious bed linens, the palatial marble and granite bathroom to the amazing service that the staff gave us. Our personal butler checked in with us to make sure that we let him know if there was anything we needed to let him know ASAP. When we requested some extra sheets and pillows for our 3 year old son's bed they were delivered in minutes.We enjoyed breakfast in our room each morning and everything was as we ordered and better than anticipated! We purchased a special weekend package on Luxury Link.com and would do it again in a heartbeat. We will never stay anywhere but the Palace Hotel when we are in NYC!

<Content>Great Trip Myself and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel from 6th Oct to 9th and it was a great trip. We arrived at the hotel at 1pm and got a room that over looked St Patricks catherdrel straight away. I must say that we did feel a little out of place. I am 21 and my boyfriend is 25 and we dressed pretty casual for the trip due to the amount of walking we were doing and whenever we went back to the hotel it was always very formal of an evening with people in Tuxedos and evening gowns, but we didn't let this bother us to much. Our room was big with plenty of wardrobe space and a great TV. The bathroom with big and the shower nearly blew my head off it was so powerful.We enjoyed our stay at the Palace and would return. The staff are very friendly.

<Content>Best hotel in town I have stayed at the Palace on business and with my husband on holiday. The bears in the front courtyard and the stunning staircase, complete with chandelier, give you a sense of this wonderful hotel as you arrive. The rooms are great (get one at the front with a view of St Patrick's cathedral) and the location (50th and Madison) is perfect for sightseeing, shopping and eating out.We last stayed in September 2005. We arrived at 9am but we were given a room immediately at no extra charge. The staff are totally charming. It was very hot and we walked a lot most days so two evenings we stayed in and had room service. This is quite simply the best room service I've ever had; the food is fresh and beautifully presented. Most important, it all tastes wonderful. If you don't want to pay the premium for the wine list, there's a great wine shop one block north and the hotel will provide an ice bucket and glasses, no problem. Lovely hotel, lovely people, even a gym overlooking the cathedral for the energetic. And if you are in town after check out you can use the changing rooms to shower and get dressed for the plane ride home. Perfect.

<Content>Bring the corporate Amex. Great hotel if you like some completely different to Schrager. But...poor value for money especially the room service breakfast. It pains me to pay $40 for a croissant even on an expense account.

<Content>Very Average for a 5 star hotel Dont get me wrong by the title of my review, I thought the hotel was very nice.....but it wasnt anything 'amazing' like some of the other reviewers have suggested.Rooms: Were very spacious for NY standards and I admit the views were stunning, our room overlooked the cathedral and we were on the 20th floor so could see straight down all the way to the river. One of my main ailments was the decor of the room; it was OK, it wasnt tired or dated just not very modern. Dark wooded furniture and Green pastel walls. The bed and linen were clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was VERY small, which perhaps explains the larger room area, plus only had one sink...I havent stayed in a 5 star hotel before that doesnt have his/her sinks. The shower was very good although the bathroom decor was generally a little tired.Room service: We had room service once and it was prompt and the food was delicious. They couldnt do enough to ensure that everything was set up nicely etc.Executive Floor: We paid to upgrade to the executive level. I would think about doing this very carefully. Although it was very convenient to have breakfast included, we found every day when we went to breakfast within the last half an hour before closing that we couldnt find a table and often had to stand eating our breakfast or reluctantly share a table with other families...(not the best way to start the morning!!). In addition, by the 3rd morning (and we stayed 5 nights) I was bored with the selection. There was cereal, toast, a few bagel selections, preserves and some scrambled egg/sausage. There was no variety on this on a day-to day basis. Its a great incentive to have the canapes/drinks thrown in mid-day/evening also - IF you are there to take advantage of it. As you would expect from any tourist staying in NY....we were out for mostly the whole day which meant by the time we got back it was all over.We didnt use the hotels restaurant - there is no need with many other amazing bars/restaurants on the doorstep.The gym/spa area was very good. We didnt get to use the facilities, but the gym was exceptionally well equipped and the changing rooms had every thing you could possible need.Overall: I would recommend the hotel if you arent looking for any 'wow' factor. It is a very acceptable hotel. It wasnt cheap for us to stay there but having done my research with other hotels of similar standard it seemed to fare well. I probably wont return again - next time I'll be staying at the Mandarin Oriental.....much more modern and a real 5star hotel!

<Content>Fabulous Hotel I have just returned from a short break to New York and cannot fault this hotel in any way. The rooms were spacious and well-equipped. The location was perfect and the streets around the hotel were noise-free particularly at night.I found all the hotel staff extremely courteous and efficient.It is worth paying extra for an executive club room. The breakfast included was very good with a large selection from fresh fruit, croissants and eggs and bacon.The hotel restaurant was a little pricy but there are some fabulous restaurants all within a few minutes walk from the hotel. I can only highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again.

<Content>Better, But Still About 1 Star Short.... I was at The Palace for 1 night, June 2, after receiving a complimentary night from management, as consolation for a horrible experience I had during a stay in February.To the hotel's credit, I must say that this stay was MUCH more of what you would expect from this level of accomodation. When I checked in, the front desk was extremely attentive and eager to please. I was upgraded to a Tower Corner Suite this time (last time I had a regular Executive room) and it was, as management said it would be, complimentary for the night.I had previously believed that the service throughout this hotel was far below that of a true 5 star, but immediately changed my mind when I was given the suite. I must also add that I have never had better service from a bell staff at any hotel, anywhere. The Tower Suite itself was quite nice (a far cry from the standard or executive rooms!), with 1 and 1/2 baths, dining room, kitchen, living room, etc... But honestly, I would never be willing to pay the regular $1500+ a night rate for this room. There are better rooms to be had in NYC for that kind of money.Since I was only there for 1 night, I really didn't have a chance to use the concerierge service again (they had failed miserably on several tasks in my last stay). Also, I found the maid service to be somewhat bothersome, again, because they constantly call to find out what time you'll be leaving.And I must agree with other reviews that complain about the extremely high room service costs. I ordered a salad, fries and dessert (nothing to drink), and the charge was $70! The food itself was well prepared, but still... $70?All in all, I had a much better stay than the last time I was there. However, I still wouldn't want to stay in the regular rooms and receive the sub par sevice that obviously goes with those rooms. Bottom line is... Stay here if you can afford a suite or tower room, otherwise you'll most likely be disappointed.

<Content>Palace Only So So I usually don't write reviews, but recently I've been using TripAdvisor for planning our European trip and getting so much good advice, that I thought I should pay back. I spent a week at the NY Palace. And I have to say it was only so so. Not horrible, but you can do much better. Although, I no longer live in the NY area, I used to. I've also stayed at several NYC hotels. I wouldn't have stayed at the Palace, except for the fact that I was meeting up with a group that was all staying at the Palace. The rate we were quoted, a group rate of $255, I think was okay value for the hotel. But as I didn't have much choice, I didn't really shop around.First, the one thing I've always noticed about the Palace is that the staff are not unfriendly, but always seem rushed/stressed-out. No one really refuses to help, but no one really seems all that happy to be helping. So the service is not bad but not good either. One part of the service I have been impressed with has been housekeeping. I usually call housekeeping when I vacate the room, so that the room will be cleaned sooner than later. I did that most days at the Palace, and they sent someone very very quickly.As for the facilities, they are really tired. Our 2 rooms both had really worn capreting that bunched up all over the room. The beds were okay but again is getting to the end of their useful lives. Everything else in the room is okay, but again nothing special.The biggest complain I have is the outrageous prices they have for food/beverage. A can of coke from the minibar is $6. An American Breakfast is $38. I assume with tax and service, it would be over $50 for breakfast for one person. Just to give you a little perspective, earlier this year, I was in Paris for business and stayed at the George V. Probably one of the most expensive hotels in Paris. I had lunch with an associate at their restaurant, Le Cinq, which is regularly considered to be one of Top 5 restaurants in Paris with 3 Michelin Stars. Their lunch course was around $50. Come on guys, you can't tell me you have to charge $50 for breakfast. There's a Starbucks across the street where I can get much better coffee and pastries for $5 altogether. I was on business, but I refused to eat a single meal at the hotel. Even if it isn't out of my own pocket, I just can't allow myself to get ripped off that badly.In conclusion, I'd say stay somewhere else. For their rate, you can do better. For example, I stayed at the Parker Meridien and really enjoyed that hotel.On the other hand, if you have to stay at the Palace, you will survive, as long as you are prepared to eat out.

<Content>Extra special weekend trip It was my first trip to New York and I came for a shopping weekend with my daughter as a treat for her 18th birthday. Upon arrival at The Palace everybody from the doorman through receptionist, porter, maids and room service were excellent. The room was spacious, clean and had a marvelous view of St Patricks Cathedral. There was a delicious birthday cake in our room for my daughter which I thought was a really nice touch. There was a blizzard on the Saturday but there was a large umbrella in the room for our use which proved very helpful. The only thing I could fault was at the end of our stay. Our bags had been stored until our taxi arrived but upon receipt of them the doorman did not help us with them, nor did he offer to. Unfortunately it took the shine off what was a most enjoyable stay in a first class hotel (one doorman being the unfortunate exception).

<Content>Fantastic I just returned from spending Memorial Day weekend at the New York Palace. We had rooms on the Executive Floors which gave us access to the Executive Lounge. It was well worth the money-food was wonderful. The staff was extremely helpful, polite, and accomodating. It was my daughter's 21st birthday and everyone from the bellman to the Executive Lounge concierge made sure that our party of 8 lovely ladies had a great time. This is the second time I've stayed here in the past year and intend to always stay at the Palace when visiting NYC-great memories!

<Content>Great Breakfast I stopped in for breakfast and was very glad I did. In fact, I ate their twice in one week even though I wasn't staying at the hotel. The service is wonderful and the food was excellent. Yes, $31 is quite a bit for breakfast for one person, but, it is NY and that is the way it is. Looking forward to staying at the hotel on next trip to NYC.

<Content>New York's Best! The Palace is by far the best hotel that we have stayed at in NYC. Roomswere very clean and spacious and the staff could not be more accommodating. Took my daughters for their birthdays and the last night there they delivered a beautiful cake for them. Have stayed at a lot of hotels in NY and this one is by far the best. We will return.

<Content>NOT 5-star! After communicating with the hotel manager and not getting a response for over two weeks, a nice-enough person from the hotel's public relations department personally handled our request for two rooms after I called back. When we arrived, only one room was ready. Later when the second room became available it reeked of smoke 鈥?on a 鈥渘onsmoking floor.鈥?Hotel personnel met the request for another room with a horrible attitude. Upon our checkout we phoned for bellmen two times and still waited over twenty minutes. For being a member of the Leading Hotels of the World, it seems this hotel has a huge problem with service. We also requested use of the complimentary house car only to be told that a taxi could do the same job! The location is excellent; the service is horrible. If you can get a rate below $250 then it might be worth it, but Manhattan has so many other great hotels.

<Content>Fabulous location I just spent 5 days at the Palace, and can't say enough. The location is superior, easy walking to most places, subway stations near by, and nothing except airports more than $10 cab ride away. The staff was also exceptionally friendly, I've never had so many people wish me a good morning! I swear that the maids popped out of the rooms to say hello if they hear you passing by. Best of all, there is a Starbucks just out the 51st Street entrance. Would definitely stay here again (if I could afford it!)

<Content>Wonderful visit...even with children! I am surprised when I read other reviews for this hotel.I stayed at The Palace with my family members during the January 2005 blizzard in two adjoining rooms. The staff was wonderful- we had two young children in tow- assisting us with anything we requested of them. The rooms were SPACIOUS, very comfortable and tastefully decorated. The bathroom was gorgeous- All of us fit comfortably as we watched our young six month old nephew play in the bathtub.Room service arrived promptly with added items-the kitchen gave us the surplus cookies and such. The items that arrived were excellent. There was enough room for the large service table AND five people in the double double room! We never called for pickup of the table and yet we walked around it to pack the next morning with no difficulty. Which means the room was LARGE by any standard... and this is NYC.We did not dine in the hotel restaurant so I am unable to respond to other comments.The location of the hotel is excellent. It is across the street from St. Pat's, one block from greatest shopping in NYC, short stroll to Times Square and yet far enough away from it to avoid the noise and congestion. The hotel is beautiful with a dramatic courtyard entrance on the Madison Avenue side.It is true that there is no VHS or DVD player in the room but my objective is to get out in the greatest city in the world that does not sleep! There is pay per view as an offering for the business traveller.I wish to say that some reviewers find fault with hotels for reservation mistakes which may occur because of the booking agent. For instance, when you book this hotel online, it is done through Leading Hotels and they do not know particulars to the individual location. I always call the hotel directly and speak with Reservations Dept.Although this hotel does not advertise as Child Friendly, the staff was attentive and very pleasant to my 5 year old niece and 6 month old nephew. The hotel offers an American Girl package which is sweet.I would return to this hotel without hesitation.

<Content>Very disappointed with the New York Palace When I got to the Palace they did not have the five star ($350 a night) room that they had promised me. Instead, they gave me an older, worn and frayed, not particularly clean room. The front desk staff was unpleasant and refused to upgrade or switch me that night. Earlier that week I had stayed at a three star hotel on Long Island($79) and it was a lot nicer, cleaner and I was treated a lot better than at the New York Palace. I hope this review saves someone the misery that I went through.

<Content>New York Palace is simply the best Over the past 20+ years, I have stayed approximately 400 room nights at this great hotel. Needless to say, I get some special ammenities, but I have also referred this hotel to numerous friends and associates, and most of them have made it their home away from home in New York. The tower rooms are the best, with your choice of classic or modern decors. The large suites are the size of upper east side luxury apartments. The best thing about this hotel is the service, which is very attentive. If you are staying for a special occasion, let them know and they will plan something special for you....and it's nice while in the tower rooms to have room service sent up from Le Cirque! No matter who you are, you will be very happy with this hotel.

<Content>Comedy of Errors Just got back from a long birthday weekend at the Palace. It was a comedy of errors with a happy ending. The concierge had made my birthday dinner reservation at the wrong restaurant (Spice Club not Spice Market!) The junioir suite I had reserved did not have any working heat.After much complaining, the assistant manager, Isaac, managed to get my party into Spice Market. Sent us in the hotel car. Bought us a round of drinks, and when we returned we had been moved to a larger suite and treated to a birthday cake and champagne.That said, the room was a little fusty (although quite spacious). I think I'll stay at the Four Seasons next time.

<Content>pleasantly surprised Stayed at the Palace 4 nights over the Presidents' day long weekend. Got a great rate - $228. including full breakfast for two - through American Express Platinum Travel. This rate was key to my enjoyment as it was far lower than available at other top hotels during this very crowded Christo's Gates weekend in New York. Positives: suberb location, good room, ok bath, excellent fitness facility at no extra cost, pleasant staff, acceptable restaurant for breakfast.Negatives: dated decor, horrible artwork in the tired hallways, disappointing bar (crowded, cramped, no second floor space anymore, expensive but unremarkable drinks), no restaurant attractive for dinner, crowded lobby space. The loss of marquee tenant -- Le Cirque 2000 -- deprives this hotel of any cache or style. So, the very attractive rate makes this a high value hotel. Loss of style moves it into second tier vs. other top NY properties. At a low rate, I would stay there again. If rates rise, I would look elsewhere.

<Content>Excellent location and generously sized rooms My husband and I recently spent five days at the NY Palace during the Valentines weekend and found it to be everything that we expected and more!The staff were very helpful and curteous, the rooms were very spacious (for a city hotel) and had all of the facilities required for this length of stay. We were given a room with a beautiful view of St Patricks cathedral on the 28th floor. Complimentary newspapers and shoe cleaning service. The beautiful foyer and trees in the entrance all lit up with fairy lights made it a very romantic location.Easy walking distance to the Empire State building, Rockerfeller Centre, Broadway and Central Park. If you can't sleep because of the time difference, we suggest and early morning walk to Times Square. We grabbed a coffee from Starbucks and went at 6am, when it was still slightly dark and all lit up but deserted - truly amazing.We only stayed at the NY Palace on a room only basis (as this is all our budget would allow) but found a lovely little coffee shop named Bread and Company two streets down (51st or 52nd St) where they served the most amazing muffins and almond croissants - well worth the visit.Only down side to the hotel was that the room service cost for just a coffee was out of our budget, but I suppose it was what was to be expected for such a high quality hotel.We are already planning our next stay there!!!

<Content>All round top quality I rarely give 5 stars on Trip Adviser, but the Palace was truly a delight. Superb room, and that view overlooking St Patrick's cathedral stays in the mind as one of the most beautiful cityscapes I have enjoyed in years. First rate room service at all odd hours with huge choices available, an incredibly pleasant staff, from the front desk, the conference room floor, the bellman who did everything but perform somersaults, to the lady who chased me down the corridor at five am as I exited the room to give me a free NY Times.  I had everything I needed in the room, the tea/coffee dispenser, lit magnifying mirror in bathroom, toasty and rich bathrobes and slippers, huge quantity of rich towels, a great light and heating control system that could be controlled right by your bed, and all in all, the quality of the hotel experience (unpretentious but smooth and efficient) helped ensure my stay in New York was a delight. The best hotel staff in New York to date. (and I usually stay at the Waldorf or the W).

<Content>One of the best in NYC!!! My husband and I stayed at the Palace 1/22/05-1/23/05 to celebrate my birthday.We got a fantastic rate directly on their website for $225 for a Deluxe King room, which was even cheaper than other 5 stars on the bidding sites. We arrived early (11 am) because NYC was in the midst of a blizzard, but that was no problem! We were able to check in immediately, with many smiles! The room was the largest I have seen in NYC, and very clean. The staff is also the friendliest I have encountered, from the housekeeping to the front desk. Our room was on the 22nd floor, which overlooked a beautiful snow covered St. Patrick's Cathedral. The location was perfect...a couple blocks from Grand Central, and a wonderful restaurant named Cafe Centro, which I also highly recommend! There are many breakfast places around, which we trudged to in the snow, because the restaurant inside the hotel is very pricey and limited. We were a few blocks from the theatre as well, which was a nice walk for us (although the Palace offers a complimentary shuttle to the theatre for certain shows). We will DEFINITELY be returning to the Palace..it made a perfect weekend..even in a blizzard!

<Content>Excellent place, location children welcomed My family (husband and 2 daughters ages 7  9) stayed at the palace January 1-3 2005. We found the hotel on line with thier super deal $225 we cancelled our reservation at The Drake Swisotel, to stay at The Palace and it was worth it! The staff was friendly and curteous although we didn't get our turn down service with the chocolates the second night, the kids were disappointed. The room and bathroom was very clean and spacious (one of the most important things to me). Our room was upgraded to a view of St. Patricks Cathedral on a lower floor than requested we were still happy ironically the room number 1225, since the trip was part of our daughters christmas present. The Palaces' web site stated discounts to American Girl according to the concierge there were no such discounts. All in all it was a fabulous and memorible weekend for all of us. I would diffinately stay there again especially at the great price, and recomend it to friends and family. The location was also great for our visit (American Girl, Radio City, Central Park, FAO Schwartz, Time Square, Rockerfeller Center)

<Content>Best Deal in NY We got a 300SF king room at the last minute off the Palace's website for only $225/night (their 25th anniv. special rates). We were blown away at the price, considering most 2 and 3-star hotels were charging that much for that particular weekend. The room was huge, with a dead-on view of St. Patricks. We also found the room to be very quiet (i.e., little traffic noise). Turn-down service at night was just great, complete with towel refreshing, slippers, bathrobes, chocolates, etc. Room service was eye-poppingly expensive, so we avoided that, but there is a Starbucks right outside the door. One final little cool touch was the box on the nightstand which controlled the temperature as well as all the lights, so you didn't have to get out of bed. Staff was uber-professional. Will stay here again and again, especially at such an amazing price.

<Content>Good but not top I have just spent two nights at the NY Palace and found it nice but not fantastic. Even though the lobby is nice and luxurious and the reception staff friendly, I just missed the personal touch a little. When I asked about whether I can get airmiles for the stay, I was told that the hotel belongs to an Arabic Sheik and he does not need to bother with such profanities.The rooms are very big for NY standards but also there I missed the certain something such as a fruit platter or a mineral water. Everything had to be paid for and the prices were very high! There was only one very small bottle of shower gel which was just about enough for a shower in the night but nothing left in the morning. I am not usually fussy, but in a 'Leading Hotel of the World' I just expect a little more than in a standard business hotel and I did not get that in the New York Palace.

<Content>Amazing Hotel fantastic view and excellent location We stayed at the Palace from Christmas day to New Years day and it was superb. We were on the 23rd floor overlooking St Patrick's and 5th avenue the view was amazing and the room very clean and spacious. The location is superb which makes it very easy to get around. Passers by would come off the street just to photograph the courtyard decorations which were excellent.The room rate included a very good American buffet breakfast which made an excellent start to the day and the staff were very friendly and courteous.We have a 13 year old son so we stayed in and ordered room service on one evening which was superb.The overall costs are difficult to comment on being English it was great value from our perspective given the current exchange rates. I must confess however that I agree with the previous review on the high costs even by our standards of the drinks in the Villard bar which we used only once as a consequence.The drinks bill in the Villard was $27 for three drinks which included one glass of wine one pint of draught and a coke. No one goes to New York and stays in though with so much choice out there so we chose to eat and drink out.We would stay there again on our next visit and not hesitate to recommend it.

<Content>Thanksgiving in NYC I stayed three nights at the New York Palace hotel over the recent Thanksgiving holiday. I have to say that, given how busy the hotel was for the holiday, it was a very enjoyable experience. Because of the crowd size, it was hard to get the kind of special attention to detail and customer service you'd expect from a hotel of this caliber. But no request was left unfulfilled, and hotel staff were mostly curteous and helpful. I had a regular room on the executive level, which allowed access to their executive lounge. The view from my room on the 37th floor overlooked St. Patrick's cathedral and down toward Rockefeller Center. Looked great at night. The room was very large by any city's standards, especially New York's. However, the furnishings were a little bland. I've seen much nicer rooms in much less expensive hotels. The executive lounge has a nice open bar for two hours in the evening and food throughout the day. Although it was overrun with small children every time I was there. Probably not a problem when it's not a holiday weekend. The entrance to the hotel and the lobby were probably the nicest part of the hotel. Beautiful Christmas tree in front. The famous Le Cirque is here. I had a nice meal there my first night, although it was very expensive: $140 for one person. Also went to the Villard bar, where drinks were equally expensive: $10-plus cocktails. But the atmosphere was chic and very relaxing. One last note: the location of the hotel, right in the middle of Manhattan, was awesome. While this is a nice hotel, and there are certainly good reasons to stay here, I would recommend looking elsewhere first. But if it's here you have to stay, you won't be disappointed.

<Content>Marvellous Having just come back from a three nights' stay at the NY Palace, I must say I really do not understand why this place is not among the first 20 in NYC. My reservation was quickly dealt with courtesy and professionality, the room we were given - in the executive wing - exceeded all expectations and met all requests I had stated, with a beautiful view of St. Patrick Cathedral on top of those, the use of the lounge was a great boon for us, supplying us with a great breakfast and a nightcap in pleasant, friendly and civilized surroundings, the concierge was very helpful and all in all we had the feeling we were being very nicely looked after every moment of our stay - something not to be overlooked in a not-so-friendly city as New York. Also, unlike what was written in a previous preview, we were there with our five yrs old child (having previously checked that it was OK for him to stay at the executive level) and he was always made to feel at home (I noticed quite a lot of families with small children during the weekend we stayed there). I will definitely return to the Palace.

<Content>Wow! Having read many reviews about this place, I was afraid it might be a bit on the stodgy side, but I was pleasantly suprised to find out it really wasn't. In our country which seems to take such great pride in its ever-increasing casual sloppiness, even the casual and sloppy look better at this hotel. I was awestruck -- and I don't normally overreact to things -- when I saw my quarters for a three-night weekend stay -- an upgrade to a Towers corner suite. Magnificent view (lots of windows on two different sides of the living room), huge living room area, large dinner/conference table, separate kitchen with fridge stove, sink, etc..., plus a separate powder room. TV with VCP, DVD player (upon request) and CD player. Very large bathroom with two sinks, very wide counter space, separate tub and glass-enclosed shower. Great bed with matching TV (armoire), easy chairs, lots and lots of drawers and closet space. Interesting, but tricky, bedside panel to control air conditioning and the various lights (including mood lights high up). If room is very dark when you sleep, you'll have a tough time finding, and pressing, the proper switch you want -- believe me. Also, lighting in living room area was a bit on the dim side...was not good or conducive for nighttime reading. Management probably figures : In a place like this, who wants to read?! Well, I do. For a little while, at least.On the down side, restaurant Istana is hideously and grotesquely overpriced, particularly at breakfast time. I'd rather not get specific. Just trust me on it.All in all, though, a great hotel. Only bad thing is, once you've been in one of these suites, it's tough to think of staying in a standard-type room. I will never stay any place but the New York Palace. I will splurge, if just one weekend out of the year. I wouldn't -- and couldn't -- do it on a regular basis, but if you're looking for a thrilling NYC weekend, you can't do much better than to surprise someone with a corner suite in the Towers at The New York Palace. Before walking into the suite, tell your mate to close his or her eyes, then lead him or her into the room(s), then tell him or her to open his or her eyes. Check the look on his or her face.

<Content>Super Palace - I mean place My family and I stayed at the New York Palace over the New Year Holidays 2004 and had a wonderful time. The location was perfect. It was close to subway stations when you needed to travel a good distance. It was within walking distance to the American Girl Store, Rockefeller Center, the NBC Studio, many shops, stores, and restaurants. This was a clean well kept hotel that was full of charm. Both the hotel and the employees. I slept better here than I had in anyother hotel, even those with heavenly beds. From the moment we left our vehicle with the staff to the moment we checked out the staff made sure they found some way to make you feel like they were your new best friend. VERY CLEAN. I would reccommend this hotel to anyone without reservation.

<Content>A Classic New York Experience As a Manhattanite, one rarely gets to spend any time at New York City hotels. Was at the New York Palace Hotel during the Republican convention for three nights for work-related reasons. Security was tight given the circumstances. However, appreciated the beautiful hotel lobby, with gorgeous courtyard views and the famous Le Cirque restaurant next door. View was really nice from my 31st floor room. Room looked east, with the Citicorp building in the distance. Staff was courteous and quick. Turn down service was provided every night. Nice amenities, robes, complimentary slippers, fitness facilities. Skip the room service, which can be pricey -- averaging $35/person for breakfast. Instead, go across the street to the Starbucks's for a cup of joe and breakfast pastries and check out the multitude of restaurants in the area. Conveniently situated near Rockefeller Center. Will definitely recommend to out of towners, who are looking for a nice treat.

<Content>Great value in NYC Stayed at the NY Palace in Sept. '04 and greatly enjoyed my stay. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Booked a deluxe room with access to the executive lounge - for the price it is a great deal. The room was huge with an awesome view of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Loved the water pressure in the shower. Bath towels are huge - almost 6 feet long! Also loved the bedside control panel for all the room functions, including the privacy light for housekeeping. Exec. lounge included breakfast, snacks, cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, and desserts for my entire stay. The breakfast was fantastic - eggs, sausage/bacon, french toast, potatoes, hot and cold cereal, pastries, fruit...definitely worth paying a little extra for the room. Snacks included tea sandwiches, pastries and fruits.Great location to Broadway and shopping. Will stay here again. You won't find a better value in upscale NYC hotels than the Palace.

<Content>Not amazing, but better than average Stayed at the Palace for 5 nights on business trip and was quite impressed. Very friendly check in staff  great concierge. I had requested a room with view of cathedral and it was great. Excellent room size, decor although 'traditional' was in good condition. The bathroom was on the small side, but ok. Did not eat in the restaurant, but tried room service, which was overpriced and tasted awful. Used the gym a couple of times and whilst the view from it is great, the equipment is old and the room not spacious. Definitely not the luxury facility advertised on the website.All in all it met my expectations, but I wouldn't call it amazing. In terms of comparison would rank it above other midtown hotels like Parker Meridien, Westin, Intercontinental, 4S Pierre.

<Content>Delighted with the Palace I and four friends recently stayed at the New York Palace Hotel. We had two very comfortable rooms on the 17th floor. The staff of the hotel was attentive, helpful and quite friendly. We were made to feel most welcome. We had a small problem with a charge at the bar, but it was handled quickly and to our satisfaction. The location of the hotel was perfect. We were easily able to walk to restaurants and to a show. The Palace was a lovely place to stay.

<Content>An Amazing Stay I stayed at the Palace for 1 night with my mom and our friends. Everything about it was spectacular. We reserved a jr. suite in the Towers and my mom had mentioned that it was my sixteenth birthday when making our reservation. The lobby of the Palace was stunning, but the real surprise was when we arrived at our room. The staff surprised us (knowing that it was my birthday) with a beautiful 2 bedroom corner suite AND there was a birthday cake for me on the dining room table! (a gourmet chocolate mousse cake) And we were not charged extra for this. I was amazed at how thoughtful the staff were to do this for me. They treated us like royalty and the concierge was very nice and helpful by giving us a list of nearby popular spots to check out. Breakfast and dinner at the restaurant Istana were also excellent, though pricey. It was worth every penny, though. I definately would stay at the Palace again!

<Content>Truly Fantastic Booked a package including room, parking, bottle of wine and breakfast through one of the online travel sites. Confirmed the reservation the morning prior to arrival. All was as it should be. Arrived a bit later than expected and the hotel entry was a crush of people and vehicles. At first the parking attendant told us the garage was all full, but upon asking the bellman he basically took care of us and much to our relief got us a place to park the car and we were whisked inside. Check-in was painless and we were upgraded to a tower room. Not really sure what to compare it with, but the room overlooked St. Patricks Cathedral and offered a lovely view that only NYC can provide. Room was well laid out, and had the kinds of touches that better hotels feature.... the things that make spending the extra $ worthwhile. We had to call to get the bottle of wine delivered, but it came up promptly and was actually quite good. The public spaces are refined and the service to a person was prompt, and efficient. What we liked best about the hotel was the great people watching. There was a wedding going on which was like having your very own parade as we sipped on full strength (but very expensive) drinks in the lobby lounge. We didn't use the health club on this visit, but it appears to be very well outfitted. One very nice surprise was when going out to dinner we stepped out expecting to hail a cab, but instead was offered the hotel Mercedes to take us to the restaurant and a gratuity to the driver was the only obligation. Nice touch. The hotel was very quiet, no street noise or hallway noise was heard. Breakfast in the morning was very good. It's the little touches that make a breakfast like that memorable.... good jam, high quality bacon, etc. The package ended up being a very good deal when you consider the parking and breakfast alone would have exceeded $100 on their own. Still, The Palace is expensive, but in all aspects we were extremely happy with the hotel, its location, the staff, the food...... everything. No question we will return.

<Content>The finest hotel stay thus far. The New York Palace is an outstanding hotel! It is everything the website/ads promise and more. Our stay was a few years ago but it truly is our fondest memory of a hotel stay. I have been traveling for work and pleasure for over 30 years. We are currently traveling with our children so another visit to the Palace is not in our plans in the near future. It is an expensive stay to be quite honest, but do yourself a favor and stay at least once. I am still trying to find a bed as comfortable as theirs for my home! From top to bottom this hotel is class in every sense of the word. We vacation in NYC every year. I stayed at the Park Central last year and it was a pigsty in every sense of the word. I have reseverations for the Barclay this year at a great rate and hope it can deliver half of the Palace.

<Content>Very nice hotel I had booked a standard room at the Palace and was disappointed when we walked into the lobby and there was a long line of people waiting to check in. Suddenly, more staff appeared and started checking people in at the tower lobby. We were upgraded to a large room in the tower. The room was beautiful and very large. The tower section has the feel of being its own small hotel. The service was very good the entire trip. I do not know how happy I would have been if we had been in the room I had booked. I also would not have wanted to pay $450 for the room we got (which is the normal rate), however, for $300 per night we enjoyed it very much. I also enjoyed the location; we walked to everything.

<Content>Great hotel great location Just spent two wonderful days at this hotel. Stayed on the concierge floor. The executive lounge offers multiple food offerings throughout the day including breakfast. Location was perfect and a real plus for a light sleeper.. the rooms were quiet. I didn't hear any street noise on the 32nd floor.Would stay there again.

<Content>Great for Business Travel I have stayed at the Palace for a few days each week for the past 6 weeks for work and I will not stay anywhere else in NY. The hotel is absolutely fantastic. The front desk staff is friendly and the doormen have always been very helpful. The rooms are nice and very large for NY. They have the BEST gym of any hotel gym I have ever been to. TVs at most of the cardio machines, towels, nice locker rooms, and even personal trainers.

<Content>The Palace Hotel was very marginal We stayed at the New York Palace for two nights. The hotel is very well located and very large. Our room was on the 39th floor which was the concierge level. Even that high up, I still heard the noise on the street. The Executive lounge is great and provides breakfast, snacks, and refreshments pretty much the entire day.Concierge service was terrible. They promised to get us in to one of five restaurants that we requested and they were unable to get any of them. They did suggest a restaurant before our broadway show but it was terrible. When we commented on their poor choice they only snickered as if they knew it was bad.The doormen really do not help much. One watched me from the door as I loaded two suitcases in a cab that I hailed on my own. He was too busy getting a hand$hake from a regular client.All in all I would not stay at The Palace again. It was also a bit overpriced but that is NYC.

<Content>Nice Hotel The New York Palace was a very nice hotel. The lobby was beautiful, but the room was bland. It was still nice, but very neutral. We stayed on the Executive level which is a great value because you get free food and drinks-- even alcohol after 5:00. I wanted to stay in the Towers, but then you do not have the use of the lounge and I would rather have the free food and drinks in the lounge.My only complaint was that they did not have conditioner. I have never been to a quality hotel without conditioner. They only have conditioning shampoo which is not good enough if you have long hair. I didn't take my own because they promise wonderful bath products. When I asked at the front desk late at night, they were nice, but suggested that I walk to the drugstore and buy some. I think they should have gotten me some in their own gift shop. All top hotels should have conditioner.I have stayed at the Waldorf-Astoria and it was wonderful. I have also stayed at the Plaza and it was not worth it. I liked the Palace, but with so many 5-star hotels in New York, I would probably try another one next time.

<Content>Exceptional Views of Cathedral and Skyline My husband and I spent hours looking for somewhere special. The New York Palace is very special! We stayed at the palace from Boxing Day until the New Year.We booked our Tower suite directly with the hotel for half price. Request a contemporary room as high up as possible with views of the cathedral. On arrival we found a bottle of wine, chocolates, headed paper and business cards with our names on. Every two days complementary water, fruit and chocolates were delivered to our room. Our rate included complementary American breakfast delivered to us by room service.The view of Saint Patrick's Cathedral and the Rockefeller Centre were amazing! The hotel looked lovely with its enormous Christmas trees. We stayed at the Palace from Boxing Day until the New Year.The staff at the Palace were welcoming, friendly and very helpful. Staying at the Palace made our trip memorable,Go and see for yourself, you won't be disappointed!

<Content>The Palace Treats you Like a Queen The New York Palace earns its name...they treated each member of my party like a queen! Five women escaped the rigors of work and motherhood for a delightful 3 night stay January 9 - 12. We all LOVED the hotel! The hotel is centrally located to terrific shopping and the theater district. We arrived at 9 am and were given 2 lovely rooms with excellent views. From the moment we checked in we were treated as if we were the only guests in the hotel. Our rooms were HUGE by New York standards and were exceptionally appointed. The decor was traditional and rich looking. The bathrooms were large and luxurious. The evening turn down service included a spritz of soothing mint spray, a tray filled with necessities such as a lint brush. The ice bucket was filled for us, the lighting was dimmed and music was quietly playing. Every employee we encountered was kind, helpful and incredibly professional. Having stayed at other luxury hotels in New York City, I have to say that this is my favorite by far. Not too large and not too small. Truly perfect! An extra bonus was our $225 night room rate from Hotel Conxions. We're already planning our return trip. Go and enjoy the pampering!

<Content>The New York Place The Palace exceeded our expectations in every way. The service was superalative, with the exception of one surly man in the executive lounge, and the rooms were huge by New York standards. Location cannot be beaten, and some rooms on higher floors have superb views. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, having stayed there between Christmas and New Year. The upgrade to executive floors is easily justified considering the extras included, and makes a stay at The Palace even more memorable.

<Content>Fantastic Location Spotted this hotel from the high ratings on Trip Advisor and thought we would give it a go. This hotel is fantastic!! It couldn't be in a better location for weekend tourists like us. Times Square and Broadway were 5 minutes walk away and 5th Avenue is on the next block for some great shopping. The hotel was beautiful aswell and the room was very nice indeed, from the well stocked mini bar to the computer controlled lighting, heater, privacy etc console on the bedside table! We asked for a room with a view of St Patricks Cathedral and were given a room on the 19th floor directly opposite it with a view of broadway aswell! The only thing that initially disapointed me was the amount of people queueing to check in and out at the time we arrived. We waited for about 10 minutes to check in but the staff were very apologetic and it was the weekend before christmas so I can't hold that one against them. All the staff were extremely helpful especially the concierge desk who gave us numerous helpful hints tips and maps for getting around the fantastic city of New York. Highly recommended!!
