<Content>Loved the hotel  Our family of 4 stayed in a quadraple room with a balcony overlooking the front street. It was a big cosy room with clean attached shower  toilet. This is a smoke-free hotel with a lift.The hotel is in a lovely, quiet and safe neighbourhood. Museums, a supermarket, a very nice park, and street full of branded shops are nearby. Albertcupstraat market is about 20 minutes walk in the south east. Amsterdam is not a vast city anyway, so we enjoyed walking to places of interest from the hotel. If one prefers the public transport, the tram stop is only a minute walk away.We loved the buffet breakfast and the breakfast room.We arrived at hotel at 7am in the morning and our room was ready for us. The checking-in process took only a couple of minutes. After more than 2 hours sleep, we recovered from our jet lag and were ready to explore the neighbourhood.We were particularly impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the hotel staff.We would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends.

<Content>A Great Little Hotel This is a great little hotel. As you'd expect with a three star hotel - the lounge/bar is fairly small, and there wasn't a safe or fridge in my room. On the other hand, the Hotel Aalders has a nice friendly atmosphere and I had an enjoyable stay there at a very reasonable rate.What I liked most was the polite and helpful staff, the nice Dutch style buffet breakfast, and the location very near the museums. (I had no idea that the Rijksmuseum is basically at the end of the same road as the hotel). Other points of note; The Aalders is in a nice quiet road; there is a good Albert Heijn supermarket five or ten minutes walk away on Van Bearlestraat; and the Connexxion shuttle bus takes you from Schiphol airport - right to the door of the hotel.To conclude: It's not the Ritz - but if you're looking for a nice little family run hotel near Museum Plein at a reasonable price - the Hotel Aalders is just the thing!

<Content>Great location. Close to bus lines, museums, and restaurants. Super breakfasts served in a lovely dining room. The staff was very helpful, and went out of their way to print out a list of recommended restaurants and directions to a small town we wanted to visit. They also helped with other information and advice.

<Content>Wonderful Experience I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. Make a long story short, I was stuck in Amsterdam for a few nights and had to find a place to stay, so I just walked in the hotel and I was lucky to find a room with Hotel Aalders. The hotel is in a residential area of the city, but very close to everything, museums, parks, shopping area, restaurants, train stops, etc. I felt safe to walk by myself.I stayed different room each day. My first day, I stayed in a small room, however, it was a perfect size for me. As I saw in someone鈥檚 review, you don鈥檛 come to Amsterdam to spend too much time in your hotel room, so the size of the room didn鈥檛 matter to me. My second day, I moved to a big room. It was too big for me, and I could switch the room with someone else, but again, the size of the room was not a big deal to me. In both room, I felt comfortable. The rooms were very clean and neat. Breakfast was included in price. There was a plenty of great choice. Laundry service was available. The reception was open 24 hours, and the hotel entrance was secured. The receptionist held my luggage after I checked out. I had some errands to do near by, so being able to leave my stuff was super helpful for me. There was a bar/lounge, so I spent some relaxing time and chit-chat with other travelers. There was a free computer available in this lounge, and this made my life so easy. The greatest experience in this hotel was, all of the hotel staffs (including house keepers) were very helpful and friendly. As I mentioned in the front, I was stuck in Amsterdam for the personal reason (lost my passport and couldn鈥檛 fly back), so I had no choice but just had to stay there. First it was very difficult for me, and I actually cried for a few times, but I could change my attitude positive, because of the hotel staffs. They were so helpful and warm hearted. They listened to my stories and could comfort me enough. That was what I needed, especially when I felt so alone and nervous and stressed out. I truly felt that they cared about me.Overall, the purpose of my stay wasn鈥檛 so great, but staying the hotel was wonderful experience. The price was very reasonable with all services. If you want to stay in an at-home-style of accommodation, Hotel Aalders is the one. I recommend to other people and would love to visit them again.

<Content>A Gem This was a wonderful small hotel in the heart of the Museum district. Public transportation was nearby making it a perfect location to visit to all of the sites in Amsterdam. Airport transportation was easily available and reliable. The hotel staff was pleasant and very helpful, as I was a solo female traveler. Breakfast, which was included in the room rate offered a great selection of high quality food and certainly the BEST coffee that I had in more than 2 weeks of travel through Europe!! Free internet access was a plus. My room was very small and had poor lighting, however the benefits of this hotel more than compensated for these minor disadvantages. I would highly recommed this hotel and would certainly stay here again.

<Content>A Dutch Gem! The Hotel Aalders was an absolute gem in the heart of Amsterdam. I have been wanting to go to Amsterdam since I was a child, and my husband and I have just returned. I found this hotel on Tripadvisor.com by looking at the other guest reviews. It was way more than we ever expected! The staff was so very helpful, the breakfast so delicous and Eurpoean, the hotel was comfortable and cozy, just what you would want in Europe, and the location was incredible. It is situated between the two most popular musems, one block from a tram stop, and in walking distance from EVERYTHING. It was more than we could have ever hoped for. I travel extensively for my job, and I would be happy to stay here again, anytime. Be sure you ask Mr. Aalders about room 9 when his grandfather hid a Jewish family of 8 in a closet under a stairwell during World War II. Like I said, a Dutch gem.

<Content>A genuinely friendly hotel. I stayed at the Hotel Aalders for ten days recently and believe that I couldn't have made a better choice. For a city as busy and alive as Amsterdam, it was a real bonus to find a friendly hotel in such a quiet location. As I live in a very quiet rural area, this was really important to me. The Aalders is in a residential part of the city, yet very close to everything. A few minutes walk will take you to the Rijksmuseum, van Gogh museum and Concertgebouw in one direction, and Vondel Park and Leidseplein in the other. The trams in Hobbemastraat are just at the top of the street, about 200 yards away. They will take you through the city centre and reach Amsterdam Centraal Station in about ten minutes.My room was advertised as a small single room, but was sufficiently spacious and more than adequate for my needs. You don't come to Amsterdam to spend too much time in your hotel room anyway! It was comfortable, warm and kept scrupulously clean by staff I didn't see - I was never disturbed. The en-suite bathroom and shower were of a reasonable size, and again very clean. Single hotel rooms don't often have the best views, but this room looked out on the garden with its spring flowers and magnolia tree in bloom.Breakfast was buffet style in a large first floor room. There was plenty of choice with cereals, cheese, ham, rolls, fruit, etc. Tea or coffee was provided quickly by friendly staff, who soon learnt that I always have coffee for breakfast. You were neither hurried nor fussed over, making the meal an enjoyable experience. Although the hotel does not provide dinners, I found several restaurants within easy walking distance.The reception is manned 24 hours a day, with the hotel entrance having a buzzer operated security door. It therefore felt really safe. In the bar / lounge there was a computer freely available for guests to check e-mails, etc.I found all the staff courteous, friendly and helpful. They seemed genuinely interested in their guests and were a mine of information. A minor problem with my suitcase on my last morning was instantly solved, much to my relief. It had been many years since I last visited the Netherlands, and I hope to return to Amsterdam and the Hotel Aalders before too long.

<Content>Pleasant convenient hotel in a quiet neighbourhood We stayed in a small double room which was a 109 euros per night. It was compact but perfectly adequate with an ensuite bathroom. There aresteep stairs but there is a small lift. The hotel reception is staffed 24 hours so you can leave your key at the desk and not have to carry it around. Breakfast is taken in a pleasant room on the firstfloor and is self-service with croissants, breads, cheeses, juices and tea or coffee. Trams 5 and 2 run past the top of the street and these will take you into the centre or onto Central Station. We purchased a 72 hour pass which was 13.50 euros and we used it a lot. It is just a few minutes walk to the Reichs museum, the Van Gogh museum and the Concertgebouw. There are places to eat and drink a few minutes walk across the park on Franz Hals Street and round the corner on Van Baerle street. We enjoyed the Cafe Vertigo beneath the film museum in Vondel Park, Pompa Cafe on Willemparkweg and old-fashioned Cafe Welling behind the Concertgebouw (avoid if you dislike smoking!)

<Content>Totally satisfied I have just returned with my family from Amsterdam. We were there for 4 nights, and we are very satisfied with staff, and hotel. I t close to the downtown, but not to noisy at night. Last morning we had a breakfast at 6:30, becouse our bus shuttle was leaving for tairport at 7. Regular breakfast is from 7:30 till 10.I suggest this hotel to everyone.

<Content>Great quiet location but needs some minor upgrades This hotel is in an excellent quiet location near the Van Gogh museum, a row behind designer shops and 2 minutes walk from the tram into town, but for the price it is a little run down. The room we hadwas large with a balcony but the decor a bit scruffy. We asked for a quiet room and although not on the road (the had a noisy hum when used when people came in late and got up early. There were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room which is poor for a 3 star. We came in at 11.40 pm one night which is not particularly late and they couldn't even provide coffee from the bar as it was shut and the machine turned off. We had to ask for our coffee trays to be removed when they had been left in the room for 2 days! Breakfast is included in the rate but the choice was limited and we got bored with it after 4 days as the choice isn't great. There are rolls, bread, fruit bread, croissants, ham, cheese, boiled eggs, butter and jams. No fruit salad or grapefruit and the only fresh fruit available were apples.A bit of decor upgrade, tea and coffee in the bedrooms and a better breakfast choice and this hotel would be great. I would probably choose the Bidleberg garden hotel which is opposite next time.

<Content>Great Location Hotel Aalders was a good place for the price. We made the reservation the day we arrived and got a good rate for a weekend. The hotel is pretty basic but the location is good and it is clean. Bathroom was definitely cosy, but it is Europe. Bed was not especially comfortable but everything seemed clean. We were only there for 2 nites and it served our purposes fine. A good place to stay if you get a good rate.

<Content>Hotel Aalders-a pleasant experience! We are just back from a tour of Holland and Belgium. Stayed at Hotel Aalders in Amsterdam. Excellent location near museums, good transport links, wide choice of eating places. The room we stayed in was comfortable and adequate with en-suite, but facing the road which was not too noisy. A garden facing room was requested but not available. Good choice of continental breakfast-bread, rolls, croissants, cheese, cold meats, boiled egg, cereals, fruit juices, coffee, tea etc. Staff at front desk were helpful with advice to arrange visits, tours and transport. On the negative side coffee and tea-making facilities in the room were lacking although there was a bar and lounge near the front desk. It was very hot during our stay there and missed having air-conditioning or even a fan to cool us down. I thought the hotel was over-priced given the lack of the above. However, I would be happy to patronize this hotel again. Krish Kumar,Plymouth,UK

<Content>Excellent choice We had a four-night holiday in the city and spent quite a some time on the web before the trip searching a hotel and reading reviews. My wife then found this one.Location: Excellent on a quiet street with public transport just behind the corner. It takes a 5-minute ride with the tram to the city centre.Staff: Very friendly, professional and helpful.Room: Very comfortable, spacious for even three people. Rather poorly ventilated, however. Made our nights unpleasant because the weather was so hot. Clean room, clean toilet. Odd location of the shampoo dispenser...The room price, too, was above average but acceptable regarding what you receive in return.

<Content>not worth the money............ Whatever you do dont get the shared hotel bus form the airport! The driver charges over the price from the booking office to make a profit (and then you end up in the unmarked minibus, which left way after the official minibus!). The busses also didn't leave the terminal for a very long time, far far quicker and easier to get the train into Centraal station (15 mins) and then the tram (5, or 2) to Musuemplein which is then 2 mins walk from hotel.Rooms are clean, but boring(furniture looks like something from a chain motel), locks on the doors are flimsy  very awkward, tiny unventilated bathrooms, no airconditioning and look nothing like the hotel website photos! The dinning room also looks nothing like the photos on the website! Shame it is a period property but needs redecorating urgently.When we were there, another in the party had scaffolding outside her window and the hotel couldn't understand the security concern. It also says it is non-smoking, but all the staff there come into the bar for their breaks and smoke in there! The broken glass windows downstairs are also attractive!Its not worth the price, booking agents ( various websites) try to make out its a very, very good 3 star hotel worth being a 4 star, its not! Its a low 3 star with a high room rate, so if you want a hotel thats pricey for what it is but in a good location go for it.

<Content>Aslders Hotel - perfectly located I was in Amsterdam for business and spent one night at this hotel.The location is perfect; being one street off from the Museum Plein as well as PC-HoofStr., this for me was incredibly convenient.My single room was clean and well maintained, and had a very large window looking onto the back garden.During my checkout, I met the owner, and as I had to get across town to another hotel, he helped me sort out all the logistics  best way to get to my destination.The breafast room for me was abit too small, but the food they served was good.Last year, my wife  I spent a week on holidays in Amsterdam and we stayed at another hotel right on PCHoofStr., I would recommend this hotel over the others on PCHoofStr.

<Content>Great for art lovers Stayed for two nights in March 2007. The hotel was easy to find - especially if you take the connexion taxi from the airport (shared system at flat fare of Eur 12.50 and you are dropped off at the door). I was early but there was no problem with leaving my luggage and being given a local map to help find my way about. The reception desk was always friendly and helpful and because of the security system - you ring the buzzer and are let in - always had my key waiting for me.It is right in the middle of the museum area and a few minutes' walk from the big galleries - hence I was first in to see the Rijksmuseum.I had a small single room which was as advertised. But it had all the facilities you could want and looked out onto the garden and a magnolia just coming into flower. Breakfast was included and met my needs for a short stay.There are places to eat nearby - ideal for a single female traveller - and it is easy to walk to the central attractions too.The rooms are all non smoking which is a big plus in Amsterdam though smoking is allowed in the bar where typically the receptionist was smoking all evening while watching the football - only downside from my point of view.Very friendly and I can't understand the comments of those who found the staff cold. By the way, I met another guest who told me he had stayed there frequently for 20 years but was by no means the longest resident.

<Content>Better than ever!! What a great weekend we had at the Hotel Aalders...again!!We have returned after more than a year and loved everything about the hotel, but we already knew that. The staff was so nice and welcomed us with such a friendliness...felt like we were coming home. Ofcourse we booked the same room like last time and it was clean en quiet. The breakfast was even better then before.They had a breakfast buffet with petit pains, croissants, 2 types of fruit juice, 2 different types of cheese and 3 types of meat, yoghurt, milk, cereals.........very nice! We did not regret returning to Hotel Aalders and I hope we do not have to wait that long as the last time to get back to Amsterdam and Hotel Aalders.

<Content>A great friendly hotel I've visited Amsterdam on 4 occasions and I always try to book into the Hotel Aalders. I've done the weekend with the boys and the romatic break with the other half. The hotel is situated in the museum quarter close enough to the main attractions but just far enough away from the bustle of the city. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the hotel has an atmosphere not unlike staying 'round someones house.Will be back with the wags in November.

<Content>Good for families Pleasant, clean hotel - quietly situated but well placed for museums and designer shopping. Main trams to centre (Nos 2 and 5) a 2 minute walk away. Some good restaurants nearby. Our non-smoking room on the ground floor was large and comfortable. The staff were pleasant and helpful. There is a small bar on the ground floor in which our 2 daughters were welcome. Breakfast was fine (boiled eggs, meat and cheeses with cereals, crossants, etc). We would stay here again if ever we visit Amsterdam again in the future.

<Content>Great Location with Fab Staff I have never been to Amsterdam before, friends were going and we managed to get on the same flight ,so just needed accomodation. This was in short supply and thoroughly tired, I booked The Aalders because it was available. I wasn't disappointed though. We arrived far too early because Easy Jet cancelled our original flights, but this was no problem - we booked in, left our luggage and took off to familiarise ourselves with the area, which from a female stance was perfect - first left, first right and you have Louis Vuitton, Chanel, La Coste, Burberry and it just goes on and on..... Location-wise it was ideal - right in the heart of Museum Plein and a few minutes by #2 or #5 tram into the city centre (the #5 also takes you to Centraal Station). Jan Luykenstraat architecturally was exactly as I imagined with five storey terraces on a tree- lined street. The hotel itself is charming and comfortable rather than luxurious, with great English speaking staff (my Dutch is slightly worse than my Spanish) and a pretty cheap bar! Ideally situtated for accessing all the cultural sights and sounds, coffee shops, bars and nightlife, it is quiet at night and boasts a lovely breakfast room. I will definitely revisit Amsterdam and when I do, I will be booking the Aalders.

<Content>Thumbs up for Hotel Aalders I've just returned to Scotland after spending a week at Hotel Aalders with my family. We were very pleased with the hotel - our family room was clean and well appointed, all of the staff (both at reception and in the breakfast room) were helpful and friendly and the facilities were first rate. The bar was excellent (with drinks available till 2 am for residents), as was the selection of maps and leaflets at reception. The range of food and drinks available at breakfast (bread / eggs / cold meats / cheese etc) time was spot on, and really set us up for the day. We also found the security arrangements in place at the hotel very reassuring (i.e. 24 hour concierge and entrance via a buzzer and video camera surveillance). Overall, I would certainly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a quiet hotel in the museum area of Amsterdam. It's barely five minutes' walk from the Rijksmuseum etc, and is situated in a very upmarket area that seemed safe and was very quiet at night. The Vondelpark is just round the corner, while the bright lights of Max Euweplein and Leidseplein are just along the road.

<Content>very nice My husband and I spent two very nice nights at the Hotel Aalders at the beginning of May. The room was very clean and spacious. The breakfast room has a lovely view of the garden and a nice variety of items were offered. The staff was friendly and helpful. My husband had medicine which needed refrigeration, and the staff were happy to store it in the kitchen refrigerator. We found only two negatives. The first is not the hotel's fault. The house numbering system in Amsterdam is very confusing. Because the Rijksmuseum takes up the whole first block of Jan Luykenstraat, that throws off the numbering on that side of the street. Therefore while the numbers on the left side of the street are in the teens, the numbers on the other side of the street are in the 50' and 60's. For us Texans it made it difficult to find the hotel. The second was a lack fo firmness of the bed. However the staff did their best to remedy that problem. They had a plank which they placed under the mattress and that helped a bit. If you like firm beds, you should look elsewhere and that would be a shame. In spite of the bed, we loved this hotel.

<Content>Good value for money We stayed three nights in a family room (room 6): 4 beds with enough floor space left for the kids to do a puzzle, spacious balcony, very small bathroom. The room was clean. The staff were extremely helpful. The hotel has a great location, just a few metres from the Van Gogh museum and the Rijksmuseum, and also just a few metres from a tram and bus stop that takes you to the Leidseplain and the town centre in minutes.

<Content>Perfect! I am one of a group of 4 traveling college students, all female, who traveled to Amsterdam for the weekend. We absolutely loved Hotel Aalders, it was the perfect choice. We stayed in the quad room which had the bathroom in the room. It was clean, big and had a cute balcony off the room. The staff was so friendly and helpful and we felt extremely safe always. I couldn't have asked for a better place, and it is ideal for travelers on a budget!

<Content>Cosy hotel with artistic surroundings It is a rare situation to fell yourself like at home in the place you are for the first time. The Hotel Aadlers is a small, cosy hotel with a very kind staff. The hotel is situated in luxurious part of the city - between Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh's museum. This is a place you can relax from a rush within one step distance from it.

<Content>Satisfied On the upside: This hotel was inexpensive (private room and bathroom for not much more than a hostel). It is well-located in an upscale, quiet part of town and only a few minutes walk from the heart of the city. The staff was pleasant, and the room and bathroom were clean.On the downside: The room was small, and the hotel in general is a bit shabby.Overall, I was quite satisfied and think Hotel Aalders is very good value. I would stay there again... unless I was planning to spend a lot of time in the room, in which case I'd spend a bit more for a little more luxury.

<Content>Cozy and quiet for the most part... I've stayed at Hotel Aalders several times and have always been satisfied. The rooms are cozy, and to be honest may be a bit small to someone used to staying in European hotels, and outside of a free traditional continental-style breakfast each morning doesn't offer much in the way of amenities. Still, if you're worried about hotel amenities maybe you should take your next vacation in Orlando or Las Vegas. For goodness sakes, this is Amsterdam; how much time were you planning on spending in the hotel? Anyway, the rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable, and the staff is helpful, extremely polite, and very friendly. The hotel is a block away from the major museums, and about a five minute walk to the leidseplein, where you can find lots of bars, restaurants, coffeshops, and night clubs (namely Paradiso and Melkweg). The only thing that I could say that could be better is that there are no do not disturb placards to hang on the doors, and as such the housekeeper insisted on knocking on my door at 9 am every morning! Still, I would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable place to stay in Amsterdam.

<Content>Excellent Hotel-Wonderful Staff The Aalders hotel was an excellent base for me and 5 of my girlfriends. We were allocated 2 triple rooms which were fabulous, roomy and spotlessly clean. As you can imagine, we were not the quietest guests which the hotel may have experienced but the staff were great and did not complain at all. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as it is close to Vondelpark, museums, and if you have lots of cash to splash, designer shops such as Gucci, Armani, Lacoste etc, etc.You can jump on a tram 2 minutes from hotel which will take you to Dam Square.Oh and the young guy on reception was rather dishy!!!I would definately go back to this hotel the next time I visit Amsterdam.Excellent!!!!

<Content>Dreadful hotel I can only speak about the room in which I stayed at Hotel Aalders and I don't know how the other rooms compare in this small family-run hotel, but my experience was simply DREADFUL. The staff was friendly, but there was no hot water for morning showers and there was no heat in the room for the first two chilly days (in May). At 82 Euros per night for a single room, some minor comforts should have been provided but were not. This hotel requires a three-night minimum stay! I would have had better accomodations at a local youth hostile! The mattress on the bed was so saggy, old, and lumpy that it was impossible to sleep comfortably. The room itself was dark and dreary. One of the table lamps didn't work and on the second day, the other table lamp was inexplicably removed from the room; leaving only the ceiling fixture to provide harsh lighting. The hair dryer in the bathroom didn't work. The breakfast that was included in the room's price was meager and woefully inadequate. After I stayed at Hotel Aalders for the required three-night booking, I gladly left and checked into a different hotel. I couldn't wait to be out of this dreadful place!

<Content>Wonderful April vacation This was a terrific location for our first time in Amsterdam as it is very near the museumplein, shopping and the tram. Our room was large and VERY quiet. It is a family run hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. The shower is open (why don't they use shower curtains?) but that is the only thing I could possibly complain about. The breakfast room is beautiful. The breakfast is typically Dutch with meats, cheese and hard boiled egg and breads. There is juice, coffee (wonderful!) as well as yogurt, milk and cereal. You won't go hungry. I would highly recommend this hotel and would gladly stay there again on our next visit!

<Content>A quiet corner of Amsterdam My wife and I have stayed at the Aalders 3/4 times over the past years. We have always found it to be a comfortable, clean, friendly hotel. Its location is just one more plus. Close to restaurants and museums it makes visits to Amsterdam like going home to an old comfortable neighborhood.

<Content>Great Family Run Hotel with a Great Staff I have stayed in this hotel, in several different rooms, at least 5 times in the last two years. The staff (who are almost all members of the Aalders family) are wonderful and helpful, but they are Dutch, meaning some Americans take the matter-of-factness of the Dutch people as rudeness or indifference. The rooms are a great value and I have never experienced any problem with any room. The breakfasts are nice and the hotel has character. Its location near the Vondelpark, Van Gogh Museum, Rijksmuseum, and the Ledseplein make it a tremendous choice. The cost, even with the euro battering the dollar as of late, is low by Amsterdam standards. It is also frequented more by Europeans, which to me is a plus as compared to complaining Americans who want huge rooms, a doorman (the Aalders has NO doorman), a concierge, in short, they want a US hotel even though they travelled 3700 miles away.

<Content>Don't Stay Here - It Will Ruin Your Vacation We were supposed to stay at Hotel Aalders for 5 nights, but had such a terrible experience we ended up leaving after one night. We had to waste half a day finding somewhere else to stay. It seemed nice enough at first, but then we noticed that our bathroom had a strong smell of sewage. We arrived quite late, so the only person to complain to was the doorman. At first he said he could do nothing, then when we pushed he said we could use a bathroom in an empty room but could not stay in the room. After arguing for awhile we were allowed to stay in another room, though he was very reluctant. The next day we spoke to the manager, and she was cold and not at all understanding. She said the bathroom smelled this way because it was an old city. We said the bathroom in the room we finally stayed in was fine, and she shrugged her shoulders. She would not let us stay in a different room unless we spent close to 50 dollars more per night. When we said we were going to find somewhere else to stay, she said we needed to check out on time, since the room had to be made up. Remember, we had reserved the room for 5 nights so clearly no one else was staying in the room. Overall, for the amount this hotel wants you to pay, it is a TERRIBLE value. The staff is cold and not at all accomidating. STAY AWAY, and you will have a much better vacation.
