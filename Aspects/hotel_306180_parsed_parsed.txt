<Content>Not worth the health risk - bed lice/bugs This hotel sells itself as a 'Boutique' hotel, my response to this is that there is nothing boutique about this place at all. Disregard any 'Awards' that they advise they have won, they are either dubiously awarded or just plain false. This hotel should be closed down for health reasons alone it is totally disgusting.My wife and I stayed in this place for 1 night on our return from a two 1/2 week holiday in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. The expectation was always that it would simply be a comfortable stay. During the night we both started to feel bites over our bodies, after turning on the light we noticed more than a few bed bugs running over the sheets, mattress and pillows. Our bodies were starting to show signs as well. We had not alternative but to sleep on the floor in the bathroom to try and avoid to bugs/lice.When we raised this with the manager in the morning the response was of shock Oh really Sir I took him up to the room and showed him the sheets with the bugs on them and some blood stains from both my wife and I and previous patrons....would you beleive it.....he was still shocked. I have requested a full refund for the room stay, for which he promised he would provide on my credit card (yeah sure) and showed me the occupancy book confirming that there was a person in the room a few days before who didnt have any problems. Frankly I didnt really care about if other people had complained or not.Upon return to Australia we visited a doctor as the swelling and infection from the bites was worsening, the doctor confirmed that we had contracted 'scabies' from the bed which is a parasite that burrows under the skin and lays eggs causing swelling and itching, though thankfully treatable. For the benefit of your own health and those travelling with you, DO NOT STAY AT THE IN AT TEMPLE STREET.

<Content>False advertising When we contacted The Inn on Temple Street via email before we left home, we requested a family room as there were four of us- three adults and a three and a half year old. We promptly received a confirmation back from the hotel that a family room was available so, as requested, we gave our credit card details to secure the booking. When we arrived at the hotel, we checked in, (foolishly without looking at the room first) lugged our bags up the stairs (there was no lift) and to our dismay, tried to squeeze into a tiny room. The door couldn't even be opened all the way because it hit a desk that was in the door way. It had obviously been moved to make way for a stretcher bed. This certainly wasn't a family room! For $248 Sing. a night, with no breakfast or no swimming pool, we at least expected a room where we could all fit into without having to try to scramble over our luggage and each other's beds!I've travelled to over 50 countries and stayed in a lot of rooms, but this just was ridiculous. We politely handed back our room key to the lady at reception and said to her that the room was just too small for four people, and she agreed! We should have suspected this when we arrived and she asked if we had booked two rooms.We caught a taxi and soon found another place to stay with a much larger room, a pool, free internet (unlike the Inn which had a very high rate) and included breakfast for less than $248 Sing.When we arrived back home three days later we found that we had already been billed $292 Sing. by The Inn for the room which surprised us a lot. It wasn't as though we had just changed our minds because we didn't like the room- it was just not what we were told it was when we booked it- A FAMILY ROOMWe emailed the hotel to ask for an expanation with no reply, so we waited a week and sent another email with no reply again. Yet when we were booking the hotel, we received promp replies. They have our money yet are too unprofessional to even reply. If you are looking for somewhere to stay in Singapore, I would not go near The Inn at temple Street. It is just a small 'Boutique' hotel with little in the way of amenities or views. There is nothing special about it. If you want to visit Chinatown it is very easy and inexpensive to catch public transport or even walk there form another part of the city where there are heaps of hotels with similar (or cheaper) rates than The Inn. At least you will have a much nicer room, views of the city, restuarants, a pool and perhaps free internet

<Content>Bad stay at The Inn at Temple street We booked 3 night , 3 bedrooms for our guests from Taiwan. This is their first time to S'pore. They found crockroaches in one room , another TV not working, plugs were not working. The management didn't even apologise when feedback. They offered to change room but by then our guest decided to check out the next day to find another hotel. Real embrassment for first impression.  We found this hotel on line. We wonder how they been awarded The Tourism Award 2008.The room rates was attractive online but when they check out they paid full rates.

<Content>Boutique hotel? You're joking. This place claims to be a boutique hotel but really it's just a hostel in a prime position. My room had no window, was so small it could only just fit the (small, single) bed in and still the air-con struggled to cool it. Wallpaper peeling, no hot water in the shower, a single scraggy towel that looked like it could do with a wash. Very poor, I won't be back.

<Content>After 11 pm Was there couple of wks ago en route to Australia.We remembered clearly where we put our perfume but it went missing without a trace. Complained to the counter staff, all they said was: will inform the manager. And then? Long silence and avoidance at the counter? Is that what we called customer service? Another incident was this old lady, counter staff, she just sat there and play with the internet, will never help despite I tried my very best to ask her where can I change my foreign currency upon arrival, she just looked at me blindly and said ''come back after 11pm''??? (I'm not gonna wait for another 5 hour for another staff to take over the shift, that's very unprofessional and silly!) Not once but twice. Very arrogant and ignorance at the same time.Horrible experience!!!I will never return to this awful ''hotel'', if you can call it a HOTEL.If you guys got no place to stay but have to put up with this [--] hotel, CONGRAT!!!Claimed to be ''The Best Experience Standard Hotel, there's nothing compare to a simplest hostel in EU, not even Thailand. Prior to my departure, the only thing that really make it up to is the courteous/ friendly/ knowledgeable receptionist who's always ready for an answer, given accurate and sufficient info on various subjects. You can always reach out to this Chinese?/Eurasian? boy at the counter, normally after 11pm, who speaks fluent English (I thought every Singaporean does?), Mandarin, French (He was talking to a French guest)! Didn't get his name though but he's the only one seems to be ''above'' the standard. Good Luck guys! Lock your bags before going out! Totally agree, this might be the THEFT CENTRAL with well organized snatching staff doing horrible things to guest.

<Content>Worst Budget Hotel in Singapore!! Chosen this budget hotel out of desperation. I checked into this hotel 2nd week of Dec 2007. Never thought the budget hotel in Singapore is in such a bad condition. I agreed with the noisy street, but worse than that, my air-con was 鈥榠nteresting鈥? not able to adjust the temperature, when it got too cold, you can鈥檛 off the unit as well, how amazing, when it happened in a country like Singapore鈥?shame on you!!Oh ya, when most of the hotels in Singapore are giving free internet access, this wonderful hotel is charging you at SGD6 per hour, I cant believe I am in Singapore!Never ever choose this budget hotel if you have other options!!!!!

<Content>Beware! Theft Central Do NOT stay here.Why?You will run a high risk of having items STOLEN.In particular, mobile phones, notebooks, and other easily portable electronic devices that can be sold easily in SG.Having stayed here before, I had made the mistake of thinking that it was a reasonable (if somewhat shabby and small) budget hotel.My assessment now is that it is a prime site for theft - organised by some staff, with items gone in a flash (usually just prior to checkout).In a word - AVOID!

<Content>Please hide the manager Foolishly I booked this hotel because it got a good rating in the lonely planets guide.Admittedly the location is very central, but Temple street is also very noisy at night - if you turn off the dusty air-con you will be woken up by noises from the street.Rooms are *very* small- literally no good space to put your suitcase. I stayed in a double room with a queen size bed - reception made a big fuss about giving me this large room at the same prize as a single room.S$148 per night is clearly too much for this **-hotel. In the latest Lonely planets guide the price is given as S$98, so clearly they have hiked the price up recently. Before checking in I stayed at the Changi Village Hotel (A good 4 star hotel) for the same price per night!While the sheets on the bed were not exactly dirty, they where certainly not white either, but old and spotted by something that could look like blood.Reception staff was friendly, but look out for the middle aged Chinese manager who also hangs out in the reception area- using one of the internet terminals a lot of the time.I did not deal with him directly, but happened to overhear himabusing the girl in the reception when walked town. A nasty fellow they would do well to hide from the customers.When I checked out he was there too in the background. He grinned and said Money! Charming fellow.

<Content>Worst experience Avoid it. As soon as you step in you will feel the smell of mould and when you come into the room you will realize where it come from. Claim that breakfast is included - consisted of coffee and bread that could not be swallowed. One of my worst experiences with ignorant and unfriendly staff.

<Content>Huge disappointment We stayed overnight en route to Australia, we arrived mid morning and on checking in couldn't help but notice how tired the place looked, on the way to our room(if you can call it that) we noticed the wallpaper hanging off the walls and dirty stairs and threadbare carpets. The room was so small you had to walk sideways to get round. The bathroom was dirty and I noticed hairs on the floor, yuk.We were so shattered we just sat on the musty smelling bed and wanted to cry, the view was a brick wall so close to the window, very strange.We overslept by twenty minutes the next morning, no surprise as the very loud airconditioning kept us awake most of the night, and on going downstairs for breakfast we were abruptly informed we couldn't have any, we had paid for breakfast and I pointed this out to the manager but he would not relent, I had to plead for a cup of tea.I couldn't wait to get out of the place and would advise people to avoid at all costs. The staff including the manager are abrupt and brusque, there is no friendly smile and quite frankly I don't know how he manages to get away with it.

<Content>OK if you only need a bed We booked this hotel for a 2-night stay as it was the only one left in Singapore with any rooms, due to a poker convention and a visit by George Bush. Our room was tiny and we had to walk sideways between the wall and bed to get to the bathroom. The carpets were sad  tired and there was a strange smell of over-cooked cabbage in the corridor. On the plus side, the staff were very friendly and helpful.

<Content>Give it a miss I foolishly booked this hotel without reading any of the reviews on here. I arrived to be given a room with no windows, the air conditioning not working (in tropical heat and humidity), barely enough room to get to the bed and a solitary light that made the room look like a very badly lit, very claustrophobic mineshaft. I complained to reception and the manger, who's attitude was both surly and rude and who's answer was to tell me what did I expect for booking a cheaper room. I was told that I could pay an extra 20 pounds per night or come back in the morning (having already paid). At this point I demanded my money back and after a very heated debate was then offered a better room at no extra cost which I took. Also the rooms at the front face the road which has very noisy Karoake which goes on through the night. Please do yourselves a favour and avoid this hotel - you're on holiday - it should be fun - not like this.

<Content>Disaster! Although we had made a reservation, when we arrived at the hotel from the airport we were told there were no rooms available. Then we were told that if we wanted to stay we would have to pay additionally for the night because our reservation was for a different day. After some very lengthy and heated discussion, the receptionist studied the voucher again and claimed that the booking company (AsiaRooms) had made a mistake. At this point, we no longer wanted to stay at The Inn at Temple Street, so we left and found another hotel nearby. Since returning from Singapore we have been trying, so far unsucessfully, to obtain a refund the amount AsiaRooms billed us for the room where we were refused. Avoid The Inn at Temple Street and avoid AsiaRooms.

<Content>Dated but excellent location I have just spent two nights at the Inn on Temple Street. The hotel certainly has not seen a lick of paint or new carpets for a few years, however, the staff do keep the hotel very clean and are very friendly.Despite the tired decor I really enjoyed staying at this hotel due to its very central location in China Town which is walking distance to the Singapore river, boat quay, the financial district and even Raffles hotel and the colonial district. It is also very near the china town metro stop.China town has a great vibe due to the street traders, the large number of food stalls and the general buzz of the area, which I preferred to the less colourful areas such as around Raffles and north of the river.All in all a good budget hotel. I think if I was staying for more than two nights, however, I would stay in a more up market hotel with more facilities and general ambience etc.

<Content>Cheap and Cheerful Myself and my fiance stayed here for 8 nights and had a great time.The room and en-suite were clean, the bed was comfortable, and the hotel is in a SUPERB location for seeing singapore - and frankly for 拢22 pounds a night what more would you expect!The breakfast was a bit basic (toast and tea/coffee), and the room a little small with some quirks - like a dodgy TV, but at the end of the day you get what you pay for. If you are after 5* accomodation and lavish hotel facilities, then this place isnt for you - however if you want a clean and comfortable place in a great location where you can get a good nights sleep after sightseeing then i'd recommend it.

<Content>Dirty  I stayed at this hotel In April 2005.The hotel is dirty, tired and unloved.The room was dingy and in extremely poor repair - dirty carpet, wallpaper falling off walls, safe that was broken. The airconditioning barely worked as the filters were thick with dust and dirt. The bed had hair in it and the brakfast was the worst I have ever had on my travels.It is a pity that the hotel is not managed and maintained properly as the location is great.I would suggest that any travellers seek accommodation elsewhere or they are likely to be very disappointed.

<Content>Utter Garbage This was to be our great return holiday to this hotel. Unfortunately we arrived at midnight and had to stay here. Originally booked for 10 nights we walked out the very first morning. The room booked was not the one we were given. It was FILTHY. I personally know the manager and was very surprised by the deterioration over the last couple of years. Avoid at all costs.

<Content>Dark and dumpy... The Inn was recommended to us by a couple of lads at Changi as being good value and a cool place to stay. WRONG! The room was a bit of a dump and the windows dirty, with a view of the usual brick wall. Having said this, the hotel's location is great - right in the heart of Chinatown and really close to the station. It was easy to find good food nearby at night. Overall, this feels more like a hostel with private rooms than a hotel - would do if nothing else was available but there are much nicer places for not a lot more money.And after a big night out in Singapore, the loud and inefficient aircon and too-soft bed were more than we could take - we checked out and into a Holiday Inn. I know - that's not what we came to Singapore for, but when needs must... And next time, if trying to do it on a tight budget, I'd stay in one of the better hostels rather than this fairly depressing, dark, shabby hotel.

<Content>Great location, but.... I had booked 3 days in this inn and 2 days at another hotel...being it my first time in Singapore, I like to make sure I am not stuck with only one hotel. I am so glad I had only book 3 days here and 2 days at a luxury hotel. I mean the inn was located in an absolutely great location in Chinatown, near the bustling shop markets, food hawkers, and MTR station to get to all the other neighborhoods. Quaint looking lobby. The only thing is I had stayed in a single room consisting of a twin bed, decent size bathroom, and a closet...that's about it...no windows, dim lights and guess what, I had to kill 3 baby roaches during my 3 day stay on different days. I was uncomfortable with my bed sheets and cover...kinda moldy...so I didn't really have a relaxing sleep in this environment.If you are not planning to stay in your room too long, this inn is ok for that...just make sure to seal your stuff every time you leave, just in case a baby one might want to hop along on your trip with you.

<Content>Avoid this hotel! This was my second visit to the Inn and will certainly be my last. The towels were threadbare and dingy. There was mold on the bathroom wall, the bedsheets and comforter smelled musty and were stained. The room safe had batteries removed and did not work. The night clerk was asleep in the lobby and we had to wake him to check in. The air conditioner was on a timer and clicked off every 10 minutes. Plus, the room card operated the air conditioner and had to be removed when exiting the room; thus, it was never really cool in very hot Singapore. Neither the television nor the radio worked. The location was great in the heart of Chinatown and the Asst. Mgr. was very helpful, but this hotel definitely needs improvement.

<Content>Don't Go I was excited to stay somewhere interesting, but shortened my trip because I had already paid for this hotel! The service was terrible and the internet cost $4.50 for a half hour. The worst part was how dirty the hotel was. One guest found faeces in his bed and when he asked to have his sheets changed they simply turned the bed sheet around. My advice is stay somewhere else.

<Content>Good value excellent value. The room was very small but well appointed: fridge; safe; shower; room service till midnight; cafe; coffee/tea maker; laundry; helpful staff and lots of maps. Location is in the busy Chinatown with local markets and easily accessable subway nearby. DO ask for a room facing the street!
