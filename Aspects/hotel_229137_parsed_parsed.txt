<Content>Fantastic!!! We stayed at this great hotel a weekend in November. We had a flight in to Amsterdam very early one morning and were able to check in almost immediately!Our room was very small, but beautifully decorated. And we absolutely loved the bar/dining room as well as the breakfast which was better than most big international hotels.Also the location is great. 10 min walk to the DamThe staff were polite and very helpful and I can definetly recommend this to anyone.A great experience.

<Content>excellent experience... I will return I booked this hotel because it had quite high ratings on Tripadvisor. The booking .com offered it at 90鈧?/night which is very cheap for hiring a room in the center of Amsterdam in the middle of the shopping season.We are very happy that we opted for this hotel. The staff is VERY friendly and helpfull.The bar is an oasis of style.Breakfast is great (lots of choice)Room is not large, but very well decorated.What we really appreciated, is that we got a full set of Nespresso in our room. Very nice

<Content>My favourite Hotel EVER!!!!! Just back from a 4 night stay at the Toren to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. I absolutely loved the Toren. The bar/breakfast room is stunning. The staff are the friendliest I have ever encountered in all my travels, so helpful and welcoming. The rooms are a little scuffed around the edges but decorated beautifully, a lovely big bed with lots of cushions, a modern bathroom, a flat screen TV, a coffee maker and a mini bar. The decor was definately to my taste lots of romantic touches and fabulous christmas decorations. The breakfast was simply perfect, a huge selection, fruit salad cheeses meats hot food smoked salmon cereals juices yoghurts etc plus anything else you could wish for prepared by the chef. I would never stay anywhere else in Amsterdam, this is by far my absolute favourite hotel. It is also very convenient about a 10min walk to the Dam. My only negative comment would be the small rooms (ours was a deluxe and still very cramped) but this is typical for Amsterdam and was more than made up for by everything else.

<Content>Perfect hotel The hotel is unique. Rooms are designed with perfect style. You feel like staying in somebody's home - not in hotel. I tried a dozen hotels in A'DAM - this on is the best. Perfect balance between quite nice street and short distance to everything.

<Content>Everything perfect What could I say? Fantastic. The atmosphere, the location, the kindness, the clearness. Just the room a little bit small, but the bed...ooooh...the bed what a comfort.Due to the fact that I dont take breakfast, I appreciated the coffee/tea machine in the room, with the real espresso (the same I get in my office in Italy).Everything perfect

<Content>great chic hotel Great design hotel. You will love interior of the hotel and rooms. Staying in the hotel you will find yourself in a boutique with perfect design. Breakfast is great and delicious. The dinner room is decorated in very rich style. We loved everything in this hotel and with any occasion will return there. For some people it may be important that it is situated in 10 minutes walking from the center, but for travelers that are coming for explore the city it is not a problem.

<Content>Loved the service at The Toren As I travel extensively for my job, impeccable service and central location are key for me to feel comfy. The Toren clearly belongs to that category of places where you know the minute you walk in that you are in the right hotel. Thumbs up for the young ladies at reception and a special AAA mention to the room service. I'll happily return there whether on business again or on an extended staying.

<Content>Great location The hotel Toren is ideally located within walking distance of the central area, red light, etc.., yet Toren maintains a dignified distance from the humbuggery of downtown Amsterdam. Just around the corner from the Pankake Bakery and the Anne Frank house, mere blocks from the red light, old church, several great pubs and 'cafes' ( specifically 'grey matter'). Rooms are small ( welcome to Europe) but clean, staff is friendly and helpful. Coffee machines in the rooms. The only draw back is the price, which seems a bit hefty for such a small room. Internet available in rooms,tv (english), etc. I have stayed in Amsterdam twice and both times at Toren simply because I love the location. Next time I might try another hotel only for the benefit of diversity.

<Content>Great Accommodations and People This is a wonderful little hotel in a great part of Amsterdam. Our room was in the annex, and so was a few doors down from the lounge and front desk. The room was large with a great view of the canal. We never heard noises from other guests, and the neighborhood is quiet as well. Wonderfully situated near many points of interest in this most walkable (and bikeable) city. The staff was universally friendly and accommodating. They helped us on several occasions with restaurant choices and did extensive research for us on good bicycle shops in town. Their English was flawless, and their friendly attitude put us at ease.

<Content>So good I almost don't want to review it! I have been going to Amsterdam for many years. It is a lovely city and as I have got older I just appreciate its diversity and interest more and more. This hotel is by far the best place I have stayed in the city. It has real charm....its is boutique and well designed without being pretentious and intimidating. Intimate and romantic in a perfect location!I go back over and over again.....and in fact I almost don't want to recommend it in case I cant get a room next time I go!

<Content>The Perfect Hotel Stay Amsterdam. The Netherlands The Toren Hotel.September 8th to 12th.2008.I arranged this trip as a surprise birthday present for my wife's 60th birthday. After searching the websites I chose The Toren because it had all the special features I was looking for. Ann's birthday was 6th September but I told her the news the day before! That was a good move because Ann was able to share it with her father who was ill in hospital. Sid was so keen for Ann to enjoy the trip. Tragically Sid died on Sunday morning the 7th. It was a tough call but with the family's support we set off via Eurostar from London through Bruxelles. Feeling tired and emotionally drained we arrived to find The Toren Hotel in an ideal quiet and peaceful location. The staff, on hearing our news were absolutely magnificent. They could not have been kinder or more compassionate. To our surprise and delight there was champagne awaiting us to celebrate Ann's birthday. The room was delightful - the jacuzzi such a wonderful aid to alleviate the stress and strain we both felt. The whole ambience of the hotel was excellent. Breakfast was truly great and exactly what was required. The Toren was in just the right location for us to enjoy the canals, the museums, the park and the local restaurants. In addition to the champagne on our arrival the staff arranged for food to be delivered to save us having to go out to find a restaurant. Later in our stay we were delighted again with the gift of strawberries and chocolates. The fire in Eurotunnel on 11/12 September made us feel marooned! Yet again the staff were so helpful and considerate. What might have been a difficult and stressful experience was made so pleasant and memorable because The Toren Hotel is such a beautiful relaxing place and everyone there took such excellent care of us throughout. Nothing was too much trouble. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your warmth, your care and your professionalism. We hope to return as soon as we can.

The building, real canal houses, have been very well furnished and the atmosphere is really amsterdamer. Breakfast is really delicious. The buffet is very well assorted and much better than others in five stars hotels...But the best is people. They are really kind and very helpful. The take care of the minimum details.We enjoyed our stay and come back for sure.

<Content>One of Amsterdam's Finest! I've had the privilege of staying at the Hotel Toren a few times over recent years and have always been thoroughly impressed with both the property itself and the staff.The hotel is in an excellent location within the heart of Amsterdam, which makes it convenient for sightseeing, especially if you plan to tour much of the city by foot.The accommodations are excellent, with nicely furnished rooms and an overall elegant charm and very comfortable atmosphere. The staff at the Toren are some of the best I've encountered in all my years of extensive travel. The clearly go out of their way to ensure your experience at their hotel is the best possible from the time you book your room, until you checkout and everything in between. I can't speak highly enough of this hotel. The rooms and the staff, coupled with their location and very fair prices should make the Toren the #1 choice for accommodations when visiting Amsterdam.

<Content>Plush, great value for money This is a great find - we checked in for one night and were brough to a room in the annex just a few doors down from check in. It was a great room with high ceilings, ornate decoration but with all the trimmings - iPod dock, Nespresso coffee maker, flat screen tv, robes and slippers. We didn't have breakfast but it looked good, with lots of choice. The hotel is well located in the Jordan district of Amsterdam, a 15 minute walk from central station, just around the corner from Anne Frank's house. Couldn't fault the place - we will be back!

<Content>Stylish  We needed a hotel for one night before we checked into hour canal boat for the weekend. It was sublime. Our room was small but very clean and the decor was decadent. I like to have a decent coffee machine in my room, and the coffee itself was v.nice. We enjoyed a late night drink in the lavishly decorated bar and stylish breakfast in the morning. Would love to stay longer in a bigger room (small room for two nights max). Great location, on quieter canal but immensely close to Dam Sq and the Jordaan.

<Content>Toren Excellence The Toren is in a great location, quite street but only a couple of minutes from Dam square and just around the corner from Anne Frank's house (Be there first thing for best visit). The Toren is a very elegant and charming hotel with excellent staff in a laid back style. Although the rooms were not huge they were spotlessly clean, very comfortable beds and a good air conditioning system (Amsterdam was very hot when we were there). We have stayed in Amsterdam at least 12 times on a mix of business  pleasure and the Toren is by far the best hotel for the money that I have stayed in in Amsterdam. Highly Recommended and I will most certainly be back.

<Content>Chic and Plush! Not just a super location but a really stylish boutique hotel. I had the good fortune to pick this hotel and to book a Superior room with canal view, I can only say that if I didn't have to attend various meetings I would have been happy to stay in this room all day, decadent interiors, plush furnishings, a Nespresso Machine! (Yes in my room!) and a whirlpool bath make a stay in the Torens truly delightful. The staff were most friendly and helpful and the breakfast was pure joy - FRESHLY SQUEEZED OJ! - and there is a really cool bar. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.Elizabeth - Ireland

<Content>Wonderful Amsterdamse Hotel in the heart of the canal belt This wonderful hotel is in a fantastic location, central and in walking distance of anywhere you would want to go. In the heart of the famous canal belt, overlooking the Keizersgracht Canal, with the Jordaan and the 9 Staatjes on the doorstep, and perfectly placed for a stay in Amsterdam. The hotel was really lovely, a real little boutique gem. Our room was pretty small, but to be expected from a city centre hotel, especially in Amsterdam, however it was immaculately presented, beautifully decorated, and the bed was so comfortable we nearly didn't make it up in the morning. The bathroom was also small, but with a great powerful shower and lovely Rituals toiletries for that extra touch of luxury, you couldn't ask for more. The staff were very helpful, and friendly, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.We used to live in Amsterdam, and this was the first time we'd ever been back and stayed in a hotel rather than been there at home, which felt very strange, however it turned out to be lovely. Booking a hotel you don't know on the internet is always a bit of a lottery, but this time it was a complete success. We will be going back!

<Content>Perfect location We booked this hotel for a romantic weekend in Amsterdam. Though normally too expensive, we managed to wait for a hot deal whith reduced price. And a hot deal it certainly was.Besides of it's very romantic atmosphre the hotel has one major benefit, namely the location. In one word: super. Walking from the Amsterdam Central Station to the hotel takes 10 minutes because it's only a few hundred meters away. The Keizersgracht, were the hotel is lying, is in the middle of old Amsterdam. Whatever you want to do or see, most of it can be done walking from the hotel or by channel taxi-boat. This last option is a wonderful way of travelling through Amsterdam, check it yourself. It has a stop near by the hotel. We stayed 3 days in Amsterdam (and got the Gay Pride Parade as an amusing and exciting extra) and wandered for hours through cosy streets along the channels and did two very long channel trips which has lovely views. Also the visit at the Zoo was nice. We spent the evenings at Leidseplein, Central Station area and the famous Walletjes in the Red District. There's a lot of very good restaurants and caf茅's in all kind of styles, so all of you will find something to your taste. The Rembrandt Museum, the Anne Frank House and all of those famous spots are very near by.Our hotel room was very nice, tidy and quiet. It had a romantic and authentic touch to it and all kind of services were available.The hotel staff was exceptionally kind and helpful and they were able to give smart and solid advise on all kind of things concerning Amsterdam.Allthough breakfast had to be paid as an extra, it hads all we needed and wanted. Meat, fish, vegetables and fruits, dairy, everything was fresh. Coffee and tea were also really OK.If you ever want to travel to Amsterdam and experience the romantic inner city, this hotel is one of your best options.

<Content>Great little hotel Have stayed at above hotel for four days with my wife, after thoroughly researching the large number of central hotels available in Ams. Booked through hotel website, as it had a very attractive offer, a deluxe double with bath and shower. A small remark about the shower, it was a huge rainshower type element which turned bathing into an experience every time.The room was big enough for two, very classy, great bed, lots of pillows, big lcd tv with plenty of sat channels, well stocked minibar and on top of everything it provided a nespresso machine! There was a wardrobe with plenty of space and a big safe inside.The bathroom was also big, very impressive shower and sink, with Rituals toilettries and bathrobes with slippers. The hotel is located on a central canal, 5 minutes on foot from Dam square, 2 minutes on foot from Anne Franke house, surrounded by many restaurants and cafes, very close to the tram stop, very quiet location day or night.Overall an excellent hotel, highly recommended

<Content>Terrific Boutique Hotel I selected the Toren based on it's location and the previous reviews. I travelled with my 3 daughters--16, 12  12. The location was perfect--easy to get to all venues, close to the Canal bus stop, around the corner from the Anne Frank House (go after 7 pm if you can--no line!)Every member of the staff bent over backwards to make us comfortable. We arrived early, in the rain, and came to the wrong entrance. Immediately they began to set up the room, adding a second bed in a VERY large room, overlooking the canal. From house-keeping to reception, they were extremely friendly, professional, and concerned for our well-being.The chef is outstanding. The breakfast buffet was the best that we had during our trip--and we were in 8 different hotels during our stay. I will definitely return to The Toren on a future trip--just with my husband this time! It is very romantic, and the service is just outstanding! Thank you.

<Content>very special toren my wife and i stayed a the toren for 6 nights,the room was very comfortable,with good aminities and a fantastic view over the canal,the toren is idealy located ,its just far enough away from the real centre of amsterdam to be quiet, but close enough to walk there in 5 mins,the hotel was special with its opulent design and colours,the staff were tremendously helpful in giving advice on resturants and bars,this was with out doubt one of the best breaks we have had,we were not expecting to be so taken with amsterdam,but with its quiet pace of life the beautiful canals and freindly people we were truly impressed,the toren made the break extra special.we will be returrning to the toren and wonderful amsterdam.

<Content>Suited Us To a T! After researching countless hotels on the internet, my wife and I finally chose The Toren for our first-ever visit to Amsterdam. We hoped it would live up to everything we had learned about it online. It did, and more. The Toren and our Amsterdam trip as a whole exceeded the high expectations with which we had arrived. Location, charm, cleanliness, friendliness, uniqueness, hospitality, elegance, comfort 鈥?The Toren has it all! And to top it off, it's sexy! (Hey, I'm sixty-one, so I'll take whatever help I can get!) We booked a Hot Deal room, knowing full well that we wouldn't be able to cancel should we have to do so. Well, wouldn't you know it? The day we were set to take the train from Paris to Amsterdam, one of those infamous French strikes struck! We had to stay yet another day in Paris. (Yah, like that's a problem?) I emailed The Toren to update them and to say we would arrive on the 21st instead of the 20th. Wendy Vissar said our room remained booked, but if they could resell it, we'd get the refund. We couldn't ask for better than that. As it turned out, Wendy was able to give us that refund and, true to form, did so graciously. So we need to add honesty to that string of honorific nouns provided above. (Recollecting Wendy, let me add beauty, too. If my wife comments on this, I'll swear I'm referring to The Toren's beauty only.) My wife and I will stay at The Toren again if we can. We do not hesitate to recommend it to folks we know. You should do your own research, though. The Toren suited us to a T. I hope you find what suits you, too.

<Content>Cozy and comfortable. After a rigorous search on the internet, I was so pleased that I had selected The Toren. It was a romantic getaway for us.We stayed in the junior bridal suite. The king bed was comfortable and the linens were very nice....lots of pillows too!Our room was on ground level with french doors which fully opened to a courtyard area. It was nice to have that open feeling being in a hotel room.The staff was extremely helpful and accomodating. Although there is not actually a full restaurant menu, the staff does arrange for delivery from a variety of restaurants and we were not disappointed in the least. Room service is available at all hours....even for a late night (early am) toastie and a bottle of champagne.The breakfast buffet is an absolute must. Everything was well prepared and presented.The hotel location was perfect for us.....an easy walk to everything.We loved our stay and definately recommend this hotel.....it actually was more like staying at a relative's lovely home. It was very cozy and the staff was very kind.

<Content>Quirky hotel offering laid back comfort in the heart of Amsterdam After a flight cancellation we stayed one night at this hotel suggested by hotel reservations desk at Schiphol airport and were impressed by its originality, friendly helpful staff and unique room design. It's canalside location in the heart of the Jordaan district meant that some of Amsterdam's best cafe's and buildings were within easy reach and the station for trains to the airport was also a manageable walk. As much as we enjoyed the unusual decoration the room, although clean and comfortable was a little small and we would hope for more space if we stayed there again.

<Content>Very Happy with Hotel Toren Stayed at the Toren for 5 nights this April 2008. We stayed in the annex a few doors down from the main building in a superior room with a canal view. I have traveled to europe many times over the years and I am aware of what is considered a spacious room. I was very happy with the size- not huge but plenty of room on either side of bed and several feet from foot to furniture. The beds were comfortable with beautiful linens. The room had a safe, refrigerator, robes and slippers and the bathroom was a decent size and recently renovated. I was very pleased with the accomodations. The annex should be considered- it is quiet and convenient and apparently the superior rooms are a bit larger than the main building.The breakfast was excellent with a large variety of foods.The staff was young, friendly, and extremely helpful. They arranged tickets for museums and recommended an excellent restaurant nearby for dinner.I would stay at the Toren without hesitation in a heartbeat!!Some restaurants that I would recommend, they are excellent but not inexpensive: Brasserie Harkema, 11, and Restaurant Luwte (Toren).Amsterdam is a beautiful, relaxed, and friendly city. I am in my fifties and my friend and I rented bikes and rode all over the city- it's the best way to get around.The toren recommends Bike City. They are nearby and very accomodating.JG

<Content>The "Beautiful" Toren Hotel I stayed here for one bitterly cold night (outside) in December last year.This has to be one of the best hotels I have stayed in, and I have stayed in a few over the years, let me tell you. On arrival you will be surprised at the lovely decor of the ground floor, not to mention the warmth and charm of the friendly staff who greet you (they even went to the trouble of sorting out the complex car parking fees for overnight parking on the canal side, insisting on walking across the canal with me in the snow to make sure I paid the right fees and did not get a ticket). On being shown to our room we where again surprised at its elegance. Combining a mixture of modern technology - flat screen tv, wi-fi, etc - with an opulent decor of satins, silks, fluffy cushions and warm colours. The effect instantly took the chill of an Amsterdam December evening from your bones, as if the 19th  21st centuries had collided to produce an oasis of charm in the desert of winter.Changing after a hot shower in the spacious and well designed bathroom we where thus well prepared to enjoy the delights of Amsterdam, returning in the early hours when we were encouraged by the ever so friendly night porter to enjoy a night cap in the spacious bar area.The charm offensive continued the next day when, after a sumptuous continental breakfast, we sadly had to check out. The staff seemed genuinely sorry to see you depart, wishing you bon voyage as you left and hoping that you would return some day.Our trip was complete when, on leaving the hotel, we were greeted by a picture postcard scene of the canal banks draped in snow in a scene that could only have appeared on a Christmas Card. A lovely ending to a wonderful experience.I hope to go back to Amsterdam in the summer and will definitely be looking to stay in The Toren Hotel, can't wait.

<Content>Great Neighborhood, Good Hotel My first impression of this hotel was very positive. The hotel was walkable from the train station, about 10-15 minutes and is a great way to immediately get a sense of the neighborhood in which you will be staying. The staff checked us in promptly and the bellman took our bags up to the second floor. I didn't see an elevator during our stay and we were always using the stairs, so not sure if there is one. Both desk agent and bellman were friendly and helpful, so no issues here.Room #115 was at the back of the hotel. They call this the quiet side of the hotel. Which is really just a way of saying there is no view, unless you count the skylight of the kitchen below, a view. The room was decorated nicely with nice deep red colors and fluffy down comforters. It looked a bit like a brothel, which I thought was kind of interesting, considering the city we were in. It felt cozy, very small, but cozy. I have stayed at a variety of hotels in Europe and this one is smaller than most. I wondered why there was so much furniture in the room, (bed, 2 chairs, desk, 2 nightstands and table), which only made it seem smaller. Maybe if it was cleared out a bit it would have felt larger. The bathroom was a great size, with plenty of room and all the normal amenities to keep you from bringing your entire bathroom. My favorite feature in the room was the coffee maker. This might seem a bit trivial, but, as an American travelling to Europe, one of the things I really enjoy is great coffe almost everywhere you go and it was nice to have a proper coffee maker in the room. It was a Nespresso machine that could brew you espresso, coffees and teas. Easy to use with a lot of selections!Breakfast was ok, very standard fare for a European Hotel. Pastries, juices, meats and cheeses. Although the chef/cook, did come out to each table to ask if there was anything additional or special he could prepare, that was not already out on the buffet. The hotel staff were friendly enough, although I get a feeling they were not completely happy with Americans. I am very sensitive to this subject, as it comes up often enough, lately, while travelling in Europe, so I am careful to be, almost over courteous, and still felt a bit affected by the overall attitude. The best reason to stay at this hotel is the location. Situated outside the city center, you are close enough to walk to all attractions, but still able to enjoy the quietness and local feel to the area. There are a few Dutch restaurants on the hotels, recommendation list and found two of them to be outstanding. The De Reiger and Clais Claisz, hope I am remembering these correctly, were outstanding, with De Reiger being the better of the two.All in all, I think the hotel is, just a bit overpriced, but would stay here again.

<Content>Classic but small The hotel was nice and had many accents. It is on one of the canals and a relative quiet street, with in walking distance to central Amsterdam. The front desk staff were both helpful and friendly. We arrived at 8 am and were exhausted. They managed to get our room ready my 11:00 instead of waiting until the 2 pm check in time. The room was small and expensive, the bathroom was the same size as the bedroom.

<Content>Doll houses are bigger I recently tried the Toren again and what a massive disappointment. The rooms are the size of thimbles and the prices are outrageous for the level of service and accommodation. Even though they have spruced the place up a bit, the rooms and bathrooms are still tiny. I also found it strange that the reception is in a shut off room and the receptionists all seem to hide behind computer screens to avoid guests. I regret to say that this was not one of the highpoints of my recnet trip.

<Content>Lovely hotel, great location Stayed at the Toren for the second time and will probably return. Pricey, we paid extra for a room witha canal view. Breakfast was an extra - 12 Euros for a good buffet with hot choices. we chose to eat breakfast in the hotel but there are planty of nearby cafes where you could get a breakfast for less money.The hotel was as lovely as we remembered it, especially the public rooms. We have invited friends for drinks at our hotel and they are always impressed.The bedroom decor is a bit old fashioned but clean and looks fine. Lovely big bed.Very friendly staff came out to wave us off when we left for the airport.Location on Keizersgracht is very pleasant and within easy reach of Dam Square, Central Station, museums, shopping etc. if you enjoy a stroll. On the parallel Prinsengracht, there are some nice cafes e.g. Cafe Prins, Cafe t'Smalle and futher down, past the Noordkirk, the Papeneiland.

<Content>Cute and friendly, but over-priced Myself and my boyfriend stayed there for 3 nights in June 2007... The website lead us to believe the hotel  rooms were huge but they weren't. This was a little disappointing but I find hotel rooms, in general, are never quite what they seem.The breakfast, while being overpriced, most definitely, was not a disappointment. The choice of cereals, juices, fruits, not to mention the non-healthy, eggs, sausages and bacon, were all plentiful and tasty. We arrived down late one morning and early another and the quantities were fine. It is worth knowing that we were there from a Mon - Wed so that may have had something to do with the amount of food available coming up to the 11.00am mark ...Overall though, I would say that the hotel was a nice, friendly, place to stay. Overpriced somewhat but I think this can be made up for by the unusual decor, which for me is important. Bedclothes matching paintings matching curtains is not something I like to pay for. Toren is not this.Thank you.

<Content>Fabulous location, quiet rooms Our flight from Seattle arrived Amsterdam at about 8am. The room at Hotel Toren wasn't quite ready, but when we were able to access the room at 12noon, we were shown to a quiet and peaceful place to rest. No city noise, just birds chirping. Our room was in the second building of this hotel, and couldn't have been a more restful place to recover from jet lag. This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel, and we'll be back. The location is fantastic - very close to the center of the city and walking distance to many interesting sites. The breakfast is nice with many options, but a bit pricey, and there are places to get coffee close by. My only negative is that the area around the check-in desk is oddly layed out so it is awkward to interact with the hotel staff.

<Content>toren the tiny This Hotel had loads of character and was generally very pretty.However the double room was tiny and it was difficult to find a place to leave your case.The room had a very good coffee machine and was maintained well.T he breakfast which was extra was poor as once certain foods were gone they were not replaced so if you came down late you were unlucky.The staff were very friendly and polite.All in all a good hotel but pricey considering size of rooms

<Content>Bad Omen with Reservation I don't know if this review will pass the screening, but I did want to let everyone know what happened when we tried to reserve the Large Bridal Suite in October for our vacation in May. I'd actually heard about the Hotel Toren through a guidebook, which also mentioned a 10% discount if you mentioned the book at the time of reservation. So, I checked out the price of the suite on the Internet, then contacted the hotel via e-mail for their rate (hoping since we were booking a 7-night stay, I could negotiate a bit of a discount from the internet price - then plus the tourbook discount. I figured, can't hurt to ask.) The hotel staff readily responded with a rate higher than quoted on the internet. When I brought this fact to their attention, they agreed to hold the room for me, and to discuss the discrepancy with Mr. Toren, to see what would be a fair rate. So, even if I'd wanted to book at the first internet rate, I couldn't. I did not hear back from them for weeks (despite a quick reminder a few days after our initial contact), at which time, the hotel was able to honor the initial internet rate. I'd already booked at another hotel, and declined this room. I just didn't have a good feeling about it.

<Content>FANTASTIC The hotel was fantastic, well worth the 10minute walk from Central Station.We arrived at the hotel 4 hours before we could check in, although our room wasnt ready at time we checked in and left our luggage in the secure baggage room. We were assured if we came back 2 hours later our room would be ready, which it was.The room itself was lovely and clean with a whirlpool bath, which was great.The hotels location is far enough away from the nightlife to be quiet, but near enough to stagger back to.The staff were very helpful and friendly.

<Content>Loved the walk home over the bridges We spent three nights in the Hotel Toren and had a very pleasant stay. The weather in Amsterdam was poor alot of rain and it was cold. It was very relaxing to return to the hotel to warm up and revatilise ourselves with a drink in their cosy bar with the added bonus of a fire.The staff were excellent, very helpful, gave good advise on where to eat and booked trips for us. This was a positive experience as most hotels we have stayed in the staff are too busy on their computers to spend any genuine time chatting to guests. We weren't disappointed with our bedrooms as thanks to your site we were fore warned that they were small, they were very elegant, beautifully decorated and cleaned every day.Shopping advise- stay away from the big malls like The Magna Plaza and De Bijenkorf tres expensive. I found a very good dept store on Dam Square Peek  Cloppenburg good quality clothes, reasonable price and helpful staff. We visited the Irish bar O'Reilly's and while we enjoyed our visit we were charged 10 euro for a pot of tea and a pot of hot water to top up. A bit of a rip off for a pub claiming to be an Irish bar.We found a lovely short cut home back to the hotel over four bridges/canals away from the main thorough fare and you felt you were heading into the real Amsterdam. We walked every where and when we felt weary we hopped on a tram and found the drivers very willing to set you on the right track. We found everyone from hotel staff, tram drivers, restaurant staff, shop assistants, tour guides etc. very courteous and helpful.We felt that we were very lucky that we booked to stay in the Toren I think our break would not have been as enjoyable if we stayed at a big impersonal hotel. Thanks to all at the Toren for helping to make our stay in Amsterdam a pleasant one.

<Content>Torrents of Praise We just loved this place. Suite 406 is large, quiet, tastefully appointed, and located in the annex a few doors from the main hotel. At first I was concerned about not being in the hotel proper, but this was no problem. There is an espresso maker in the room with complimentary coffee and tea...try finding that elsewhere in Europe. Everything was sqeaky-clean. Bed was extremely comfortable. There is a small rooftop patio (no view) for smokers or those in need of fresh air, The photos on their website are accurate, especially the 360 degree tours of the rooms.The bathroom has a real wow factor, very large and modern with a jacuzzi large enough for two to share. My only quibble is that one has to descend a steep and curved staircase to get to the bathroom so you must be VERY careful especially at night and you'll be fine. Do not book this suite if you have trouble with stairs. Bath linens were very high quality.Location is quite good on a very lovely canal, very close to Anne Frank's house and the Westerkirk. We walked everywhere (train station, Rembrandt's house, Rijk's Museum, Van Gogh museum, etc. with no problems.The surprisingly young staff is gracious, professional and very helpful with suggestions for dining, sightseeing etc. The bar is elegant and friendly. Barman Thomas is a model of Dutch courtesy and effciency. Breakfast is reasonable and well done with pastries, cold cuts, cheeses, even sausage and eggs.

<Content>Very disappointing! My family of four stayed here in August for three nights and we really were not impressed. Toren is part of the Canal House hotel and shares the bar/breakfast room. Aside from those two very elegant rooms, the hotel is pretty much a 1 - 2 star flop house. Our room, which had an extra bed added, was extrremely small and did not allow for any space to put our luggage. Even with three in the room it would have been too small. There was no A/C and the bathroom was really quite grungy. The hotel is close to Ann Frank House and within easy walking distance of the Dam and the museum district, but these are not good enough reasons to stay here. From what I saw, the Canal House was not much better. The staff was indifferent, at best, and truly not interested in us.On a related note, I have to say how dejected we were with Amsterdam in general. Having been there some ten years ago were were really looking forward to exposing our children to what used to be a vibrant, beautiful city. Sadly, it is nothing of the sort anymore. Drugs (pot and magic mushrooms) are king now, with prostitution running a close second. At one time it was a chore to find the famed brown cafes that sell marijuana. Now these coffeehouses are on virtually every street corner, and so too are the legions of stoned drug tourists that go with them.Moreover, it seemed that the entire city was under construction - even the museums which were very disappointing since so many exhibits were closed. I hate to say this, but we were even disappointed by Ann Frank House - sacred ground indeed, but badly in need of work. I could go on, but suffice it say that Amsterdam is off our travel map for a while.

<Content>A touch of class We came to this hotel via the tourist information office in Amsterdam, after a disastrous experience at the Hotel Aadam Wilhelmina in the same city (see the 'Mice Love It', under Wilhelmina on TripAdvisor). It was like visiting a different planet. Staff were extremely welcoming and courteous, the surroundings comfortable and relaxing, and the room everything we desired (including a great view of the canal). The hotel was also well situated. It was certainly expensive -- but considering that it rescued our holiday, it was money well spent and we'd happily return there again.

<Content>Overpriced and undersized After extensive research as well checking the hotel's website I asked our travel agent to book this hotel for us. Upon arrival we were showed around the main building, shown the lovely breakfast room / bar; then came the shocks: By the way your room is not in this building, it is in our annex; also breakfast is not included either. The annex happened to be about 10 houses down the road, a real run-down, dirty old place with our either canal or garden view promised room turned out to look over some toilet block between the 3rd and 4th floor. The room was so small that our luggage almost didn't fit, there weren't enough coat hangers, there was a kicked in hole on the bathroom door, numerous light globes were missing and so on. As we were charged 170.00 Euros for this, we felt totally ripped off and could stand one night only, before we moved to a better, nicer and a lot cheaper hotel just next door. It is possible that the main building is OK, but the secondary building wouldn't be good enough for a student dormitory.

<Content>Ignore Any Negative Comments - This Place Is Perfect The perfect hotel! An idyllic location, being in the prettiest part of Amsterdam, on the canal, yet just a short walk to anywhere and everywhere you would like to visit. The staff can not do enough for you and the decor of the hotel is beautiful. The air conditioned room was very welcome and the whole place was spotless. You will feel like royalty with the settings and the attitude of the staff but comfortable enough to have a very reasonable priced drink in the bar(cheaper than any other bar/cafe we found) or breakfast in the lounge in your jeans and T shirts! Definately worth the extra to get a room with a (very large) whirlpool bath - great fun! During our stay we saw a selection of hotels. Our opinion is that the nicer ones are too far out from the attractions and the closer ones are awful; except the Hotel Toren. A truly magnificent, friendly hotel in the perfect location for a romantic break. Looking forward to visiting again soon. ---I have not attached photos because the 360 degree reality rooms on view are exactly as you will find them. Infact, they do not give them the justice that they deserve. - We would love to stay in one of the bridal suits though. In a city notorious for small rooms, they look fantastic!

<Content>wonderful hotel Hotel Toren was a great hotel in a convenient location. It's on one of the most beautiful canals and just around the corner from the Anne Frank House. There's also a church next to the Anne Frank House with a very tall steeple that makes a great landmark when finding your way back to the hotel. Considering that the airline lost our luggage for 48 hours and that my friend was pickpocketed in the train station as soon as we arrived in Amsterdam, we really appreciated the friendly staff. The concierge was very sympathetic, warned us that there are LOTS of pickpocketers in Europe, and patiently helped my panicked friend to contact her credit card companies. Our room was nice, clean and overlooked a quiet courtyard. We could walk to the train station, Dam square, Madame Toussaud's Wax Museum, the infamous red light district and other attractions. It was very easy to take a tram anywhere we wanted to go such as the Van Gogh Museum (fantastic), the Rijksmuseum, Leidesplein Square (famous for nightlife), a flower market and a flea market. (Another highlight of our trip was that we saw another pickpocketer get busted by an undercover cop on the tram.) I would highly recommend this hotel to families. My only complaints are that breakfast is not included and that the internet in the room is costly and VERY slow and hard to use.

<Content>Toren-riffic Booked this hotel at the last minute on the basis of location and price. I was incredibly surprised to find that my room was enormous and very comfortable. Plasma TV, air-conditioning, lovely bathroom and spacious enough bedroom for queen sized bed, large corner sofa, desk area. Unusually for Amsterdam it also had complimentary tea  coffee making facilities in the room. The windows opened onto a charming and peaceful courtyard garden. Staff were uniformly helpful and welcoming. A highly recommended hotel and and absolute oasis from the city pace and heat.

<Content>Right Place at the Right Time We were travelling to Europe for the World Cup and paid a visit to Amsterdam. The World Cup seemed to have driven up hotel prices in Amsterdam, but the rates at the Hotel Toren were reasonable, which was a main reason for our decision to stay there. The hotel was in an excellent area of Amsterdam - within walking distance of all of the attractions and the train station but in a quiet enough neighborhood. We stayed in the second house in a standard room which was small but, like another reader mentioned, that was fully disclosed in the website so we were not surprised. The room and bathroom were clean but the biggest plus - especially considering that this was the hottest week in Amsterdam in years - was the excellent AC. We've stayed in hotels all over Europe and experienced the often weak air conditioning and we were pleasantly surprised that the AC at Toren was powerful and kept our room cool.We normally don't care about hotel bars, but this bar was charming. The bartender was friendly and chatty but above all the prices were reasonable and we were pleasantly surprised by the bar tab at the end of our stay. We also made a couple of international and were charged a very reasonable rate. The only drawback was that by being in the second house, we felt a bit cut off from the main house and the bar, which was probably a minor inconvience all things considered.Rarely make these types of posts but we so enjoyed our stay that we thought our positive experience would be helpful to finicky Americans and other travellers alike. Would recommend this hotel without hesitation.

<Content>No complaints at all Just returned from a three night stay at the Toren. Arrived at 10.30am. Our room was ready which was an unexpected bonus. We had a standard room which was small. No room for two people to pass between the end of the bed and the wall. However this is clearly shown on their website pictures so no complaints. The temperature was 28 degrees so the air conditioning was a blessing. The room had everything you could ask for, hairdryer, radio satellite tv and tea and coffee (some five star hotels could learn from this). The bathroom was excellent. Really good size with bath and shower overhead. The bathroom looked newly decorated. The location is perfect. Beautiful quiet area but only a ten minute walk from Centraal Station. Ideal for the trams. (We paid 13 euro each for a 72 hour tram pass which saved us loads) Lots of nice canalside bars and cafes close by. Housekeeping was efficient and friendly. Nice bar. Didnt have breakfast as it was 12 euro for a continental and the local cafe does a full breakfast for 8 euro. Service was good and it was easy to get a toasted sandwich in the bar at midnight. (Again a lesson for some fancier hotels) There is nothing about this hotel which wows you. It is simply a very nice, efficiently run establishment where everything works. We wont even bother looking anywhere else when we go to Amsterdam again

<Content>Excellent We had already stayed at the Canal House Hotel, just down from the Toren and knew what to expect. We were not disappointed. Our room (227) overlooked the Keisergracht canal and was clean, comfortable, with jacuzzi bath. The staff were very helpful and polite. The location is perfect for all the sights but quiet enough to be peaceful at night. I'd highly recommend this hotel

<Content>Loved it!! Hotel very clean, staff very friendly. I had a query about our booking and e-mailed prior to our stay, they e-mailed back straight away. Room was lovely, overlooking canal, so quiet on an evening. 5mins walk to anywhere you would want to go. Really enjoyed ourselves, breakfast was great too!

<Content>Fantastic!!!!!! ok, so this hotel is not enormous and the rooms are not big but this is normal for Amsterdam. (and accomodation is never cheap here). However, this hotel is FANTASTIC - full of charm and character. rooms are spotless and homely. the location is the best in this city - on a quiet canal street, very safe and peaceful yet only minutes on foot from the lively cafes and restuarants. I have stayed here 5 times now and last time took friends who have since returned on their own and stayed here again. I would always book this hotel as a first choice. The bar area is gorgeous and i have always found the staff to be superb. Tip - if you are returning to this hotel, email them directly for reservation enquiries instead of using their web site search and tell them you have been before and would like to come back. they always send a personal email back and offer me a 10% discount. Check out the pancake factory round the corner, a superb cafe with the most amazing choices of pancake.stay at Toren - you will love it!

<Content>Great hotel A great hotel. We had the deluxe room with a fantastic view over the canal. Don't expect big corporate hotel gloss but you can expect a spotless room, great service and friendly staff. It's a quiet spot ideally suited for the main sites, even on foot. Thoroughly recommended.

<Content>Quiet and comfortable haven We had booked another hotel in this area via a suggestion from a Dutch friend - which turned out to be a mistake as we were within earshot of the Westermark chiming bells, which ring every fifteen minutes all through the night. Following a disturbed night, we walked around the area and found the Hotel Toren. They showed us a very quiet room at the back of their annexe (room 404) which looked onto a little courtyard. The room was spacious, welcoming and comfortable. There is aircon. The bathroom was clean and well-equipped, the shower was very powerful and everything worked. We chose not to eat breakfast there as we thought 12euros per person was expensive - and there are two very good cafes which serve breakfast just around the corner. This hotel is in a marvellous area, within walking distance of everything but peaceful and atmospheric. There are many typically Dutch eating places close to hand, and it is a delightful area to walk around at night.

<Content>nice stay but pricey for what you get... We stayed here because our first choice of hotel, the canal house where we have had a very pleasent stay previously, was full. The toren is a beautiful converted canal house in a very convenient part of town. Walking distance from everywhere. We didnt get in a taxi or tram for our entire stay.We had a very friendly welcome and the staff were consistently friendly and informative. The communal areas were beautiful, especially the newly renovated bar and the breakfast very good.We had a canal view room (deluxe) The view was lovely but the room really was too pricey despite the view. The room was small (no swinging cats in here) and tired. The bathroom was ok.Wasnt fantastic but not bad either. Definately worth considering.

<Content>Ok Hotel This hotel had a very nice feel to it. Very attractive. But then you get to the rooms which are clean, but the room I stayed in had this weird spray in the bathroom that automatically sprayed every now and then. The smell was supposed to be nice, but it was not, and I was terribly allergic. The windows are cool, but I was eaten alive by mosquitoes! The bed was very comfortable and overall they were REALLY nice to us. We arrived very early, they were not full, so they let us check in early which was fabulous after flying all night from the USA. Overall good exp. But I could not wait to leave after 7 days due to the issues I mentioned. If you bring a mosquito deterring plug in you should be fine! They ordered dinner at local restaurants for us when we did not go out to eat, which was also very cool鈥攁 wide variety of good food in AMS.

<Content>very nice hotel I stayed here with my Mum and Sister on a short break. We loved the hotel, we had a triple bed room which over looked a garden at the rear, the garden was stunning, it was may and the laburnum trees were in full bloom, it was a lovely sight to wake up to each morning. The room was nice, clean, bright, the bathroom was ok. The location was excellent.The staff were nice, but didn't acknowledge you much. like another trip advisor has said, we also weren't acknowledged properly when checking in and checking out, they didn't seem grateful we'd chosen to stay at their hotel, or asked us if we enjoyed our stay. We thought the breakfast was excellent, so much choice. rather pricey though.Their own bar was relaxing in the evening. This overall is a good hotel to stay in.

<Content>Just okay...nothing more, nothing less. I have a few issues with an otherwise okay hotel.Upon arrival, I was not welcomed or even acknowledged. There were two other couples in the reservations office when I arrived. The reservations desk has been moved into the main office as the actual reservations office is being refurbished. After taking care of the other people and showing them their rooms, the receptionists came in and out of the office twice and not once did they say anything to me; not so much as an I'll be right with you. Granted, once they acknowledged my presence, they were polite enough, but it would have been nice to have been greeted. It wasn't a very auspicious start.I brought my 14 year old son with me on this trip. Upon being shown our room and being left alone, I noticed that the bed was a double and not twin beds. I went down to reception to ask for a twin room as I obviously was not going to sleep with my child. I was told You didn't specify a twin. I'm sorry but what grown woman sleeps in the same bed as her teenager? When making my reservations for the hotel online with a travel company, it stated that a room would be designated upon arrival. Granted my child is a tall teen but he's obviously just a teenager. I suppose I should have asked for a twin at the desk but I thought it would be a given.I was given a room in the hotel's annex which was not bad. (A side note: The young man who showed me to this room was warm, funny, and gracious...he added a better impression of the hotel than my first contact.) I was situated next to a small garden (even though it was snowy and cold, it was lovely). The room was neat and clean (a bit of black mildew on the bathroom tiles) and quiet.The hotel is in a wonderfully central location. Being located right on the canal is great. The Anne Frank Huis is just around the corner. There are numerous restaurants for when one gets hungry and lots too see within walking distance. Breakfast was 24 euro for myself and my son. While the food was good, it was standard European, not much to choose from, and a bit expensive. Basically, nothing worth 24 euro. When it came time to check out, the morning receptionist asked for my credit card, charged it, gave me my receipt which I signed, took it then turned back to the computer. There was no How was your stay? or Thank you. or Have a good day.I probably wouldn't stay here again simply because I wasn't acknowledged upon arrival and checking out was just as cold a procedure as checking in. It's not a great feeling to be disregarded.

<Content>Location great - hotel OK We stayed in the annexe just along from the main hotel. It was fine - clean and comfortable but definitely nothing special. The location on the other hand is fantastic - the nicest part of Amsterdam. Overall, OK but rather overpriced for what it is.

<Content>Nice Stay in Amsterdam Overall, Hotel Toren was a nice experience. The location is wonderful, and the staff was extremely nice and helpful. The hotel itself is small, as well as the rooms, and a bit musty because of its age. Our room was noisy; we could hear other guests of the hotel. However, the hotel was well kept and clean. I would recommend this hotel if they are running a good deal, but I feel we paid a little too much for this hotel.
