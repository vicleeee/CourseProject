<Content>Best deal in SF!!! Unbelievable value!!! This was my second stay here - I got the room for $50 a night on Expedia, and I couldn't have been happier. Great neighborhood - a short walk or bus/cab ride to TONS of restaurants, stores etc. FREE PARKING right off Lombard St. near the Chestnut St. shopping area, HUGE rooms, heating/cooling good, great shower pressure - all those little nuisances of budget hotels are nowhere to be found here. When I checked in, I realized the tv wasn't working, and went out for dinner and came back to a working set. I requested and got a king smoking room, desk staff was quite helpful, housekeepers were very nice, danish/croissants, coffee and oj are the breakfast - totally acceptable. This place is a winner!

<Content>Good location...I guess... I shouldn't too harsh a review, as when I reached San Fran I saw hotels and inns that looked a lot worse...but Buena Vista wasn't really anything to write home about.It's in the midst of being repainted, and after 15 mins the smell of paint was getting to me.I'm not a hotel snob, but the place was creepy, and I imagine it's a bit of a hangout for crack dealers. I didn't feel like my belongings were overly safe... - speaking of 'safe', there wasn't one in the room, sadly.Smoking in rooms. I wish this wasn't allowed. There were burns on the blankets and on some of the sheets. I didn't feel the bed was overly clean. (If I could have worn gloves the entire time I was in the hotel then I would have!)That said, it was a short walk to Fort Mason - great view of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate bridge...there's a Safeway down there too...and it was a short walk to the famous wonky street.By the way, when/if you check-in, they may tell you when their complimentary breakfast is seved. It's an OJ machine, some coffee, some dodgy looking fruit and a little muffin if you're lucky. Joy.

<Content>Four visitiors from UK found this well situated and good value Following a cruise we returned to spend three nights in San Francisco before returning home. Party of four we had two double rooms. The locality was excellent for getting round. The staff were very helpful. This hotel is not luxurious but is extremely good value. The rooms had been newly carpeted and were of a reasonable size. TV, coffee machine, hair dryer and and ironing facilites all available in room. The bathrooms were clean and again met all our needs. Having stayed in far more expensive accommodation who do not supply a free breakfast the fruit, coffee/orange and pastries were very welcome and freshly delivered. I would recommend as a good base at a sensible price, if you want luxury you have the choice of a host of centrally based hotels all of which will cost a great deal more than this friendly facility. If I have any negative comments it would be that the pillows could be a little more comfy. The hotel is situated on a very busy road so the front rooms can be a bit noisy but no more so than others in the area. The rooms were clearly marked no smoking and we had no unpleasant smells as reported by another visitor.

<Content>Stinky rooms The location of this hotel is the only thing i liked about the place. Firstly the room we had just reeked of cigarette smoke even after spraying half a can of deoderant around. Second the hotel is old and has been done up (if you could say that) very cheaply. Third the breakfast was okay but they ran out of coffee and some of the pastries were old. The guy at the front desk was friendly enough but didnt do any extra to make your stay easier he just wasnt that helpful and only did what he had to. If i was to come back to America and go back to San Francisco i would personally spend a bit more to stay at another hotel.

<Content>Needs some work We stayed here end of June beginning of July. Location is good, but the hotel needs some work. Despite all buildings meant to be smoke free the stairs stunk of smoke (not from the fires). No problems with bugs and we did stay in 2 different rooms, as we had gone to Yosemite for a few days as well. The staff were friendly, if not sometimes clueless (not knowing how to open the safety deposit box was classic as I was boiling hot (no Air con in the lobby)). Breakfast as previously commented was pastries but there Safeway and IHOP can be walked to. The first room there was a small amount of mould on the shower curtain and the vents were filthy. The second room had been repainted, but done in a hurry and there was paint on the curtains and the bathroom door looked like someone had tried to kick them open from the inside. Also part of a carpet was missing. Overall Okay for a motel, decent selection of TV channels for once in an American hotel but make sure you have a third floor room, away from the ice machine and away from the main road. At least our fire alarm did not go off at 3 am unlike some fellow travelers who stayed at the Hilton Fisherman's Wharf.

<Content>Buena Vista is good European 2 * hotel style! We stayed at the BV some years ago, and honestly forgot about it while getting caught up in the frenzy of trying to find a deal at a 4* SF hotel closer to the Embarcadero. Well, all was either sold out, OR wanting higher bids..when we remembered the BV! Still mostly the same, BUT now they have the continental bkfast!! OJ, coffee, croissants, muffins (sometimes), and other assorted pastries (NOT Paris quality!:) and apples/bananas! Rooms are basic, but perfectly suitable. We got a king bed, a/c, openable windows to the back (preferred, as Lombard St. is noisy and to the front) for the AAA rate of $125 +tax. We had forgotten that it was AAA and 10% disc. would apply, so the front desk guy went back in time:) and gave us the deal for both nights!! VERY helpful staff!! AND, computer access (free!) next to the breakfast area! AND, they'll let you print out your boarding pass thru their printer!! NO extra fees!! NOT luxury, but definitely NOT buggy!! IMPT. to me, having had a prob. in San Diego!!

<Content>I recommend the Buena Vista Motor Inn, great for sightseer's Difficult to know what to say, I must say I had read the reviews from earlier in the year before travelling, although they were written after I had booked 7 nights here, so I was a bit unsure as to what to expectWe knew it wasn't going to be 5 star accommodation, but our rooms were faultless. Cleaned everyday, great job by the maids. The breakfasts were rather basic, croissants and cold/hot drinks etc. Yes, the carpets and other furniture items are beginning to show there age, but not an issue. Only in the hotel to sleep!You might get to your room and be disappointed to find that you don't have any sort of view from your window, but that is a good thing. I slept with no problems during my stay, I did not hear any traffic noise whatsoever during the night except a fire truck or police car siren, which only happened onceThe reception staff were really helpful and friendly, no complaints thereGood location to get to Fisherman's Wharf (either on foot or by cable car. It's a 10 minute walk up the hill to get to the Cable Car, which can also take you Union Square. A large Safeways store is also a 5-10 minute walk awayIf you want somewhere good near to the hotel to have dinner, you must go to Cafe Lombard which is just a block or two up the street on the other side, they do mostly Italian dishes, but we went there twice! I can't comment on their breakfast menu sadlyI would definitely go back to this hotel

<Content>Totally ok I spent there 3 nights in the begining of May, nice hotel, just few block uphill to famous Lombard street, the same walking distance to Fisherman Wharf, rooms were cleaned, front staff very polite and helpful. Free access to computer in a lobby. Breakfast maybe not interesting (just donats and crossaints), but wake up coffee is there, and free covered parking can allowed to forget about breakfast.I'd come back again, good spot.

<Content>good value, great location The buena vista has mixed but consistent reviews. Firstly it is NOT the Marriott and no they do not do english breakfast. However this is a tidy convenient motel which you should use as a B and B. There is nothing else in the hotel except reasonably clean rooms. Breakfast is included but consists of croissant, other pastries. orange juice,tea and coffee. That's it, so dont ask for more. If you are hungry turn right out of hotel go up hill 300 yards and cross over to the cafe (that's what my son did) In reception there is a pc where u can access the web freeThe location is everything=I was on crutches at time but could still walk to Ghiradelli square, and the busy Polk street. I also got up the hill to see crooked street (very near by if you survive the hill) Please note that you cannot walk to Union Square from the hotel nor China Town even if you are Seb Coe. Once you get to Ghiradelli of course the Wharf is quite close. There was a fair bit of tourist crap here but we loved itDo's=Definitely Al Catraz, repeat definitely. On crutches so we also did a bus tour and this stopped at the Gate and Twin Peaks, hippyville and many others. Twin Peaks was obscured by fog which is a feature of this city, sunshine one minute then fog, maybe some rain,then sunshine again. Do a bus tour if you are short on time. Go to the Wharf and try the seafood, see the seals etc, its all pretty walkable. The chocolate at Ghiradelli is amazingDonts - very few, except the new yorkers told us the shopping in SF was average (well they would of course) but our girls (all 17) loved SF, its a wonderful city full of contrast and fun. One tip- if you want to ride the cable car dont do it at peak times - we queued for about 1 hour to get on at Ghiradelli and we didnt see much on way to Powell street, but its worth it especially if you can hang off side, otherwise you see zip. Second tip- if you are going out in evening in March/April take a light jumper or you WILL regret it. Third tip- try Polk street for reasonably priced food which will not break your wallet. Finally try the Buena Vista and remember what you are paying for - in our case $400 for 6 people with breakfast for 2 nights Enjoy

<Content>Location Good The hotel lobby needs a major cleaning and fix-up. Booked a great rate through Expedia and had no problems. The rooms are older but clean. There were some ants in the room. The location was great.

<Content>Bed Bugs and Ants The ants didn't bother me. It was the bed bugs I detested.Before staying at the Buena Vista I didn't know what a bed bug looked. But the spots on my arms that looked like flea bites kept appearing after I got home. So I googled them.Yep, sure enough! Up popped a photo of the same type of bug that I had killed after I found it crawling on my husband's pillow while we were staying at the Buena Vista this January 2008!I ordered some all natural bed bug powder to dust all over my house. Even my kids are showing up with the spots.When I called the hotel after I got home to tell them about it they said they would block off that room. But when I called a day or two later there was someone in that room. It doesn't matter if they block off and treat one room. They've got to do the entire premises.

<Content>good location this is not a bad place to stay,but it's not great either. located on lombard street,it's a good place for getting around from.rooms are a good size,ours was clean but a little dated and we had no problems with noise from the street and you can't fault it for value.however do not expect a warm welcome or a hearty breakfast,you will be dissapointed.the 'breakfast 'was a dry old roll and coffee out of a vending machine in a small area next to the check in desk,we did'nt bother at all the next day.you need to check that you have been charged the rate you agreed if you pre book as we were overcharged by $10 per room per night. i was told they would credit my account later that day.it did'nt happen so after no response to my 1st e-mail i sent another. my reply was 2 statements showing that they had now dealt with it,nothing else,no apology,thanks or anything else that would have shown a bit of courtesy.to sum up it's a good value and well located hotel to crash,just don't expect much in the way of service.

<Content>Good value for money We flew to San Francisco from London for Christmas to stay with my parents in Sacramento. This time we were flying with an 11 month old infant. Rather than drive straight through after a 10 hour flight, we decided to relax in San Francisco. I chose this hotel due to it's location to the Wharf, the free parking and the price. Considering this hotel is in a good location and there's free parking, it is great value for money. The staff were very friendly and the room was very clean. The only downside was that our room was right on the Lombard Street side. However, the curtains muffled the traffic noise pretty well and we were extremely jet lagged, i could have slept through anything. I would recommend this place for a quick stop over in SF. It is very convenient!

<Content>Fantastic! Wow. I'm from Singapore and I was absolutely impressed with the place! There's free breakfast with muffins and bread which were pretty delicious coupled with the orange juice. Parking wasn't a problem, plenty of space. Close proximity to the Colt Tower and Fisherman's Wharf which makes it even more attractive. I recommend staying in this inn if you have a car and if you have a budget. =)

<Content>Love this place! Wasn't expecting this to be good as it was cheap for San Fran, but it's a little gem! Short walk to bus stop that takes to you everywhere. Just around the corner from some fab reastaurants and little bars, so no need to go into town.Felt very safe round here.Hotel is basic, but big, quiet, clean rooms. Some are smoking rooms, but couldn't smell stale smoke. Big bonus - 15 minutes free internet access in the hotel lobby! Reception staff very helpful - its all good!

<Content>Affordable, clean and well located The Lombard St. section of Highway 101 through the Marina/Cow Hollow neighborhoods of San Francisco is a goldmine of bargain accomodations. There are a number of reasonably refurbished motels along the strip which offer to make a stay in San Francisco much more affordable than the Nob Hill/Union Square hotels.The Buena Vista is a great example. Only two blocks from Van Ness, and therefore close to Fishermens Wharf and the cable cars, it's a good base for touring San Francisco. Having free parking under the building is a plus (the Comfort Inn up the street charges $26/night for parking). The rooms are large and clean. While the rooms facing Lombard have some street noise, the windows keep out most of the sound and many are bay windows. Housekeeping is attentive and thorough.Away from Lombard, the neighborhood is residential. Union Street, two blocks south is full of shops and neighborhood cafes. Chestnut Street, a block north has become more dominated by upscale chains. But walking in any direction is a great stroll through neighborhood San Francisco.

<Content>A nice change. My girfriend and I stayed the 2 previous nights at the Greenwich Inn. This place was much nicer and more comfortable. We wished we had stayed here instead.Pros: - big room- big bed- padded carpet floor (a treat for tired feet after days of walking)- very clean- decent price with RoomSaver coupon.- our room had a big bay window with big lounging pillow.Cons:- traffic noise pretty constant.- parking is tight if you don't get there before everyone else. I barely managed to wedge my car into one of the remaining spots.

<Content>Value for money The Buena Vista hotel is an inexpensive option for people who want to see the sights of San Fran on a budget. Located 10min walk to Fishermans Wharf , cable car stop, and a few block (all be it stright up hill) to the crocked section of Lombard St. Although the hotel decor is mid-80's in appearence, it's clean and smells fresh. They offer a standard continental breakfast which is a take or leave option. I recommed the cycle from Fishermans Wharf over the Golden Gate to Sausillito or round to Tiburon if you're game.

<Content>Ok, but dated Motel. Stayed here for 3 nights in September, and booked direct with the hotel for a reasonable rate. The room was large with a large bathroom, but had quite dated decor and fittings, although it was clean. The front of the Motel is on a busy road (Lombard St) which was quite noisy from early in the morning until late at night, so try to book a room at the back of the hotel.The location was a 10 minute walk from the bay area where there are many restaurants, although the area around the pier 39 is a bit tacky. It was more difficult to get to the city centre (without a car) so we ended up in taxi's (about $20). Overall an OK Motel, but I would stay somewhere else if we ever went back to San Francisco.

<Content>Great location, large room The room was large and clean, although the hotel looked as though it had not been decorated too recently (paint coming off a little on bathroom door, etc.). There was a wet towel on the bathroom floor when we arrived, but the room was cleaned thoroughly while we were there. Parking was in an underground garage below the hotel, with a lift/elevator straight up to the rooms. There was a snack vending machine in the corridor and a drinks one on another floor. Breakfast was served in the lobby (rolls, fruit and orange juice) and there were only a few seats so we either had to wait for a seat or take the breakfast up to our room. Free Internet access is available in the lobby. The hotel is within walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf. The location was also handy for other sights within a short driving distance (Golden Gate Bridge, Golden Gate Park, Twin Peaks). Downtown is a bit of a walk but there are things to do and see on the way (allow a few hours). Of course, it's also possible to get a cable car from Fisherman's Wharf. For places to eat in the evening, the Union Street shops are a 5-minute walk.

<Content>Not a great place to stay This place is falling apart...was once a nice little place to stay but not now. Lobby was shabby and dirty, room was not better...there was mold in the tub, no movies here to buy on cable, iron in room was broke....etc. For the $160 they charged per night ( with a AAA card), I would not go back...there is a very nice small, totally remodeled motel two blocks down that we should have stayed at for the same price and most definitly will next time...It is called Hotel Del Sol...check it out, thehoteldelsol.com....much, much better for the $$$$.

<Content>Good location, big room Chose this place because of the Trip Advisor reviews after my first choice The Greenwich Inn was either full or just un co-operative, it was very difficult to tell as the staff were so indifferent. However the BVMI was much better, staff were friendly and we managed to strike a deal on a room price ($11 Sat, $104 Sun and $64 Mon with a coupon from the Roomsaver Guide). Motel鈥檚 most attractive point for us was the free parking underneath of which there was probably just enough, it was a bit tight down there though! Room was really big with a king size bed that was comfortable and what looked like a new carpet. Coffee makers and ironing boards means the rooms are well spec鈥檇 but no safe if you feel you need one. Our room was a bit gloomy, partly due to poor lighting, but also because the only window looked out onto a narrow passageway between buildings. Although other rooms that I spied whilst the cleaners were in looked brighter! Lovely orange juice and pretty good selection of doughnuts and muffins for breakfast (included in the price but no coffee in the lobby). I did feel that the hotel smelt a little strange in the lobby and some of the corridors though. Public areas 鈥?stairs and corridors also suffered a bit from gloominess and would probably benefit from a lick of paint. Having said al that, it was a very walkable (about 10 mins) distance from Fisherman鈥檚 Wharf area and one of the Cable Car turnarounds, so you could get pretty much everywhere really easily. A bit further up the road is a Travelodge which also looked really nice. 6/10

<Content>Great hotel for the price Read on a SF forum that this is one of the best low priced hotels in the city so stopped to check it out. Very satisfied with spacious room. Friendly staff, clean, free internet, coffee maker, hairdryer, iron, free parking and good location make this hotel a good find! The room was facing Lombard St. but as a first timer to SF enjoyed people watching and didn't mind any extra noice from the street.

<Content>Great for the price Stayed for 3 nights in April. Arrived late but had no problems at all. Parking was fine - always got a space. Great location for Fishermans Wharf etc and easy to return from downtown via cable car then a short walk downhill. Breakfast was ok to get you started. Stayed at the back and didn't hear any noise. Would stay there again.

<Content>Buena bono Stayed on a sun  mon for $74/night - good location (near Lombard  Van Ness), walkable distance to the wharf - pier 39. Trolley is not to far. Rooms are big, a little old, bathroom was clean, tub could be in better condition. We had a room away from the traffic which was quiet. Breakfast was ok - danish, croissants, apple, banana, and OJ. Free internet access. Best part, free parking, did not have a problem finding a spot. Book early to Alcatraz or it may sell out. For us, sold out monday morning by 10:00 am.

<Content>Great location! Great location! The rooms were very nice and cozy. I would have preferred to have a room on the street vs. one in the back of the hotel looking at a brick wall. The parking was great and best of all it was free which is rare for San Francisco. The hotel staff was very courteous and friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel for those that are on a budget.

<Content>Good place to stay Date: October 15-20Reviewer: Wellington, New ZealandWe stayed here for 5 nights. Very handy to Fisherman's Wharf (20min walk). Room spacious and clean. We had a room at the back, which was very quiet. Bus route close by. Also, laudromat just round the corner. Not that many restaurants near by, but as we had a 4 day bus pass, we just got on and off buses as we pleased. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>good little Motel for the price I stayed at the Buena Vista for 5 days following a cruise. I called the motel directly and asked for a better rate than was offered on the internet and was given a few dollars off each night. Better than nothing! The room was average, but for the price I paid I did not expect anything more. There was some problem with a breakfast shortage, ie: nothing left one morning, and the offerings were coffee and donuts / muffins so we didn't miss much. One morning we found out why the breakfast was going short of food. Some people were taking 4 or 5 donuts instead of considering that there may be someone else who would like a little bite to eat in the morning. The motel is in Cow Hollow, and about 2 blocks away is a great street to walk (uphill) for dinner. Ask the desk clerk and they will give you suggestions where to eat within walking distance. My husband and I walked to Fisherman's Wharf every day, a good walk not overly hilly. Our room was beside the elevator but we did not hear any noise coming into our room. The most bothersome noise was from the street but we just turned on our a.c. to fan only and that drowned out the street noise. There is a nice little sunroom on the top floor but it is very hot if the sun is out, so much that we could not sit there. All in all, if you are looking for a good little hotel in an expensive city, try this one.

<Content>Superb Location!!! A couple of weeks ago, we stayed at this hotel with friends. The rooms are clean and spacyous. The rooms include high speed internet access if you have a laptop. But if you don't have a laptop, the hotel allows free use of internet access in the lobby for 15 minutes. Fisherman's Wharf is just 15 minutes walking distance away. Public transits are conveniently acessible from this hotel if you don't have access to a car. I will stay her again my next trip.

<Content>OK and cheap for San Francisco We were looking for a cheaper hotel in the marina district and not looking for anything more than a clean place to sleep at night. This hotel was ok - older, but for the price you can't really complain. Free Internet in your hotel room is a plus.

<Content>OK for the price We chose this hotel mostly because of it鈥檚 free parking garage. I was really not willing to pay 10 $ per day just for a parking space and that eliminated most of the hotels in the city. The pictures of the hotels homepage seemed ok and the area was not to far from city center. The hotel staff was friendly and the room seemed to be clean, we had nothing to complain. The breakfast though is a joke, as it consists of a basket full of muffins and Danish in the lobby with some orange juice. But it鈥檚 OK as a pre-breakfast-snack ;o) Nowadays you shouldn鈥檛 expect much of a hotel-breakfast, anyway. All in all we were content with our stay and thank to our AAA membership we had a pretty good price (compared to other SFO hotels) of 74,- USD plus 10,- USD tax. The hotel is nothing special but good for budget-travelers and I would go there again, and if it鈥檚 just for the free parking!

<Content>Great Budget Accommodation If you want a small budget sized no frills hotel that offers a resonable level of service then this is for you. The rooms were large and the housekeeping very good. The front desk service was always helpful and friendly with good advice. Traffic noise was not as bad as expected and nor was the beds. Only minus was the continental breakfast American style which differed somewhat from what we experienced in other countries. Too sweet for our taste.Overall a great experience and well located although being closer to eateries would have been appreciated. Can recommend the Liquor Store accross the road. Their staff were great!

<Content>Great Hotel! I came to San Francisco for a trade show in town, and stayed at Buena Vista Motor Inn for a few nights. This hotel is a interior Corridor hotel with indoor parking garage. The staff is courtieous and friendly. The room price was affordable for me with free parking. Rooms are spacious and clean with comfortable bed. The room was equipped with AC and heating and high speed internet access which was free. However, I did not get to enjoy this because I did not have my laptop. But I did get to use the internet in the lobby which was free for 15 minutes. It was not noisy at all because I had a room that was away from all the traffic. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to San Francisco.

<Content>Neglected and dirty Just stayed at this hotel. The website portrayed a nice clean room and these are not! Mold in the shower, old shower curtains, ragged towels, old blankets with cigarette burns, old furniture, torn up carpet. Our room was noisy as it was across from the ice maker. The garage was nice. The employees were nice but definetly NOT worth $100 a night!! This hotel needs a good cleaning and updating.

<Content>Got sent down the street! We planned to stay there for 2 nights with our kids. Got there are noon to check in and the lady at the desk told us that check in was not until 3:00. After asking if we could leave our bags behind the counter she hesitated at first but then agreed. The parking garage was 2 flights down and we did not want to drag them down again.We came back at 3:30 to check in and was greeted by a different person. He told us that they had overbooked and that we would have to move to the Star Motel 3 blocks down. He said it was a similar hotel and the cost would be the same. The manager was not available to talk to.Since we had pre-bought tickets at Alcatraz for 4:40 we had not time to complain and as it was we almost missed the ferry.The room was not the same as the Buena Vista because the exterior doors were leading to outdoors and they charged us at a higher rate as to what we were getting at the Buena Vista.Based on our experience, The Buena Vista Motor Inn does not value their customers and I would advise booking else where.

<Content>Good and clean hotel This is a very good and clean hotel. The bed are queen beds, not double beds like other 3 stars hotel. The breakfast is just little but enough for breakfast. Be carefull when you request a refrigerator, they charge $10 per night. That is over price.

<Content>A Gem Hotel My wife and I came to San Francisco for business purposes. I have stayed at many hotels in San Francisco within Lombard Street, and this is by far the best hotel I have stayed at. When I checked in, I was greeted by a warm, welcoming, friendly clerk. Rooms were nice, clean and comfortable. Parking is free and inside a garage with surveillence for security. You can actually leave your car in the garage and go to Fisherman's Wharf, which is walking distance from Buena Vista Motor Inn. There are many restaurants nearby if you don't want to walk too far. Since I was in town for business, the FREE HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS in room was very Helpful. This hotel has some of the features of a top elite hotel at a reasonably and affordable price. I was able to invite over business friends to conduct business on the rooftop sundeck of the hotel in private! If you are a business person and coming to San Francisco, staying at this hotel is a great investment for you because it has all the amenities a business person needs to conduct business. So if you are considering staying in San Francisco, I really recommend Buena Vista Motor Inn!

<Content>Unless you're paying the SAVER rate it's not worth it We stayed at the Buena Vista Motor Inn for 8 days and if we were not paying the discounted rate I would have felt ripped off. I believe it is barely worth the discounted rate. There are numerous nicer motels or motor inns on the same street that it would be worth it to pay the extra money. The plus about the hotel is that it is in a good location and close to public transportation. It does have free parking, but so do most motor inns nearby.The hotel just had a feeling of neglect. Bedding- Cigarette holes in the bedspread, holes in the sheets and were not changed. Towels- Threadbare and old, Drapes- Filthy and holes. The continental breakfast one morning conisted of a banana in a bowl and a rock hard muffin. When I go back to San Francisco I would stay in the same area, but would definitely not stay at the Buena Vista Motor Inn.

<Content>Not bad for the price Rooms at front overlooking the street are airy and light but fairly noisy (shut the window and put the A/C on to drown the noise out). Rooms at the rear are much quieter but with less windows, they are slightly dismal. The rooms are adequately sized and all the light and shower fittings were in working order. The bright, clean bathroom was fully equipped including hairdryer. Linen and carpets were clean but our non-smoking room smelled of stale smoke despite the best efforts of the maid with the air-freshener. Reception staff were friendly, efficient  helpful although a little neurotic about you parking EXACTLY between the lines in the cramped carpark. But then again, the carpark was a big bonus in San Francisco. Free Internet in reception.

<Author>Remote Traveler
<Content>Good basic lodging I wanted a place in San Francisco that would be easily accessible to touristy locations without being in the middle of the touristy areas. The Buena Vista provided good, safe and basic lodging at a reasonable price. There was parking for my car...there weren't enough spaces to go around, but they had me double-park in the garage and leave my keys with them so they could move my car if needed. They had high speed internet access. The room was clean and, as a single female traveler, I felt perfectly safe. I was on a smoking floor and although my room didn't smell like cigarettes, the hallway did (partly because the door was always propped open onto the rooftop deck on this floor where people would go outside to smoke). Due to the traffic on Lombard, I did need earplugs to sleep (even though I was in a room on the side of the building), but the only noise I heard from other guests was water running through the pipes when they were in the shower. The hotel is also easily within walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf. This hotel will save you money (especially if you have a car) and will get you away from the throngs of tourists in the more touristy areas.

<Content>Returned for the second year running Started out a 3 week touring holiday of California at the Buena Vista. We stayed here last year and thought it was excellent value for money and a good location. Bonus is the free car park, although it can be cramped at times they make sure everyone can get in. The staff on reception are very helpful and friendly. If you are looking for a small, good value, clean, friendly hotel, close to all the major attractions this one comes recommended.

<Content>Great Location  The Buena Vista could use some updates, it is slightly outdated and could be described as dingy by some, but for the price it was great. The location is very central to everything and to save on parking made the Buena Vista a very desirable place to stay. If you are planning on seeing and experiencing the city, and would like to use the extra money on something that has nothing to do with a hotel room, the Buena Vista is for you. If you are looking to be catered in an modern hotel, then look elsewhere. The in room DSL and contintental breakfast were nice touches as well.If you enjoy to walk or jog this hotel was great. It was 1/4 mile from the Marina and you did not have to climb any large hills to get there.

<Content>Never Again..... We stayed here for 3 nights and it was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. I was looking to save some money.....and you do get what you pay for. For approx. $99- you get FREE parking and that's about it. The lobby is extremely worn and dirty looking. It had a stale musky smell and the carpets were in dire need of vacuuming/cleaning.The room itself was a relative dive. The wallpaper around the window was torn back all the way around the window and all the mold was exposed. Black nasty mold that made you keep the curtains closed. There was no lock on the window nor was there a screen. View on the odd numbered rooms is the side of building next door...about 8' away. The bedspread had at least 30 cigarette burns on it (at last count) and it was a non-smoking room. Just overall disgusting for my tastes. Next time I will spend a little more money for a better room. The staff were very courteous and pleasant. I don't think its their fault the owners run such a dirty establishment. On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being excellent) this would rate a negative -5 IMO. But that's just it..........my opinion.

<Content>Loved it!! We stayed at Buena Vista Motor Inn for two nights in June and again in July, at the beginning and end of a round trip in California. And we were more than satisfied. Our room was great, clean and comfortable and the staff - Ken and Bernard in particular - was more than helpful and friendly. It is about 20 minutes walk from the central part of Fisherman's Wharf, cable cars, Alcatraz ferry etc. Sure, the parking lot is small, but it is free and according to the staff they will always be able to fit in a car per room even if it means double parking and leaving the keys at the front desk for them to move the car if necessary.There is a coffee maker in the room to keep you going until breakfast. The breakfast - muffins, pastry, fruit and juice - they serve at this hotel is neither better nor worse than so many other continental breakfasts at motels in California (according to our three weeks of experience). And up the road on the left side of the street is a great place for a freshly cooked breakfast, the Lombard Cafe. And going left maybe six blocks down the street from the hotel is Mel's Diner, a typical American diner with typical diner fare - and the best milk shakes we tasted in California.Buena Vista Motor Inn is highly recommended - we loved our stay there!

<Content>Great place, Great location! Stayed at his hotel for the 4th of July weekend with my family and everything was great.The room was as we had requested it, it was very clean with good furniture, it had a fridge for beverages and snacks.We made coffee in the room and bought some breakfast items in the deli near by. In the lobby there was lots of juice and some pastries early in the morning and a computer to check email if needed to. The parking garage was a good help since that is expensive in big cities.The staff was helpful and friendly, (Thanks Ped and J for all your help, keep the good work)The location was excelent, very short drive from everything and just 3 blocks from Union St. with restaurants galore, strongly recomend the Restaurant Luisa`s, small italian, very charming and great food.As a Hotel Manager myself I really recomend this place. If you are planning a family get away siteseeing trip on a budget and you want to explore local restaurants and visit the city atractions, this is the perfect place. Their rates are great.

<Content>mattress was very hard We stayed one night. The only problem that we really had was the mattress. We don't like hard mattresses so we had a hard time sleeping! The desk clerk was very nice. The parking was free. We had high speed internet access in our room and we were able to walk to Fisherman's Wharf.

<Content>Good value for $75/night We stayed two night May 3-4/05. Parking is OK for a small car and free. The staff were all more than helpful and very friendly. Our room was on the 3 rd floor rear and was quite large and quiet. We were able to walk to the Wharf area with no problems. The hotel is clean and the mustiness of the previous reviewer was not detectable by us. The breakfast was coffee, muffins and fresh fruit. A very good value for the money.

<Content>Disappointing We chose this hotel after reading good reviews and were extremely disappointed. This was by far the worst accommodation in our entire trip.Upon entering the inn it smelt stale and looked very tired and dated. Things didn't improve upon entering our small family suite with strips of wallpaper hanging off the wall and a very musty odour. The floors and couch looked as if they had not been cleaned in a long, long time. One of the beds pulled down into the living area, which made it somewhat difficult. The room was also very noisy being on the corner of two busy streets.The complimentary breakfast was a joke. We managed to actually get something to eat and drink only once in a 4-night stay and with 2 children this was frustrating. Breakfast was from 7-10, however, by 8.15 there was nothing left and depleted supplies were not replenished. Having to go elsewhere for breakfast was an added expense. I would rather pay a higher rate for clean, quiet, comfortable accommodation. The only thing the Buena Vista Motor Inn had going for it was courteous staff.

<Content>Has its minuses! This motel has a free garage which is reasonably large.The rooms are relatively clean. People who worked there were on the friendly side. Unfortunately, the beds are very uncomfortable. They claim that there is breakfast, but there is no breakfast except for a box of sweets that is left out there for the whole week. This is all I can say about this place.

<Content>A Perfect Hotel for under $80.00 This was one of the best budget hotels that I have ever stayed in. It has many more pluses than minuses. Still, I will list both so you can make an informed decision.PLUSES:1) Under $80 (At least it was in March, 2005)2) FREE Parking (Almost all of the hotels in S.F. charge $20-$30 a night)3) FREE Internet (Almost all of the hotels in S.F. charge around $8 a night)4) The housekeeping is great. 5.) The interior conditions of the hotel are good. No cracks in the walls..stains..etc. All looks relatively new or at least relatively repaired.6.) The staff is very friendly. MINUSES1) The closest public transportation is 2 blocks away. 2) It is located within walking distance to a couple of attractions, however, walking distance is quite large, usually 1.5 - 3 miles. To get to the downtown, Union Sq area, it takes about 15, 20 min on the bus. Transportation in S.F. is great by the way.3) Continental Breakfast includes sweets and bananas only. 4) There is no laundry in the hotel. Although there are drycleaners a block away. Overall, the hotel has given me a very positeve experience and I would definately stay here again. This is why I give it an Excellent raiting.

<Content>Good Price, Good Location, Good Hotel This was our first trip to San Francisco and we chose this hotel based on the reviews from TripAdvisor. We were not disappointed. If you want lots of extras, this isn't the place for you, but it is a very basic hotel with everything you'd expect. The free parking was a huge bonus. It's within easy walking distance of Pier 39 and all the other Piers and attractions that are on the way to it (Hyde St. Pier, Giradelli Square). It is also a doable walk to North Beach (don't miss this neighborhood), if you don't mind walking up a few monstrous hills, we did it.The breakfast in the morning was nothing to brag about, just some fruit (either apples or bananas) and then some pastries. The rooms all have coffee makers in them.All in all considering the price, location, and free parking, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, especially if they don't need a 5 star hotel to feel comfortable. You won't be disappointed.

<Content>Very convenient We always stay here when we visit SF; very convenient to walk to many attractions/city transportation, plus the indoor free parking is great. However, leave your big pick-up or SUV at home because the parking is VERY cramped to say the least. Very nice, but small, rooms that are beginning to show a little age in the furnishings and fixtures. The last time we were there though the elevator had a terrible smell in it and the roof leaked at night in the hall and a light fixture crashed to the floor. Very quiet, in fact, one of the quietest places we've ever stayed in--you can't hear any noise from the halls, other bathrooms, etc. But if you stay on the Lombard Avenue side, you may hear traffic noise. A great little breakfast place up Lombard to the left, Lombardy Cafe. And a nice deli a block behind is the Fort Mason Deli. 70+ TV channels. Great rates during the week, and Bernard at the front desk is very helpful and personable. For the price/convenience/free parking in a VERY expensive city like SF, the Buena Vista can't be beat.

<Content>Best hotel ever! Loved this hotel! Came from Miami, and spent three nights; and all three nights were fantastic. I was greeted fabulously by the warm and welcoming and charming tall fellow behind the desk. Indoors corridor and the room was clean and comfortable. A little breakfast in the morning, and free parking. I come to San Francisco often and stayed at many hotels. But this hotel is by far the best I have ever stayed at. If you ever come to San Francisco, stay at the Buena Vista Motor Inn!

<Content>We were NOT disappointed!!! We spent 3 nights here in September and we would stay here again. Booking in an unfamiliar city is tricky, but we were quite pleased with the hotel. It is clean and comfortable with a friendly, helpful staff. It is an older hotel and the rooms are a little smaller, but it has recently been remodeled. It is within walking distance to the Wharf and other locations and is a safe neighborhood. The covered parking is free, a little tight on space, but it saves $20-$25 a day, which is what other hotels charge. The top floor of the hotel has a small sitting area with a beautiful view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Mel's Diner about 6 blocks down the street was a fun place to eat. There is a small continental breakfast each morning....don't wait too late to eat, it goes fast....fruit and muffins. For the price it was wonderful, and believe me, I checked them all. Had it not been for the other positive, informative reviews I would not have stayed here. You won't be sorry. If you are looking for entertainment, I suggest you see Steve Silver's Beach Blanket Babylon at Club Fugazi. It was fantastic! Be sure to visit Alcatraz, but book way in advance.

<Content>Previous reports were exactly right for the Buena Vista.... Although this property was not fancy, it was clean, well located for walking to different places, and the desk staff was very accomodating. Free parking was another big plus. Small free breakfast served in lobby each morning (rolls, muffins  fruit). In room coffee. All in all I felt the Buena Vista was a great choice and value.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel; Perfect location If you're looking for fancy, this is not the place but if you want a reasonably priced room convenient to Fisherman's Wharf, this is the place. The room was small but clean. The front desk staff were wonderful. They answered all our questions with a smile. Fisherman's Wharf is within walking distance. There's a Mel's Diner (remember American Graffiti) down the street about 6 blocks. The most we spent on cab fare to get around the city was about $12 dollars. This is a great location and a very clean, friendly motel. I will stay there whenever I am in San Francisco.

<Content>Superb Fantastic hotel, location, service, cleanliness. Highly recommended. So central and easy to access points of interest. Free parking a big plus. Get down early for the continental breakfast or there won't be any!
