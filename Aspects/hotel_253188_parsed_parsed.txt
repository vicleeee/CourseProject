<Content>Biohazard 25 STRAIGHT UP THIS WAS THE WORST HOTEL EVER!!!!I had a minor back injury which led to me arriving at the hotel a tiny bit late. She had already givin our room to another customer which then left us roomless. We were then told we could go to the spare room which is located in the basement. This room is known as room 25. I do not suggest taking this spare room because it smells so foul that you would think someone was murdered and left for death in there. Not to mention we could hear the mice crawling in the walls. It is also 50 degrees Celsus in tehre because of a heater that runs the building. It is so musky in there it releases a very distrubing smell that will follow you and your luggage for the rest of your trip. Also when we were outside smoking we notcied 3 dead rats. NOT MICE PEOPLE, RATS.I would not suggest this even to your worst enemy. This place should be shut down or condemned

<Content>A Dump - Stay far Away I stayed here for one night at the end of October 2008 with my family and it is an experience never to be repeated. The hotel is in an advanced state of disrepair and is not clean. The carpet in the communal areas is very poorly fitted and given how steep and narrow the stairs are (there is no elevator) I would not be surprised if there is an accident. The rooms are even worse. Curtains are torn and dirty, the tiles in the bathroom are coming out of the wall, the sanitaryware is very old, chipped and stained and sheets and towels are threadbare. My sister in law asked to borrow a hairdryer - there is only one at reception and someone else was using it - so she had to do without. One hairdryer for an entire hotel!! The breakfast is disgusting and they do not tell you that you it is not included in the price until you have exited the equally dialpidated bar area where they serve it and at Euro 7, 50 you are being ripped off for your further displeasure. I posted a review on Venere which is the website I booked it on and I ahve yet to see it posted. It causes me to wonder if this agent is filtering reviews because when we booked with Venere there were very few review and no recent or negative ones. I should have been suspicious! This hotel has serious heath and safety issues and should not be operating.

<Content>A Gloomy Prospect The hotel lies in a quiet street close to Rembrandtplein square and 10 minutes' walk from the Red Light District. Do be aware as previous reviews have highlighted that there is no passenger lift. The staircase is both steep and winding and it would be all too easy to trip over especially when carrying luggage all the way up to the fifth floor.As for the accommodation itself the hotel has seen better days. Evidence of neglect is all around including peeling wallpaper, worn carpet and exposed wiring in a wall socket. More worrying however were the insecticide cartridges placed at intervals around the floor of the carpet in my room on the third floor. Upon arrival the temperature in my room was stifling. Nor was it possible to open a window since the windows themselves had been almost completely boarded up. There was a noisy portable air-conditioner unit, but this was a poor substitute for natural light and fresh air. As a result I had to leave the unit running throughout my stay and the use of artificial light in the daytime made for a gloomy and depressing stay. The advertised facilites of a room safe and tea/ coffee tray were not provided. When I took this up with the lady at reception I was told that some rooms were without heating - as if I should actually be grateful!On a more positive note the bathroom was modern and spotlessly clean with ample hot water at a good pressure.Breakfast ( an additional 7.50 euros per day ) is a self-service buffet in the ornate dining room complete with chandelier and staircase leading to a circular balcony. The hot food selections consisted of scrambled egg, cocktail-sized sausages and curled-up bacon. There were also slices of Dutch cheese available, but the tiny flies I could see hovering beneath the glass dome were sufficient deterrent..The daytime receptionist was pleasant enough and dealt with my queries, but as a guest you were not really made to feel welcome here. Also you will be asked to pay an additional City tax which will come as an unwelcome surprise on departure. It will make no difference arguing that your paperwork (in particular Expedia) makes no specific mention of this charge as you will still be expected to pay up.All in all I simply cannot recommend this hotel to anyone. Judging from previous reviews the owners have had more than enough time to deal with essential issues of health, cleanliness and hygiene which crop up on this site time and again. Do yourself a favour, spend a bit more and make yourself comfortable elsewhere.

<Content>Not great Good and bad points -Good - 5 minutes walk away from Red Light District and Dam Square. Bad - There is no lift, we stayed in Room 19 which was at the very top of the hotel, which is about 8 flights of stairs up. It was an absolute disaster trying to get up and down them, especially with luggage. Carpet in hotel not the cleanest, they sting you for city tax and credit card charges so be prepared and there is a church at the top of the street which bell rings constantly. Its very annoying. Advice - only go here if you are well and able to walk up stairs!!

<Content>A great place to stay The hotel was situated on a lovely little street that was close enough to all the hussle an bustle but far enough away so that it was quiet and felt safe at night, dam square was only a 10 minute walk away and central station was 20minutes on foot.The rooms were dated in there decor, but were very clean although small they had eveything to offer. I would definatley recommend and stay there again, we had clean towels everyday and the rooms were cleaned daily. The staff that worked there were very friendly and helpful the reception was open 24 - 7 so it didnt matter what time you came an went .

<Content>Not a bad place at all! The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The hostel was really well located, a short walk to the red light district but far enough away to be out of the chaos and to feel a lot safer. It's on Groenburgwal which is not on Rembrandtplein but is quite nearby. We got a bit confused on the way there as there's another hostel called Rembrandt Square (Plein means square in Dutch). Groenburgwal is on a canal and is quite a pretty little street. The area is quite quiet at nighttime but there's no shortage of coffeeshops and the hostel has an all night bar if you need it. The room we had was very dark and the mirrors were tinted brown for some reason - if you wear make-up that might be a bit of an issue. The others in our group got a room on one of the higher floors and it was much airier and brighter but they did have to hike up a lot of stairs. The shower wasn't bad at all, good pressure and plenty of hot water. All in all I think we did pretty well with this place. If you are a very picky person this might not be the place for you, this place is not perfect - but you will pay a lot more to find somewhere that is. It was clean, safe and the beds were comfortable. Certainly not a luxurious place but for the price (in Amsterdam) I think we got a very good deal. Other places had so many horror stories I was quite worried about staying anywhere but I don't think you'll come to much harm staying here! Just a warning, be prepared for very steep stairs. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>One of the worst. Read the reviews on this hotel before booking and as there was a mixed bag, thought I'd give it a try. However my friend and I asked to leave after the first night it was that bad. Ant powder on the floor, no window - just a boarded up frame, shower that was like a tap, a plug with no surround just exposed wires, and stains and crumbs on the floor.I would recommend you avoid this hotel.

<Content>Great locale This was a surprisingly nice place for a hostel. It was a perfect location to walk to all of the tourist locales. The first impression upon entering the hotel was very positive. The staircases were strange, but that goes with an old house in amsterdam, and to top it off we were in the room at the VERY top. The bathrooms and beds were VERY clean. Access to rooms was given only to guests through a buzz-in process. Great overall experience. Would stay again!

<Content>Perfectly nice pension I found Rembrandplein to be a simple, friendly and clean pension. Sheets and linen, bath, were impeccably clean, as you would expect in the Netherlands. I saw nothing that could prompt some of the complaints I've seen here.Service was fine.The stairs are steep... it's a building from the 1600s. I am an American who's lived many years in Europe. Let me say emphatically, this is NOT a place for Americans used to Hiltons. If that is what you want., don't come to Europe. Or stay at the Hilton. But don't stay here and give it bad marks just because you didn't have cable and an ice machine.I'd stay here again anytime.

<Content>Would not go back! We are just back from a two night stay in Amsterdam. I would not go back to this hotel/hostel - while the staff were friendly and helpful, it certainly was not a comfortable or enjoyable stay. We found hairs and stains on one of the sheets - not impressed is all I'm saying. It is a very old building and in desperate need of repair - from a plug with all the wires hanging loose to paint peeling and sellotape on the wallpaper to keep it together. And to top it all off, while we were waiting for our taxi in the breakfast room (of all places), a mouse ran by us! Would not be recommending this hotel/hostel to anyone!

<Content>Never again! We stayed here for two nights during a layover in Amsterdam. I have travelled a fair amount and have stayed at a range of hotels from luxury properties to hostels in my younger years. Never have I stayed in a hotel as filthy as the Rembrandtplein. Granted, the location is extremely convenient to all the sites of Amsterdam and is situated in a pretty canal with beautiful church bells ringing in the distance. However, I would never stay here again and strongly recommend others to stay away as well.We were travelling as a group of four and had originally requested two twin rooms. Upon arrival, we were given room 7 and our companions a room on the 3rd floor. Immediately upon leaving the reception it was clear that this hotel is in dire need of refurbishment. The condition of this hotel cannot be described as charming outside of it's architectural gems such as the breakfast room ceiling and steep staircase. Our friends requested another room immediately and after a second request were given room 18 which was larger and appeared to be somewhat cleaner than their original room.Our room looked over an internal courtyard - more like an air shaft. The ground was littered with various garbage including cigarette butts and unused tiles. Upon entering the room we were immediately shocked by the obvious filth in which we were staying. The bedspreads were stained and had cigarette burns, the carpet was equally stained and the ceiling was grey with dirt. Perhaps it was a blessing that half of the lighting was inoperable as it would have certainly revealed more of the room's dirt. The bathroom was even worse, the tub surround and ceiling covered in black mould. The tub itself was relatively clean but the ledge had obviously not been cleaned for some time. We finally took a shower our last day before departing for home and made the mistake of using the shower curtain to prevent water from splashing onto the small floor. Once the hot water and steam from the shower came into contact with the curtain I nearly gagged from the stench that arose. It was a mixture of urine and such dirt that the smell permeated the entire bathroom and even our room.The neighbouring room was occupied by a number of males and the marijuana smoke was so thick in the hallway it entered our room as well. The only thing that appeared to be clean were the sheets - we did not unpack and tried not to touch any of the other surfaces at all. Reception indicated that they clean daily and thoroughly but this is not the case at all - the lamp bases were obviously filthy and the wardrobe dusty as well. Breakfast was average at best. Orange juice, coffee and tea were accompanied by scrambled eggs (ok) and the saltiest most fat riddled bacon I have ever eaten. There was ham and cheese however, the cheese slices were obviously dried out indicating they were sitting there for a long time. Reception was friendly enough however, we asked for wake up calls both mornings and never received them. We ordered a taxi for the morning of departure and it was not ordered until we reminded them again and a call was made.This hotel was definitely not worth the 75 Euro we paid per night. Due to the fact that we were staying only two nights we did not want the hassle of finding other accommodation but I would never stay again - not even for one night. Stay far far away from this hotel - it is not worth your money!!!!

<Content>Great location! Stayed here for three nights. Hotel is small and old, but the location is perfect. Located on a quiet canal, is only a couple minute walk to coffee shops and all the action the red light district has to offer. There is no elevator, so don't stay on the fifth floor. Breakfast consisted of bacon, eggs, and toast.

<Content>pleased. A quirky little hotel in a great location.We only stayed 2 nights and it was a cosy sort of place with cable tv.DON'T expect some sort of palace because the rooms are very small,you get what you pay for.The rooms were clean and I liked the sleazy mirrors on the ceiling too.I would reccomend this hotel for 1 or 2 nights but no longer.

<Content>Hotel in lovely area for exploring the city We read the reviews (mostly poor) after we had made the booking, so it was with some intrepidation that we entered the hotel! We feel that we can sympathise with many of the comments. The hotel is in a lovely position for exploring Amsterdam - the canalled road prettily framed by the church at the end. The hotel, inside and out, looked like it was once quite splendid BUT it now looks tired, worn  in need of a face lift. The carpets are quite threadbare, furniture worn - in some places broken, and bathroom fittings in need of replacement. We travelled as a party of 4 adults, staying 3 nights. The rooms (no.s 89) we were given on our 1st night were unacceptable... as well as being quite shabby, they were very small, no tables or drawers for storage and a tiny shower room/toilet (a multitude of mirrors however!) The two female staff on reception were sympathetic and most helpful, moving us to alternative rooms (usually reserved for 4 persons) for our 2nd  3rd nights (Room no.s 1  11 ).These rooms were very much better- more room  better facilities! In both rooms, the sheets were spotlessly clean as were the towels. The breakfasts were fine...cereals, toast,cold meats and cheese, bacon  scrambled eggs!Would we recommend it? At 拢80 per room per night, no, not to other couples who are looking for reasonable accomadation in that price range - unless they can be assured they would have the larger 4 bedded rooms. Stag parties, sharing the cost of the larger room, would think they had a good deal! All in all, this hotel did not spoil our stay in Amsterdam....we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves in this lively city!

<Content>Good little Hotel We stayed here for 3 nights  were very pleased with everything. The room was clean, as were the sheets. The towels were replaced everyday. Breakfast was fine. We loved the quiet location  it was handy for everything. Stairs were a bit awkward but hey, this is an old canal house so it's only to be expected. No tea or coffee facilities in rooms. The staff were always friendly  helpful  we'd definitely stay there again. The reviewer who moaned about the church bells should take note that they do not ring from 11pm to 7am so I don't know what they were complaining about. After reading previous reviews I was worried about staying there but am glad we did  can't fault it for what it cost us.

<Content>Worst hostel ever I booked this hotel through a hostelbookers website, with no booking fee. I booked it becasue i have no fear of going cheap and cheerful, and I have stayed in some pretty horrible places on my budget travels. Worst case scenario, i had to wear flip-flops in the shower, nothing too bad there. On arrival the booking fee of 3% was due plus an 8% charge for tourist tax in Amsterdam (this was the first i'd heard to these taxes as the website i had used when boking expressly stated that there was no booking fee). Then the bathroom stank of bleach so much that i gagged when i tried to pee. There was no toilet paper supplied and i had to insist that the reception staff give me toilet paper, while they repeated over and over that the cleaner had left some in the room if i cared to look. The location, while good isn't great. Leidesplein is a much nicer friendly area with a lot more life and much more to do around the area. The pillow cases had blood stains. The towels weren't replaced by clean ones during their room clean, nor was the bed made. The top blanket was pulled up over everything. So when we pulled back the blanket the bed was still a mess. What i didn;t understand was why bother? Why bother pulling the blanket up on the bed when they aren't going to make it or replace the towels? That made me very uncomfortable, these people had been in our room with our possessions and hadn't even cleaned up... Very Weird!DO NOT STAY HERE, if you are really really desperate (now really desperate, and willing to pay more than the quoted price) and you have no where else to go, then please DO NOT leave any valuables around. These people are unhelpful, unfriendly, unappproachable and sneaky. Oh, and make sure you bring somrthing to stand on in the shower because it is disgusting.Plus side: the water pressure in the shower was good and the TV worked. And the mirrors do make the place look cleaner than you think. Each morning we were woken by church bells, if that's your thing.

<Content>You get what you pay for We booked this through A1 Discount Hotels on the net. The hotel is in a great position overlooking a canal and is only a short walk to all the shops and attractions of Amsterdam.The hotel itself is a bit on the tatty side and would benefit from a redecorate, but apart from that the room was clean and of a good size (room 1). It was nice and quiet, no rowdy drunks or anything like that as I had my doubts initially as I had seen reference to the hotel in Stagbookers.The staff were friendly and helpfull despite other reports I have seen regarding this hotel.We paid 拢55 per night for the room with breakfast. The breakfast was OK with eggs, cheese, ham and toast available with juices and coffee or tea and was available from 8AM to 11AM which was good if you had a night on the town and did not want to get up too early.All in all not bad for the money but don't expect luxury for the price you pay. I have stayed in better but then again I have stopped in worse for the same money and more.

<Content>Cheap  Stayed here for 2 nights and it was my first trip to Amsterdam. There were many things I let slide because I thought that perhaps I was being snobby my first time in this foreign country. I said to myself Wow, they don't even give you towels in the room around here! And look at how tiny the room is; I can't even stand up without banging my head on the eaves. I shouldn't have to ask for towels like it's a privilege. The hotel has a quirky feel, like it was renovated from some other use. Steep, crooked stairs that give the place a very old school feel. The bathroom is literally a toilet, a shower head and a drain in the middle of the floor, and I was even OK with that. The neighborhood is quiet but very centrally located. Location is the best feature of the hotel. Overall, I was able to adapt to everything since I had the bare necessities. But I couldn't imagine trying to convice my girlfriend to stay in a place like that. Couples planning to spend quality time in the room should know this isn't the place.

<Content>What - no rooms at the inn !! A party of 14 arrived to enjoy a birthday weekend of 3 nights in October 05. The reservation was made with the hotel direct in January 05 and a further email was sent July 05 to remind them of the booking due to the large numbers in the party. On arrival late afternoon we were told by the receptionist that there were only 3 rooms available and for one night only. When a copy of the emailed booking was shown we were told that there were still no rooms available and we asked to speak with the manager who would not come to reception but told the tearful receptionist to sort it. Eventually she managed to find 6 rooms which we kept for the whole weekend but watched when other visitors were turned away, equally having booked rooms.One couple from our party had to find alternative accommodation elsewhere (approx. 25mins away) and we received no apology for this. When settling the bill at the end of the weekend, one of the party who had booked a single room was charged for a double (she took the double because she did not want to be somewhere else on her own and her single room was not available). The hotel was definitely a 2 star with some rooms disgustingly dirty, well worn and like prison cells in some cases. Breakfasts were very basic and cleanliness was not a priority anywhere in the hotel apart from the reception! Would not recommend this hotel to anyone and if a booking has been made I would definitely go through an agent rather than the hotel direct as at least you have some chance of a refund or alternative accommodation if (or when) they overbook which seems to be the norm here.

<Content>Terrible service! I booked a twin room at Rembrandtplein Hotel by calling the hotel directly a month before arriving. I also sent an email with the booking details, and the hotel answered, confirming my booking. When we arrived at the hotel, however, our reservation had not been registered. There was no trace of our reservation anywhere and they had no available rooms. This was late afternoon, and the receptionist apparantely didn't know much. About anything really. I suggested that she should check the hotel's email, perhaps my reservation was still there, but she didn't know how to do that! She didn't offer to find us a room at another hotel or just suggest another hotel we could stay at. She had no other solution for us than I'm sorry! After much arguing, and moving another guest, we got a room, but we had to wait for 3 hours before we could actually see it. And when we finally saw it, it turned out to be the smallest and ugliest room I have ever seen. It wasn't a room really, more like a dirty closet with windows. And if we were staying there, we had to pay full price! So, we found another hotel and left. The receptionist did manage to call us a taxi, after we had asked her several times of cause.Apart from all this, the hotel looked nice, a typical 2 star Amsterdam hotel with steep stairs and carpets everywhere, and the surroundings are beautiful. But if they do not learn to treat their guests better, they will soon be out of buisness!

<Content>Disgrace for the City of Amsterdam Booked one of the cheap rooms through Internet. About the same price as the ones I stayed in London, Paris, Luxembourg, Brussels, Bruges per person per night but far far worse. The room was a hot dirty basement room with no air flow (felt like a gas chamber for the 5 minutes I spend inside the room), at the end of a dirty long corridor where the laundry is, full of obstacles and only one exit through the corridor (in case of fire I pity the poor souls who will be trapped there). The room has a shower but for toilet one has to head to the hotel's bar toilet in the first floor. It was the worst room I have ever seen in my life. Unfortunately I had payed the room and couldn 't get a refund although I didn't use the room at all -- I moved to another hotel immediately. The staff was not helpful and the only thing they cared for is how to get the money. It is a disgrace for the city of Amsterdam. I made an official complaint although I don't know what will come out of it. Very nasty surprise for a first-time visit in Amsterdam.

<Content>Ghost Hotel and mirrors We booked the room in a small office in a corner on one of the Straats, it seemed like a romantic, relaxing and cheap getaways. The staff were mysterious and curious but friendly and surprisingly they spoke our language which is almost a dead language, we are originally from Skurks Molvania.The room was full of mirrors, not only on the sides but on the ceilings in the shape of the letter V. It seems that Rembrandtplein was a brothel before. My girlfriend spent the night finding the right spot between the cracks of the letter V. It was fairly clean and had a small TV. The hotel gives the impression of being haunted with malfunctions in the doors and reflections from all the mirrors and the 1300 feeling. The stairs are steep. The restaurant seemed to be a fancy restaurant in better years, now is a confy caffeteria for the breakfast that was not bad at all considering the price. They gave us some coupons as well for some local attractions but wanted us to charge us 50 Euros for phone calls that we never did. Very centric and close to everything, you can get drunk and find your way easily.

<Content>Stay clear! We are three couples who went to Amsterdam for a weekend trip in May 2005. One couple had to leave immediately to find another hotel as their room was extremely hot (no exaggeration) because the heater was on, could not be turned off and windows were impossible to open. Additionally cigarette smoke leaked from the neighboring room underneath their door. The other couple were content with their room. In our room, both two radiators were hot. I managed to shut off one but the other was totally stuck. We asked the reception several times for help but nothing happened.The first night was terrible because of the heat. On the next day we had to discuss quite intensely with the receptionist to change rooms but finally we got another room which turned out to be a lot better. However, returning from dinner late on the last evening, it turned out somebody had kicked in the door to our room, stealing, among others a laptop PC that I had kept hidden in my suitcase at all times. Only our room had been broken into. Did somebody know beforehand that I had my PC with me, stowed away deep down in my suitcase? I don't know... There are no safes in the rooms. It is possible to store valuables in the reception they told us - afterwards... The manager told us that two weeks ago exact the same thing had happened; the doors to three rooms had been kicked in by unknown burglars. So far he has accepted no responsibility for our loss.Is there anything positive about this hotel? Well, the sheets were clean, and the breakfast was ok, served in a calm and pleasant breakfast room. The location is central and the area is quiet with no traffic noise. It is a small hotel with 15 rooms. You might find this hotel OK if you get one of the good rooms. Do check the room before you give them your credit card details! Don't bring any valuables!

<Content>Don't bother! I booked this hotel via Hoteladvice for a very good price so I wasn't expecting much and the website looked good.On arrival (early) we left our bags in the lobby (which looked ok at the time) and then came back at 2.00pm when we were told, to check in. I had reserved a double room and this had been confirmed. The room was the highest one they had, right in the attic and was a dump. There were two single beds, one six inches lower than the other, as it had had it's legs removed so it would fit under the eaves! There was a desk with tv on and a tiny wardrobe which had no means of hanging anything up. The sheets were clean but the breadspreads were covered in hairs and cigarette burns.The bathroom was a typical Dutch bathroom where the shower and tiolet are in the same cubicle but there wan't even a curtain and the toilet paper got wet when we had a shower. I had also emailed before we went and was told there was a hairdryer in the room - there was no sign of one. I rang reception to complain but there was nothing the could do until the next night because they were full. (I wish I had checked on the room when we dropped our bags off!) We were only there two nights but we did move rooms and it was slightly better. Breakfast was not great either, I have never seen brown scrambled eggs before! The moral of the story is that you get what you pay for. I paid 115e for two nights but would not pay more than that.

<Content>Horrible experience with the staff !! Well, for starters : upon entering the room after having climbed a very steep staircase for 4 floors (no elevator) I found NO toilet paper, and one of the two lights was broken. I reported to the owners, who said with a smile that they would fix everything in a few moments. So when I came back in the evening, I was very disapponed to find out that there was still NO toilet paper and the light was still broken. And then I discovered: the bathroom was almost useless; bed sheets were dirty AND broken (yes really!); heating was too strong, and many other annoyances !I reported everything back, and I got the same response: they would fix everything in a few moments. It went that way for two days, then I stopped compelling because I finally realized that I was being cheated and that those people were not doing anything at all to solve the problems.It was really a BAD experience, worsened by the sensation of continuosly being cheated.You should avoid this place by all means, eve if I it is in a wonderful location.

<Content>Rembrandtplein Hotel After a couple of emails, and a phone conversation with the Rembrandtplein Hotel, I booked a room for 5 nights in September. The staff was very nice, the service good, and the room was very sufficient. Included in the price were all taxes, and it included a basic Dutch breakfast served in their small lounge, which was a bar in the evening hours. The hotel is a canal house dating from the late 1600's I believe, and the location is terrific, with the hotel located at Groenburgwal 27. It is within three blocks of the Muntplein, where you get off the #4 Tram from Centraal Station and walk behind the Hotel de l'Europe. Cafe de Jaren is right around the corner. There's a wonderful little draw bridge at one end of the street, and framed by the bridge at the opposite end is the Zuiderkerk. The phone number is 31 20 428 4244!
