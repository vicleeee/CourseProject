<Content>Bland, generic hotel in a great location If you wanna be a stone's throw from one of the best outdoor bazaars in Asia -- the Ladies' Market -- then this hotel is in the perfect location. This part of Mongkok is bustling and full of neon and busy all night, which I like.The hotel itself is an uninspiring, personality-less, generic 3-star property where the staff are superficially friendly but nobody speaks good English or seems to know quite how to do anything like, say, run a hotel. The room was clean and adequate. If I'd been staying more than one night or if I'd paid a penny more than $US125, I would've been disappointed. But on a tight budget, the Stanford is a good option in its class -- it's well-located, much nicer than a youth hostel and cheaper than almost any other hotel in HK. (Personally? Next time, I'll spend an extra fifty bucks and go somewhere with a shred of style, even if it means catching the subway to buy my fake Calvins.)

<Content>A comfortable stay! We stayed at Stanford Hotel for 5 days from 8-12th dec 2008 arrived to hotel around 6pm. Lobby was nicely decorated with chritsmas tree and welcoming staff. We were told that non-smoking room is not available and they will move us next morning. We didnt move though because we were happy with the room. Our room was located near to the elevator, very convenient. Amazingly this hotel's tv channels has watchable english movies!! Every night when we return to hotel the bed is made and room is cleaned!! Plenty of restaurants and shopping centres around the hotel. My favourite is Sephora, beauty centre. I am very pleased I chose this hotel and will stay here again in the future.

<Content>Good shopping location but clueless staff The location of the hotel for shopping is perfect close to the markets and the train to Shenzhen. Only problem the hotel did not know that you can not get a Visa at the border so we ended up in no-wheres land and wasted half a day and funny enough we were not the only ones. Heard that this might change again after 16 Oct.Secondly we booked the hotel offered bus shuttle to the airport but missed it and had to pay! Great customer service but even worse when asked how much a taxi to the airport would be we were told 4 times more than the actual amount (250) which I can only explain by the hotel charging 120 per person which is almost the same but takes 3 times as long. So my advise negotiate with the taxi and you are far better off.Aircon at the hotel is old and smelly also the free wifi is probably the slowest I have ever seen. You are better off to use one of the free service.Would I stay again? Probably not...

<Content>Nice, Comfortable  My sister and I stayed in a standard room on the 10th floor. The room wasn't huge but was spacious enough. Nice clean bathroom, beds were comfortable and had a giant plasma on the wall with English Channels. The hotel lobby is lovely and the staff were very nice.Breakfast was pretty good but get in early, as it gets quite busy around 8am and you might have to wait to get a table.Hotel is in a great location, right near the Ladies Night Market and surrounded by plenty of restaurants.

<Content>Great Location, Small Room, Bad Cleaning Service Stayed for 4 nights and actually this is my 2nd stay in this hotel.Location is great just mere 5 mins walk to the Ladies Market and 10 mins walk to MTR station. Abundant food options nearby.Minus side. Quite Expensive internet charge at HKD 20/hr or HKD 100/day. Cleaning lady seemed not done a good job. Everyday they clean up the room but never change any bed sheets during 4 days of my stay. Trash bin cleaned daily but always some trash left out. They never replace the glasses used in the room with the clean one when they clean up the rooms.Overall, for HKD 950 per night is slightly on the expensive side. I dont really mind about the room size which is normal in HK however the cleaners should be able to do better job.Not recommended if you are really concern about sanitary issue

<Content>Good service except upon arrival We stayed 10 nights at Stanford Hotel. The service provided are generally good, they send us whatever we requested in just few minutes. Except on the day we checked in, the man at the door was quite rude as he argued with the taxi driver that drove us from the airport over the luggage matter. You will need to bring your own luggage up to your room upon check in. There is no one to assist.The room are a little small but for the price paid, I think it's alright. It's cleanliness is okay. The hotel corridor is a little small. Not even enough space for two person to walk side by side if you are holding your luggages.There is only two passenger lifts. It's slow and small. There is free coach to Hung Hom MTR station and the Hong Kong China Ferry terminal every one and a half hour or so.The nearby area is always busy but the location of the hotel is just right, not as crowded. Taxis are available easily. About 5-10 minutes walking to Mongkok MTR station. Local restaurants, Fa Yuen st and Ladies market are just nearby.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay at Stanford Our travel agent booked this hotel for us for our 5 night stay in Hong Kong while we were on our way to Europe.We knew very little about Hong Kong or this hotel so had no expectations. However, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The hotel is basic. The rooms small but adequate and very clean, housekeeping were lovely and the bed was comfortable. There was just handsoap/shampoo in a dispenser in the shower which was fine as we had our own.We ate lunch at the hotel restaurant and had a great authentic Chinese meal. Dim Sum was available but we chose to order from the menu and really enjoyed our selections.The location was really enjoyable for a first trip to Hong Kong. It felt like real authentic Hong Kong - the hotel is amongst apartment blocks and as you leave the hotel in the mornings you are surrounded by people just going about their everyday business. The hotel is a short block from the ladies' markets which are fantastic. The hotel is very close to Nathan Road where it is easy to catch cheap buses if you want to see a bit more than you to on the MTR. We enjoyed our stay in Hong Kong. We spent little time at our hotel (because there is so much to see) it did it's job perfectly - a safe, clean place to sleep.Next time we would stay on Hong Kong Island as it is a very different experience to staying in Kowloon.

<Content>Comfortable Stay A comfortable stay. The room was adequate, if a little on the small side. I would happily recommend The Stanford as an option away from the harbour area (being so close to the ladies market). My only complaint was that a travel cot was not set up for us on arrival (this seems to be a problem with many hotels). Having arrived late at night - it was very frustrating to find our room with no cot. If they had check the notes they should have realised one was required. The room did not even have the space for one (although the enthusiastic porter was sure he could assemble it). After several phone calls we were moved to a larger room and the cot assembled.Tip: Now when we travel I always email the hotel a couple of days in advance to remind them that a travel cot is required.

<Content>Good location but with limited room amenity This was my third visit to Hong Kong. Like the location which is near to many shopping areas within walking distances and close to the heart of the locals. Hotel rooms in Hong Kong are generally small and sizes are rather awkward; similar in Stanford Hotel. Very basic facilities and furniture in room. Do not expect to find toothbrush, shampoo and comb in the room. Shampoo was in a dispenser which reminds me of a club's changing room. No bath tub and standing shower is definitely too small for big sized people. If you are looking for good location with easy acess to the local shopping areas such as ladies market. This will be the place for you! However, if you are looking for luxury, then do not select the hotel.

<Content>Truely impressive Rated as a three star hotel this place truely impresses. This was my second stay and I would stay here again. The room was clean, modern and comfortable. The staff were excellent and helped beyond all expectations to make our stay comfortable. We were travelling with a baby and gave us a late check out time at no extra cost. The location was safe and very convenient to all the Mong Kok attractions, particularly shopping and the Ladies night markets.

<Content>Good Location. Hmmmm... Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. I find the room small but clean. The location is great as it is near to mtr,ladies market and shopping malls. But do not expect much from this hotel, they does not have excellent service nor facilities.

<Content>Great price, great location The Stanford is a great little hotel in a perfect location in Kowloon. I paid $62 (+13% tax) for a single through a special offer on Expedia, and this was a fantastic bargain.The hotel is located right next to the wonderful Ladies Market, just a few blocks off of Nathan Rd (the main street of Kowloon). This puts you close to all of the great public transportation. Note that Soy St where it meets Nathan is a pedestrian street - this was confusing for me when I got off of the Airport bus on Nathan Rd., but it's practically right at the stop (look for the Bank of China). A quick couple of short blocks down and you're right at the hotel (easily walkable w luggage if you didn't bring too much).The lobby is small and the rooms are too, but everything is fairly modern and very clean. The beds had beautiful white duvets and nice firm mattresses. My second room (changed rooms first night because of on odd paint smell) on the 19th floor had a large wall-mounted flat-screen tv. All rooms come with a mini-fridge (stocked) and complimentary tea maker and fixings.A couple of things to be aware of - the restaurant is pretty bad (bland and overpriced), but with lots of restaurant options in the area you shouldn't need to eat there. There's another restaurant (not owned by the hotel) in the basement, but I didn't try it. The room has no real place to store or put clothes away, just a tiny closet that will fit a 22 carryon laying down. There are a couple of small drawers in the desk and nightstand, but don't count on a having real dresser. Lastly, bring your own hair conditioner or plan to buy some at the local drugstore - the shower and sink have a wall-mounted dispenser containing all-in-one hand soap/shampoo.The concierge was rarely at his desk, but I did arrange a tour through him the last day and he was very helpful. It appears that they only deal with one tour company, so if you want additional options you may need to do your own research.I'd stay here again - it's a real bargain in a location that can't be beat.

<Content>Excellent location We spent 4 nights at the Stanford Mongkok, and had a very pleasant experience. Our stay was definitely enhanced by the concierge (Brian) who did an excellent job at ensuring that we got the best out of our visit. He showed interest in how much we had enjoyed his suggestions, and booked us a very reasonable taxi directly back to the airport. (He also taped up our suitcase, which we only discovered to be damaged as we were about to leave!)Our room was fairly compact, though I can't imagine why anyone would want to spend time in a hotel room in this amazing city!Buffet breakfast offered a reasonable selection of items. Other reviews have mentioned problems re lifts - we were on the 9th floor, and did not encounter any delays in using lifts.Hotel very well located for tourist attractions, especially for shopping on Nathan Road and nearby markets. Eating out is incredibly cheap - meal for two for under 拢2. Excellent bus network, as well as MTR.

<Content>Nothing spectacular but good location Nothing fanciful about this hotel or is it really that bad. Just a decent place to stay in while you shop in Hong Kong. As no one really stays in an hotel while in HKG what matters most in the selection of hotels is the location and Stanford Hotel meets this criteria.Located just minutes away from Ladies Market and 10-15 mins walk from Mong Kok MTR, this is a good enough hotel which is slightly end the end of Soy Street. Plenty of good eateries nearby which is a bonus to this hotel. Rooms are small though adequately done and is clean

<Content>Good location, get a deluxe room. The location is great, in the heart of Mongkok. Initially wanted Langham hotel, but was fully booked, so we were given stanford hotel. The rooms were not ready when we arrived and we waited for almost more then half an hour. We arranged with our travel agency that we wanted 2 rooms side by side, the hotel didnt arranged that for us and we were given 2 rooms with different floor. We wanted a room upgraded to deluxe room, its newly renovated, its clean and neat, normal toilet with walk up shower only, but clean. Its a small room, small cupboard with no door, but thats fine with us. Basically you can hear people talking and walking outside. Since we are not spending much time in the room, so its fine. The stanford hotel chinese restaurant serves very good tim sum, if you are a tim sum lover, have to give it a try.

<Content>Great Little Budget Hotel The location of this hotel is wonderful as it's close to public transportation and also gives you exceptional access to the day-to-day life of Hong Kong's average citizens.However, to appreciate this hotel you must first understand that what it offers in terms of comforts is very basic:* Yes, my room was small, but it was very tidy and the bed was very clean. (The mattress, however, appears to have been fabricated from the same material used on armoured tanks to protect them from rocket attack.) The bathroom was immaculate and the water pressure in the shower was good.* The staff at the front desk is extremely polite and helpful, although their English skills might not always be the best.* It's difficult for me to understand some of the other reviews of this hotel because during my stay a doorman was always on duty and a staff member was always on hand to help with luggage.If your expectations are reasonable, and if you want to experience the vibrant, chaotic street life of middle- and working-class Kowloon, this hotel is a fine choice. There are several typical cafes nearby where it's very enjoyable to sit and sip an iced milk tea while you people-watch.

<Content>Great Little Hotel My sister and I were pleasantly surprised by this little gem. The staff were great and the room, although not large was OK, clean and serviced excellently. The desk staff were extremely helpful. We found the hotel in a nice little area not far from the market and transport all within walking distance. This area all tends to look the same so take note of where you are going. You can get lost easily. The dining room was nice and the chef cooked us especially a souffle which was out of this world. Be prepared for the smell of the area which can permeat your skin and become quite unpleasant. Our return stay was in Whompoa which is a lovely area but for the experience of Hong Kong, we preferred Mongkok. Enjoy your stay.

<Content>Quite a decent hotel This hotel is in a great location. Was there two nights in May 07 enroute to Europe from Australia. Staff at reception were polite but the supervisor was very icy-cold who did not respond to greetings! He shouldn't be working there with this attitude. The doorman was pathetic as he did not help open door when I first arrived as I was struggling with two luggages. He did not even bat an eyelid when I smiled to him. Even worse he did not show me to the lift. What is he there for, I asked! The room though small was clean. But on uncovering the bedcovers I saw a stain and pubic hair in my bed! Must congratulate housekeeping for efficient and speedy service as they immediately attended to changing the linen and apologised profusely. Had breakfast on first morning. Was served 'fresh' fruit salad which I sent back as they looked stale as if from night before. Their response was quick and came back with freshly cut up fruit salad. All in all, service was very good except for the reception supervisor and the doorman whose attitude must change if hotel want clients happy and to return for another stay. All said, I will come back to stay at this hotel and hopefully the attitude of supervisor and doorman would have improved.

<Content>A bad ending to a wonderful trip This was the final four days of our our two week vist to China and I wish it would not have ended this way. No one in the hotel would help with our bags, the lobby was always crowed and more then one I had to walk down the stairs because I waited over 10 minutes for the elevator and I was on the 18th floor. The hotel rooms reminded me of my dorm room in college. I had to pus the door open hard because it it the bed. The bathroom dor would not open all the way because it hit the bed and the shower doors did not work. However, the A.C. in the room was wonderful. The location of the hotel was an hour walk to the harbor and in a more residential area, but there was a nice street market Ladies Market. The food at the hotel was horrible. Our agent booked us for breakfast every day and dinner two of the nights. The breakfast and dinner area was overbooks at breakfast and dinner and the selections were right out of a can. After the frist night, no one ate dinner there and most skipped breakfast. I can only recommend this hotel to the very very cheap budget travler or college student. There are a lot better offeres in Hong Kong at the same price.

<Content>Absolutely the best After reading poor reviews for this hotel we were unsure what we would find. What a fantastic place this was to stay at for a budget hotel. The room was small but clean, fresh towels and sheets every day. The buffet breakfast had a huge variety of choices - yoghurt cereal baconeggs, sausages, tomatoes,hotcakes, fruit and plenty of tea and coffee. The staff were very pleasant and helpful, nothing was too much trouble.Location was fantastic. Just minutes from Mong Kok KCR  MTR.The Ladies market was just around the corner. There was also a great variety of places to eat at.All in all a great place to stay if you are on a budget.

<Content>Didn't like it much Whilst the hotel is well located, being close to MTR and train stations, night market, and lots of restaurants, it is in serious need of renovation.Rooms are more than tiny; we paid an extra USD 25.00 a night to get a room that at least enabled us to put our suitcase somewhere. Bathrooms were OK though.Breakfast was horrible and not worth the money, we did not try any of the other restaurants after that.Staff generally very unhelpful, for USD 165.00 a night I would have expected somebody to help with our bags.In short: great for location, not so good for everything else.

<Content>Won't be staying here again We stayed here for one night, all our first choices being booked up.The location is fantastic - a stone's throw from the Ladies Market and a few minutes from public transport. Everything else about the hotel is pretty average.The rooms are very small, like much of the rest of Hong Kong. A Superior Double is not big enough for two people to walk around in at the same time. Do they really have an Inferior Double?We had asked for a non-smoking room. We didn't get one. On calling down to reception, we were told that all the other rooms were taken. No explanation, no apology. Tough luck. The aircon had been turned off, presumably because it was irritatingly loud when turned on. There was no view, but it was clean enough and the shower was ok, if not as powerful as US travellers might expect.We could not get a late checkout. Fair enough - you can't expect that. But the hotel also has no changing facilities once you have checked out. For those people on late flights to Europe, America or Australia (i.e., nearly everyone), this is hugely inconvenient.They do agree to store your bags. Sort of. In fact, they are left all day in the main lobby, tied to each other with a cable that might withstand kitchen scissors on a good day.Room allocation issues aside, service was reasonably efficient, if frosty.Overall, the stay was tolerable as it was only for one night. But we would not choose to stay here again. There are better places for your money in HK, especially if you can book early.

<Content>Was booked here in error We had booked (or so we thought) to stay at the Stanford Hill View in TST, however, when we arrived in at the hotel they had no booking for us (although they recognised us as we had stayed there before), we should have been staying for 15 nights and they no rooms available. It soon transpired that we had been booked into the Stanford Mong Kok. We arrived at the hotel and the staff were OK, the rooms were much smaller and the first one we were given was very dark (it faced the back with a small window). We asked reception if we could have a larger room with more storage for our clothes (and the shopping we knew we would do), they were more than pleased to assist and moved us to a twin room which was bigger all round. The rooms were neat and clean and the staff were very helpful and understanding,The location is fabulous and the walk down Nathan road to TST was good and enabled us to see far more of Hong Kong (although this would be difficult in the hotter months).All in all although we stayed here by mistake we would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>Clean and comfortable Very clean and comfortable but room is rather small, but not the smallest in HK. Space is just nice for 2 persons - my friend and I (we're both 5+ feet). There's even space for luggage. Bathroom space is sufficient though.The bed is very comfortable and quilt is warming. Clean beds.The location is fantastic! Less than 10 minutes walk from the nearest MTR and less than 2 minutes walk from the busy area 'ladies market' (Lui Yan Gai). Lots of shops and activities and food nearby.Hotel staff is good and helpful. Internet is very fast. They are doing some outer renovation in the month of January 07 but noises is from 9AM-6PM only.A bit pricey for this room size but location and cleanliness make up for it.

<Content>Average Room Small room with very basic amenities. However, it is very close to Ladies Market and the shopping streets. It is a short walk to Mongkok MTR though. The hotel is a little old but the thing that makes up for it is the close proximity to the shopping areas and night markets. Would not have chosen this hotel if there was a choice as it was a peak period and all hotels were full.

<Content>Good hotel.. i will stay there again during my next Hong Kong trip The location of the hotel is great. It is near to ladies street and within walking distance to MongKok MTR. But be prepared to walk through the crowds during peak hours and weekends from the hotel to MongKok MTR as the whole area will be very crowded.If you are taking airbus A21 from airport to the hotel. Be prepared to walk for at least 10-15 mins as soy street is a very long street and the hotel is right at the back of soy street. It took me quite a while to find the hotel.The room is small but good enough for 2 people. House keeping is done everyday so you will have clean towels every morning. I didnt try the food in the hotel so no comments about that but there are lots of eating places near the hotel so no need to worry about going hungry. During my 1st night, the air-condition wasnt working well and I called house-keeping. In less than 10 mins, they send a technician and fixed the problem for me. Good service.Basically it is a value for money hotel.

<Content>be sure to request for a non-smoking room the hotel is okay if you are looking for cleanliness and standard service, but be sure to request for a non-smoking room. we were given a room that smelled like vomit and cigarettes so that made our stay less comfortable than expected. the location was also not so good. the rooms were a trifle small, but a good deal for budget travellers.

<Content>Great Value for Money If you're looking to not have to pay the big prices at the main hotels in Hong Kong, I highly recommend this hotel. It is a short walk to shopping and the subway. The rooms are as clean as you could ever expect and the service is good.

<Content>Great stay in Hong Kong We stayed at the Stanford hotel early November for around two weeks and found it to be very good. The Hotel was clean with nice size rooms and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We also had an hour free internet access for our laptop every day in our room which proved very useful. The restaurant also had a lovely restaurant in the basement where we ate fantastic Dim Sum. The location is right in the centre of down town Kowloon, which if you want to experience the locals Hong Kong then this is the place to be. If you prefer to be among westerners then you should probably look at a hotel further south in Tsim Sha Tsui or on Hong Kong Island. Whilst in Hong Kong you should try not to miss the restaurants on Lamma Island, especially at Sok Kwu Wan, the horseracing at Happy valley or the view from the bar at the top of the Peninsular.

<Content>Gateway to Toy Haven Being an avid toy collector, my husband loved the accessibility of the Stanford Hotel to Argyle Street where rare collectible items can be found. He's best find was a 12-in. G.I. Joe doll in mint condition, sealed box, for only HK$19.Just 50 steps from the hotel is a Yoshinoya, 7-11, McDonalds, Pizza Hut and a host of shops - Giordano, Esprit, Bossini, Mannings, Sasa, and my favorite Bonjour (low-priced designed perfumes and make-up). Of course, the Night Markets abound. I specially liked going through the Ladies Market which is just 2 blocks away from the hotel.The hotel staff is very nice  speaks good English. Helped us also in translating some Chinese characters for a shop that we were trying to find. Basic necessities are met - aircon, clean bathrooms. They accommodated us for an early check-in at 10am and placed us in a non-smoking floor (which is great!). Their hotel shuttle service is such a treat for us when we go to Tsim Tsa Tsui. No need for extra taxi fares :=) We will definitely consider the hotel in our next visit to HongKong.

<Content>Okay, but a bit too far out This hotel is a very comfortable, modern, friendly hotel. The room was fantastic, the staff were great. Buffet breakfast in the morning was also very good.The only probably is the location of this hotel. Yes its in the thick of the Ladies market, but it is still 4 stations on the subway from HK island. Mongkok is the most densely populated part of HK so there are people everywhere. It is also not very scenic because its just streets and streets of residential blocks. If you want to visit the markets you can just jump on the subway and get there easily and then leave back for HK island or TST.There is an airport shuttle that gets you to Kowloon airport station (which is no where near the hotel), but I was unsure of how to book this before I got there, so I caught the train, through to mongkok station. I had to change twice on the subway and with bags it can be a little difficult.For the money you can stay closer and be near a good view. Would not stay here again due to location.
