<Content>Just Ok Was at the holiday inn at sea-tac airport for one night as I had an early morning flight the following morning. The hotel is very close to the airport, about a quarter-mile. You can see airport main terminal from the room they gave me on the 11th floor. Shuttles to and from the airport is scheduled every half hour. I noticed that the shuttle was small and can only seat about 12 people. Other hotels seemed to have larger capacity shuttles. The morning of my flight several people had to stand but then again its such a short ride so its really no big deal. The staff was very friendly. The first room they gave me had malfunctioning locks so I had to be moved to a different room. The room I was given was just standard. It was clean and had a king-size bed. A coffee maker was provided. the bathroom was of standard size but clean. I would consider staying here again next time i need to be close to the airport.

<Content>Great Airport Hotel We stayed here for one night due to a flight delay and had a great time. The hotel was clean, the Internet free, the gym functional and it came with a good breakfast. The shuttle picked us up within five minutes at the airport and dropped us of again the next morning.I recommend it for a quick airport stopover.

<Content>Very Good Experience We stayed at the Holiday Inn Sea-Tac and had a very good experience. Despite some negative reviews here, we found the hotel was fine in all aspects. The front desk was helpful on check-in and the shuttle to the airport was right on time. It is only about a 10 min. ride to the terminal. The room was fine: clean, good size and nice bathroom鈥reat shower. Despite proximity to airport, no noise. All the linens were fresh and the king bed was just perfect. Plenty of soft pillows. The lobby was well appointed for an airport hotel. We got this through Priceline with a $63 rate; a real bargain. Would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Content>My WORST hotel experience in 20 years - no kidding! Arrived at airport, got bags, and called this hotel for their free shuttle. Was told it would be 10 minutes. After 20 minutes, a full shuttle bus drove by and told me there was a bus behind him. After 20 more minutes (and another phone call), another shuttle bus drove by and --- again -- said they had no room. I insisted that they let me on. I rode sitting on my luggage on the floor. When I got to the hotel, a man was arguing with the front desk clerk because she had given him a dirty room. While I was standing there, other customers came up with problems ranging from keys that didn't work to missing toiletries in their rooms. The front desk clerk told us that the other clerk helping her had left in frustration and she had only been on the job 2 weeks and was the only one running the hotel! When we checked in to our room -- guess what -- our room had not been cleaned! The clerk told us no other rooms were available and tried to put us in a smoking room in another hotel, which we refused. Finally out of options, the front desk issued us our own sheets and towels so that we could CLEAN OUR OWN ROOM from the previous guest! I have been a business traveler for 20+ years and this is the absolutely worst run hotel I have ever experienced. Holiday Inn should strip this property of the rights to use it's name.

<Content>Dirty, Smelly, Rundown If your corporate travel person checks out hotels for you and the holiday Inn costs less than the Holiday Inn Express, there is probably a really good reason for it.This property is old and has not been maintained. My colleague checked out after finding old coffee grinds in her room's coffee maker and got her white socks filthy walking across the carpet. We had a drink in the bar and nothing will ever persuade me that the liquor is not watered down. The carpeting was old and stained as was the bedspread. The mattress reached the end of its useful life sometime in the Cliton administration and the biggest insult was the card by the bed boasting of the pillow selection. They should have been categorized not by firmness buy by degree of discomfort ranging from awful to unbelieveble.To give the hotel credit, I was not bothered by airplane noise but this was only because the window was bolted closed so that the only air available was form the very stale air conditioner. Did I mention the place was smelly? The corridor stunk of old cigarette smoke that had festered in the carpet for years and they are still challenged to remove room service trays in less than 48 hours.We used a meeting room and were charged way more than our original quote then, when one of us went and bought a bagel to bring back to our meeting, the waitress in the restaurant got extremely belligerent when she took a knife from the table.Do not stay here. Instruct your corporate travel organizer to avoid it at all costs.

<Content>Fit for purpose We stayed here for 1 night as we were flying out the next morning at 6am and everything about the hotel was fine. The room was clean, bathroom was a decent size, and there was free wifi internet which is always a bonus. Shuttle the next morning was also good.

<Content>Not worth it, even with Park and Fly We stayed here for one night so we could fly out early the next morning, and we wanted to park and fly. The hotel looks nothing like the photos of it. The lobby is very nice, but once you walk into the room you can see how old this place really is. The bedding appears to be very old, and the beds are hard and uncomfortable. The cafe/bar is a strange place. It looks like it was a continental breakfast that they randomly put tables in. It has a very strange vibe to it, and was a very dismal place to spend my birthday dinner. The waitress didn't even ask us if we wanted beverages, just dumped some water off, took our order, and that was it. By far the worst of this experience? The shuttle to the airport. We came down with plenty of time to catch the shuttle for our flight at 7:15 am. We waited for the shuttle to depart, and then were very rudely told that we were not allowed to board, that he would come back for us. I'm not even sure why he singled us out, he just bluntly told us we weren't going. I went to the front desk and complained, and he agreed with me that the driver was rude. I then asked them to call a cab, which they did. They also paid for the cab, which was the one redeeming thing about this stay. Upon coming back to pick up our car, I contacted the hotel for a shuttle pick up. The first time I tried to call, the woman hung up on me. The second time they told me the shuttle was on it's way. We waited 45 minutes for that shuttle, with three kids who were very hungry and tired. After I called three times, they tried to tell me that he had come and gone, but I know for a fact I never saw that shuttle once. My son even asked the shuttle driver why he was late, and he certainly didn't have much to say. Horrible customer service, except for the young man at the front desk on the morning of our flight. Would never, ever stay there again.

<Content>Terrible customer service at Holiday Inn I booked through Priceline and it is listed as three stars. This should be two stars. I contacted the hotel several days prior stay to request two double beds. The hotel reservation said ok. When I arrived, I was told there is only king bed room. I contacted the Manager and never heard back from him. The front desk personnel were very unfriendly. My room smell like smoking room even though it is a non-smoking room. Will not stay here again. I felt like I was being treated differently because I booked through Priceline.

<Content>Good Airport Hotel This hotel is very convenient to the Seattle airport. The shuttle makes it very easy to get to and from the hotel. There was some confusion upon our arrival and it took some time for the shuttle to pick us up (about 25 minutes). When we checked out the shuttle took us to our car rental place, which was very nice. The room was comfortable and had a microwave and fridge with basic amenities. The shower did not have much hot water when I showered but was ok when my husband showered about 1 hour later. It could have just been a busy time (7:00am). The breakfast was simple, but a nice bonus to get started with the day. All in all I would stay again if I needed an airport hotel.

<Content>If you have to be by the airport..... Stayed there 4/5/08 for one night. Had to catch an early flight the next day- 6am meaning you had to get to the airport around 4:30am.Nice property for an airport location. The free 24 hour shuttle was great- we dropped off our car rental the night before, the hotel shuttle picked us up, and we left the next morning around 4am.The rooms were clean, average size while the front desk and driver were friendly and very helpful. They serve their free breakfast from about 5am to 9:30am.The only weakness is that the walls/floors are thin and if you have noisy neighbors to the side or above, the sound will travel. Whoever was above us did quite a bit of pacing that night.Still, for the cost (under $90), shuttle service and airport proximity, it's a good choice if you need to stay in the Sea-Tac area. Clearly better than Red Lion down the street.

<Content>Nice airport location. Free shuttle w/in one mile of hotel. We paid about $88 and stayed one night. We checked in our room then took our rental car back. The hotel picked us up at the rental car location and brought us back to the hotel. They have a free shuttle to the airport too, saved us one night of car rental fees. They will even take you to restaurants w/in one mile of the hotel. We ordered in pizza from Round Table to our room, pizza was fantastic. Try the cracker crust pizza (super thin crust). The room was the nicest Holiday Inn express room I have seen, it was more like a suite, two rooms and a kitchen area. Hotel was nice and clean. A few maintenance issues (toilet rocked on floor and the bathroom door would not stay open, tv remote a bit tempermental) but there were small inconviences. Would stay here again.

<Content>A surprisingly good choice by the airport We were booked in to the Holiday Inn Express-Seatac by Horizon Airlines due to a scheduling error on their part. We knew about this in advance, so I checked out the hotel website and was kind of bummed out because it didn't look that great.Fast-forward to our arrival in Seattle. We called the hotel for a shuttle from the airport courtesy phone; staff directed us to the pick-up area, where she asked us to call again, and she would dispatch her driver. We did as asked, and got on the wrong shuttle van (for the Holiday Inn, not the Holiday Inn EXPRESS). Our fault, but their driver was very accomodating, and took us to the right hotel anyway, even though they are apparently under different ownership.The front desk clerk was very pleasant and efficient, and told us about nearby options for eating, and offered the free use of the shuttle to get to and from a restaurant (we were hungry, it was late, and we had planned on hoofing it or taking a cab). The (correct) shuttle driver was very prompt and friendly. The room was good-sized, had VERY comfortable beds and pillows, and also had a microwave and fridge. Breakfast was served at 5:00 am the next morning, along with a complementary Sunday paper; this was great, since we had an early flight. The shuttle took us back to the airport right on time.In the end, my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the Holiday Inn Express-Seatac, and would use it as a Seattle Airport hotel again if we needed to. Signing the receipt, we saw that Horizon Airlines only paid $63 for the room; out of curiosity, I checked the website later on, and they were charging $100+. I thought this was a bit spendy, but my wife says I'm a cheapskate, and it was a decent price for an airport hotel, especially with a free shuttle and breakfast.

<Content>a very pleasant stay Very friendly and helpful staff. We booked a double and were upgraded to a suite. (I'm a Priority member.)Computer and snack shop were available in the lobby. Covered parking was a definite plus. Breakfast was basic but satisfying (eggs, bacon, toast and pastries).One down side: if you face the runway, you WILL hear planes taking off at 5AM.If you have time to spare, take Int'l Blvd (Hwy 99) towards downtown. Visit the Museum of Flight. Then head west on SW Spokane St towards W Seattle Bridge. Drive along Harbor Blvd towards Alki Beach for a spectacular view of the city.

<Content>Great basic hotel for families This was the third time we have stayed at this property, and have found it to be consistently good each time. Quality accommodations, a friendly staff, and a decent breakfast included in the room rate. Our family of four finds it perfect for our needs. The beds are comfortable, the bathroom and kitchen very clean, and the heating and a/c units make it easy to set the comfort level in both the bedroom and the living area.

<Content>Quite good but not great Stayed the night before our Alaska cruise. Shuttle not only picked us up at the hotel but also takes you to any restaurant within a mile -- very convenient and pleasant service. This hotel is showing its age but we found it in generally quite good condition. Bed was very comfortable, with a choice of firm and soft pillows. Unfortunately the Entertainment rate, described as under $60 in May, was now $104. Nice to be able to book that rate online, though. Not a bad rate for the area but wouldn't have wanted to pay much more. Breakfast very adequate but not great.Personnel all very helpful and courteous. As a Holiday Inn Priority member, we received a free microwave popcorn  a bottle of water -- a nice touch.

<Content>typical aiport hotel We stayed here to be close to the airport as we had an early morning flight. We had a suite which was spacious. However, when I turned on the air conditioner, there was an odor coming out of the unit. Also, when we went down to the lobby to use the computer, there was a strange odor in that area also. The computer was in a hallway near the lobby. It would be better if it was in a room.The breakfast was okay, not great, but enough food to chose from. The hotel was not clean enough to warrant us staying there again.

<Content>Great accomodations and a great price We stayed here after a late night flight, arriving at the hotel around midnight. The gal at the front desk was very pleasant and helpful.Our room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. The bed was so comfortable and the room so quiet, we slept soundly until 10 a.m.! The were lots of pillows, soft cotton sheets and a warm blanket. Also, the comforter looked brand new. Having slept in, we missed breakfast unfortunately. But noticed the breakfast area was large with lots of tables. This hotel also had a small 鈥渃onvenience mini market鈥?with items such as soup that could be heated in the room鈥檚 microwave - something I had never seen before! Perfect for a late arrival when you just wanted something warm and nourishing!The room rate was very reasonable and I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again in the future.

<Content>Enjoyed the Holiday Inn Express Seatac I booked a room at the Holiday Inn Express near the Seatac airport for a one night stay prior to a cruise in May, 2007. I was thrilled to see that their website had an Entertainment card discount available, and booked a king size suite for less than $60, which I felt was a great deal.We checked into the hotel early Saturday evening. Our room was quite large and definitely worth what we paid for it. We've stayed at several Holiday Inn Expresses over the past couple of years, and have become big fans of their beds, linens, and showerheads. This one was no exception, and we had a very enjoyable stay. Our room was clean. While there are a few signs of wears, overall we had no complaints. There was a microwave and refridgerator available. Since we're Priority Club members, we received a free bag of popcorn and bottle of water when we checked in.We had excellent service from any of the staff we encountered. They provided us with suggestions of places to eat, and we ended up eating dinner at Sharp's Roasters, which we thoroughly enjoyed. The continental breakfast the next morning was very adequate, but extremely busy. They were out of several items, including orange juice, and it didn't get refilled while we were there. If we return to Seattle in the future and need a place by the airport, I'd definitely plan on staying at this hotel.

<Content>Nice property, friendly staff, large rooms I checked into the Holiday Inn Express following a cruise. The hotel is mere blocks from the airport with zero of the noise! The property is about a 20-25 minute drive from the cruise terminal. Upon arrival at the hotel, the front desk was extremely helpful, friendly and welcoming. I was checked-in within 3 minutes and my room was ready at 10:45am. I inquired about a late check-out, and was extended a 2pm checkout with ease. The agent also pointed out a free high-speed internet terminal with printer near the front desk which was perfect for printing a boarding pass. There's also a small sundry shop open 24 hours. Enroute to the room, I discovered vending, ice and washer/dryer machines - a huge convenience. (Wash $1.50, Dry $1).The rooms are spacious 2-room suites witha cozy sitting area with a tv and fold-out sofa, comfortable working desk and coffee table. The middle of the room offers a kitchenette-like area with a large fridge, microwave, coffee maker, and plateware upon request from the front desk. Across from the kitchen is a reasonably-sized bathroom with the amenities you'd expect. The only negative feedback would be the need for some light preventative maintenance such as caulking and grout. The room (and most importantly the bathroom) were extremely clean.The bed was a tad on the firm side of comfortable and offered an assortment of pillows (2 soft, 2 firm - and labeled as such right on the pillowcase! Cool!) Although there's no on-demand movies, they have over 70 television channels. There was a LodgeNet controller for videogames, but no LodgeNet menu. Wierd.Although I did not partake, the property offers a complimentary hot breakfast with eggs, bacon, pastries etc. A nice perk!In the surrounding area, there's not much. A 10-minute walk takes you to a Denny's, Taco Bell, Jack In The Box, a diner and an awesome BBQ restaurant called Grand Roaster which was quite the dining experience. Check it out. Also, a little dive of a casino, the 'Silver Dollar' with only table games - no slots. I won $850!Overall, this was a great experience at the property and I would certainly return.

<Content>Super Clean My room was the cleanest hotel room I had ever stayed in. The front desk staff were very helpful in helping me get shuttles into town and to the cruise ship terminal. The buffet breakfast was a wonderful addition with lots of items to chose from. I would most certainly stay here again.

<Content>3 Time's the Charm I booked this hotel through hotwire.com, which indicated that it was a 3 star hotel. It wasn't. First, the property is old and it's showing its age. Second, there were large pumping hoses running down the stairwell; they hotel was having some work done on the plumbing system. When I checked in, the front desk workers did not welcome me, saying something to the effect of You booked this room through hotwire? I said yes, and they gave me a room on the 5th floor by the stairwell, with the hose running down the side of it. Now, this room had to be one of the smallest hotel rooms that I've ever stayed in. Since I didn't feel safe with the hose and door to the stairwell ajar, I returned to the front desk and asked for another room. The young man was obviously irritated, and he moved me one floor up, in an identical room, next to a stairwell, with a hose running down it that was propped open. When I saw the room, I muttered something like You've got to be kidding me, and the housekeeping manager overheard it. She asked what was wrong, and I explained the situation with the open stairwell, and not feeling safe. She escorted me back down to the lobby and asked the front desk clerk to put me into a better room, which he did. If it had not been for this lady's personal effort, I would have rated this Holiday Inn as terrible. The airport shuttle was also convenient, but the indoor pool was too cold to swim in (in March), and the whirlpool was crawling with children. Anyways, I'm a new trip advisor member, so I hope this review is somewhat helpful. If I had to pick a hotel at the SEATAC airport, it probably would not be this Holiday Inn.

<Content>not great Stayed in Room 324 which was clean but the door had been damaged which left a BIG gap around the frame...big enough for someone to get their fingers in and undo the latch/locks. I regret not asking for a different room. Noise level from other rooms was enough to keep me awake until 1 AM. Front desk said they were sorry but offered no compensation.

<Content>Clean and safe Stayed at this property for 2 weeks in March 2007. Extremely good housekeeping. Rooms always clean and well looked after. Most staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel will shuttle you to nearby restaurants.... a very long walk. Breakfast much more than the normal continental breakfast. Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone. Very clean and safe.

<Content>Great Deal This hotel was a great deal. If all you need is a clean place to sleep with friendly staff, this is the place. We needed to stay in Sea Tac for a wedding, and wanted a place that was not too expensive since we would not be hanging out in our hotel room much. The Holiday Inn Express exceeded our expectations. The room was very large with a microwave and refridgerator! There were two TVs, one in the bedroom area and one in the living area where there was a couch and desk. They also offered a very nice breakfast in the morning, complimentary! Instead of your normal cold continental breakfast, they offered bisquits and gravy, eggs, and cinnamon rolls (among other things). If you are looking for a good deal for a hotel stay, this is the place.

<Content>Good Experience We were in the area for a nearby convention and chose this location due to reasonable cost for a full suite. Despite the fact that this hotel is right at the airport, the noise level was not all that bad. The room was nice, the staff friendly and helpful. Would definately stay there again.

<Content>Everything you need If you need a stopover hotel for Seattle airport use this one. Great value for money, large, comfortable, quiet and clean rooms. Friendly, helpful staff - I had missed the allocated shuttle to the airport but they were more than happy to run one just for me - and the one the fastest most effecient check ins Ive ever had, thoroughly recommended.

<Content>One of nicest hotels of our trip This one continues to be a winner in terms of the spacious rooms with separate small living area, kitchenette, friendly staff, and good breakfast.We did hear the airplanes, so it might depend on the wind and which runways they are using.

<Content>Another excellent stay Good location--convenient to airport and I-5. Free parking. Large lobby with plenty of tables and room in the breakfast area.Clean. Elevators have tile floors rather than carpeting, so they can be kept clean. Friendly, efficient night clerk checked me in and out.Large room. Bathroom on the small side. Room has a wetbar area with sink, microwave, coffee maker, and half-size refrigerator. This would be a good choice for someone staying several nights for a business trip.Free continental breakfast has a wide choice of juices, boiled eggs, fruit, hot cinnamon rolls, and numerous other choices for both healthful and sinful eating.Free internet terminal in the lobby hallway for those not travelling with a laptop.Have stayed here before and will definitely return.

<Content>nice, we'd stay again Horizon Air bumped us and put us here.. they get it like for $38.. but free to us.Nice place, airport shuttle fast, entry very clean for a mid market hotel. Staff nice and helpful. Room larger than expected.. we were on the 5th floor and had 2 queens. Beds comfortable.Missed the breakfast because we had to go early.Safe and nice, we would stay again. Even if we had to pay for it ourselves. Don't think you could go too wrong with this property. Brian

<Content>Bed was hard, But Hotel was Great I stayed for 8 nights in Jan 06. The clerks at the front desk and every employee I encountered were very friendly and gave excellent customer service. The beds were hard. I was told that they are all new. I don't like a firm mattress but I wasn't miserable like I was in August at the Studios Plus in Renton. The extra firm mattress was the only problem during my stay. The room was great, big and comfortable. The room was very clean and kept very clean. The room was very well equipped with a microwave, mini fridge, large TVs with multiple channels of HBO and many other choices, iron, hair dryer, coffee maker with free daily coffee, a desk, a couch and a nice big vanity in the bathroom. The shower had good pressure, and the temperature never wavered. The bathroom door is a bit awkward. They should have used a pocket door but this was not a big deal. The hotel was quiet. I barely heard airplanes. There was no noise from neighboring rooms, not much from the hallway either. I did have a stomper over me a couple nights but that isn't the hotels fault. No street noise either even though it is on a busy street. The breakfast was way beyond the typical danish and coffee. There were multiple types of danishes, bagels, muffins, bread for toast. There were fresh warm cinnamon rolls. Choices for cold cereal and fruit. Instant oatmeal and multiple types of juices and beverages. There were hard boiled eggs and yogurts. There is a nice eating area in the lobby with a big TV. It was spotlessly clean, fresh and full every morning. There is a computer in the lobby that you can use for free with high speed internet. There are coin op washers and dryers on every floor.The parking is free. Freeway access in all directions is close and easy. Restaurant choices of all types nearby and they have a shuttle to many of them. I am a business traveler and I travel to Seattle often and I will be staying here again.

<Content>ok beds like boards This was a clean hotel, close to the airport, with free parking and a wonderful breakfast. However the beds were as hard as boards. The hardest beds I have ever slept in, neither my husband nor I slept well due to the beds being so uncomfortable. ( Desk clerk ruefully acknowledged that they had heard this before when I mentioned it next morning) - Plus the mattress cover did not even come close to covering the entire top of the mattress in our room. ( at least a foot uncovered.) would not stay here again due to the beds

<Content>I'd stay again! I don't know where some of the negative reviews have come from as I pretty much agree with the previous review to this one: check-in staff was very professional, room was nice (upgraded to a suite on a low rate without any Priority Club status!), nothing was broken or dirty, and the included breakfast was not outstanding, but quite adequate.Scrounging really hard for a negative,all I could come up with was that the tile floor in the bathroom and kitchenette area was ice cold - a bit jolting, but I managed to deal with it.

<Content>Great Stay! ... And Just Booked Again I had a great experience at the HI XPRS this past April and actually just booked another stay for tomorrow night. * The late night clerk who checked us in was friendly and efficient. * The room was large and comfortable- great shower!* The breakfast room and lobby area are very nice; the food selection is better than adequate.* The morning desk clerks were extremely helpful- as it turned out, I forgot something in the refrigerator and didn't realize it until I was waiting at my gate. I called back to the hotel and they connected me to housekeeping who was able to confirm that it was still there. The front desk gals were patient with me while I tried to get a friend to make a trip over to pick up my package to no avail. So, they offered to get it to the courtesy van driver who ran it over to the airport for me. They were all sweet and helpful! The only somewhat negative thing I could point out was that our room was waaaaaaayyy down at the end of a very long hallway. - Not too big of a deal unless you have a large pile of bulky luggage as we did. Certainly not a complaint though- just an observation and a learning experience.

<Content>Excellent Service Our group of five stayed at the Holiday Inn Express 19621 International Blvd., Seatac, WA on July 31 - August 6, 2005 and really felt at home. The young lady working at the desk was very friendly and helpful upon our arrival and continued to be helpful during our entire stay.The Continental breakfast was very good; Our room was kept nice and clean. When we had a problem and needed help, someone always assisted us immediately. I would highly recommend this motel for one desiring excellent service at a modest price.

<Content>I wouldn't book my dog in this place...... I wouldn't book my dog in this place......The desk clerks were rude to me and everybody that I observed them with. The room was dirty......The shower was broken.......There was a dirty mop and bucket outside the room just down the hall......It was there when we checked in and still there when we checked out......I think they generate more revenue as a long term parking for the airport so customer service has gone away.

<Content>No hurry to repair things... I've stayed at this property a few times when in Seattle on business and agree that it is relatively inexpensive and the staff are friendly. But, I've had consistent problems with a lack of follow-up on problems. During this stay, the so-called business center was broken the entire time and the staff said it has been non-functional for some time awaiting repairs. This location is in the middle of nowhere, so without a rental car there is no other way to print materials for the next day's meeting. In similar fashion, the fitness center is generally without clean towels even if you remind them the night before. Yesterday, the treadmill malfunctioned and threw me off when the belt slipped, so I switched to the other treadmill and it did the same! I immediately unplugged both and reported this to the front desk. This morning, they were both back in service and - you guessed it - still malfunctioning in the same manner. The front desk personnel would not let me speak to the manager until I demanded to do so, and she said that the treadmill worked fine for her a few days ago. In other words, they're not going to make any concerted effort to insure guest safety. Only when I persisted did she reluctantly admit that maintenance had decided the treadmills were OK yesterday but finally promised to actually call in treadmill repairmen today. Of course, no one has marked either piece of equipment as broken so they continue to let guests risk life and limb until someone is injured or the repairmen show up - whichever happens first. There are too many well-run hotels in the SeaTac area to stay at properties with such lackadaisical management.
