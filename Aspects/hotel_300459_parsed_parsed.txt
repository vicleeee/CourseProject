<Content>High quality city centre hotel I spent 3 nights here recently on business. The hotel has a very grand reception area and it is really the public areas of the hotel that make it stand out as good choice.It has a number of different restaurants and bars (the bar up on the 40 something floor has fantastic views, but does come with a table charge which I thought unnecessary) and the ones that I tried I found very good.The hotel is not located in the best shopping/business districts of Tokyo, but it is next to a metro station so getting round is very easy.I found the room size comparable with that of other city centre hotels (slightly small but large enough for a short stay) but did have a really good view of Tokyo Tower. The hotel was modern, clean and the staff friendly and efficient.Overall a very good hotel

<Content>Would stay here for business trip..... As a previous review mentioned ....most of the guests were westerners and on a business trip or at a conference. Mind you saying that whilst I was there the hotel held a very traditional Japanese wedding on the saturday and from what I could gather no expense was spared ! So perhaps the hotel is held in high regard by the locals ? ANA is a very clean and modern hotel. I stayed in a basic room on the 24th floor as I was only staying in Tokyo for 4 nights. Last time I stayed in Tokyo I was in the Palace Hotel and I felt that the hotel was in need of an 'upgrade' ...for want of an expression. ANA is perfect for the business traveller....and suits if travelling with your partner. Everything you need is in your room...if not ask and it will be . .. In fact if you need anything at all, the staff are all very eager to help and do more than is required of them. They really did try to make my stay as comfortable as possible and ALL staff were curtious, always willing to please and bent over backwards to help should you need any. For the more 'adventurous traveller' the hotel is located near the Roppongi ..literally a 10 minute stroll. ... Tokyo isnt necessarily the cheapest town in the world and the hotel certainly reflects that. I personally found the eating and drinking ''in house'' was particularly expensive. I had one incident which was most unexpected....got up one morning and there was NO water supply at all to the hotel...it was only off for 30 mins...but if one had appointments it was no consolation. When I returned later that day 2 bottles of red wine awaited me with a letter prefuse apology....which was very nice. I will stay again when I return to Tokyo . I would also recommend other business travellers and tourists ( if it's within your budgets) to stay there too.

<Content>A fantastic service : Director of guest experience The very first time I met Concierge Jerome Palacoeur was in Bora Bora at the InterContinental Le Moana resort, I had been pushed in the pool of the resort by some 鈥渇riends 禄 and when I walked out of the water he was standing there with a towel, a new dry key for my villa and a dry telephone chip for my mobile, that was in December 2002 and I was impressed.A few years later I found out he was head concierge of the acclaimed InterContinental Thalasso Spa in Bora Bora and returned to Bora Bora without knowing my stay would be that memorable Thanks to Monsieur Palacoeur. It was my wifes鈥檚 birthday and I asked Jerome to have some ballon brought to my overwater villas by outrigger canoe; any concierge can organise this, even in Bora Bora but a GOOD concierge is going a step further by asking the color of the balloons and this is what Monsieur Palacoeur did, again I was impressed.Lately I staid at the ANA Intercontinental Tokyo and discovered that Jerome was there as Director of guest experience, a challenge for him, a definite plus for the guests of this hotel. In a few months he has been in Tokyo, J. Palacoeur managed with his team to offer the real concierge 鈥淐l茅s d鈥檕r鈥?service. He is everywhere and knows everything, I don鈥檛 know how he does it but he and his team certainly deliver the experience a guest is looking for in a hotel such as the ANA InterContinental. This is not the best hotel in town in terms of service and quality, but thanks to Jerome, Japan and Tokyo have become for me a much easier destination to deal with than in the past : just to name a few of these Concierge experiences : my business cards in Japanese were ready within 2 hours (they could have been in my room if I ordered them in advance), my suits pressed upon check in in 60 minutes and best of all he has an incredible network and address book that gives him access to a 3 *** Michelin restaurant or a concert ticket for the Who鈥檚 who will be performing in town in October. Monsieur Palacoeur you may soon be a legend in the small world of Palace concierge around the world and will definitively make sure to stay again at the ANA InterContinental Tokyo or wherever you may end up in the world . Merci beaucoup Monsieur as you would say in French !

<Content>Great Find in an Expensive City Recently spent 3 nights at ANA Intercontinental Tokyo and give it high marks. From the moment you step from the taxi you are greeted with bowing and huge smiles. A staff member took my luggage and escorted me thorugh the grand lobby area to registration. Upon completion of registation, the same staff accompanied me to my room. The room was exceptional in amenities and cleanliness. Air conditioning worked beautifully.The location is less than a block to a Metro station and a 7-11 store. Also nearby is the American Embassy.As expected, hotel food was pricey.

<Content>Terrific stay Really enjoyed my stay here (business trip). The lobby is grandiose and stunning, with some very large falling water features next to the escalator, separating the lounge area from the reception. My room was clean, modern, and comfortable. I had two really nice meals in the hotel's sushi bar. The atmosphere is perfect, it's small and intimate, and perhaps needless to say the food is terrific. If there's anything to compain about, it would be the shear size and volume of the place... impossible not to feel like just one of the flock here. But some people like it like that.Will definitely stay here again when in Tokyo.

<Content>Treated like a rock star by the great staff I have been a road warrior for 30 years and have stayed in some of the finest hotels in the world. Recently I have been in Tokyo twice in the last few months and my most recent stay was fantastic. I have some problems with mobility and had written to the concierge staff to ask with help for finding a mobility scooter. When I arrived at the hotel on the Airport Limousine Bus I was met by the fantastic French native concierge J茅r么me Palacoeur and his staff. He had my scooter waiting there for me and they whisked me to my club level room with a minimum of fuss. Anything I needed during the week he was there as was Dorothy up in the Club Room.If you google J茅r么me Palacoeur you'll find he is a professionally trained concierge and has worked at some of the finest hotels in the world. All i can tell you is that his work is fantastic and I believe the ANA Intercontinental is lucky to have someone of that quality on staff. He seems to be everywhere. For experienced travelers using a concierge is a secret that helps our lives work better. Thank you JEROME!!!! Dean Hughson, Spirit Lake Iowa

<Content>Nothing wrong but not great (although excellent service) The ANA Intercontinental Hotel in Tokyo offers a good but somehow average stay. It definitely had one of the best services we have ever experienced. The Concierges are always available and helpful; although you may have some difficulties to communicate in English, they always solve your problem or answer your question. The lobby is very fancy and cool with its waterfalls, lights, plants and bars. The rooms are clean and pleasant, with views over the city, improving according to how high floor you stay at. But they remain very business and quite standard. If the hotel gives a feeling of luxury, it might not be as exquisite and special as you would expect it to be. Of course the panoramic views over the city from the Manhattan Lounge (36th floor) are definitely worth it, (and they have good Japanese steak meat). On the other hand, the inroom food you might order at night (you feel pretty jetlagged :)) is nothing special for the price. You unfortunatly have to pay extra to access facilities such as the pool and the gym, (1000Y to 1500Y per person and per session), which really feels like useless expenses, especially since the pool is pretty average (more of a public pool than a 5* hotel's). The location is ok (10 minutes walk from Roppongi and near a couple of subway stations), but if I should return to Tokyo I'd probably pick something like Shinjuku, Ginza or Shibuya, which are much more lively. The service is really the one thing that made us enjoy our stay at this hotel.

<Content>An outstanding value: Service in a Grand Style We (Mom, Dad and teenage daughter) arrived at the ANA on the Friendly Bus from Narita, tired from our overly long plane ride. As we left the bus, various ANA staffers took our bags, ushered us to reservations and helped us to our rooms. No tipping necessary. The ANA staff offers service the likes of which most 5 star American Hotels can only aspire to. The staff tries to anticipate your needs and respond accordingly. We also stayed at the ANA in Kyoto. Another great experience. You will not be disappointed by the rooms, service or staff. Price was a value compared to most costs in Japan.

<Content>Wow We stayed here for one night as part of our honeymoon adventure.This was an experience we will remember with much happiness, upon check-in where we were met with a smile you really felt you were in a 5 star hotel, we started off booked into a standard room, as we arrived early we were directed to the lounge for a complimentary coffee while our room was prepared and asked to come back for the key in 10 minutes, fine. When we returned we discovered to our delight we had been upgraded to an executive room, yay honeymoon! The room was fantastic! Clean, modern with an amazing view and really held to that 5 star promise. During our stay we had help from the concierge who politely smiled through our fumbled attempt at the language and provided us with maps, fantastic direction and a shuttle bus out to the airport.We booked in for the buffet breakfast the next morning and were extremely happy, everything that a buffet breakfast should be.Our checkout went extremely smoothly, the whole stay which was our last night for Japan which we loved couldn't have left a happier memory.

<Content>Much better than expected It had been years since I stayed at the Zen-Niku as it's known locally and I didn't have high expectations. I selected the hotel for its location and competitive room pricing. Since my previous visit the hotel has affiliated with Intercontinental and renovated the rooms. But there was more to appreciate than the new badge and the room reformations. Staff quality has definitely improved -- you'll find foreign faces at the front desk and on the floor. In years past, even some of the best Tokyo hotels had trouble with staff communicating with non-Japanese speakers. Even though I speak Japanese, I found it effortless to communicate with most staff in either English or Japanese. The room was clean, modern, efficient and functional. My only complaint here, a common traveler's lament, was the daily charge for internet in the room. I sampled two restaurants: the sushi bar (no complaints here) and the lobby lounge, where I had the breakfast buffet. The charge for the buffet, I thought, at about 40 dollars, was way too high. There are cheaper eating options in the attached Ark Mori complex. There is no doubt that the entry in the past couple of years of foreign super-luxury hotels into the Tokyo market has forced the traditional second-tier properties to upgrade as well. Being walking distance to Akasaka and Roppongi the ANA is an attractive choice for business and leisure travelers.

<Content>Absolutely loved this place, you should go! Well I don't normally title a review like that. It sounds like a review written by someone who has nothing to compare it to. But I usually do well over 100,000 miles travel a year (this year could be twice that), so I stay a lot of places (check out my other reviews), and this hotel really was just terrific.The service is impeccable from beginning to end. Just go visit the bar (which by the way is on the 3F) and watch in awe as your drink is placed precisely in front of you and served immaculately. Or go to the panorama bar (actual name is the Manhattan Room) on 36F and sip a Mojito whilst looking out over the city lights. That has to rank as one of the most romantic locations I've ever been. Pity I was on a business trip!The rooms are again precisely set out with Japanese attention to detail. Every conceivable amenity is there for you (iron, kettle, bar, snacks, very comprehensive bathroom bits and bobs). The style is sort of Frank Lloyd Wright with lots of darker wood. The bed compares closely to the Marriott Heavenly Bed. Actually a bit soft for my preference but luxurious.If you are leaving from here to go Narita the Limousine Bus goes from here. You can buy your ticket from the hotel and put it on your bill. I checked out and gave them my bags, then went off to a meeting for the morning. On returning in time for the 12.30 bus, without any further query on my part my bags were brought right to the point where the bus leaves, and were loaded for me. That was very cool.I only had one meal here, a lunch in the bar. It was terrific and presented with great style (great plating as they say). There are a great variety of on-site restaurants but I did not use them.I suppose there is not too much more to say. If you are looking for a refuge from a busy world and just want everything to be taken care of, I highly recommend that you stay here.

<Content>Fantastic Property I stayed at this hotel for the 2nd time in 3 weeks and loved it once again. As a Priority Club Ambassador member I was upgraded from a standard club level room to a club level junior suite. The hotel is good for it's location and offers convenient transportation to and from Narita for only 3000 yen.The showers in the club level rooms are very good and offer multiple shower heads and nozzles for a full body cleanse.I'm already looking forward to my next visit.

<Content>Solid hotel for business travelers I often travel to Tokyo for work and usually stay at either the Hotel Okura or the ANA InterContinental Hotel.The best thing about the ANA is the location. It's steps from the Tameike Sanno station on the Ginza and Nanboku lines. Plus, it's only a 10-20 minute walk to Roppongi and Akasaka.The rooms are average for hotels in this price range. Everything is in good order, but there is not much to wow you. The size is okay for central Tokyo. The furnishings are nice, though a little old (particularly the carpeting). The beds are comfortable but nothing like the fancy mattresses in most upscale hotels in the US these days.The bathroom feel especially outdated. The bathtub and the tiles are right out of the 1970s or 1980s. The shower curtains are quite utilitarian. The towels provided are merely average. I think you should get more from this level of hotel.The gym on the 6th floor is not bad. The equipment is relatively new and well maintained. If you are staying on a corporate or government plan, you can use the gym for free.Internet access in the rooms is provided by Ethernet jacks (not WiFi). Cat-5 LAN cables are in the desk drawer to connect your computer. As with the gym, if you are staying on a corporate or government plan, Internet access is free.Noise can be an issue if you are staying on the side facing the the elevated expressway. Cars and motorcycles zoom by at all hours of the night. I recommend asking for a room on the Tokyo Tower side of the hotel if you wish for peace and quiet.The level of service from the staff is good. They are both polite and helpful. No complaints on this front.Overall, the ANA InterContinental is a solid choice for business travelers. You won't be lacking anything.

<Content>Unforgettable first time to tokyo WOW, the first visit to Tokyo really was exciting. To top it off, I stayed in this amazing hotel. High rise, awesome view, great service, easily accessible too. Rooms are big bathrooms too. Great hotel amenities. Very central to Rippongi and akasaka. Even though it is more business district area, the subway close by can whisk you to all ends of Tokyo. Conceierge was extremely helpful. Also there is a direct limousine bus ride to and from Narita airport. Great service. I would definately consider staying here again when I come back.

<Content>Excellent hotel The hotel is in a good location one block from the American Embassy. The rooms are well done, with safes, refrigerators and marble baths. The staff is incredible. Bedding was spectacular. The location of the hotel is good with three major subway lines very nearby. There are not very many restaurants near the hotel, and the eateries in the hotel are quite costly. Tokyo is a spotlessly clean city and very easy to get around via the metro system. Walking, however, is another matter as few streets have street signs. Although I have a very good sense of bearing and direction, I never was able to discern north, south, east or west....odd! I would highly recommend a stay at this hotel. I paid $238/night which is considerably less than the room rate at the Marriott or Hilton, and I consider an Intercontinental a step above those two chains.

<Content>My home in Tokyo Over the past 3 years I've travelled to Tokyo frequently (approx 5 times a year). The company I work for have corporate rates with ANA InterContinental Tokyo so I always stay there.I love staying at ANA because the rooms are very clean and spacious, very high tech and the service is always good. Oh, and they have an excellent room service menu! I usually stay on one of the corporate floors so not really sure what the rooms on the lower floors are like.I used to stay at this hotel back in 2000-2001. Back then the hotel was very bling/decked out in gold and the rooms looked like they were from the 70s. They've since renovated the hotel and whilst the lobby is still a little too bling for my taste, the rooms are very nicely decorated in chic, neutral tones.The location of this hotel is excellent - walking distance to Ropponggi (for restaurants and bars) and there is a subway station right near it, so you can easily go to other areas of Tokyo.The service is excellent and the staff go out of their way to be of assistance. Once they even went to the convenience store to purchase deodorant for me, coz I forgot mine at home and was running late for work.

<Content>Great Hotel at Tokyo While at Tokyo on business, I stayed at Hotel Ana. Service is quite excellent. Even if there were plenty of guests awaiting check-in, there are many front desk staff to accommodate us, and rooms are large and overly clean. But the breakfast buffet on their ground floor restaurant is the best breakfast I have ever tasted in a hotel, and I have been to far more bigger and more expensive hotels. The location is very near the train station, and I spent a free afternoon at the Tokyo museum at the city's lovely Oueno Park.

<Content>Convenient, Well Done, Great Price I had to go to Tokyo for a Thursday meeting. They now run service from Hongqiao to Haneda, versus Pudong to Narita, thereby saving 1.5 hours at least of trip time in each direction. We left Wednesday night and came back Sunday mid-day.We stayed at the ANA as 1) corporate rate was $231 USD per night, 2) my office HQ is in the Akasaka Mori ARK next door and 3) this hotel has a great location and easy access to the Tokyo Metro.It took about 25 minutes and 6000楼 to get to the hotel from Haneda. We were drinking at the champagne bar by 6pm where pricing is on par with the location and the city itself. Afterwards, a short walk to Fukzushi for sushi. The rooms, service, etc. are what you expect, impeccable, clean and quiet. Breakfast in the morning was the usual mix of Western and Japanese offerings and quite good and was included in my corporate rate. We also used the bar at the top of the building which has a great view to the West of Asakasa. Pricing is expensive.This hotel, and you can get rates close to my corporate rate, is an outstanding value for Tokyo and Asakasa. It's well located, easy access to the metro and quiet.

<Content>Good location, great hotel Service is great, and very typical of fine Japanese hospitality. The staff were effiecient, always friendly and professional. The location was convenient, located walking distance to Tamieke-Sanno subway station with direct access to the Ginza and Chiyoda lines (and to some extent the Namboku line), getting around was easy. Access to Shinjuku on the Maranouchi line is also very convenient. The station did not get overcrowded at peak times so it was easy to travelThe hotel has good food, and a bakery selling scrumptious looking pastries and cakes. Rooms were comfortable and roomy, very clean. The rooms come with information on Tokyo in general and the Akasaka area, these come in handy. I would definately stay here again if in Tokyo

<Content>Excellent Value, Professional Staff, Hard Beds My most recent stay at this hotel found it spotless, as usual. All staff are professional, efficient, competent and impeccable. The lobby is airy and relaxing with water effects, plants, etc. There is a small shopping arcade which includes clothing  accessory boutiques, convenience store, flowers, bakery, etc. There are several somewhat pricey restaurants in the hotel. The common areas of the hotel are immaculate.The room had nice lighting, a flat panel TV, small frig, hot water pot, desk, small sofa (some of the ANA room sofas are so small as to preclude sitting), an overly firm mattress, great comforter/duvet and the most wonderful soft fluffy pillows. Two types of robes are provided - traditional western and yukata. The plumbing was excellent. A fabulous shower/tub with superb water flow (wish my home bath was like this!). The mirror was fog free, the toilet the usual many functioned Japanese toilet. There were complimentary toothbrushes, toothpaste, sewing kit, cotton tips, etc.There was complimentary instant coffee, plum tea (more of a salt broth type flavor), and green tea (bag type) - however, all were of low quality. The hotel location is good for riding the Metro - located between two subway stations. A variety of dining nearby. There is a great little grocery store (Pororoca) less than 2 blocks away that has fresh produce, and a variety of drinks, snacks, chocolates, etc. at reasonable prices. I have stayed at the ANA Tokyo many times, the most recent being after the Intercontinental acquisition of ANA hotels. Prior to the takeover, I stayed on the club floor. This last stay was on a non-club floor. So I'm not sure if some of the changes are due to the new owners or just the difference between the club floor and regular floors. I say all that to say this: the standard room of this most recent stay (after IC takeover) had bulk toiletries in the shower - large dispensers of shampoo, conditioner and soap, all Shiseido brand and smelled nice. There was a bulk soap dispenser at the sink. Conspicuously absent was LOTION. My stays on the club floor prior to the takeover, I seem to remember all kinds of charming little toiletries, including lotions, all individual sized. With the current airport restrictions on liquids/gels, I have come to depend more on hotel toiletries. I never used them before, but now I find I carry only the most unique (to me) items that will fit in the quart size bag - and rely on the hotel to supply the (more common) rest. So the absence of lotion was annoying. Sooo - whether the absence of toiletries was due to non-club floor or the new IC way of doing things, I'm not sure.The only negatives that were experienced with this stay were minor: the pens in the room were cheesy and wouldn't write - they replaced them and the next batch was fine; the hairdryer on the cool and set settings was useless unless you have three days to dry your hair - the high setting worked OK; the weight scale didn't work, probably due to dead battery. The used glasses and tea cups were not sanitized - apparently just rinsed off in the sink at best - which often doesn't actually get them clean. For me personally, this is intolerable. Makes me wonder if they are sanitized or just rinsed after the last guest!!! And I do not care to re-use MY OWN glass without sanitizing it between uses. Overall, this hotel is an excellent value. A similar level of atmosphere/service in the USA would cost three times what I paid here. And I have stayed here enough times to find them to be consistently superior. Whether the new IC ownership will change this remains to be seen.

<Content>Great hotel and location We had a great stay at this hotel in early November.Staff very helpful and polite at check in. The reception area was ultra spacious and airy.Arrived at the hotel at about 11.45am but couldn't check in until 3pm. My husband said that the staff didn't speak that good English so he wasn't sure if that was because we were being upgraded. We were really tired and this was a bit irritating but we did get a fantastic room with a great view towards Roppongi Hills and Tokyo midtown.There are eating places behind the hotel and a Starbucks coffee place which were handy while we waited to check in. There is also a bakery shop in the hotel and I recommend the cinnamon swirls with cream on top!The metro stations we used were Roppongi 1 itchome which was only a few minutes away and Tameike Sanno station literally steps away at the front of the hotel. Although this station is close the Ginza line was a bit of a walk underground.The bar at the top of the hotel was great for cocktails with a fantastic view of the Mori Tower at Roppongi Hills. I also enjoyed the Da Vinci bar on the third floor which had low lighting and a pianist which was relaxing.We had a meal at the restaurant on the same floor as reception. Food was excellent but very small portions. They did a buffet which looked good but this stopped at 9.30pm.We found out by accident that you needed to book the Limousine bus back to Narita which thankfully we did. It took about an hour and a half to get to the airport.I would recommend this hotel for it's location ameneties and great rooms.

<Content>Stunning hotel, location so so Usual Intercontinental standards and prices! We upgraded to an Executive room, (only because I wanted to be on a high floor 33+) but we got a lot more than we bargained for, free buffet breakfast - including small selection of hot items, free pre dinner drinks and canapes (including champagne), so we managed to get our monies worth!! Rooms well decorated and recently rennovated (although bathroom was a bit small). Again as with all my recommendations for Japan, do not eat in the hotel (the quality is good but very over priced). You really need to research the area well and ensure the restaurants in your guide book still exist, you'll need full addresses (as during our 6 night stay not one taxi driver knew were he was going!).

<Content>Pretty Much the Standard Expected I found the ANA InterContinental to be pretty much just what I expected. Large and rather impersonal with good quality rooms and all the amaneties you would expect from an InterContinental hotel.Room size is rhather on the small side but everything in general was in very good condition. Maybe with the exception of the tiny bathroom that would have needed some refurbishment.What makes it an above average hotel in my opinion is a) the perfect location close to many things andb) the superior service offered by it's staff.All in all a place I would return to.

<Content>Have stayed in better Intercontis Nice but nothing special, big, lots of marble and anomymous.Staff are frantic all the time and it gives the impression of being disorganised which to their credit it is not. The business centre was very expensive and not as helpful as they could be. I asked for something to be translated and they just looked at it and said 'too difficult' eventhough they do advertise a translation service.The beds are fantastic though. Minibar could do with doubling the content!!!

<Content>Very Good Hotel I stayed in the ANA Intercontinental at the end of September for five nights and thought it was great. The room was large, particularly by Tokyo standards; though I have the feeling I may have been upgraded to a superior room. The bed was very comfortable. Decor was black marble, which is what Intercontinental seem to be going for in a lot of their hotels and seems to work in modern city locations. The serivce is very good and anticipates your needs. The restaurants are pretty expensive, but are very good.Access to the underground network is very easy, though the station next door is huge and you can end up doing a lot of walking to get the line you want. It's pretty easy to navigate and is the best way to get around Tokyo. Taxis aren't that expensive either. There is a frequent bus service that takes you from the hotel to Narita airport.The only complaint is that they do seem to have decorated the hotel and forgotten about the bathrooms, they were small and basic.In summary, for it's location and standard of decor and service, the ANA Intercontinental is good value for money for Tokyo and I would stay there again.

<Content>Stereotypical I arrived at this stereotypical hotel with it鈥檚 Western feel, but impeccable Japanese friendliness and quickly located my room, through the vast impersonal lobby. The view from the twelfth floor window overlooking Tokyo was impressionable, even better the amazing view from the top floor bar and restaurant.Room had the normal 鈥榖its and bobs鈥?you expect from a hotel of this calibre, but the bathroom was miniscule; had to breathe in to close the door. Also the room size wasn鈥檛 too great.Centrally located, a 700 yen cab ride to the nightlife of Roppongi and adjacent to Tameike-sanno tube station, which also links by walking underground to Kokkai-gijidomae, in case you are arriving via Tokyo station; as the latter has a direct connection on the Marunouchi line (red). The underground walkways at the former two stations are extremely large, so head for exit 13 to locate the hotel, which is just in front of you as you pop up, if you take 20 paces in the same direction as the escalator you are travelling on.The hotel won鈥檛 set you alight, as you will expect by it鈥檚 price and star rating a high quality, but it is a safe bet. Finally, don鈥檛 miss the Tsukiji fish market for a great 7AM early morning experience.

<Content>Very comfortable, good location Arrived at the Intercontinental on the airport bus - reasonably priced, took an hour. The hotel is in the luxurious bracket, lots of marble and shiny surfaces, good reception staff. The room was large enough, with a comfortable bed, an LCD TV and enough space to walk around. The bathroom, as has been said in other reviews, is pretty small, and was was the only downer. Internet access was very fast and fairly cheap.The bar on the top floor was very nice with good views, I didn't try the food.Location wise, only a 20 minute walk to Rappongi (if you really have to go, I wouldn't bother), or 660 yen in a taxi. The metr is bang next door so it is easy to get around the city.The best price I found was on the hotel's own website.Overall, a very nice place to stay.

<Content>First class all the way Being conveniently located in Ark Hills right near a subway station and an Airport Limousine dropoff was my original reason for staying here, but I've since stayed here two more times. Service and room accommodations are Westernized, but with Japanese style and the highest level of quality applied to every facet of the hotel.I think the original Cascades waterfall was more beautiful back in 2003 as it had marble streams that flowed into the lobby. It's still quite magnificent, though the 'streams' are gone. But with the remodeling came some very futuristic additions - electronic placards display hotel events  restaurant menus, digital world clocks, and an array of artistic images electronically projected on large screen monitors.The main restaurant offers breathtaking views of Tokyo, complimented by a piano bar and other live venues on the occasion. One night the pianist played something quite familiar - the Brady Bunch theme!Strange, but amusing.The only real meals I had during my multiple visits was breakfast, which were all fine continental affairs with the addition of traditional Japanese fare. Business kept me away during dinner time, but I'll try next time.The rooms are smallish, but well appointed with wide screen LCDs, every digital appliance you could need, a wet bar, and a firm mattress with buckwheat pillows.This was also the first time I've ever used a bidet, though it took a few tries to operate it without getting doused, as the instructions were in Japanese. The multi-lingual hotel staff was quite helpful, and the currency exchange was quite fair, unlike my experiences in other cities where you would expect to take a beating for the convenience. I can't really say anything negative about the ANA Hotel. I fell in love with Japan here, and the pleasant memories linger.

<Content>Comfortable, but uninspiring BookingWe booked our stay over the Intercontinental website. The process was easy and even though we booked an advance purchase rate, my credit card was only charged upon check-out.LocationThe hotel is pretty well located (Akasaka) with access to the subway within 5 minutes by foot. There are 4 subway lines accessible - the Ginza line is closest (300m) and the others are up to 1km away, all underground. The hotel is not too far from Roppongi - cab fare is Y600 - Y800. It's about Y1,500 from Tokyo station by cab.Check-InCheck-In was a smooth process. We arrived a little early and were accommodated (the hotel didn't seem very full) straight away. Staff were friendly and polite (common theme throughout the country).RoomsThe room was of a decent size. We were able to accommodate 2 full sized suitcases without tripping over them. We were on the 20th floor and had a decent view looking towards Roppongi. Housekeeping was a little slow though, our room would only be made up in the late afternoon which is not optimal when you head back lunch time for a rest.I really struggled with the bed, it wasn't comfortable at all. Furthermore, the standard pillows were way too soft, so I requested hard ones and these were like bricks. I didn't sleep at all well any of the 3 nights we spent at the hotel.The mini-bar was well stacked, but prices were as you'd expect in a 5-star hotel and we didn't partake.MealsMeals inside the hotel were on the expensive side and with so much on offer in a fantastic city like Tokyo, we only ate one breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast buffet itself was brilliant, but a little costly. We certainly attempted to eat enough for value! There are a couple of cheaper places in the adjoining arcade if you're looking to spend a little less, but still enjoy close-by convenience.PoolThe pool looked good (from our hotel window), but we didn't actually use it. We didn't see anyone swimming, although it was quite hot and humid.Concierge / ActivitiesThe friendliness and assistance provided by the concierge was extremely welcome. There was always a knowledgable English speaking person at the desk, who was eager to assist and they provided us with some valuable tips to maximise time efficiency.The business centre was well equipped, although once again, the prices were a bit on the high side. I think Internet access cost approx Y500 for 15 minutes. The lobby was large, airy and elegant.Check-outOnce again a smooth process although it took a while to convince them to give a short check-out extension as we had a time-clash with our Imperial Palace excursion. They were able to store our luggage for the remainder of the day.OverallThere is nothing wrong with the hotel, but my feeling towards it is neutral, considering the price one has to pay. Whilst we got a good deal for a 5-star hotel, I have stayed in other 5-star hotels worldwide where my experiences have been standout and the prices have been comparable or better. I would probably select a different hotel next time I'm in Tokyo.

<Content>Fabulous Service I am currently staying at this hotel. This is also my first trip to TOKYO and was not sure what to expect. Unlike hotels in major cities where the lobby and ambience is great but lack the service, this hotel truly offers excellent service. My room though nonsmoking smelt of residual smoke. I talked to the reception and they immediately changed the bedding and provided me with a deionizer.Service calls were answered in less than 5 minutes.The hotel is in a good location. I would recommend checking out the local restauarants before eating in the hotel restaurants since they are pricey.

<Content>Big, Nice but unspectacular I stayed at the ANA Intercontinental for the first leg of my business trip (Taipei and Beijing followed). The hotel is/feels gigantic but the staff is extremely attentive and the amenities (health club, etc) are very nice. I was on the club floor which had nice rooms and access to the lounge--light breakfast, drinks and a light dinner. The rooms are nice and large--but mine was a little dated. For a high end hotel, i would expect the shower head to be intact and not leaking (streams of water flying everywhere).Since this was my first trip to Tokyo, i have no frame of reference. The rooms seemed larger than I had envisioned and the food was better. The location of the hotel was great--but it didn't feel like a 5-star property--the Grand Hyatt in Taipei and Raffles in Beijing were definitely nicer.

<Content>Stunning hotel, decent location We stayed in the executive floor, which features spotless and very classy rooms. The lounge is wonderful, with Glenlivet and other high end liquor on tap, and tasty snacks. The remodeled rooms featured plasma screens, and electric everything. Overall just beautifully appointed, and not too expensive by Tokyo standards. The staff is wonderful, too.The hotel is maybe a quarter mile from a subway intersection, but the walk is long if the weather isn't cooperating. It's not walking distance to anywhere else, really, although there are some nice restaurants within a couple of blocks.Bottom line: a five-star hotel, a three-star location

<Content>Great location; superior service Great hotel for business purposes. Staff was highly professional, expedient, and competent. At times it seemed as if there was one staff member per guest in the lobby - all ready to help with a nod of your head. Room quality excellent; bedding was very comfortable. Gym accessible via only a few elevators and relatively small (however rarely busy).Sleek, contemporary design in lobby area - amazing flower arrangements - ikebana - if you're interested in that sort of thing. Superb dining choices, particularly if you don't have time to leave the hotel. Excellent spot for business meetings. Small, limited selection of tourist shopping inside; just enough to satisfy someone there for a short stay. Right around the corner from the US Embassy and within walking distance to Roppongi. (That said, try NOT to make Roppongi your only stop should you be a first-time visitor to the city.)

<Content>Great hotel but be careful.. We stayed at this hotel on 3 occassions over 2 weeks and we were very happy with the accommodations. I鈥檓 very surprised someone grumbled it wasn鈥檛 up to Intercontinental standards, I鈥檝e stayed in over a dozen Intercontinentals and it certainly is. If you get the right room. We were booked into a standard room (generally floors less than 20) The room wasn鈥檛 too bad,but just a little tired looking. The furniture is the same as in the superior rooms, it just appears to have been more used. The rooms are much larger than what we expected for Tokyo. You can get a view of Tokyo Tower if you really want to. The station was a bit of a hike, about 15 minutes, which was a bit of a downside. Also, the bathroom while nice had a shower curtain instead of a glass door, but otherwise the bathroom was top notch. Note that in a standard room, you get the fairly sad Intercontinental own brand of toiletries, but in the superior rooms you get really nice Elemis(a top spa brand) toiletries. This is an easy way to figure out if you are in a standard or superior room. I鈥檓 sorry to say but in our second stay, we got put in a standard and we were told it was a superior. If it wasn鈥檛 for the fact that we had been in a superior, we would have been none the wiser. So be careful about this. However, we were put into a club room when we complained, which intriguingly was smaller, but it did have a nice view and of course lounge access. Didn鈥檛 eat in the restaurants, but I met Iron Chef Hiroyuki Sakai in the lobby so I鈥檓 sure the food must have been of a high standard. Meeting him was a big high point for me, and if you are an Iron Chef fan, Chen Kenichi鈥檚 restaurant is also nearby. Feel free to email me if you want more Iron Chef information, we went to most of their restaurants. As mentioned by others, the airport bus goes straight there, just under 1 hour if there鈥檚 minimal traffic, 1.5hrs if there is. Don鈥檛 even think about trying to use the train if you have anything more than hand carry luggage, even if you can find the lifts(we couldn鈥檛) the path to the hotel is still very long. Additionally, everyone in the train and station will hate you. Spend the $30 for the bus.

<Content>Excellent business hotel Huge modern hotel in Akasaka. Scores of restaurants; very large, elegant lobby. Great service, like in all good Tokyo hotels (far and above the level in USA or Europe).The location is good; 100 feet from a metro station on the Ginza line; about 5 stops to Ginza and 5 stops to Omote Sando (Harajuku/Ayoama area).I had a phenomenal view of Tokyo Tower from my window.One thing that many visitors don't know is that a few blocks away is the Akasaka entertainment district (basically one long street chockfull of restaurants, bars, clubs). At night, it's very festive and fun to walk around.

<Content>Great service We stayed for 2 nights in April while traveling to Tokyo for leisure; the ANA is a very nice contemporary hotel and what you would expect for a room that cost in the mid-200 dollar range per night. The rooms are large enough - i.e., you won't feel claustrophobic and there is enough room for 2 people to room together comfortably. Free internet access. The bathrooms are nice  clean (I'm very picky about bathrooms). The staff speaks limited English but are very accomodating and polite. Breakfast at the Intercontinental Lounge (for members) was excellent with gorgeous views. Beautiful lobby/atrium. About a 5 minute walk to the Tokyo metro station, with a mall nearby. More impressively, we lost our cell phone (we didn't remember where - train or taxi) and the staff was able to locate it for us within an hour.We also stayed at much more expensive places this trip (Mandarin Oriental Tokyo and Gora Kadan resort in Hakone) and felt the ANA was a better value for the money. Not a super luxurious hotel where one goes to be pampered, but definitely a good balance of price and quality. Keep in mind that there is something like a 15%-17% tax on all hotel rooms.

<Content>Average at best I found the ANA Intercontinental to be merely acceptable. The room was not particularly clean, the staff were okay but not particularly friendly, the breakfast buffet was decidedly average, and the phone in the room (which was important to me as a business traveller) was circa 1980. Having said that, if you have business in the Ark Mori business or at an embassy, the location is great. I will be trying the Okura next time around as it is similarly located and I have recently heard some good reviews.

<Content>Wonderful Hotel in a great location We spent one night at the ANA Intercontinental Tokyo and loved it. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I requested hypo-allergenic pillows and the staff brought me several pillows to choose from.My nine year old daughter especially liked the heated toilet with all sorts of gadgets. Also, the mirror in the bathroom is heated so after you shower you can still see in the mirror. Great for men who shave after showering. Our room on the 23rd floor looked out towards the Tokyo Tower ~ an especially nice view at night. Sidenote: be careful of the 600 yen seating charge just for being at the lounge on the 36th floor. The hotel is centrally located and close to the subway station. We walked to the Tokyo Tower (about 20 minutes). Close to Rappongi. I would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Decent, comfortable well located hotel. Stayed at the Ana Hotel in Tokyo in March, and found it very comfortable and clean. We paid 19,500 yen a night for a standard twin room on 26th and 22nd floors (we stayed for four nights initially, and three nights a week later). Both our rooms were pleasantly decorated in a neutral, western style with good lighting, comfortable beds with duvets and flat screen TV. In particular, the beds were extremely comfortable! Whilst not huge, the design and inclusion of a small seating area in front of the large window providing great views across the Imperial Palace and Diet Building from one room, and the Tokyo Tower and Roppongi in the other, gave some sense of space. The bathrooms in both rooms were adequate- unlike the room decor and furnishings these don't appear to have been upgraded recently.Our first room, on the Imperial Palace side of the building, suffered from condensation- the picture window would mist up and in the morning was covered in condensation. There was no sign of damp in the room and the problem seemed confined to the window itself, but still it was annoying as it meant missing out on an amazing view. Looking from outside the Hotel, it seemed this was a problem for some other rooms too.Other than a bit of a wait at check-in for our first stay because of a french film festival being hosted at the Ark Hills concert hall, service was efficient and helpful. The conceirge secured us a great table at the Park Hyatt New York Grill for lunch and booked our spaces on the bus back to Narita without fuss. Communal areas are attractive with lots of comfortable seating.Breakfast (buffet) at the hotel was very good indeed, with a wide choice of Western and Japanese options, and more reasonably priced at than the other hotels we stayed in Japan. In the immediate vicinity to the hotel there are some restaurants dotted around the Ark Hills Complex. Aux Baccanales provides acceptable french standards and has a good range of wines by the glass. The Andersens bakery/cafe provides an excellent, filling breakfast for 650-800 yen.We very much liked the location of the hotel- the immediate vicinity is reasonably quiet, being next to the Ark Hills Complex with its gardens and the American Embassy behind- and you can walk to the Imperial Palace, Ginza and Akasaka within 15 minutes each, and there's a subway station just outside the hotel. We would definetely consider staying again.

<Content>Great public spaces but rooms a little tight It'll be interesting to see what Intercontinental Hotels do with this hotel when they take over ANA in the New Year. The service and staff here are excellent with one of the most efficient check-outs I've ever seen and a bell-boy/concierge service that is run like a military operation. The rooms however are a little dissapointing but having come from generous rooms in Singapore, I guess I just had the wrong expectation. Breakfast on the Exec Floor was limited but good and once again the staff most courteous. If I were Interconti - I'd upgrade the rooms, but leave the rest - it works.

<Content>Excellent location, spacious rooms The ANA hotel was one of 3 different hotels offered to me by the organizers of a conference I was attending in Tokyo. I had no idea which of the 3 hotels would be best as I had never been to Tokyo before. A Trip advisor forum expert for Tokyo suggested the ANA would be the best selection of the 3 hotels offered to me by my conference and the advice was perfect!ANA hotel was located right next to a subway station that has service on 5 different lines on Tokyo metro line which was perfect as the subway is the best way to get around the city.The hotel is in a neighbourhood that is bustling and very cosmopolitan, the area is filled with various shops and many restaurants (both Western and Japanese) all within walking distance.Rooms were spacious especially for a busy city such as Tokyo, rooms were modern, well designed and very clean. An impressive lobby area will greet you for check in and the rooms do not disappoint after your initial greeting.Hotel amenities are good, service is excellent , hotel has a polite and friendly staff most of whom speak English very well.
