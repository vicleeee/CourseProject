<Content>Fantastic choice in el DF We returned to Mexico City for two nights and were very pleased with our choice of the W Hotel.Most notable about the hotel is its outstanding staff. From the bellmen to the fitness center attendant, everyone is very welcoming and eager to assist. The concierge provided useful guidance on restaurants.The fitness center is well-equipped and the spa has good facilities. Our room, on the 22nd floor, was well appointed, very comfortable and extremely quiet. We enjoyed a nice view of Chipultapec Park.We have visited Mexico City several times, and most recently stayed at the Condesa df hotel. While I prefer the Condesa neighborhood (it's hipper -- think SoHo in NY), Polanco (the Beverly Hills of Mexico) is also a good choice.I would highly recommend this hotel. My only advice to guests who stay there is to ask the bellman to phone a radio (sitio) taxi, rather than taking the hotel town car, as a radio taxi will be about 1/3rd the cost.

<Content>Not for business travelers! This is a great hotel if you're going to party. This is not the hotel to stay in if you want a good night's sleep, or are there for business. Too many young partiers yelling in hallways, slamming doors in the middle of the night to get any rest or get any work done from the hotel in the morning, even if you wear earplugs. They need to install systems on the door to make them close more quietly, like I've seen at many hotels (like the Hilton at Ave of Americas in New York - those doors are super quiet). The staff is extremely nice and accommodating, but there isn't much they can do to help you get some sleep. I would suggest they set up separate floors for business travelers. That would help. Also, the lighting isn't bright enough to work in the rooms. I would suggest the JW Marriott if you're a business traveler, right next door. If you're there to party - the W is the perfect hotel. Also, being in Polanco area, it is not cheap. There aren't any close by places to grab a cheap, quick meal, etc.

<Content>Ill suited for a business travelers; better for a traveling rock star The W hotel in Mexico City looks great on the outside but is overall ill suited for a business traveler.The constant DJ disco beats begin when you approach the hotel lobby and follow you to reception, the gym, outside your room and even at 6:00 AM in the morning when you'd like a quiet breakfast in the restaurant with a newspaper. The hotel is located close to terrace bars on the street which complement the constant DJ noise in the lobby with plenty of music in your room (until 3 or 4 AM) if you stick around for the weekend.If I were a 20 year old traveling rock star, I would love this place and spend most of my time below in the lobby bar or out on the street in one of the terrace bars.However, I go to Mexico City for business and when I'm back in my hotel room at 10 or 11 PM after a day of meetings or at breakfast at 6:30 AM before more meetings I like peace and quiet.However, I have two positive things to say: (1) the hotel gym is cool (most Mexico City hotels have hot gyms), well maintained equipment and the view is nice and (2) the English summary newspaper given to you free every morning is nice (most hotels only have Spanish local newspapers although many of the guests are English speaking).My recommendation if you are going to Mexico City on business: stay at the EL CAMINO REAL or the HOTEL INTERCONTINENTAL which cost the same and are better suited for business travelers.

<Content>Good for young singles not so good for families Great location (close to the Anthropology museum, a must see in Mexico City), a hip hotel, would recommend to young singles as this place rocks most nights. The bar is packed and the music is great. The rooms are incredibly spacious and clean, but they are dark, the whole focus being on hip and trendy (there's a hammoc in the bathroom over the bath) rather than function. The beds are comfortable and luxurious but such basic amenities as cotton buds and cotton wool have to be asked for. We also requested three adjoining rooms and gave plenty of notice and reconfirmed the week before, however we only got two adjoining (and they do have three adjoining rooms available). The desk staff did try to resolve this but were only helpful to a limited extent. However, the concierge was incredibly friendly and full of recommendations of where to go and how to get there. If you want to save money though, don't use the hotel car, it's at least double the price of the taxis and as long as you're careful and don't take the green and white vw bugs, taxis in Mexico appear to be safe enough.

<Content>Love this hotel! We stayed at this hotel for three nights in July 2008 and I cannot say anything negative about it. The location is great and there is a nearby subway station. The staff is very helpful and friendly, but what I really loved was the room and how hip the place is. There are restaurants within walking distance, including a Starbucks across the street.

<Content>Modern, Hip, Hammock in the Shower A jumping, hip place, with a very friendly staff. I've stayed here a couple of times overnight on business. The disco adjacent to the reception area seems to be hopping all night, but it hasn't impaired my ability to get a good night's sleep. The beds are VERY comfortable. However, if there is someone noisy in the hallway (say, a maintenance worker with a walkie talkie at midnight), that will wake you up -- the door must be cardboard! The rooms are ultra modern and spacious. The tumbled marble shower area in the Spectacular class room (mid-range) takes up the back 1/3 of the room and the entire picture window. It has to be about 12 x 12 feet and includes a hammock, in addition to a rainshower shower head and two body sprays. Not that I've ever had any inclination to lounge in a hammock in my bathroom. . .The staff is exceptionally friendly and eager to please. All in all, a nice place to stay, and definitely a departure from a typical business-trip type hotel.

<Content>Short Business Trip The W Hotel in Mexico City is a fine hotel, based on my experience, but it does lack in some details.I checked in around 2am and while the lobby bar seems very hip and crowded, the noise level made it difficult to talk with staff at the front desk.My luggage was lost (no fault of the hotel) and they were nice enough to provide essentials such as toothbrush, etc. The room was very comfortable, excellent TV set, and an unusual shower with a hammock near it. Some updating needs to be done with the room so that drains work, etc. but overall it was OK. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Extra charge for the broadband access, but it worked fine.The front desk staff was helpful and wake-up calls were timely. I think with a few more amenities, this could be a top-notch hotel. The area for the hotel is a nice part of Mexico City, with good restaurants within walking distance.

<Content>my favorite of the hotels in Polanco I've stayed here about 5 times in the last year. Unlike some people, I have had great experience with the front desk staff. The rooms are cool, although it is a bit wierd that your shower is the only window to the outdoors! Having said that, I love the shower/hammock. Very relaxing after a long day riding over speedbumps in a car. Comfortable bed, A/C works well, nice to have the little stereo with mellow house music playing. Restaurant isn't the best or the worst in Polanco, just order the Tortilla soup, I love it. Bar is great for soaking in the Polanco scene, although it can be crowded on some nights of the week.Nice gym, only 3 treadmills, but I've never had trouble getting on one.Rates seem to be better than JW Marriott and Nikko, but worse than Intercontinental

<Content>If you like modern design you will love the W Hotel We were able to inspect this hotel operation during our last 2 days in Mexico DF, we did use a number of service in the hotel but did not stay overnight, however had the chance to inspect each Guest Room category; here is what we found:The W Hotel is very well located in Polanco next to other International 5 star hotel operations; it will take you about 30 minutes to 1 hour from the air port to the hotel. The hotel is in its 3rd year of operation, very modern dressed up and may be not for every once taste.The Front desk is fast, does handle guest request promptly, fast and efficient, the lobby bar offers all kind of international beverage, the cocktails taste very good, price value is fine, the decoration and furniture are very nice.We took lunch in their 1st floor Restaurant which also is connected to a very nice and large out door area overlooking the parts of Polanco. The food was very well presented, outstanding in taste, the service extremely friendly, very well trained and fast. The price values for both FB are perfectly in line with the product.We used their Spa for Spa Treatments; it is a very nicely decorated Spa on the 4 floor with small pool area, GYM, Temazcal and relaxing area, please note this is a City Spa and decorated with a very modern D茅cor. The Spa Service was very good; the bar does offer health beverage very low prices, keeping the limitations of a City Spa in mind this is a very good choice.The Guest rooms are large, well decorated, fully equipped with all amenities needed and are well sound proved; again the d茅cor is very modern however fits perfectly into the overall design concept.Looking at the over all Hotel Product, keeping all Guest Services and Standards in mind, looking at a perfect price value, the W Hotel for sure is a very good place to stay while in Mexico DF.

<Content>Really great room and service We used Starwood points to stay here for free, so obviously a good value for money. I'm not sure i'd be as enthusiastic if we had to pay the going rate... As the hotel wasn't fully booked, we ended up with a superb room on the top floor (beneath the penthouse) with spectacular views, and a bathroom that I'm still dreaming about. The bed was super comfy, the room was huge, and the public areas were artfully designed. Very chic.We had absolutely excellent service, with a reception from the front desk, and concierges that booked nearly everything for us. We thought the service was great....Would stay here again!

<Content>Cool to look at, A pain to stay at Like all W's this is a visually stunning hotel with a clearly stated attitude of Cool. Tons of attention spent on lighting, building materials, primary and contrasting colors, and a casually cool staff all come together to make a clear statement. Great place to walk thru or to step in for an afternoon ... staying there is another thing.The endless techno music starts at 6am and goes until ... sometime in the morning I suspect and wears. Guest rooms are visually cool, but take a day or so to learn how to actually stay in. Small things like a neat industrial sink in the room that has water pressure that splatters the rest of the room. A great looking bed that defies comfort. Lighting that is better suited to seduction than reading. Special mention is the combo shower, sun, hammock, and bathroom space. The hammock is great (easily the most comfortable piece of furniture in the room) but over a tile floor which means a certain amount of prayer on getting in an out of. The shower is a rainforest head which drops so much water that the relatively shallow drain is defeated and the water flows into the bedroom area. Meeting rooms are set up too tight and quickly become to hot and stuffy. Food again looks good but tastes off. The bar area is really cool at night but uncomfortable to sit in for any length of time. The restaurant is OK in quality but overpriced to what is delivered to the table. Parking is expensive and car retrieval is slow at best. The staff is helpful, but non-directed.The W is located in a whole row of hotels that are priced more or less the same. Would recommend the Inter-continental or the Sheraton or the a couple blocks away the Camino Real before mentioning the W.

<Content>OK Pros: Safe location, clean, funkyCons: Soulless, uppity front desk staff, did not take the extra step that makes a hotel stay special, so-so restaurant.W is located in Polanco on hotel row with the Intercontinental, Marriot and Nikko located right next door. There is also a huge Hard Rock Cafe, which makes this location somewhat generic. However, I felt perfectly safe walking around at night. There is a close metro station about 2 blocks away, making it quite convenient.The rooms are decent size, clean and modern. Beside the front desk, the rest of the staff was quite nice and helpful.However, the front desk had problems getting my SPG (starwood guest program) number, and were unable (did not try) to get it again until I finally looked it up myself online in a matter of a few seconds. I am a SPG Gold member, and wanted an upgrade as well as a late checkout (normal things I should have gotten wtih my gold status), and they were unable to provide this.Solea, the hotel restaurant, has rather mediocre food and unless you are desperate (and there are many other restaurants nearby within walking distance), I would not recommend it.

<Content>Style in the city We arrived late on a Friday night after a long flight from London and were greeted by a very slick team. Walking into the trendy bar was like walking onto a set from Sex and the City! The room (called a spectacular room) was the most amazing room we stayed in during our trip to Mexico - huge room and ensuite bathroom. The service during the whole stay was very professional (if a bit impersonal). The only disappointment was probably the food which was quite expensive and a bit too clever for its own good (I mean what is the point of coconut butter?!). The brunch, however, was excellent and overall we would score this hotel very highly.

<Content>Great spa and social scene at the bar My stay here didn't come to a great start, after I met two LA girls with more money than sense on my flight to Mexico from LAX and I shared a car (that I presumed was just a taxi) from the airport to the W in the Polanco district, where we were all staying, and I got a terrible shock when the driver charge us 90 Pesos EACH for a journey that was supposed to 35 Pesos in a taxi for a single person, so I was disgusted that we were so ripped-off. I complained to the hotel and they said that the car was a 'private car' that these girls had ordered directly from the hotel to pick them up, but I had just wasted 90 Pesos on getting to the hotel when I needn't have spent that, so I wasn't in a good mood as I checked in. So beware when ordering a car from the hotel from the airport, just use one of the normal taxis and you won't be charged double the fare. A standard taxi charge to or from the airport here is 35 Pesos.Apart from the bad start, the W was trendy and one of the newer hotels in the tourist friendly Polanco area of the city and it's also one of the safest areas to explore. During my stay, the hotel was packed with latino celebrities and music stars, all in town for the annual MTV Latin America Music Awards. The bar downstairs was packed and it's easy to meet people here. The downside was that the rooms were noisy and you could here people above and below too easily. It took me ages to figure out the shower, as it sprayed from all directions and there is no bath tub in the rooms, just these spacious power showers that come from all different directions. However, the spa was really relaxing and I used the sauna. I took advantage of the Bliss products that come in the rooms and the rooms are spacious, despite not being that peaceful.

<Content>Sleep Deprivation Perfected First let me say that this is nice looking hotel in a great neighborhood (Polanco). Second, the staff are friendly and the spa is wonderful. Unfortunately, the shoddy construction of this hotel overshadows any of the positives.The constant, mind-boggling noise (from within the hotel as I was on a high floor) made my 4 days (er, nights) a horrific experiment in sleep deprivation. In addition to hearing everything going on in the rooms around and above me (eg, showers, toilets, walking, blasting stereos), there were a number of loud events, at any time of day or night, that I could neither figure out what they were nor where they might be coming from. In addition, I had to twice ask housekeeping to stop vacuuming and talking right outside my door before 8 am (on a weekend). But, what was most mystifying (and maddening) were the smells that awoke me on 2 different nights. The first was cigarette smoke and the second was what can only be described as cooking grease. Both odors lasted for 2-3 hours.Other, less serious issues: turn down service did not show up on 2 of the 4 nights; the internet charge is 190 pesos (about $20) per day; water is not potable and the in-room per bottle charge is about $10.I emailed the hotel over a week ago about the noise concerns and never heard back so can only advise caution before staying at this hotel.

<Content>I Actually Love the W, but this Was Terrible First, let me preface this review by saying that I'll probably go back to this hotel, I suspect the problems I suffered were temporary. I actually like the W and will certainly give Mexico City W a second chance. My experiences there previously were quite good.The Mexico City W is in Polanco, a great location. It's next to the JW Marriott and the Intercontinental. I've friends in the neighborhood and it's convenient to several of the meetings I have to do when in town.The hotel itself is a good example of what the W is known for: kind of hip with a nice mood, excellent service, and great surroundings.That said, my stay had some serious problems. First off, my room had no hot water two mornings in a row. Rather than move me to another room, the staff fixed the problem, but it seemed only temporarily as hot water came and went. Waited for a while but was forced to take cold showers. Needless to say, I was late for my morning meetings on both days. This is unacceptable for what is supposedly a top-end value proposition hotel.Second, the hall to my room and at times my room smelled moldy (only way to describe it). I've experienced this kind of odor in cheap hotels, but never something like the W. It became distracting after a while. I visited another floor out of curiosity and did not encounter the same odor. I've no idea what caused it. Mexico City isn't the type of climate to create excessive dampness, I don't think.I did complain and received apologies and what not from the staff, but apparently there was no room to move me to another room or maybe they just didn't feel it necessary. Or possibly, the hot water problem was something several floors were experiencing. Whatever the cause, lack of hot water and strange odors might be acceptable at a cheap tourist motel, but not at the W.That said, I'll probably give them another try before avoiding them in the future. My previous experiences with the W have been almost uniformly positive. Nonetheless, thought I'd record this terrible experience for the record.

<Content>An exquisite experience This was a nice surprise. The W is a modern hotel, with a unique d茅cor, and excellent service. The attention to details is everywhere, from the music playing in the CD player when you first enter the room, to the open plan shower room. For the first time in several years, on a business trip, I had a pleasant and exciting stay in a hotel. The location is very good, everything feels contemporary, and it would be perfect placed near, or within, the Tate Modern. The food is very good, and the staff very courteous and helpful - they opened the business centre for me at 03:00 AM local time (09:00 AM in London), so that I could access the internet. That is outstanding, and it was done with a smile. The unique d茅cor may be a bit tiring, so I am not sure if I would go for a very long stay, but for any trips under 10 days the 鈥淲鈥?is my choice of hotel in Mexico City.

<Content>Amazing service I stayed for one night at the W and all I can say is that I did not want to leave. Plush beds, spacious rooms, good spa, excellent (but pricey) food... but the best part was the service. Security was top notch, bellemn always helped, room service was quick and extremely efficient and housekeeping was excellent. The design of the room is very modern and I loved the hammock in the shower and triple head shower. Only thing I was not crazy about was the red walls, but the bed was so maazing you fall asleep quickly. I booked through otel.com and had no issues. I will go back for sure!

<Content>a great city break After a grim stay at the W in the Maldives we reluctantly booked intothis hotel in Mexico for a couple of nights. We werent sure whether to go to the fourseasons or the W, both basic rooms being the same price (拢100 rm pn) - but were very glad that we stayed here. It was clean and efficient, the staff were helpful, the bar was buzzy,  it was in a 'safe neighbourhood' where we could stroll around quite easily. We were upgraded to a suite on the 21st floor - which had a giant ceiling to floor glass window along the side of the room - giving both the circular bathtub and the loo - the most amazing view out across mexico city.Annoyingly there were two complimentary bottles of champagne - when we would have preferred water - and the restaurant was completely devoid of atmosphere. But they werent big problems - and there are so many great restaurants in the City there is no need to stay confined to your hotel.We went to a restaurant called - el Bajio - which is a minutes walk away - on the same street as the hotel - and had an excellent lunch of great mexican food. Certainly worth a visit - and make sure you make a reservation as its always packed (NB - its only open for breaksfast and lunch).The W - definatly works in a city setting and for a two day base - it was perfect.

<Content>Fun at the W Mexico City I stayed the W Mexico City for business. I found it a nice contrast to the stuffy work life I lead. The rooms are intense--contrast of color (red) with a very innovative twist on the hammock shower. I thought the property was showing wear however; the bar and restaurants were lovely and the massage I had at the spa was excellent. Close to the professional district and yet seemed fun and alive.

<Content>Would stay here again We stayed here for a few days in December 2006 and would come back. We liked how the hotel is in a safe area and close to great restaurants, the hammock in the bathroom, the friendly and helpful service, and the fun restaurant/bar in the lobby and mezzanine floor. The complimentary refreshments, xmas cookies and hot beverages, in the lobby were also a nice touch. We weren't crazy about the red and white walls in our room.

<Content>Great experience at W Mexico City My wife give me a great birthday present: a weekend stay at the trendy W Mexico City. We took advantage of the special weekend low rates (199 dlls per night) and the hotel really was worth the trip to Mexico City (we live at Morelia, Michoacan, a three hours trip by car). The W is brand new, located at the stylish Polanco neighborhood, just across Chapultepec Park. The staff is friendly (all dressed in black at the front desk and the bellboys), the architecture and interior design is minimalist, the rooms are quite different from the usual hotel rooms: they are loft style, with the bathroom integrated to the rest of the room (the washbasin is actually in front of the bed), and very well equipped. The service is superb: newspaper at your door in the morning, two changes of towels daily, bathrobes, slippers, wine glasses and even a hammock to relax in the bathroom. And with the whatever whenever concierge service you can get almost anything you want in Mexico City.There are a lot of atractions near the hotel: museums, the sofisticated shops at Mazaryk Avenue, new and trendy malls (Antara), fancy restaurants and a wide array of night clubs. We deffinitely recommend the W.

<Content>Loved it! Recently stayed at the W Mexico City on a business trip and conducted a small event there on the same stay. Although the LOUD nightclub in the lobby was very disarming coming in late after a long travel day and business dinner, the service was excellent. Greeted with much needed bottled water and easy check in I made my way to my room and found a much needed oasis - I will give Starwood credit, you know when you are in a W without any doubt. The room had been set for a guest arrival including pulsating light to soothing mood music. No noise made its way upstairs from the nightclub and the bed was extremely comfortable - I slept like a baby. I had the spa shower with hammock - did not dare to use the hammock as was so tired I feared I'd fall off and crack my head on the marble seat, however it was an interesting concept - which was lovely. Staff was attentive on every count. The food and location was great. I am extremely picky and can not find a single complaint!

<Content>was it Mexico or the W? Was it Mexico or the W? We are wanting to try another W to see if it was just a local thing or the W.. Yes they are 'whenever wherever'.. had a great concierge to book reservations for trips and reservations..rides to the airport etc.. all very nice.The room and room service was our major issues.. just little things.. light bulb out on desk,two tissues in box,NO drawers to speak of... seriously it was two four inch high 14 inch .. How two people could stay there for longer than a few days is beyond me.. we had to live out of our suitcases.No bottle opener when we wanted a beer.. water one day..never again until one hour before we checked out.. no lotion.. They had upgraded us to a suite.I was so excited about the tub.. but there is no tub spout ..just the rain shower head and the stopper didnt work...:(Roomservice..agh.. we filled out the card they left on our pillow.. at 7:45 we peeked out the door in the morning. it was. sadly to say still on the door(even though it said to put out by 2;30 am and we had done so at 10pm.. well a call to whatever whenever we said we had to leave by 8;30.. they didnt seem to really get the card still here thing..and oddly enough we never got another on our bed.. had someone forgotten to tell the maid they werent doing it anymore? Anyway they rallied... Next day we called it in .. but got herbal tea instead of black.. oh yes and the first day grape juice instead of grapefruit.. which WAS on the menu.. not grape.. well thats it.. oh yes one last thing.. the 8 inch gap in the curtains.. The walls area almost all glass. even in the toilet room..It was bright all night and in my face in the moring.. wish I had brought some duct tape! thats it.. would I stay there again...no..I like all the nice touches...and things that go smoothly for that price... would rather have that than being cool. But i will try a W elsewhere..

<Content>Loved the W in Polanco My partner and I just spent 5 wonderful nights in the W. It was our first trip to Mexico City and the W was the perfect respite after busy and hectic days sightseeing. Our room was on the 15th floor. It had great views, and the hammock in the bathroom was a kick. The bed is super comfortable and the room was just perfect for lounging. We came home every night and just chilled. Although I enjoyed the bar and people watching - after being in the hustle and bustle of the city all day I just wanted to have some peace and quiet, and our room didn't disappoint.The staff was wonderful and friendly. I must admit I expect a little attitude at a W - that's part of the schtick - but there was none here. Just warm, friendly hospitality. We were greeted by smiles and welcomes every time. The concierge was wonderful - recommending several great restaurants and booking us a fantastic tour to Teotihuacan. The Polanco neighborhood is very lovely - chic and urban - and made for great evening walks and dinners.Of course, the W isn't for everyone - it's a little minimal and modern. If that's not your style there's always the JW Marriott next door.

<Content>Very bad experience on this W! This hotel definitely does not provide the value of an international brand name hotel or the price it charges. I had a very disappointing visit to this hotel. The halls are dark and smell, the rooms are very dark, cold floor, not functional bath tube (rounded bath tube leaves the entire floor wet), lateral window could not be closed (no curtains) preventing privacy from nearby building. The supposed excellent restaurant served me a spoiled fish (recommended by the waitress!!) and I got E.coli, destroying my business trip, and my wife's first visit to Mexico city. I noticed the bad taste of the fish, but never thought could be something so serious. Of course, after that (and very sick!) I changed to the awesome JW Marriott next door. Very pretentious environment, no real value for the serious business traveler, be aware!

We booked ourselves here because my boyfriend had to attend a convention in a nearby suburb, and instead of staying at the Fiesta Inn closer to the venue, we decided to treat ourselves and make a vacation out of the trip.Check in was a breeze and the hotel staff was very helpful. The staff at the Whiskey/Lobby bar were extremely accommodating of our love for the Sauvignon Blanc that was only served in the upstairs restaurant, and went out of their way to travel up and down the stairs just to bring us the wine we like! We stayed in a Spectacular Room. The beds were extra comfy and the rooms were clean and unique. We loved the hammock in the bathroom and the three-shower heads in the shower. The only downside to our room was the closet space 鈥?there was virtually none, which was kind of a hassle. We treated ourselves to massages (Swedish - both excellent) and I enjoyed a pedicure - very expertly done! We worked out at the gym daily - all the machines are top of the line (they're equipped to read your heart monitor if you have one) and the equipment is extremely well cared for. As far as the neighborhood, you can't get any better than the trendy Polanco district - it's extremely chic, and there are wonderful restaurants and shops just within blocks of the hotel. If you'd like to go anywhere, the hotel will arrange a driver for you, and even send the driver to pick you up when you're done exploring!We ate at the restaurant every night for dinner and I tried 4 different entrees, and they were all impeccable. My boyfriend is a vegetarian and he found the selection quite ample and was able to enjoy a variety of fish and veggie dishes. The brunch options are also fantastic.All in all, our stay at the W Mexico City was really the highlight of our trip.

<Content>Great 'W' Experience As a frequent business traveler to Mexico City, have had experience in many hotels here. By far, the 'W' Mexico City has become one of my favorite stays. The location, the trendy  chic Polanco district is great for those who like a lively nite life and great restaurants within walking distance. The Lobby bar is a happening spot on Friday and Saturday nites, but once entering the elevator and ascending to your floor, all is left behind. Plenty to do and see in nearby neighborhoods, including museums, parks and shopping. Hotel itself have great spacious rooms with signature comfortable 'W' beds. An excellent gym to keep fit while on the road and cool spa to relax in after a long day of business meetings. The staff are very friendly and attentive and try their best to meet your all your needs. Highly recommend for young singles and those who prefer trendy friendly boutique hotels in a great part of town.

<Content>Trendy boutique style hotel and fabulous During my stay in Mexico City I stayed at the Marriott, Sheraton Centro Historico and the W, all were great hotels with different styles. For me the W was the best.The HotelIn the trendy Polanco district, just round the corner from the Marriott and an easy walk to the Anthropology Museum and the Zoo.Decorated in modern trendy style, with a great bar and spa.The spa has steam room, sauna, relaxation pool (note you cannot swim in this it is just for relaxing in) and my personal favourite the Mexican sauna (a dome like structure with coals in the middle, very nice indeed)The bar is busy on friday and saturday nights with young affluent mexicans and some business travellers. It is pricey but they do a great apple martini.The restaurant is interesting, the food was a little too over-complicated for me, too many flavours. I would recommend that you get a booking at nearby Aguila y Sol instead.The roomsHuge with plenty of room for sitting and working. The bed was huge, and the room decorated in modern style. I went for a king size bed which means that i has a wet room which was great, including the hammock to sit in and observe the city from.If a bath is a priority then go for the rooms with two double beds.The StaffCan't do enough for you, friendly yet incredibly professional.In conclusion, I would highly recommend this hotel if you like modern boutique style hotels. I preferred it to the others as it is a younger crowd.

<Content>Endorsement for the W Mexico City We stayed at the W Mexico City for 7 days and we didn't want to leave the hotel because the service was so good. The hotel restaurant, Solea, has a fantastic power lunch which included 6 different appetizers, and even a fantastic cactus appetizer. The staff at the Solea are very attentive, and we experienced very excellent service during our meals there. The Away Spa's hot stone massage is a wonderful way to recover from the weariness of traveling. Our hotel room feature multiple HBO channels, very comfortable linens, robes, slippers, bliss toiletries, and a hammock in the shower room. Although the lobby bar is a very happening nightspot, we didn't hear any sounds from the bar in our room. The concierges were very helpful with recommendations about guides for side trips that we took, and also, set up the tours for us which made our vacation much more relaxing. All in all, we would stay at this hotel again and wholeheartedly recommend it. The location is very central to the Museum of Anthropology, the Castle and the Modern Museum of Art, all within walking distance.

<Content>Good for Business Travelers I found the W to be a good fit for English-speaking business travelers. The staff were extremely friendly and accomodating.The rooms were a bit unusual, but quite functional. I found the mini-sofa with table to be a better alternative for working on a laptop than the desk.it is quite expensive, especially the restaurant and bar. There are good alternatives for food and drink within a short walk. The nearby area appears relatively safe.Overall, I would stay there again for business, but probably not for a family trip as it did not seem like the most kid-friendly place. Style definitely takes precedence over function.

<Content>A Perfect Stay W Mexico City is a trendy hotel in the upscale Polanco neighborhood. It is close to good restaurants, upscale shops, museums, and parks.The staff members are attentive (gave us ice-cold water and towels upon arrival) and speak fluent English. The concierge is very eager to assist in making dinner reservations and was able to make a reservation at one of the busiest Mexico City restaurants that evening for us.The decor is classic W. The in-room shower with 3 showerheads and gorgeous city views is luxuriously indulgent.The hotel spa is great, with helpful staff members who are more than happy to provide drinks and assistance. There is a steam room, steam adobe, sauna, relaxation pool, and gym.On Thursday nights, there is a lively bar scene in the lobby, where the creme de la creme of Mexico City come to party and hang out.Overall, the Mexico City W is a great way to experience this cosmopolitan, vibrant city. However, if you are looking for more traditional Mexican accommodations, you may be disappointed.

<Content>What a dissapointment! I guess that we expected something special. In general the construction is terrible.What we found in the room was broken lightswhch the hotel could not fix, a broken telephone on the desk that could not be fixed, a chipped sink, a toilet room with a sliding door which could not be closed, no reading lights. A bottle of water and two glasses was left on a table each day. Upon checkout, we were charged US$7.00 a day for the bottle of water-the charge ultimately refunded. No place to sit except a desk chair. The shower was cool but flooded the room. I did love the bathroom hammock overlooking the park. The concierge gave directions to stores which had moved years ago. The cost of drinks in the lounge was more than double the prices paid at the best places in New York City. We now have reservations at the Nikko and would never again consider a W hotel.

<Content>The W gets an 'A' for Service We spent three nights at the W in February and it was the service that impressed us the most. Shortly after our arrival Ricardo at the Welcome Desk went the extra mile to help us out with a minor issue. The Concierge service was prompt and professional, and when the power went out in our suite an Engineer arrived within minutes to solve the problem. The rooms are beautiful and the beds deliciously comfortable - the recessed lighting and halogen spots provide a warm glow, and the hammock strung over the huge tub is great for an afternoon siesta. This may not be old world Mexico City, but it certainly captures some of the cosmopolitan vibe of this amazing city. Yes, there are a few design flaws; and the nightly lobby bar scene is full of suits and ex-pats on their laptops, but the location is great and the service is superb.

<Content>Function Bows to Form If you've never experienced groovy modern design, you may be tickled by the W Mexico City. Its vibe is refreshing, a break from the hyper-Republican shtick you get from your average high-end hotel. No dowdy empire-wannabe furnishings here, no latter-day Louis-the-something knockoffs trying to make you feel regal. Problem is, the designers did the fun part, coming up with the look and the vibe, but seem never to have gotten down to the brass tacks of functionality. And so you find yourself constantly bending to accommodate the high style, especially in the smaller rooms (the ones facing west). Stingy closet and drawer space, no room to store a suitcase, nowhere to sit but the desk chair. Not to mention (a) the annoyingly mediocre construction standards, and (b) the design itself, which isn't perhaps the finest example of its type - too darn red, too lava-lampish. That said, the beds are delicious, and the hammock in the bathroom rocks. (Get it? I'm clever, right?)

<Content>Trendy but loud - and did not feel like mexico city... Very good service, rooms look cool but are not great, and expensive for what it is.We were greated by a friendly and efficient welcome. The room was very trendy, but did not feel like Mexico at all and were a bit run down. Most of the lights did not work, and as some have already mentioned the music from the bar and from other rooms was very loud.The food (both dinner and breakfast), however, was very good and though we didn't have dinner in the restaurant at least it looked cool. The area is also nice.I also stayed one night at the Condesa df one night and have to say it is miles ahead of the W.

<Content>VERY LOUD, POORLY BUILT I am a starwood platinum member and I cannot believe Starwood allows this property to operate.Rooms are dirty and in desparate need of renovation (I was in two different suites and ended up tranfering to a regular room because it was more quiet). The sound proofing is terrible -- from many rooms you hear the bar noise throughout the night.This hotel will be good for the single traveler who wants a late night bar scene downstairs (though it is mostly expat men). The more exacting traveler should stick to the four seasons, and the marriott next door has nicer rooms.The hotel has a nice location. The staff is very kind but really cannot make up for the poor construction and failure to maintain the property.I will not be back.

<Content>Not worth all the extra costs Why do the really expensive hotels always look to nickel and dime you to death? In spite of a $300/night tab after taxes, I had to pay $20/day to access the internet, $10/day to use the gym, $5/'loaned' compact disk. And watch your room service bill - they include service charge (20%) and tip (15%), but leave a line open on the form for more tip. The room was interesting, but loud loud loud. The showers are wonderful, but whenever anyone around you gets into theirs, prepare for the loud deluge of water through the pipes. Service here was friendly, as they should be for NY prices in Mexico City. And don't even think about the spa $95/hour for a 60 minute massage when you KNOW the therapist is probably only seeing $10 of that, if they are lucky. The W should be ashamed of themselves for overcharging as much as they do here.

<Content>Well, well.... Although the entrance/reception area looks great and stunning I was slightly disappointed about the room that already starts looking tired (spots on carpet, chipped furniture). I missed dimmers in the room as the light is very bright. The restaurant at breakfast looks terrible (white chairs, tables; spots everywhere). Too bad!

<Content>Totally Awesome The W Hotel in Mexico City rocks! I was there for two nights. The staff was very nice, especially Ricardo at the concierge. He'll take care of you!The location is great. The Polanco district has many good restaurants and bars, especially Hard Rock Cafe and The Irish Pub across the street. I stayed in room 1908, with a great view. The room felt very clean and was decorated in feng shui style, which I like. If you're looking for a traditional Mexican feel, this is definitely not the place for you. I ordered room service one night and the food was good. The bar is very trendy and attracts an LA style crowd at night. The staff usually is all in black or black and red.Places to see: The Musuem of Anthropology which is very close to the W. Bulldog's, a live music venue. Eat at La Valentina and go to the Barfly downstairs for the evening. Go to the Saturday Bazaar at St. Angel and Frida Kahlo museuem afterwards. We missed the trip to the pyramids, but will definitely do it next time.The only reason I wouldn't stay here again, would be to find something with more of a Mexican feel. Otherwise, this is the place to be!

<Content>Super Comfy Bed! I stayed at the W hotel for my first visit to Mexico City. Helpful staff, large rooms and comfy beds. The main complaint I have is that the room I stayed in was not that clean - it obviously was not dusted or vacuumed after the last visit.

<Content>Midwesterner Finds Wonderland in Mexico City From the moment we stepped out of cab from the airport we felt we were in Wonderland. Check in was flawless. Bell staff was great. Rooms were very cool, hamock in the shower, CD to play in the stereo, trendy room decor. Nothing in this hotel is traditional, which was a breath of fresh air for us.The scene was very interesting. Great people watching in the lobby bar area. The staff was very accomidating to hotel guests, non-guests may have to wait for a table.I thought this place was great, we will definetly return.
