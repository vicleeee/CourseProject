<Content>I dodged a bullet because of a screw-up with my reservation On a trip to Britain in July of 2008, I decided at the last minute to go to Amsterdam for five nights instead of London. So I booked a room online (I thought) and flew to Amsterdam. I arrived at the Marnix around 11:30 p.m. My first impression wasn't good. The attractive looking exterior shown in photos was anything but attractive; graffiti covered the building at street level and there were a couple of really creepy-looking guys just hanging out in front of the building. The front door was wide open, with no evidence that it was a security door. Inside, what struck me upon entering the check-in room was the stench of rotting food or garbage (rotting meat and sour milk comes to mind). The front-desk clerk was obnoxious and rude, telling me that I didn't have a reservation. (As it turns out, that was lucky for me.) At least he was helpful in pointing out a hotel next door, where I did take a room. (Honestly, I didn't feel like wandering around a new city at midnight, luggage in tow, looking for a room.) This place should not be charging the rates it does for rooms and it really should advertise itself as a hostel, not a hotel. Having said that, even if I were 18 and on a much more limited budget, I can't imagine me staying in such a disgusting place.

<Content>I saw the mouse I read loads of reviews about this place, so I had prepared myself for the worst. It really wasn't that bad, and for the price it was really good. The Leidseplein is only a 2 minute walk away, and there is a coffee shop accross the street called crush, which is really good. We had the 8 bed room and 2 other rooms in the hotel, and even though there was a mouse we weren't that bothered. It nibbled through my friends time out bars, and my other friends penguin bars, but nevermind. The mouse is white by the way.The bathroom in the 8 bed was tiny, and if you were to sit down on it your legs would be touching the door, but that was part of the charm.The staff were alright, and the 24 hour reception thing is really good. The breakfast was alright too, and there are drinks available all day from the lobby. There is a computer for internet access too which was handy. If your just looking for a place to crash at night its perfect, its not the Ritz but you shouldn't expect it to be at the price it was.

<Content>never ever again! Hi thereMy giflfriend and I are not people who need a lot of comfort but these hotel is defenitely never ever again our choice of staying...My girlfriend stayed allready ones at this hotel before, but like she said, everything has changed to the worse.We spent 4 nights during eastern in amsterdam. fortunately we stayed only several hours in the hotel for sleeping. First of all, too expansive during eastern, every day the costs are rising, from 25 to 45 鈧?a day per person for a 6 bed room, without windows, no air, very small and dirty. the boss, a really nevervous, unfriendly lier. the only one's they were friendly were the cleaning staff. every day we were asked coming to the receptionist, cause they had no organisation about who is how long staying. After the first night we need to change the room (from a 3 bed room, which was not really bad) to our booked 6 bed room. day after they thought we had to pay for all days we have allready done on arriving day. unneeded discussions! last but not least...boycot these hotel without thinking you miss a hotel with good condition, it isn't!!!!

<Content>The only kind thing you can say is that it's clean This was a pretty horrible hotel. We were booked into the Fantasia Lucky Travellers hotels for four days, but they had double booked our room so we were transferred to here for two nights.First they ripped us off - charged us 鈧?00 a night when the advertised rate is 鈧?8. The room was pretty as basic as you can get - two single beds, two bunk beds (in a room for two - it's an odd place). There was an en-suite shower and toilet, but nothing else at all - no chair, no table, no phone, no lamp - nothing. They really are stretching two-star beyond breaking point. The room d茅cor was just nasty - orange walls with a rough texture and incredibly dim light.The room was not touched in any way between day one and day two - no clean towels, no making of beds - the only thing done was to remove one towel to take us back to the one towel that we were given between two people on the day we arrived.The included breakfast was a very minimalist affair - orange juice or water, toast or you can make yourself a toasted sandwich from slices of processed cheese and very cheap ham. If I've made it sound appetising it isn't.The staff were generally acceptable, except for one receptionist who seemed defensive and unconcerned.Finally the walls are paper thin so you can hear everything that every other room does. Basically avoid at all costs.

<Content>Cheap and nice! The beds and towels were clean, the carpet on the floor I don't know because they were dark, but i don't care either. Yes, there was no bathroom inside the rooms but there were 1 per floor and I've always found them clean. The rooms were small, but i've slept there for 4 nights and had the time of my life!The showers are apart from the bathrooms and were in good condition too. I found it cheap and nice! The owners and good people, the breakfast is good. I would definitly stay there again!

<Content>Never Go There !!! First, I had booked a room with toilets but there were no toilets in the room and no room available with toilets (futhermore, there were no light in the shared toilets) . After 20 minutes of very hard negotiations with the owner, we obtained the possibility to cancel the booking, leaving the hotel on the following day and beeing reimburse. Second, I have travelled in many places in the world and in some very cheap hotels in under-developped countries, but I had never seen a such filthy hotel : dirt everywhere and worse : wastes, empty bottles and food under the beds. At last, it's a very noisy location : tramways in the street, snores from the adjoining rooms... NEVER GO THERE !!! For the same price, you can find so much nicer hotel in Amsterdam.

<Content>Will Never do it again We have booked 2 six-bed rooms, but although the bookings proceeded normally, when we arrived, the reception told us, they don钮 have the booked rooms. They had only one 6 bed room and one 4 bed room, so they put there 2 matraces inside on each room for some price reduction. The rooms were really small and awful. I haven't ever seen anything like this accomodation! And the social facilities-1 shower on the floor for appr. 20 people was inside the bath, so You had to wait until all the people finish cleaning their teeth or you could exhibate. Generally the bath was terrible, dirty and disgusting. The only average thing was the breakfast, but all the rest was about 1-2/10points. I thing that if you want to save some money, go to Formula1 or s.l.t. but trying to sleep at this hostel is really adventure for itself.Tomas

<Content>More of a youth hostel than a hotel I just got back from a weekend in Amsterdam where I spent two nights at Marnix Hotel with 5 friends. Since it was all booked last minute we did not have much choice as far as accomodation was concerned. But we're all former backpackers in our thirties now and decided it would be fun to re-live that dorm-room experience. Since one of us is pregnant though, we asked if the room had a private bathroom. We got a very nice answer saying, yes, of course the room has a private bathroom. As we got there we first had to make it to the third floor: the steepest and narrowest stairway I have ever seen! The room was about as big as my home bathroom (and I live in a small flat) with three bunk beds, no room for our bags (even very small ones) and NO BATHROOM. One of my friends had printed out the booking e-mail and made her way back down to complain only to be told that dorm rooms have no en suite bathroom and that since they're all booked out and all Amsterdam is booked out we would just have to make do...Since it was supposed to be a fun weekend we decided to laugh about it and adjusted but I still think at a 150 euros per night it was a rip-off. Had we known we would have just gone for a hostel that calls itself a hostel: at least we would have known what to expect! One last thing: the breakfast room is the tiny lobby which fits about 10 people. If like most of us you get up between 9 and 10 forget about finding a chair...we decided to splurge and went for the breakfast buffet at the American Caf茅 (just 5 minutes up the street) were you can sip champagne and eat all you can for 20 euros!!! All in all the Marnix Hotel is a youth hostel, the room and shared bathroom were clean and the beds comfortable. If you simply need somewhere to sleep and everywhere else is booked out, go for it. If not take the time to look for something decent (Hotel Sint Nicolaas by the main station, where we were allowed to leave our luggage FOR FREE finding the storage room at the station full, seemed very nice).

<Content>Drastically disgusting! I have travelled to quite a few places and stayed in various budget hotels and hostels, but this was by far the worst. The staff (all one of them that I saw) was very short with us, and scruffy. Theres no lift and the stairs are lethal, but then they are in a lot of places in amsterdam. the floors were dirty, the shared toilet was so tiny you could hardly shut the door and stank. The shower in the room was big, but the twin room we had was so small, one of the beds had to go at an angle to make room for the wardrobe. The shower wasnt seperate from the room, so you step out of the shower curtain and almost trip over the bed!The noise from the room next door was very loud, the walls must be really thin, and you can hear everything from the other rooms.There were stains on the carpets, stains on the sheets (nasty dirty ones!). Beds badly uncomfortable and the sheets were like cardboard. And the window was held open by a rotten piece of wood tied to a bit of rope, this was particularly dangerous as the window itself was heavy and would get jammed then fall like a guillotine unexpectedly! I went with a mate and we just 'coped' and made a joke of it, but if you cant cope in these conditions, just dont stay here. We just look back and laugh now- but that takes quite a sense of humour!yeh it was cheap and the location was good (right by liedesplein which is a great location), but there are better hotels in the same price range. we just left booking til the last minute and so had to book what we could get on a budget. not worth what we paid at all.Didnt try the food- thought it best not to! But there are good places to eat very near. So if you dont mind staying in a dump for a good location on a budget, go here. If you value health and hygiene- don't!!

<Content>Decent and cheap For its price, the Marnix Hotel is decent. The location is good, the breakfast is free and goodsized. Nevertheless, the hotel is also understaffed, so don盲t expect to check in on time. The cleanliness is also subpar, but if you've gone to Amsterdam for the right reasons, then it shouldn't matter anyway.

<Content>Not so cheap, low quality, very basic hotel The hotel was comparatively cheap, but it was ugly, uncomfortable, and very low key, ideal for smoking and not much more. Not the place to enjoy your room. The only good things were its location near the Leidseplein and the friendliness of some of the personnel.

<Content>Very centrally located!! The hotel was easy to find and not too far from Central station.Friendly 24 hour reception.Our room was clean and functional, with nice clean sheets and towels.There are soap dispensers on the wall next to the sink in the room and also in the shower. The bathroom was nice and clean but did smell a bit musty but there wasnt a window in the bathroom.You can get hot and cold drinks from the reception area.This hotel is very central and you are minutes from fantastic entertainment, shopping,the cafes,fast food and excellent restaurants.If you are here to shop, chill or whatever and need somewhere simply as a base then this hotel is ideal.I found it value for the money as everywhere else within the same price range was way out of town.Please email if you want anymore details.

<Content>Disgusting rip-off This is the sort of dump where you definately want to leave your socks on while walking around the room. Filthy bed linens, cigarette butt left on windowsill and `stuff' on the carpets. No soap in bathroom. And at 100 euros, you'd at least expect breakfast to be included, which it wasn't. Then again, considering how disgusting the place was, I'm not sure I'd trust the food. All-in-all a disgusting rip-off.

<Content>Fine. We stayed at the Marnix mid September 04.The location was good, the room was clean, the staff was friendly.The room was tiny. There were two single beds on either side of the room with a narrow path between them and a sink at the end.The shared toiled and shower were clean.
