<Content>Ibis is solid for a night or two Conveniently located to both the domestic and international terminals the Ibis is a good choice for an overnight stay on your way into or out of Sydney. Rooms are small and basic but are clean and have all the amenities you need, however the lighting in the rooms is not adequate. We were departing on a 14 hour flight in the afternoon so were hoping to get a sleep in but the room doors are quite heavy so we were awoken by the slamming doors (you can鈥檛 close them quietly) of other guests departing for morning flights. The hotel itself also has coin operated laundries and internet access which came in handy for us.Food at the hotel is average, and as with most properties located close to airports, a little on the pricey side. The shuttle bus service seems to work well going from the hotel to the airport but is a little confusing coming the other way, add to that our driver was rude and struggled with English. Staff at the hotel seem to lack motivation and there often seems to be underlying confusion amongst them.I would recommend the Ibis Sydney Airport for stays of 1 to 2 nights only, any more than that I would suggest making the journey closer to the city.

<Content>Don't stay here! We were on a 3 week trip to visit family in Australia. On the last night of the trip we flew in from Hobart and arrived in Sydney to spend the last night of our trip near the airport for our flight out the next day. I called the hotel to arrange for the shuttle bus. I told them where we were (Terminal 2) and the guy said OK and that the shuttle bus would be by at 11:20. No other instructions were provided.11:20 came and no shuttle bus. I called the hotel again and was told (by a different person) that we had to go to the shuttle bus stop. I was informed that the last shuttle was at 11:20 but it hadn't left the airport yet. I asked where the shuttle bus stop was. Got a really vague 鈥榯here's a U you need to go stand by鈥?before being put permanently on hold. Some nice passerby finally showed us where the shuttle bus stop was but it soon became apparent that we had missed the last shuttle. I tried repeatedly to call the hotel again and they wouldn鈥檛 answer. We finally decided to take a taxi and there was a huge line for them. While in line I called the hotel again (I was very upset by this time) when the girl finally answered I asked her if someone would at least be there at the desk to check us in if and when we got there. I also told her I was NOT IMPRESSED with the service I had gotten so far. When we finally got there and got checked in we received no apology for the 'miscommunication' . The room had paper thin walls 鈥?we could hear the people next door showering like they were in our own bathroom. You could hear the people above walking around and the people in the hallway were loud and clear too. Easily the worst place we stayed the entire trip.

<Content>Good Airport Stay The Ibis Hotel is close to the domestic airport (within walking distance) and also has a reliable and regular shuttle bus for $5 pp. The rooms are very spacious with a double bed and a single bed but the bathrooms are tiny more like a Formula One hotel. They are tastefully decorated with an LCD TV on the wall that swivels. There was next to no noise from the planes or traffic even though our room was facing the main road. Check-in staff were not all that friendly and whilst they fixed a small problem we had they were robotic and not apologetic at all. I would recommend this hotel for an airport stopover or early flight.

<Content>Great Value An excellent hotel for travellers between flights! This hotel is close to the airport with its own shuttle bus service ( payment needed for return journey) but we were not bothered by any noise at all.Rooms are small and the bathrooms ingenously small but perfectly adequate for a one night stay. Check in was efficient but checkout a little slow as there were too many of us wanting to go and too few staff to cope at that time.There is a bar and bistro on site, this is handy as the area is not one for wandering out in at night. Food is ordinary and pricy but its ok given the captive market.Internet connection available.I would definately use this hotel again if I'm between flights.

<Content>Only good if want to stay near the airport to depart early morning I had to wait one day in Sidney for my next flight, so I needed a hotel that was close to the airport and with good connections. The hotel is quite basic, but served my purpose well. The airport shuttle is 5 AUD, but I think it is fair if compared to what you would pay with a taxi or even the train. If you are looking for a similar hotel in the area, I saw a Holiday Inn one block away that looked nicer (at least from the outside), so check the reviews.The good: the staff was professional and helpful. It is 500 meters away from Mascot train station, so you can easily move around with public transport . However, bear in mind that the area gets quite deserted during the night, so I wouldn't recommend it if you are planning to come late at night. Rooms are very small, in particular for Australian standards, but ok for staying overnight. The so-so: the bathroom is really, really small (really!). It was ok for me, but I am not sure oversized people would fit in them. On top, it was a bit smelly. The room didn't feel 100% clean, but it could have been due to the stains in the carpet (to be fair, a previous gest had the bright idea of ironing in the carpet so it was burned...). The bad: walls are VERY thin, so you get to hear all sorts of noises. It gets particularly bad if you have some aussie neighbours who went drinking and arrive late in the night (i.e. a 70% chance of experiencing it). The bottom line: Only good if you arrive late in Sidney and need a cheap place to leave early next day. If you need space and silence to sleep, and are ready to pay for it, then check other options. And if you don't leave too early in the morning, I would rather recommend to stay closer to down town (Darling Harbour in particular) and to get the train from there.

<Content>Great value for money The second time at the Ibis Sydney Airport this year this time for three nights to enjoy a quick sydney holiday. This is what I found, yes the rooms and bathrooms are small but comfortable esp as we got the room at a very low rate $69 per night Australian. the room was kept clean and the only issue was a fault with the bathroom drains this was fixed almost straight away, Great view of aircraft coming in/out of sydney airport, wonderful terrace area in front of hotel, The staff very helpful even when we needed to change money over or get directions, no problems with them at allOnly had one meal (lunch) at the hotel and it was fine for the price and reasonable qaulity and very good size.I know this hotel gets mixed reviews but for the price and what you get it is a good hotel, its not the Stamford but it is only half the cost, This is a very good three star sydney hotel

<Content>Clean rooms, happy staff and great location I was apprehensive about staying at the Ibis Sydney Airport after reading some of the reviews about the odour, staff attitude and the mildew - but it is in a great location and just right for a weekend in Sydney near the airport.I booked two rooms and both were clean and had no mildew or smell. The bathrooms were adequate and provided all the items that a traveler needs for a short stay. The buffet breakfast was good - hot items HOT and chilled items chilled - and of a good quality.If you want a good standard clean hotel close to the airport then stay here for a reasonable price -- if you want luxury then stay at one of the other hotels in the area or the city and PAY for the extra service, bigger rooms and wastefulness. The standard of the Ibis Sydney Airport is on par with other Ibis hotels I have stayed in across Australia - good quality, happy staff and wholesome food.

<Content>Smelly Ibis The hotel was so noisy. The air conditioner was so noisy I had to turn it off in order to sleep. Not only was the air conditioner noisy but the fridge was so noisy I had to turn that off as well. There was a lot of noise in the hotel during the night - thumping and banging etc - it disturbed my sleep. There was also a strange smell in the hotel, not just in the room, but in the hotel itself. The smell was right through the hotel. I think it is a damp, musty smell. It was awful. The staff were not overly helpful. The staff in the hotel dining room very very unhelpful and wouldn't let us enter the dining room 5 minutes before the scheduled meal time. The hotel shuttle bus was supposed to pick us up at the airport but the shuttle bus took so long coming that another hotel's shuttle bus took us in their shuttle bus to the hotel instead. I would not stay at this hotel again.

<Content>compact stay This hotel must have been designed by a really small Japanese person. The rooms are incredibly compact - I found them a bit stifling but they are very clean and the beds are comfortable. When I got there there were guests who were queued up to complain to and yell at staff. The staff appeared to be used to it though. The staff were not warm and inviting and in my observation could have fixed some of the problems the guests raised by simply waiving a small charge or being more attentive.. They did not do this though. The menu after 10.30pm is very restricted and the kitchen didn't have any mustard on hand so I can't think they are too well equipped. The breakfast looked great though and the waiter there was sweet and helpful. I am not sure that this is the best value for money in town but the stay is ok if you have to leave early. The shuttle bus costs $5 to get to the airport but it is really only a $9 cab ride anyway so not alot to be saved there.

<Content>Great Stopover We stayed at this hotel as we needed something close to the airport and we were also familiar with the area. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I arrived earlier in the day than my partner and had walked to the hotel from the airport. It was about 10am and I wasn't due to check in until 2pm. The staff at reservation were more than happy to let me into our room then and there which I was most grateful for. The room was small but clean, comfortable and quiet. We didn't eat at the restaurant (walked down the road to a great Thai place) but the menu looked good and the restaurant was full. Breakfast was good also. We recommend this hotel for a stopover close to the airport.

<Content>Basic accomodation near the airport We stayed for a night with our three year old daughter, picking the location for it's convenience for the airport for a flight the next day. Rooms are small and functional, bathroom 'unit' is clever use of space and big enough for what we needed. Bedding was a little strange, with bedsheets wrapped around the duvets rather than proper duvet covers. Staff were efficient, breakfast in the morning was good and transfer to airport was on time (despite being chargeable which is not what was advertised). It's a decent enough place, even if you still get some noise from aircraft due it's proximity to the runway.

<Content>Avoid It! Don't Stay Here!staff are rude and nonchalant,rooms are like prison cells, cold and full of strange odours.food is limited and extremely over priced.trying to get a cab to airport is virtually impossible and to be frank it's possibly easier to walk!If you have the option, I would suggest buying a sleeping bag and spending the night in the terminal.

<Content>Will not return We chose this hotel as it's near the airport and boasted what we thought was free airport transfers.After a 7 hr flight and a further 1hr clearing customs we just wanted to get to our hotel. We waited at our pick up point for 30 mins. No pick up! after calling the hotel we were told our pick up would arrive in 55 mins! bear in mind the hotel is just a 7min ride away. I don't think that's acceptable service. We took a taxi.We arrived and then had to queue for 30 mins to check in.Meals were good (see comments later) but there appeared to be something wrong with the hotel A/C which seemed to be at 14 degrees, most guests were eating wearing Winter woolies.On the way back to the airport we were then charged $10 to transfer which we felt added insult to injury.After returning home my spouse became very ill and had to be taken to hospital for treatment. Doctors were pretty sure it was caused by eating a meal which contained Gluten. As my spouse has coeliacs disease we specifically asked our waitress to point out which meals were Gluten Free. It appears either the waitress was wrong or the chef wasn't informed.Needless to say we will never return to the hotel.

<Content>room was a pleasant surprise I had read that Ibis rooms were small and the bathrooms extremely compact -- it was a pleasant surprise to find that there was plenty of space for a one-night stay and the bathroom very efficiently organized. Everything was crisply clean and comfortable, and the hotel is well-located for easy train access to the city attractions. The restaurant was noisy and there were minor mistakes with our order, but our experience overall was a good one.

<Content>Small rooms, overpriced Not enough room to swing a cat was the first thing I thought when i saw my room.Having said that the room was clean and so was the tiny bathroom.The bathroom was that small, I struggled to sit on the toilet.Ridiculous charges for movies and for internet access....when are Australian hotels going to offer free wireless to customers as they do in other countries?Restaurant food was overpriced for what it was..but the food was not all that bad.Breakfast was a different storey.....Ok Priced, but very greasy...I could not eat it.This hotel would be OK for a quick night before or after a flight....but no longer.

<Content>Convenient to Airport, good breakfast menu. Room was small and quiet. Stayed one night after landing in Sydney in the evening. Close to Airport. Did not use their shuttle. Took a cab from and to airport instead based on other reviews. Bed was comfortable, shower and bathroom adequate. Just perfect for one night.Breakfast buffet looked good but we ordered from the menu and had a nice filling meal of eggs, bacon, tomato, and bangers (sausage). Everything was clean and neat.

<Content>Ok for A Stop Over This hotel is very basic, but you get what you pay for and it is handy to the airport especially if you check in late and check out early. We had a bad experience checking in with the girl on reception, she was rather rude when I reminded her we had requested an early check in, but apart from that no problems.The food was rather good and reasonably priced.

<Content>affordable near the airport This was my second stay at the Ibis Sydney Hotel. I really cant complain much other than it is a simple, non flashy, No Wow!, average little place very close to the airport. If you need a place to stay for a night or a layover this is perfect. I would not stay here for a vacation as there is really nothing going on in the area.The shuttle bus at the airport is complimentary but you will have to wait 30-40 minutes. The shuttle back to the airport is $ 5.00 per person and you will have to make arrangements in advance as it does get full during peak times. you dont want to wait for the 2nd or 3rd bus to come along.The reception area flows right by the restaurant. It gets very crowded in the hallway waiting to check in or out because of the restaurant and the 2 tiny elevator infront of the desk. The only problems I have with the room is the toilet that does not flush completely. I would have to flush several times before anything dissapears. It is a very basic room with limited amenities. Again just enough for rest before a long flight or to venture elsewhere.The staff is friendly, but the surroundings around the reception makes you feel hurried because of the restuarant, elevators, and small hallway. Each floor has a vending machine to purchase drinks, candy, or chips if you need a snack and not utilize the in house restuarant.Mascot Train Staion is only a 10 minute walk. It well get you into the Darling Harbor, downtown, Circular Quay area within 10 minutes. Very convenient and cost about $9.00 per person.

<Content>Conveneint For The Weary Traveller My criteria was, find a hotel near the airport to crash in after a flight from the UK. Having read reports on all the candidates, there seemed to be no ideal choice. So, I took a punt on this hotel.The free bus was waiting for me and left for the hotel within 5 minutes. Within another 5 minutes I was at reception.Check-in was reasonable, although later when i was in the bar I noticed very long, slow moving, queues.The room was basis, but clean and tidy. The bathroom was like a space capsule, but with a very large shower cubicle. I heard no aircraft noise.I didn't eat at the hotel, but I saw plenty who did, who seemed to have no problems.With all Ibis hotels, if you take into account what little you can pay (if you get a deal on the internet) you can't grumble too much.

<Content>average I agree with some of the comments already mentioned. There was a bad smell emanating from the bathroom after a few days. And the shuttle driver seemed rushed, and pressured for time. On the plus side, no air traffic noise despite facing the airport, although I was unable to open the window.

<Content>Avoid this hotel! Not only did the Ibis try to overcharge us by $30 (apparently the rate quoted over the phone was wrong) but it wasn't even worth the $120 we paid. The room was absolutely tiny, with our suitcases on the floor there was no room to even walk around the bed. The bathroom was just ridiculous! It was no different to a bathroom on a boat and the whole floor was soaking wet within seconds of turning on the shower. By far the worst hotel we stayed in during our month long trip overseas...even the 1-2 star motels were better.

<Content>Compact,Comfortable,Very Busy We stayed at this hotel prior to an early morning flight, it is compact and clean and the saying you get what you pay for applies here... We stayed when the hotel was at maximum capacity so, had to wait ages for a table for dinner it was well over an hour even though it was annoying we can not complain booking through accor room and breakfast was $118.00.If i had an early morning flight i would stay there again.

<Content>Unable To Answer The Phone - No Business Skills Booked one night stay for my parents over the phone. It took a very long time to get through on the phone to them to let them know a relative had a serious accident. Very disappointing that it took 16 minutes for my call to be answered at the reception. Another great day at Ibis Sydney Airport. - The service is ordinary.

<Content>Ok for 1 Night Stopover We stayed here for 1 night enroute from Fiji to Sydney then we were travelling home to Ireland the following day. It was handy as it is right at the airport and there is a shuttle bus to and from the domestic and international airport.We are a family of 4, 2 adults  2 children, 13 and 10. We booked a room to fit 4! There was small double bed, sofa bed and we were given a roll away bed (which was actually a full size single bed) and with our luggage and the 4 of us in the one room it was a very very tight squeeze. The hotel had told us that it would be a squeeze but we really should've been given 2 rooms or a family room. It was ok for 1 night but no more than that.We didn't get breakfast the next day as it was finished early so we decided to get it to the room but you have to go down and collect it. We then decided to have it in the restaurant before we left for the airport but were told they no longer do an 'all day breakfast' even though it was advertised. Needless to say we were disappointed so when we checked out we got an earlier shuttle bus to the airport, checked in and had our lunch then.

<Content>Could be better Overall good, clean, comfortable hotel, close to the airport but:- shuttle bus is quite rare (every 30-40 minutes) and costs $5 although advertised everywhere that is free (in fact it is free to get to the hotel from the airport, but then coming back to the airport costs $5 but let's be honest - staying at an 'airport hotel' means you want to come back to the airport...)- overall it is a bit pricey: $79 but it does not include breakfast ($15), internet ($25 for 24h - the only choice), and any other expenses like laundry- my room was very noisy, as the vent in the bathroom was making terrible noise and it was not possible to turn it off; plus planes coming above the hotel quite frequently... (I mean, they could have put better windows)

<Content>Not Safe, Hotel Robbed While I was There Not safe. The night I stayed at the Ibis, it was robbed. I don't know the extent of the crime, if it was just the reception desk that was robbed or if rooms off the lobby were robbed as well. I exited the elevators at 5am to go to the airport to find crime scene tape, cops and broken glass.Rooms not clean. Upon first glance the room appeared to be clean, but then I noticed large red stains in various spots on the rug. Looked like blood, can't see how it would be anything else like wine just because of how the spots were and where they were located. I had called down for an extra blanket and the one sent to me was covered in hair.Bathroom is tiny. The bathroom is about twice the size of an airplane bathroom and the shower gets the floor of the entire bathroom soaked.

<Content>Sleeping in the Airport Would be a Better Option Where do I begin, when we arrived at the airport we were tired and wanted to catch the shuttle. Unfortunately, the shuttle only comes every 40 minutes so we had to wait a long time. When we finally got to our room 2 things stuck out: how tiny the room was and the odd shaped bathroom. The bathroom was round so the room had a curved wall. You had to step up into the tiny circular bathroom making it easy to slip when the floor was wet which it did easily since the shower was level with the rest of the floor and water was free to run out. There were no other restaurants around so you had to eat at the overpriced one downstairs. The bed in the room was comfortable, but it didn't matter since you couldn't sleep due to the noise of the highway outside, which was occasionally drowned out by the sound of a 747 buzzing the roof of the hotel. Leaving the hotel, which I was very happy about, was another challenge. We reserved a spot on a shuttle the night before as recommended, since they only run every 40 minutes in the morning too. When we checked out a lot of people were signing up for the shuttle as they checked out. There was a long line for the shuttle and it was apparent that everyone wouldn't fit. They loaded everyone going to the international terminal first leaving us to load last since we were going domestic. There was only one seat left which my wife took and I stood. The bus driver tried to kick me off and wouldn't allow another group on that did reserve a spot the night before at the same time we did. I argued with him and he let me stay on, but I couldn't get them on, hopefully they made their flight. If you do have to stay near the airport, try to stay at one of the other hotels, or just spend the night in the terminal as it is bigger, quieter, and you won't have to deal with the shuttle.

<Content>OK at that price Stayed there for 1 night to catch a 7:35am international flight. Checked online trying to find other better deals near the airport but Ibis was almost the lowest price hotel that comes with a certain level of re-assurance, and that fitted my criteria that I could go to and from the airport quickly. Found the room reasonably clean and as I am small built I didn't have problem with the room size nor shower. They could even provide adaptor on request. And their internet kiosk costs AUD1 per 10 minutes, sounded ok to me (though I didn't use it).Already set my expectation before I picked airport hotels that food wouldn't be cheap because of the location. Ordered a prawn pasta that costed AUD20 and the quality was reasonable for that price.Service was, again, ok. Friendly enough. And perhaps because of the complaints of the customers have made in this forum, they did alert me that the transfer to the airport costs AUD5. (So yes, forum fellows, this is what we are for, to improve their services and accomodation quality. And thanks for the reviews).The only thing they need to improve is to advise directions (amongst other things) to get the Free transfer from domestic or international arrivals via their online hotel brokers' hotel content page. I had to call Ibis (before l left home) via Expedia customer service hotline to figure that out. All in all, not a great/good deal but I'd say it's adequate/reasonable for its location and convenience.

<Content>Cheap and Nasty Experience I stayed here in a standard room booked on wotif.com and I was so disappointed with the experience. I wish I could find one positive about my experience but I honestly can't. Here are some lowlights:1. No trolleys available when we got out of our taxi. Waited 15 minutes on the curb/sidewalk and then decided we had to get our bags upstairs to our room so we lugged them up. The management couldn't find trolleys - they have 3 trolleys he told me for 150 plus rooms! No wonder they couldn't find them.2. Long wait for the only lift that was working - the other lift had a sign 'out of order'3. Room had a portable bathroom installed - the kind you would find on a boat! I had to step over the ledge that was designed to stop water going in in rough sees! I kid you not!! I couldn't turn around in the bathroom without hitting my elbow on a wall.4. Finally got my stuff in the room, waited for a lift downstairs to get a beer at the bar, and had to pay $7 for single beer. I have never had to pay that for an Australian beer, even at a sporting event! Then when I got it there was no head on the beer - had been poured by a 18 year old boy or something and was flat as a tack.This is definitely a third rate hotel - the worst I have stayed in and there have been some other bad ones over the years. Avoid like the plague - stay at the airport formula one instead if you are after a cheap room.

<Content>Would not go back We stayed at the Ibis Sydney for just 1 night, as we had a late night arrival on one plane and an early departure on another. I鈥檓 not sure I鈥檇 call our overnight stay a disaster, but I was definitely underwhelmed.The free shuttle bus only picks up at the airport every 40 minutes, which is way too long between visits when you鈥檙e tired late at night. Therefore, we took a taxi and it cost about A$ 6.50. Check-in was easy and quick, and we inquired about a shuttle the next morning. Once again, it鈥檚 only every 40 minutes, and we had to have an RSVP. There was no discussion of fees, as I assumed it was free and the clerk didn鈥檛 say anything.Our room was on the 2nd floor. I neglected to take photos of the hallway, but the carpets were very worn, thin, and faded. There were even small rips. The room was small, and since Accor Ibis is a French company, it reminded me of small, compact European rooms. We were in the room less than 8 hours, so it didn鈥檛 really matter, but still felt small for the money we paid. The Ibis is obviously in the flight path of Sydney airport as the planes were easily heard throughout the night.When we checked out, we were finally informed the shuttle costs A$5.00 per person. Not a huge sum of money, but would have been nice to know beforehand as it would have been cheaper to take a taxi for the 2 of us and we鈥檇 have the control of when to leave. While waiting outside, the shuttle bus driver shows up and tells the line of waiting people (about 10 of us) that a car was on fire on the road to the international terminal, so he鈥檚 not going there. Perhaps in 40 minutes it will be clear. No empathy or proactive solutions, and people had to go inside to get refunds and get suggestions on how to get to the airport. As I see it1.The driver could have called ahead from the road to the reception desk once he saw the car on fire near the international terminal. At 6:20am, this would have saved time for those in line2.The driver could have shown at least some empathy for a huge line of people who were probably tired and on a tight time schedule3.The desk clerk did not offer to call taxis for people, but casually pointed to the phones and suggested people call or walk down the street to hail a cab4.The shuttle fee should have been communicated beforehand.If this was a super budget hotel, perhaps I could overlook these things, but since we paid a moderate price, there just wasn鈥檛 value for the price. Avoid this hotel if possible.

<Content>Great Airport stopover Stayed here for 1 night before heading off to another city 鈥?2 adults  a 5 yr old. We had a double and single in our room. We booked on line which was easy. The hotel offers a FREE shuttle from the airport but it鈥檚 not mentioned in detail on their website. It runs every 40 mins (confirm times with the hotel) from bus stop 6 and it takes 5 mins. Last bus is 10.50pm. If there鈥檚 2 of you, when you get to the hotel get one person to head in straight away whilst the other person gets the bag from the bus so you head to the front of the check in queue otherwise it can take some time to check in if the bus is full.The room was basic and clean and had air con. It鈥檚 n0 5 star but it was adequate and worth the money easily. Even though it鈥檚 close to the airport it鈥檚 well sound proofed so we had no problems with noise.Breakfast comes highly recommended as it was a good price and was a great start to the day and much appreciated after airplane food.We paid a mere $100AUD (拢45) for the room which is a good price for a hotel so close to the airport.

<Content>Nice hotel, shame about the service of the staff Clean hotel, modern and all that you require for an airport stop over.Tried to grab something to eat at about 9pm after flying two sectors earlier in the day.... very poor service, slow and we practically had to beg them to bring us drinks!!!Didn't seem bothered even when they were questioned that we had not been given what we had ordered.Other than that the hotel is adequate for an airport stay.

<Content>Good value for money Stayed here for one night to catch an early flight after the Grand Final. Well located, within walking distance from the Mascot train station. The hotel operates a shuttle to the airport (for a nominal fee). The room was neat and clean. Shower pressure was excellent. Well worth the money spent.
