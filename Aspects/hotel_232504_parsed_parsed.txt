<Content>Great location!!! Nice, clean hotel! The hotel was clean  modern, very close to Leidseplein which was nice! It's with in walking distance to museum square, vondlepark  the redlight district. The best way to see the city is to WALK! The trams were very close to the hotel too. Hotel was VERY easy to get to from the airport by using the train to central staion  then the tram. We stayed in room 409 which was on the top floor. The room was more spacious than some of the other places I have stayed in Europe. Room also had a nice view of the city. Would recommend getting this room if possible! Hotel had computers in the lobby with free internet which was really nice! Bathroom was a tad small, and had a paper thin shower curtain so after your shower the floor was pretty wet. (my only complaint )Staff cleaned our room every day (we stayed for 5 nights) and overall we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would stay here again next time we visit this beautiful city!

<Content>Taxi scam We did not have too many complaints about our stay other than the room and bed being super small.The place was clean and breakfast was adequate.They had also lost our reservation when I called to check ,but our booking site hrs.com fixed it before arrival at the original rate.The problem happened at check out. We asked the gentleman at the desk to call us a taxi to the central station,which he did.When the taxi arrived,it had no taxi sign outside,it was stashed between the seats inside,he took us to the station and let us out at the back door, not the normal taxi stand in front and charged us 17.70 euros for a normally 11 -12 euro ride.An obvious scam.I would never knowingly stay again in a hotel whose staff are calling scammers when taxi is requested.

<Content>Great Hotel! Great location! Me and my friend stayed in the Eden Amsterdam Centre Hotel in july. We loved this hotel! The location is just perfect. I is right in the middle of the city centre. The staff was very helpful with finding a nice restauant. The room was small, but very modern. We had a room with a nice view on the canals. We came to the hotel by car, and we were very suprised that there was a carparking!I would realy recommend this place.

<Content>great location, free internet We stayed at this Leidseplein hotel for 5 nights for work and while it was a small room, it was efficiently organized. It was also very clean and the decor was above the regular Marriott drab. We even had a view of the canal! While it is very close to Leidsepein for easy transportation options, it is very close to the Negen Straatjes (9 streets) shopping area with boutiques, as well as Museumplein. Even better, it is quite and not far from the residential areas where you can go to a supermarket or street markets to pick up fruits and bottled water. The one thing that was tricky was the breakfast. When we checked in, the front desk informed us of the times that buffet breakfast was served so we thought it was included. However, when we check out, they said our prepaid online price did not include breakfast and it was 15 euros per person per day! If we had known it was not included, we would never have had that breakfast. (it was good quality, but for 15 euros, I'd like some caviar omelet!) As for the free internet, there is no free wireless, but there are 2 computers in the lobby with free access, and usually there is no line.

<Content>Very Disappointed The hotel was booked not by our choice, but by a travel agent as part of their group tour package. If you are 50+, or with any physical limitations, do not consider this hotel. To enter the hotel, you must climb ~ 1/2 a flight of steep stairs. We were a group (~30) of older travelers (all 60+) and had to carry our own suitcases to the lobby - the staff offered no assistance and only watched. The lobby is tiny, barely accommodating the people, let alone their luggage. No assistance was provided to get suitcases to the room - which took a while as the elevator barely fit 2 suitcases and a person. The room we were assigned was miniscule. To avoid bumping into the wall when getting out of bed, you had to scoot to the end of the bed, and then be careful not to trip over your suitcase as there was no place to put them except on the floor. They were ill prepared to handle a larger group of people coming in for breakfast running out of silverware and food and not seeming to care (another steep set of stairs to get to the breakfast room). Others in our group indicated they had a larger room and said it was ok. The saving grace for us was that it was at least located ~.3 miles to a tram that you can take to the center of Amsterdam. We would not consider this hotel to be in the center of Amsterdam, but the outer fringe of the centrum. The hotel was relatively clean, but the decor was tired. The bathroom was in good condition, but had a half step to enter and many stubbed their toes! Watch out though - the shower curtain was too short so you can easily create a flood when showering! Have fun!

<Content>Eden Amsterdam I stayed in town for a conference. Given the reviews on Trip Advisor I set my expectation low. I was surprised to find a nice hotel that was overall great value for the money. My room was clean and modern. I originally booked a single and was given the smallest room I have ever stayed in. I went back to the reception and after some discussion was upgraded to standard for extra 10 Euro per night which was great. I had some issues with my final bill (they wanted to charge me 30 Euro per night) but it was resolved eventually. Overall the experience was good and I will stay there again.K.R.

<Content>No Complaints! I stayed here on a room only basis with my partner. Our first impressions were that the outside of the hotel, the reception area, the bar area and the room itself were all clean, smart and well decorated. Yes, the bar area was abit smoky ( only because someone was smoking in there!) and yes the room was quite small but this is Amsterdam afterall!We had a first floor room and despite being warned about ongoing refubishments, we didnt hear/see any work going on during our 3 night stay. The room was modern, had a lcd tv with cable channels movies, a decent sized bathroom  shower  was nice  cosy considering it was freezing outside! The traffic on the road outside was quite busy between 4pm-11pm but this is to be expected in any city centre. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the hotel is in the perfect location. To be honest im rather baffled by some of the poor reviews and comments people have made about their awful experiences!Theres so much to do in Amsterdam we only went back to the room to re-charge  sleep  all in all had a fantasic time  would definately go back.N.B the hotel is now called Eden Centre and is now non smoking apart from in the bar area.

<Content>Very Disappointing Booked a deluxe double, got a tiny twin room. Building works were ongoing (I wasn't aware of this as we booked through a third party but it does state it on their website) The receptionist was very helpful and pleasant, said we had a quiet room on the first floor - it might have been quiet if not for the workmen in the room above who started work at 6 am. Hotel stank of smoke, especailly the reception was disappointing, I'm not a smoker but my partner is and he found it off putting as well. Maybe when the upgrade is done the hotel might be worth recommending.......

<Content>Decent experience I thought the rate was high for the very small room that I had booked. The room seemed clean, and we had a window's view of someone's backyard. Although the website says that it's near to Museumplein (it definitely is), it's also close to the Leidesplein tram stop (I believe the 1, 2, 5 stop by there).

<Content>Tacky hotel and tacky staff Smoky, tiny room, bed slanted head down. We put our bags in the room, went to the desk and told them we had smoke in our room and had requested a non smoking room. Did they have another? The answer was no, yet people continued to check in after us.We went out for dinner down the street and after dinner walked into the NH Hotel and booked another room. We went back to the hotel and upon telling them we were checking out they informed us that there were better rooms available. When I asked the girl at the front why she didn't change the room at the beginning she said the room just came up.Needless to say we still checked out and had a great last night in Amsterdam after 30 days of travel.The hotel still charged us for the night even though we had not used the room.Tacky hotel and tacky staff. Date of our stay was October 4, 2007

<Content>Absolutely awful experience This hotel was absolutely awful. The corridor and rooms were stinking of smoke. My room faced a courtyard, no daylight at all. The rooms were not particular clean, the interior was out of date. It was one of the most depressing hotels I have ever stayed in if not the worst one...I cannot believe it cost 140 EUR and I cannot recommend anyone to book through Hillgate Travel Agency, unfortunately our company is using them as their travel agency...they are just as incompetent....

<Content>great hotel unhelpful staff Upon arrival at the tulip inn we were informed of a mistake that had been made, although we had been told it would not be a problem. By not having the card used to make payment we were initially made stranded until we had to get a fax sent through verifying the card was not stolen. this was a major problem on our trip and got it off to a bad start. the staff where at either end of the spectrum some were highly helpful yet one in particular was ignorant and didn't care and made it extremely clear this was not her problem.Other than this the room was small but very clean and of nice decor, the shower was like a kettle and burned me on several occasions. the location is superb and it is near tig barra which is a lovely lively venue. i would stay in the hotel again but the one thing that was a problem was an unhelpful member of staff.

<Content>Nice spot for a night or two Clean, neat and everyone was very efficient and helpful. This was our first stop of a several country tour, we did not speak the language and we had flown through the night, navigated the train and tram and landed here. So, their excellent English and desire to accomodate was great. They were helpful with directions, cabs, etc. Room was small, yes, but neat and clean and linens were really good. A little crowded for a week long stay but great for a night or two. Internet stations were great to keep in contact with everyone. Small bar and sitting area were nice for a bit of elbow room when you needed it. Amsterdam is so beautiful and there is so much to explore, nobody should stay in their hotel room for anything more than sleeping anyway.

<Content>Not bad Given the size of European hotels  the general level of customer service in Amsterdam this place was not bad. Customer service was adequate and the room was neat  clean. Furnishings were new  modern. The price was right for me: 120 USD or less per night. Great location: close to the Leidseplein  Rijksmuseum and away from the tacky / seedy Red Light and Central Station areas. That said, everything in Amsterdam is walking distance. Did have a little bit of a mosquito problem, but that is to be expected any where with all those canals and no AC (necessitating open windows).

<Content>Tulip inn centre I have now been to Amsterdam 5 times over the last 5 years, this was one of the best hotels I have stayed in yet. The hotel is just 2 mins walk from leidseplein.Yes the rooms are cosy, not what Americans will be comfortable with, (but everything in Amsterdam is narrow and tall.) The room was modern, very clean, you get a tv with movie access, safe, telephone, internet access. The security is very good as you have to use your door card to access the lifts and stairs and if you only plan to use the hotel to sleep and get ready to go out this is a perfect location. The hotel has a cheap bar, free internet access.After you check out, by 11am, you can then store your bags.Remember city tax charge will apply on top of your hotel bill! This caught us out.

<Content>Definitely Return Hi, Just returned after 4 nights at this great hotel.As others have said the rooms are pretty small,but everything you need from a City hotel.Easy check in with polite staff,very clean rooms with a great power shower. Its all about location with this hotel,couple of minutes walk to Liedersplein with its numerous bars and countless restaurants.From here you can catch a tram that passes a number of attractions including the Flower Market (only a short walk to Rembrandtsplein) and Dam Square. When we go back we will look no further than this hotel,but i must say it would really benefit from air conditioning !

<Content>Incredible Hotel! The Tulip Inn Hotel was an excellent place to stay! Our room was compact, well designed, immaculately clean, and quiet. We were pleasantly surprised by the hotels convenience, and accessibilty. Though our room was compact, it was well designed and thought out. Everything had its place!The staff were helpful and friendly, more than willing to help us when we needed assistance navigating the transit system and finding different locations within the city. The Tulip Inn is perfectly situated in the centre of the city, within walking distance to dozens of restaurants, bars, museums, and shopping! The hotel also provides free internet access in the main lobby.If you are looking for a great place to stay in the heart of the city, this is an amazing hotel! Highly reccommended!!!

<Content>Blah This place was NOT GOOD. I am normally very easy to please when it comes to hotels, but the staff at this place was seriously clueless. It took them forever to find our reservation and get us a room (to the point where we were worried we'd be turned away!). The room we finally got was TINY. Again, I'm from NY and do not expect much in terms of space! But this was shockingly small. Whatever, it was clean and we only stayed for one night. But I would definitely NOT recommend this place.Good location, though!

<Content>Reasonable place to stay near the centre Small clean room (probably a bit small for more than a couple of days) with air con and a flat screen TV. Good bed. We first were allocated a smoking room but they changed this without fuss. A bit noisy from the road early morning but not too bad. We thought we had booked at the Golden Tulip Hotel, Centre....which is much more swish and went there first...so we were a little disappointed but for one night it did the job! Nearby Cafe Belgique about 5 mins walk is a good place for breakfast.

<Content>Great hotel close to the restaurants We booked two rooms (one for me and my husband) and the other for my parents.Both were double rooms within the same price bracket, however one room was considerably larger than the other. Great tidy rooms, which looked like they were recently refurbished. Flat screen TV on the wall, and air con.Quiet room, conveniently located near the restaurant area of Amsterdam centre.Only negative was the breakfast. At 15 Euro each it was very expensive and you didn't get much for what you paid for.We would definitely recommend eating elsewhere.Rececption provided a map of Amsterdam upon arrival and we were able to leave our bags until our room was available later in the day.We were pleasantly surprised by the hotel, as it was one of the cheaper hotels closer to the centre that we were able to find.

<Content>Horrendous I was never given a confirmation of my reservation with this hotel. When I called the hotel to confirm my reservation, I was told I had none. I was charged for a no-show anyways. Then when I wrote to the hotel about the matter, I was denied a refund. It is truly shocking that a large hotel chain would treat its guests in such an appalling and careless manner.

<Content>Terrible customer service A very disappointing experience! We were forced to pay for a room that we could not use. The receptionist was not apologetic about the situation and basically said it was our problem. Here鈥檚 what happened: My colleague in Germany made the reservation, prepaid, for a double room for my cousin and me. Upon arrival, the receptionist hastily handed the check in form for us to fill out and moved on to help another customer. She was still helping the other customer when we completed our form, so another receptionist helped us with the check in. He took the long time, about 15 minutes, checking us in. We were handed our room key, so off we went. When we opened the door, the room turned out to be single room. Thinking that they simply made a mistake, we went back downstairs to get the room situation straightened out. We spoke to the original receptionist. She simply said they had more single rooms than doubles, and they were out of double rooms. We asked her to refer us to another hotel. Fine, she said, but we would still need to pay for the room that we could not use. It was our choice to stay or go. 15 minutes of pointing out that it was their problem that they could not accommodate us went nowhere. We finally just asked her to refer us to another hotel and we left.

<Content>Great location, fab room The hotel was reasonably priced especially for the location and the room. The room was genorously sized, with a lovely clean bathroom, flat screen tv, adequate desk space, comfortable bed and a safe. Its located about 2 mins walk away from the Leidesplain and about 10mins from the museums. We enjoyed our time in Amsterdam sunning ourselves in the Vodelpark, drinking and dineing out in the Leidesplein, and visiting all the v touristy places. We only had to pay to get the tram once during our stay as we managed to walk to most places we wanted to visit in Amstedam. Only issue with the hotel was the tiny lift, but we just used to stairs instead. Fabulous stay and would definantly recommend.

<Content>Excellent Mini Break Hotel My boyfriend and I stayed at the Tulip Inn for 3 nights on a mini-break. Excellent location to explore Amsterdam and close to some cosy restaurants, if you look beyond the neon signs. Only a 15 minute stroll to Dam Square via the main shopping streets. The reception area and lounge/bar were clean and bright and the staff friendly and helpful. Free internet access and a selection of magazines and newspapers to browse in the lounge area were a bonus. The room itself was compact but the decor was modern and the room was very clean and bright. No bath but a powerful shower. The room was cleaned every day. In my opinion, this hotel provided fantastic value for money and I would definitiely stay here again.

<Content>Small but nice We stayed here for 5 nights in early January. The hotel was in a great location - tram stops nearby as well as bars and restaurants etc. It gave good value for money ( we got low rates through expedia), a lot cheaper than staying right in the centre. The staff were friendly and the hotel tidy. Didn't try their breakfast but had some drinks in the bar each night which seemed to stay open until quite late. Our room was small but clean as was the bathroom,so neither caused any problems. We would be happy to stay here again and recommend it for a break in the city.

<Content>A superb hotel Although the room was a bit cramped, it was nicely set out and clean. The hotel staff were very friendly and overall i enjoyed my stay in the hotel. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk away from the Damrack but there are enough restaurants, shops and bars within a minutes walk, that you do not feel out of the way.A great hotel!

<Content>Very nice hotel in a great location Having read a few dodgy reviews I was unsure what to expect.Upon arrival I found a very pleasant hotel in an excellent location. The staff were very friendly and the accomodation was how I expected. Yes, the rooms were not the biggest but there was ample room to change, sleep etc and they came equipped with an easy to use safe. The hotel was very clean and the free internet in lobby was very handy. I would recommed the hotel and definitley stay there again. People who expect greater things should really look to be staying in the Marriot next door and paying well over the 70 euros a night we paid.

<Content>Excellent Hotel After reading some of the reviews of this hotel I was apprehensive about what was facing me. When we arrived at the hotel we were impressed by the reception area and the prompt and friendly service we were given. The only access to the upstairs is by key card in the lift or the door to the stairs so we felt very secure. When we entered the bedroom it was a perfect size for two, flat screen tv and very comfy beds after trekking around Amsterdam. I would recommend ths hotel to my friends and family. It is slightly out of the centre but the walk to Dam Square is nice and you can experience most sides of the city. I would recommend a map as it can be very confusing especially at night.The only down side was that the shower was very powerful but the shower tray and curtain weren't adequate.

<Content>little mistake Two of us have just come back from a 4 day stay at the Tulip Central and the only souveniers I have are brusises from bumping into the bedroom furniture! The room was so small we had to put our case on the dressing table as there was no floor space, the chair at the dressing table could not be pulled out as it was only about 6 from the bed and whilst one was getting ready the other had to lie on the bed! Having said that the staff were lovely and the hotel was very clean - how they got a vaccum in the room is beyond me. The location was also very good but i don't think anyone should be expected to stay in a room (105) that size, it certainly should not have been described as a twin room

<Content>A nice hotel to visit My husband and I recently returned from our stay at the Tulip Inn. The hotel has a cute slogan,Where the Stars Meet and they literally mean what they say...The building contains two hotels, one Tulip Inn three star hotel and the second the Golden Tulip four star hotel. The rooms at the Tulip Inn were clean and offered all of the aminities we needed for our stay. The hotel is far enough from downtown to offer a relaxing stay, yet close in proximity by taking the #22 or #48 bus. Be careful when traveling after 12:30a.m. because you have to take another bus, the night bus. Make sure you ask where the stop is located. We traveled one night on the night bus expecting the bus to drop us off in front of the hotel as the day busses do; however, the stop was on the opposide side of the street... We were unaware the next stop was about two miles down the road and they did not offer any buses going back to the hotel nor did they offer any going back to Central Station... Pretty scarry at 1:00 in the morning! Overall the hotel was a pleasant stay and the staff excellent. One word of caution, be careful with the windows as they can be pushed out and into the room. I received a nasty cut from one of the windows by not realizing it was situatied under my chair...

<Content>A Great Small Hotel A great small Hotel - saw some of earlier negative reviews - but my stay was a pleasure. Very reasonable rate, clean room and more than adequate toilet and bath amenities, well-maintained, and very helpful and friendly staff - with free internet facilities. Would definitely stay again.(Perth, Australia)

<Content>Small rooms and one tiny tiny bathroom with paper thin walls The hotel was centrally located. But Amsterdam is so small, you can walk or bike to any where in the city in about 10-20 minutes. The rooms were extremely bare and small. We stayed on the top floor, yet we could hear people walking/talking on our floor and the one below. The walls are paper thin!! We could hear the people in the next room lifting the toliet seat!!! The bathroom was also extremely tiny with a shower that was about 2 feet by 2 feet. When we took a shower the entire bathroom got wet. Also, no air conditioning. We stayed there 3 long nights and slept with ear plugs all 3 nights. It felt more like a hostel-not like a hotel.

<Content>Excellent location Don't know if it changed much since last summer, but, I had a great  relaxing stay at this hotel! It was walking distance to all the top tourist sites and tram services. They offered free wireless internet in a comfortable lounge area  their rooms were modern  secure. Their breakfast was pricy but their room rates were affordable if you booked in advance  online of course. The hotel desk staff were friendly  helpful. I'd consider staying there again! I noticed some comments on this site regarding a wallet or luggage being stolen - welcome to Amsterdam! Perhaps you missed the videos playing on trams showing how pick-pockets can steal your personal belongings? Hope you had insurance coverage!

<Content>Watch your wallet Average hotel with poor service, !! Because i am a travelagent in the Netherlands and i have stayed in this hotel several times i found out after some research with colleagues that the hotel has a reputation to overbook and then move you to another hotel without any compensation.Tip. If you want to book here, make sure that you contact them by email/fax a couple of days before arrival, so they can confirm your reservation at the hotel in writing. It will reduce the chanche that they wil book you out to another less comfortable hotel. Tip. Make a hell of a scene with management if they have overbooked the hotel, because if you make a reservation it means that you have a businessagreement with them so they have to follow up to that agreement. Call the police if necessary.

<Content>At the same level as a youth hostel Have stayed in Amsterdam at the Marriott for the last 5 years...the hotel is uninspiring but you know what you are getting. When I went to book this trip, it was 290 Euros/night. I tried the Tulip Inn Amsterdam Center, and was immediately disaapointed once I opened my door. The room is just too small! The window(no a/c) overlooked a dirty little alley. Whenever I came off the lift, I smelled the same perculiar smell...vomit mixed with hazzlenuts. The carperts are dirty but the rest of the rooms are pretty clean. The only saving grace about this hotel is the free wi-fi in the bar and the day staff..The one gentleman working in the evening only can say no, we are fully booked.Do stay here if you are newly graduated from college, an feel as if your dorm room was too big for your needs.

<Content>perfectly situated hi! we stayed in the tulip inn amsterdam central and found it perfect! its located in leidseplein which is a lively place with all the best bars and restaurants not to mention shops! its about a 5 minute walk away from leidseplein square so its nice and quiet at night but you dont need a taxi. rooms very small but clean and staff friendly, food is usual european fare of bread ham and cheese enjoyable though. when we arrived at schipol airport we took train to central station, there we bought a 3 day tram pass and took the 5 tram all the way to leidseplein you can also take the 2. highly recommend it

<Content>Poor choice! Very disapointing, expensive to get to from Central Station (17 Euro), access is difficult for luggage, as the room elevators are accessed by walking through the restaurant and lounge. They charge high rates for the wireless internet and the breakfast. The room was cold and the bed uncomfortable, certainly nothing to brag about...but worst of all, the carpet in the room and the hallways was filthy. Don't believe the frequent flier promotions they offer, you only get points if you pay rack rate. Not Recomended!

<Content>Great Hotel I stayed at the Tulip Inn Amsterdam Centre for 3 nights. The hotel had a small bar and free internet access in the reception. Staff were friendly. Room was extremely clean, ours was a decent size (room 120). Room also had a flat screen TV with loads of channels. Beds were comfortable but we had 2 singles pushed together instead of a double. Hotel was close to Leidseplein square where there are loads of shops, coffee shops and restaurants. Its a 20 minute walk or short tram ride to the train station and Red Light District. I would definately book this hotel again. Downfall was they called to clean the rooms at 8.30am, even when the do not disturb sign was on the door. Otherwise a very pleasant stay.

<Content>Very clean hotel We booked a double room and stayed for two nights. The room was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast is not worth 14 euros though. There are plenty of cafes nearby where you can get breakfast (full English between six and ten euros each). Hotel only a short walk from the tram stop. Close enough to walk to bars, restaurants at the Leidseplein, but far enough away to get a good night's sleep. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>great location, great value! having read the previous reviews, i was worried that we would be sent to another hotel; luckily, that did not happen..staff at the front desk were very helpful and even helped looking up the train schedule on the net; the room was a decent size, modern, clean and comfy..only complaint i have is that there is no air-con (which is fine this time of the year since it is winter); location is great..just a 5 min short walk and there are a bunch of bars and restaurants! if you are coming from the airport, take the train to central station and then take tram 1, 2 or 15

<Content>dont go When I booked my hotel via internet I was really happy about the hotel, two day before I was going I confirmed my booking, the room seemed so nice and modern on the pictures and the location was perfect I had all sight seeing planed around its location. When I Got to the hotel after a day traveling the receptionist greetings were 'Sorry, but the hotel is fully booked'. In the Lobby three girls Maltese as well had the same problem.Not a nice way to start a holiday. we were allocated to another Hotel Eden Best Western were we where given an apartment with no lift facilities and the apertment was on 3rd floor. However, service and cleaniness were good.If you're thinking of visiting Amsterdam, go its beautiful, just avoid Tulip inn amsterdam centre, later on i got to know that this problem happens very frequently.

<Content>Clean, welcoming hotel Stayed at the Tulip Inn for 2 nights. We had 2 single rooms, both comfortable and clean. Beds were cosy, showers powerful and hot! The staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel was within easy reach of tram and water bus. Although the weather was cold and wet we enjoyed our trip on the museum boat, that came right past the Tulip Inn. I have to recommend the NEMO science centre for anyone with kids who love 'hands-on ' learning with lots of buttons to press and fun (also great for big kids!!!). But AVOID the 3D Amsterdam experience. This is very disappointing, a waste of time and money.We had a lovely meal at the Asian restaurant 2 doors down from the Hard Rock Cafe. Excellent food in tasteful surroundings. I would definitely stay at the Tulip Inn again, great value for money.

<Content>A nice stay Stayed here for 5 nights in early November. The location was good: it's easy to get to by tram and leidseplein, kalverstraat and the museums are within walking distance. The single room in top floor (#406) was nice and wasn't facing the street so there was no traffic noise and had a good sleep. Didn't have the breakfast so can't comment on that.

<Content>couldn't ask for a better hotel, location, service, atmosphere... list goes on! Well... where should I begin?! Me and my boyfriend who are both 22 years old have just recently come back from Amsterdam! We went over there on 25th November for a long weekend! We actually stayed at the Tulip Inn for 3 nights鈥?I鈥檓 not sure how much I paid for the hotel room itself, but flight from London to Amsterdam and a 3 night stay in the Tulip Inn cost a total of 拢370 for the both of us so it wasn鈥檛 too bad I guess?! We thought we鈥檇 be brave and attempt the Netherlands public transportation and it was straight forward! We landed in Schiphol airport at 8pm and as you walk through arrivals your at the Schiphol airport station! There were tickets machines where you can purchase train tickets but it only take euro coins or cards! A train ticket into Amsterdam Central Station cost 鈧?.40 pp (if I rightly remember)! And it only took 15 鈥?20mins! We then had to get the tram to Leidseplein where the hotel is situated! You can either get a No. 1, 2 or 5 tram which cost 鈧?.60 pp which was very reasonably! The hotel is a few minutes walk from the tram stop! The hotel is located away from the main Leidseplein square area where all the night life goes on but it was a good thing because you was away from all the hustle and bustle and got a decent nights' kip! Arriving at the hotel we were very surprised cos it looked very modern compared to its neighbouring hotels from the outside! The front desk people were very friendly and courteous! We checked in and everything was fine! We got a non smoking room on the 4th floor鈥?our room number was 423! We had to walk through the lobby and bar area where there was also free internet access section with 24hr vending machines that sells snacks... to access the lift to go to our floor! The prices for beverages were same as the main shops! Security was good as you needed your room key to access the lift! We was very delighted with our room鈥?even though looking out on the window it wasn鈥檛 a magnificent view鈥?the room itself was so cosy! Yes, it was small鈥?but most European city hotel rooms are! This hotel is by far the best European city break hotel we鈥檝e stayed in! It was so modern鈥?you had flat screen TV hanging on the wall! The bathroom was spacious! We had a power shower! There was an hairdryer built into the walls! The wardrobe was spacious... enough storage for both our clothes! There was also a safety deposit box which was free! Housekeeping was done everyday! Fresh cleaned towels were provided everyday too! Staying in Leidseplein was far better then staying in Amsterdam square! Leidseplein had all the night life and it was walking distance to shops and places to eat! We spent most of our time in Leidseplein because it was better then the square! You had much more of a variety of things to do! If your a football fan and can鈥檛 bare to miss a game away from home (even though your on holiday) which my boyfriend is (and a major Arsenal fan who made us walk all over Amsterdam to find a place that showed Arsenal vs. Blackburn) then your in luck! There鈥檚 an English pub right next to Burger King in Leidseplein square where they show every premiership game! When we was there, there was like 5 games playing at once! There was loads of screens in there so you can watch all the games at the same time if you wanted! It was surreal! But an experience! We went on a canal bus route which was outside the hotel opposite the tram station to the Anne Frank house, the canal boat stopped right outside the Anne Frank house and that cost 鈧? pp on the canal bus route! The Anne Frank house was a bit disappointing as the annex itself was just empty rooms!Shopping in Amsterdam is expensive! Food and drink too! All the souvenir shops all more or less sell the same thing! The only downside of the Tulip Inn was that housekeeping was done at 8:30am! So from a long night the last thing you want to do is being woken up to a knock on your door hearing 鈥渉ouse keeping鈥? But to resolve this鈥?just stick your 鈥渄o not disturb鈥?sign on the door before you go sleep! It helped only a little bit as the walls are quite thin and you can hear all the noise that they make on the landing and people鈥檚 door slamming and walking in the corridor! But that was the only down side! All in all鈥?Amsterdam was fun! Very cold during this time of year! Tulip Inn topped it off because it was situated in a great location! The hotel itself was amazing! The staff were polite! The hotel is clean and bright! I thought I should write one of these reviews cos as a frequent traveller I鈥檓 always wary of the hotels I would be staying in and reviews on TripAdvisor helps give a better picture and I just hope mine helps in anyway it can.

<Content>A Fine Little Hotel A fine little hotel within easy walking distance of many prime attractions (Van Gogh, National Museum, expensive shopping district)but far enough from the hustle and bustle of the Dam (main city center area) to be quiet. Hotel staff are polite, friendly and very helpful (buy tickets at the front desk for the museums). Take the #370 bus from Schipol Airport to the Leidsplein stop. (costs about 3.50 Euros/person and is much cheaper then the taxis) Get off at Leidsplein, then face the Marriott. The hotel is on the right side of the Marriott and about a two minute walk from it. (Watch out for bikes when walking at all times, but especially when crossing streets!)The #1, 2 and 5 tram stops are also at Leidsplein, which will take you downtown to the Dam or to the Central Station in a few minutes. The rooms are small by US standards but twins are adequate and have most conveniences. We asked for a non-smoking room (we got #420)which was on the top floor and very quiet. The view did not overlook the canal but it was fine.The hotel has a free Internet connection in the lobby area. The only small issue is that they will automatically charge you for breakfast every day (13 Euros each) -- just tell them at checkout when you actually ate there (if you do at all -- it's expensive and there are other choices relatively nearby -- try the Pancake Restaurant a few blocks away) and they will adjust the charges with no problems. All in all this was a great, economical place to stay -- clean, helpful and a retreat from the bustling city. We suggest that you reconfirm your reservations on the phone or on the Internet (they are responsive)before you go.

<Content>Book here at your peril... My party of 6 people was in Amsterdam last weekend and had a near identical experience to the previous reviewer. Despite booking well in advance we were informed on arrival that the hotel had overbooked and that we had been transferred to a sister hotel. The hotel we ended up in was perfectly adequate (obviously we have no way to compare the two)but this chain is cynically taking bookings above the rooms they have available on their most appealing hotel in order to gain business for their other hotels. My advice would be - do not book here as who knows where you will actually end up!

<Content>Would of been good! Unfortunately I did not get to stay in this hotel even though I booked it 6 weeks in advance. I arrived to be told in no uncertain terms and with no hint of apology that they had overbooked and that myself and my friends were being moved to a different hotel. I found the attitude aloof to say the least. I was however even more upset to find that the hotel we were moved to was on the other side of the city in a much less desirable and accessible area. The reason for booking the tulip in the forst place was for location. Also the best western hotel we were moved to was clearly inferior to the Tulip. I found this whole experience to be dissapointing and left a bad tatse in the mouth. I think it is a disgrace to accept a booking and accept payment and then move people. I will certainly not use any tulip hotel in the future.

<Content>Great Deal, Great Location I found this hotel after having a terrible time booking two nights in Amsterdam for early September, 2005. Everything was either sold out or incredibly expensive. I booked this hotel based on the recommendations from this site and felt they were an accurate representation of what to expect. The rooms are very small, but efficient, clean, modern (flat screen T.V.). I was staying alone in a double room (upgraded by the front desk from a single) and frankly it would have been cramped for even two people. The teeny tiny bathroom had modern appliances but the sink was so small that it was virtually impossible to wash my face or brush my teeth without hitting the glass shelf above it. However, the small shower had good water pressure and plenty of hot water.I did not have an air conditioned room, but the fan provided enough circulation (high temps were in the low 70sF) that I was not uncomfortable.Overall, I likened this place to a European equivalent of a Hampton Inn (albeit with much smaller rooms!)--designed for a business traveler with just the right amenities. The free internet in the lobby was very key.Location I thought was ideal. I would not have wanted to stay near Central Station and all the cheesy crappy souvenier shops. The location near the museums allowed me to walk to many attractions, and the tram was easy enough to take you to other parts of the city.I would definitely stay here again if it was just me. The value is great, location great. I would think twice if I was traveling with someone else simply because the rooms are really, really small.
