<Content>It is a Dump! Needed a place to stay one night for Pearl Harbor Commemoration. If I had been with wife, I would have left to find another place to stay. The only bright spot was that my rental car was still in the parking lot in the morning so I could leave.

<Content>Don't do it! Customer service was the worst I've ever experienced!!! Personally coming from the hospitality field myself, the way the management handled a customer complaint was worse than that of a teenager. The way he handled himself was more then inappropriate. Harassing a Veteran on Veteran's Day is not exactly what I would call top of the line service. If you are looking to book a hotel reservation I highly recommend that it be elsewhere, where the staff cares more about the customer than the over-pricing. Jeff Kemblin, the manager I spoke with, humiliated me when I was in the presence of an out-ranking Non-Comissioned Officer; I spoke to him on speaker phone.

<Content>Not Bad For One Night Needed a hotel room near the airport because of an early flight. After reading reviews for all Honolulu airport hotels, chose this one mainly due to price. We were pleasantly surprised to find a clean, relatively quiet, spartan room with functioning A/C, prompt shuttle service, and friendly staff. The hotel is in the middle of an industrial area. A bit overpriced, since a bit further into Waikiki there are cheaper hotels, but perfect for quick airport access.

<Content>A glorified motel I paid $110 for one night (for a party of three) at this hotel. Overall, it was a disappointment. The hotel is like a glorified motel, with a pool and cleaner rooms. Though it had two beds in our room, there was not a single chair. it also lacked a bedside table. The bathroom had a shower only, no tub. Though it is close to the airport and it offers free shuttle service, the shuttle bus runs only every half hour or so. The sound isolation of the hotel rooms is terrible -- you can hear every take off and landing, unless, of course, you are too tired to stay awake. I would not recommend this hotel.

<Content>Horrible We received a AAA rate and it was $122 after all taxes. This hotel is located very close to the airport but it has no restaurants or hotels nearby . The room did not even have a coffee maker or a hair dryer. the bed was clean. The pictures on the website does not at all resemble the place. Really scary place. We did not feel safe.

<Content>All The Ambiance of an Industrial Park in Oakland, California I was stopping over in Honolulu for four days in early December 2007. As it turned out, my visit unintentionally coincided with the timing of the Honolulu Marathon. Therefore, I could not book any of the budget-priced hotels in Waikiki. My choices pretty much came down to something really expensive or... the Pacific Marina Inn. The website makes it look like a decent little property so I figured why not. The stay started out promisingly enough with the complimentary pick-up from the airport (great driver) but went downhill rapidly as we approached the hotel. Looking at the neighborhood, one could be forgiven for thinking that they had been somehow teleported to an industrial park in Oakland, California. The hotel itself is dingy, the pool which looked inviting on the hotel website, looked like something that you wouldn't want to expose your skin to. The room was smallish and barely adequate. A real negative at this hotel is noise from the airport. I have stayed in plenty of airport hotels. They're usually located in such a manner as to avoid as much noise from the runway as possible. Not so with the Pacific Marina Inn. I am an early riser so was in the lobby for complementary coffee before 06:30 in the morning. The thermal pot ran out after I had taken a cup and I informed the desk staff that they were out of coffee. They told me that they only made one pot per morning and that was it! Apart from the coffee incident though, I would have to say the only positive about this hotel is the staff. Everybody I encountered was actually really nice and made you feel welcome. Too bad that they're stuck working in such a horrible, horrible hotel. Thumbs down - adequate for an overnight near the airport and that's about it.

<Content>not so bad I stayed here recently and I can't see what everyone's complaining about. I had a really nice ground floor room. It was spotlessly clean and the staff were really helpful. Yes, it's close to the airport- that's the reason I stayed there, along with the 24- hour free shuttle service.

<Content>Great for "Worst Hotel Experience of my Life" Stories. This hotel was so bad, I am glad we stayed for the hour we did, because it gave me a great story to tell our friends back home in Atlanta. We only needed to stay on Oahu one night before our real vacation on Kauai, so I was not picky. I booked through Hotwire. We got to the front desk to check in and they handed us our room key...and the remote to our tv. Um...ok....? That was weird. We walked to our room and saw a sign in one of the rooms that said Nancy's Fantasy Massage. This is not going to get better, is it? No, no it's not... We get to our room and it was what I would expect to find in the worst hotel in El Salvador. It was horrible. But I STILL was not ready ready to give up on my bargain. Until the domestic violence ensued in the room next to us. Oh yeah...full on fight. smashing, yelling, hitting. The WORKS. We call the Hilton at Waikiki and book a room. But we were stuck at the Pacific Marina Inn until the the fight (which they had taken outside - right next to our door) was over. I threw the keys and the remote on the front desk and ran as fast as I could.

<Content>Overrated This is NOT a two star hotel and for $130 ($150 after taxes) it should be considered stealing. I walked into the room and it was VERY small, dirty and not even close to the pictures on the website. I went to the desk and imeditly sked for refund. Since I booked this through EXPEDIA they would not give me a refund. I called EXPEDIA and they would not refund my money. I ended eating the $150 and stayed in Waikiki for another $180. Much nicer. Don't let the location fool you. it's not worth it. The staff was not friendly either.Oh yeah, the hotel is in the middle of a large industry section by the airport with no other hotels nearby. I wish I had taken a photo of the room so you could compare it with the photos on EXPEDIA. not even close.

<Content>Impossible to sleep here - next to airport runway! My wife and I stayed here for one night because we had to change planes at Honolulu Airport to get to Kauai. Once we checked in, we were disappointed by how small and dirty the room was. Quite cramped for two people. Ugly furnishings.Worse, no one told us that the hotel is located right next to the airport runway! At 5am the next morning, huge jets started taking off every 10 - 15 minutes. They planes were so loud that our room literally shook. I can sleep through just about anything, but this was ridiculous. We got up an hour later and checked out, because it was unbearable. The front desk was rude and acted like everything was normal.If you need a good night's sleep, do not stay here. For a similar price, you'll be better off at the Ohana airport hotel or the Best Western Plaza.

<Content>Adequate and Comfortable Our first impression was positive when contacting this hotel from Honolulu Airport - the quoted price included the tax (which wasn't added on when checking out as we experienced at the Radisson Hotel at LAX!) After thirty minutes waiting, the 'Free Shuttle' collected us from the Airport. Our room was on the ground floor alongside the pool. The first problem we encountered in our small but adequate double bedded room was that after pushing the plug (plunger) into the handbasin to fill it with water, there was no way to release it to drain the remaining water away. The plug (plunger) didn't fit the basin adequately in the first place, which meant that water was constantly emptying. (We informed Management who said they'd have someone check it out!) Our main frustration that we had at this hotel was the refusal to let us put through a necessary 'Reverse Charge' telephone call to New Zealand from either our room or from Reception. We had to use a telephone out in the open area alongside a snack machine, with people walking past talking and laughing loudly - hardly the place to hold a private conversation. I went into the pool for a swim in the evening but found the water positively freezing after such a hot day. After our one night stay, the 'Free Shuttle' meant just that but it wouldn't leave the Hotel until there was a ful complement of passengers! Other than those gripes, the positives are: overall, the Staff were friendly, the bed was clean and comfortable and the inexpensive public transport bus was close by which we caught to Waikiki Beach. The small shop nearby stocked a very limited supply of snacks.We would stay here again, if on an overnight stay but most likely not for longer than that.

<Content>Not that bad... I booked through Priceline and was a little apprehensive before arriving. In reading the previous reviews on here you would think this hotel is a dump, terrible, not safe, etc. etc. However, I found this hotel to be an adequate stopover hotel.We stayed one night after arriving in Honolulu and, needing a place to stay near the airport before our flight to Maui first thing the next morning, this hotel fit the bill.Here are some positives:Free shuttle to/from Honolulu Airport.Free coffee in the morning.Free computer with internet in lobby.Cable TV with at least 50 channels.As for the negatives (which weren't too bad really):Small rooms with outdated decor. Our room also had two twin beds, which was kind of funny to see!Overall, if you want a clean hotel that is close to the airport, and you just want a quiet room to sleep in, this hotel is fine. Check-in was a breeze, they were welcoming, and it only took a minute. In no way did my wife our I feel unsafe or were disturbed by anyone while there.

<Content>Only a stopover Perks: 1. After arriving late at night, they have a shuttle that picks you up and drops you off at the airport2. It's close to the airport3. They drop you off at the airport the next day for your next flightnot so Perks:1. A very basic room - small and boxlike, kind of like a private hostel room - the rate (approx $120 US) is overpriced for the room2. Noisy - be sure to ask for a room away from the parking lot - there were lots of people shouting outside, and as it's close to the airport, their were lots of people starting their cars and leaving during the night - and no they weren't quietThis is a step up from sleeping at the airport itself - only reason we chose this place is that either renting a cab or renting a car to go to another place would have made our one night stay more expensive than $120. The only reason to stay here is if you need to rest and then leave - not a place to stick around.

<Content>Stayed here 1 night, got no sleep I would not recommend this hotel - had an early flight out of honolulu in the morning so we stayed here for one night. pay a little more for something better. It just feels gross, it was loud and there was activity all night that kept us up. I felt like i shouldn't touch anything in the room. made for an exhausting long travel day the next day. not a way to end a hawaiin vacation.

<Content>Retro Drab Friendly staff, small on-site restaurant  lounge, pay-per-use lobby internet access, and pool make up for the retro-drab rooms. The rooms are reminiscent of Route 66 motel rooms, with the added charm of lamps nailed to the desk and nightstand. Adequate for a one-night layover, but no more.

<Content>"Horrible" We spent fortunately only 1 night at the Pacific marina inn, because Hawaiian airlines cncelled our flight so we had to spend one night in Honolulu and fly ou the next day. We found this hotel on the Lonely planet guide and I think they should cancel it from the guide. We have used all our hotels based on tripadvisor, and all of them have been great. The room is very basic, and not very well cleaned. I did not have a shower because I felt very uncofortable. It is a very BASIC Motel. We paied 100$ which I think is really too much for what the offer. Do not stay there ever!!

<Content>Don't go there! This is a transit hotel near Honolulu Airport. For more than $100USD you get a $50USD room with a shower and a TV. It is more a down market motel than a hotel and is surrounded by industrial sites. The staff are at best disinterested but at least the linen was clean and they do run a regular free shuttle to the airport.Do not use the phone. They charge a $0.75 service fee even for prepaid phone cards using toll free numbers. Pick up and call an outside line and the fee is applied. I have travelled extensively and this is the only hotel where I ever been charged for using toll free numbers.Take the $8.00 shuttle into Waikiki and get a room back from the beach for less.

<Content>Best for a layover Pacific Marina Inn is not a vacation hotel. It is simple clean, convienient to downtown and the airport. Also has a free shuttle that will pick you up and drop you off at the airport 24/7.At times the hotel can be a little noisy (especially on Friday Saturday nights), but generally it is clean, has a decent pool for the kids, and with a car you can be downtown and to the University area in less than 10 minutes.This is a very economical place to stay if you are a former resident and are just visiting for a few days business, or you are a frequent traveler and just have 10 to 24 hours between flights to other Pacific locations. I have stayed there in just these situations over the last 7 years and have paid as little as $75 per night (May '06), it pays to call and talk directly to the hotel for the best rates. It ain't the Ritz, it ain't on the beach, and there isn't even a Marina, but for a simple, clean, cheap room for a night or two, not a bad choice, especially if you have kids.

<Content>Acceptable I stayed at Pacific Marina Inn February 23, 2006 and paid $110 including tax. The area is mostly warehouses but it appears to be safe, as far as I could tell.The parking lot was full but fortunately I was able to find a space on the other side of the building. Spillover parking was available on the street. Parking was free, a big plus in Honolulu.The room was very small. The room was nicely decorated and the furniture was in good condition (better than I expected). There was a wall unit air-conditioner that was typically noisy (about what you'd expect in budget motels). There was a louver-style window which did not keep out the noise very well (I was along the parking-lot road and heard vehicles). Also note that the motel is on a runway flight path, but I heard very few aircraft.Traffic going into Honolulu on the Friday morning was horrendous. Do not plan to stay here if you need to commute into town on a weekday morning.Overall, I rate this place as acceptable. If you can find a better hotel at the same price, I would recommend taking it. But if you just need a basic motel with easy parking, this could be your best bet in Honolulu.

<Content>Crime Filled Slum Watch out! It may be inexpensive and close to the airport. But after my car was stolen from the video survalenced parking lot, the police told me to avoid that hotel unless I was looking for illegal activity.

<Content>The best place to lay over OK, so it's not the Ritz, but what do you expect for 拢60/night? Yes my heart sank when we arrived; it looks like a typical motel (which I guess is what it IS)but the staff were friendly, helpful and welcoming. The room was tiny but clean and the A/C was noisy but extremely efficient (FYI the controls are awkwardly placed on to of the box). The bathroom was also small but there were plenty of towels, soap and hot water with a very good shower unit. Pure cotton sheets, rather than 50/50 would have been nice and the bed was not particularly comfortable.Although the place was full the night we stayed there wasn't too much noise, yeah a bit at kicking out time from the bar but this was only marginally annoying as we had gone to bed early for an 0545 start (although there were signs around asking people to be quiet).There is a nice-looking pool and terrace area, as well as a restaurant (which we didn't try as the husband wanted to go into Chinatown in HNL, now THAT was a mistake!), a friendly set of barstaff and locals having a few drinks at knocking-off time, and a couple of vending machines. We asked for an alarm call which came promptly on time.We didn't use the shuttle service as we dropped our car rental off before we checked in, which is why this pace was so fab, as the car rental return is signed right from the back of the hotel! Literally 30 mins after being woken we were checked in and hanging around for the flight. Couldn't have asked for anything more convenient!I do recommend ear plugs if noise is a problem. It's not a palace, but more than adequate for the job at hand.

<Content>Two Twin Beds!!! I booked with PRICELINE...so far a big mistake since I didn't realize the rooms you book with Priceline only accomodate 2 people. Really...After booking (and paying) I discovered that priceline sells the smallest rooms in the hotel and these rooms have 2 twin beds. If I want a place for my 2 year old daughter to sleep I'm going to have to pay an upgrade fee. So I haven't saved any money but have already experienced grief before leaving on my trip. My advice to you is to skip Priceline altogether.

<Content>A nightmare I chose this hotel because it's next to the airport, and we had an overnight layover. When I called from the airport, the hotel said a shuttle would pick us up in 5 or 10 minutes. Instead I waited almost an hour -- it was after dark and I had a small child with me. I called several times from my mobile phone, and each time the operator said the shuttle would arrive in just a minute. Finally a rental-car courtesy van driver took pity on us and drove us to the hotel. Incredibly, the desk clerk was totally unapologetic and claimed it was my fault. She said the shuttle had driven by twice to look for me, but I wasn't standing where I was supposed to be. I knew perfectly well that I had been in the right place, and later I happened to see the shuttle driver, and she admitted that she hadn't come to look for us because she was too busy with other customers. Next morning I complained to the manager and she gave me a discount on the room rate. But you couldn't pay me to stay in this hotel again.

<Content>Mould doesn't smell nice I stayed here for one night and will unfortunately not be recommending it to anyone. To start with the positives at least - the staff were all very helpful and the shuttle to the airport - extremely handy, (and the amount of channels on the the tv is unbelievable to me coming from an area with only 7 channels) but the negatives started as soon as I got to my room. Firstly the key to the door had a trick to it so I had to ask for help with my room key, then when I entered the odour was insane - the room reeked of mould. The only way to get rid of it was turn the A/C on and get used to it. The walls were showing their age and mould and/ or serious dust/ dirt appeared in most cracks/ fittings. Then to add it is in an area in the middle of nowhere. Luckily there is a bus stop a little walk away and it is frequently stopped at but I wouldn't have walked out past dark in such an industrial area. The final negative was that a number of people I met up with complained their showers and/ or sinks (2 out of 5 showers and 1 sink) did not work due to either water pressure or faulty nozzel. I'm thankful mine did work as with 11 hours of flying ahead of me I would not have coped doing it not having had a shower prior. For anyone looking for somewhere to stay I would personally recommend trying somewhere else in the airport area even going closer into town if the place has a shuttle.

<Content>Perfect for a Layover We stayed here on a seven hour layover on the way to Kauai. The free shuttle picked us up quickly, and returned us to the airport early the next morning. The service was excellent and very friendly. We felt very welcome. The pool and courtyard areas are well kept. It was exactly what we needed for our first night in Hawaii. We would stay here again.

<Content>This Hotel has Heart I stayed several days at this hotel while visiting my son stationed at Pearl Harbor Naval Base. My room was clean, for a few dollars more you could upgrade to a Suite. The staff provided excellent and friendly service. The pool is maintained daily and there is several places to lounge in and out of the sun. The Canoe Hut lounge was a great place to relax and regulars sing Karaoke including Hawaiian songs and if you're lucky you can learn to hula. The rooms are being remodeled. You can spend your savings at the Aloha Stadium flea market.

<Content>It was Perfect for Us This is a 'Mom and Pop' hotel, in an industrial area of town, very close to the airport. We got in late and didn't want to navigate unknown roads at night. The rooms are small and old, but ours was very clean with fitted sheets and a cold AC. The staff were nice and they had a lovely little pool. We only 'slept' here. We ran around the island all day. We wanted to spend our money on excursions and side trips, not a room. We would use it again.

<Content>Agree with "Great for a layover" We have used this hotel since before the name was changed a number of years ago for layovers. Pluses: Proximity to airport  free shuttle. Fall into bed after a long flight, change into shorts the next morning, have a hearty breakfast, and take your Inter-Island flight. I've never had a complaint!

<Content>Might choose seat at Honolulu airport instead next time I've stayed here before, and live in Hawaii, so I wasn't expecting much. We got even less. The neighborhood and some of the hotel tenants are rough, so don't leave your room. You check out your remote control at check-in , and the TV is screwed down (does that tell you anything?). Even at the Hawaii resident rate, it is overpriced. The air conditioning was virtually control-less. The door to the room was hard to open, even for the staff. We were upgraded to a suite (that is a joke). It was dismal, repleat with burned old bedspread and vinyl couch. Outside there was a water line gushing. This place should simply be torn down. And Castle resorts should be embarassed to be their agent. Our reservation slipped through the crack between Castle and the hotel, even though we called Castle to reconfirm. The grounds and pool are attractive and the shuttle people were helpful and friendly. If you have a layover at HNL and that is your only reason for staying here, I still probably wouldn't recommend it.

<Content>Good place to stay for overnight layover. When we booked our room at the Pacific Marina Inn, I really wasn't expecting much. However, the hotel/shuttle staff were very friendly and we had a nice quiet stay. The rooms, although smaller than the average hotel room were clean and quiet. And the courtyard's flora was well groomed. We also enjoyed breakfast at the attached restaurant. The P.M.I. is not a place you would want to stay if you are a tourist and planning a multiple night stay. The hotel is situated in a more commercial neighborhood with warehouses and highway as the main attraction. However, the close proximity to the airport and the free shuttle service was the deciding factor for our family. For anyone considering staying at the Best Western near the airport, I might advise against it. That hotel is located at the end of HNL's runway and directly against Nimitz Highway. The noise there is unbeleivable.

<Content>I agree - Don't Do It! My husband and I and another couple spent one night in Honolulu after a wonderful two weeks in Kauai and Maui because we wanted to see the Pearl Harbor memorial the next day before our flight departed Hawaii. The hotel description made it sound basic but nice, which is all we needed for that night. We stayed there last Saturday evening (10/9) and were horrified at the rooms, the unsavory and unsafe location (this is based on our observations that night and the next morning AND the warnings of the desk clerk when we checked in). Our room (down a few rooms from the office on the main floor) was very small and rundown. It was so moldy smelling that it was disgusting and unhealthy, and the pillows, bed linens and mattress all had the same strong moldy smell. The wallpaper was stained and ripped, and in the bathroom it was stapled onto the wall! The bathroom vent was filthy and rusty, tiles and woodwork old and stained, and the room was loud all night long with truck doors slamming right outside and a decrepit air conditioner in the wall. The unit was incredibly poorly maintained. The restaurant was not open when we arrived (8:30 p.m.) and didn't open in the morning until 8:00 a.m. We had to be picked up by a tour van to the Pearl Harbor memorial at 7:45 a.m., so breakfast had to be a roll and a bad cup of coffee from a gas station a block away. We were not able to change hotels at that late time because the Pearl Harbor tour van had instructions to pick us up at the Pacific Marina Inn so early the next morning, and we did not have a rental car because we had airport shuttle transportation from the hotel. Even if we had been able to change hotels, this hotel has a 72 hour cancellation policy, so we would have had to pay for that room and another for the night. Some day we may laugh about this, but it truly was a nasty place. The website for the hotel was really misleading, and if it had been a woman traveling alone it would have been even a worse situation than we had with two couples. Don't even consider this place!

<Content>Don't do it! My ex-husband came down from the mainland to visit his children. He got this hotel from the web-site. Even though I live in Hawaii, I did not know where this hotel was. When we got there the lobby itself was appauling. I didn't want to sit on the chairs because they looked dirty. I actually tried to talk him out of getting the hotel. He took it for a couple of nights. When we got to the room, it just didn't even look clean and it was EXTREMELY small. I stood the entire time. The bed spread looked dirty as with the chair that was in the room.  My husband is in Afganistan and will be coming home in a few months and we were looking for a hotel to stay in for a few days to get away from military living. We also are on a budget, but I can definitely say that this would not be the hotel that we would go to. I'd rather pay more and go somewhere else.

<Content>You're in Hawaii to sit in a room? Typical to Hawaii homes, the rooms are small, but really we didn't come to Hawaii to sit around in a room. It's a convenient hotel, away from the tourist flocks in Waikiki. The price is right! Go for it!

<Content>Perfect for a Layover This was a perfect hotel for a layover. Literally 4 minutes from the airport. I was picked up promptly by the free hotel shuttle, there is a phone on the kiosk at baggage claim to call when you are ready. I was checked in quickly and my luggage was taken to my room. I had an early morning flight, got a prompt wake-up call at 5:30am, free coffee in the lobby, and a shuttle ride back to airport. All with a smile and great service. Yes, the rooms are small, but they were clean with new linens, bathroom amenities and a hot shower. It was exactly as advertised, and for a great price. I would definitely recommend it for a layover or an inexpensive couple of days in Oahu. And while it is not a resort location, it has a pool with comfortable lounge chairs. (Bring a small alarm clock as there is not one in the room.)

<Content>For layovers and early flights out Reasonably clean, reasonably good service, reasonably quick shuttle pickup, and a reasonable restaurant on site. But overall, of course, in Honolulu, this is a choice you make only if you need to be near the airport. It is not a resort destination in any sense of the word. That in mind, it is fine for the price.

<Content>close to the airport, but well-worn rooms The hotel is close to the airport and there is a free airport shuttle. The staff was very welcoming. However, the room was very worn and in need of renovation. It was clean enough, but I wouldn't stay there again.

<Content>Disappointing The standard room was 6 feet wider and 6 feet longer than bed. Request for suite was charged at rack rate. Had to go to desk for cups, then rationed at 2 per request. Severe disturbance, at 2AM, in an adjacent room with no effort by the desk to correct when called. Continued for over an hour with inadequate attention after a second call to the desk. Left the Inn at 5AM. Lodging was part of a Hawaii Airline package. Unfavorable Comment Card being sent to Castle Resorts and Hotels with name and address included.
