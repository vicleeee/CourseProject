<Content>great value this is a great hotel at a great location--up the street from gracia station--you can get to la rambla in literally 5min on metro from here--the hotel staff were extremely friendly and extremely helpful on suggestions of where to eat, see a show or tour bus--they all seemed to speak at least 5 languages fluently--the rooms are modern, clean, large and the showers/bathrooms are great-they also have wifi and room svc-I also recommend taking the breakfast option--the food was plentiful and they had many selections--there is no downside to this place and the price was @ $110 per night--we stayed the last weekend in december--it's simple--when in barcelona you stay here!

<Content>Not 4 star Not sure where the pictures online came from but the room we had was nothing like them . Stated coffee and tea making facilities bath robes slippers free glass of cava on arrival ,we had none of these. Went down to reception and was given a jug 2 sachets of coffee sugar milk and 2 cups. Put jug on hob to boil some water 30 mins later it was barely warm so gave up and went to bed . Woke in the night by window coming open couldn't get it to close properly and it rattled the rest of the night . Lots of noise out side and on night two other hotel guest very loud until early hours Had booked a twin room . Got a room with a double bed in bedroom and a single in the lounge /kitchen area .  Bottom of shower curtain was black ,plug in sink didn't stop the water runnng straight out . Thankfully we where only there for 2 nights .

<Content>Good enough but beware the 5th floor This is a fine hotel, probably more accurately a 3 star hotel. The room 5th floor where we spent our first night has not been renovated and is very different from the other rooms in the hotel, with lots of cheap pine furniture resembling a student residence. On the first floor where we moved the room was great. There is no room service and a concierge who knows the city would be helpful. The metro is two minutes away and a short journey to Placa Catalunya

<Content>Not a good place to stay I booked two nights at the Mariana Cubi. The booking website I used showed that the hotel was classed as a four start hotel and the picture of a typical room looked smart and well furnished. I arrived late (booking was guaranteed) and was placed in a room that looked like student accommodation from the 1960's. My complaints were met with excuses that the manager was not in till mid-day the following morning. The following day I spoke to the manager who did change my room to one which matched the descriptions on the website. However no recompense for the previous nights stay was entertained. I've stayed in a number of hotels in Barcelona and this is by far the worst. My advice is book somewhere else.

<Content>The staff of this Hotel saved my Barcelona visit!! So I arrived on barcelona late on a Friday night only to find that my original choice had given away my reservation due to a booking.com error (Hostal HMB). There were no other rooms available until Sunday and Toni at Hostal HMB set me up at a small hotel (Hostal Amsterdam) that should be stayed away from at all costs. The people at Mariano Cubi (down the street) not only let me use their WIFI to find a room (I ended up staying at the Mariano Cubi for two nights), but let me keep my valuables there as the Hostal Amsterdam was basically a transient hotel.In other words, they saved my trip!Now, as to staying there. The rooms are fantastic, clean and possess great bathrooms and free WiFi. The bed was not that comfortable, but a small complaint! If you can get a booking there through booking.com, I highly recommend it as I think the rack rate is a bit too high.Again, the staff is EXCEPTIONAL!!It's a bit of a hike from the nearest Metro stop (Fontana), but Barcelona is a wonderful city to walk in, so big deal.Again, stay here if you get a price break!

<Content>Liked it Having read reviews on this site, I discovered the hotel I was going to be staying in Barcelona was a dump, advertised as 3 star according to travel websites, less than 1 star on visitor reviews though so be warned. I requested to be changed to here as we were looking for decent quality budget accomodation. We definitely found it here: not amazing, but great for the price.We had a spacious double room with a balcony which was great for having lunch! Basic shower and kitchen facilities (no cutlery/plates/etc provided but weren't expecting anyway). Room was fairly clean, staff were friendly  helpful. Diverse, but average buffet for breakfast. Location was quite reasonable, you can pick up the tour bus nearby, the underground was also five minutes away. Quite close to the Gracia quarter which had a festival on at the time and was brilliant to walk around.All in all, we were happy to have stayed here!

<Content>Beware We booked up months in advance, but we were allocated an old non-refurbished room, which was not even 2* standard. On the first morning all our cash went missing from our room when we were having breakfast ! We asked to change rooms and the next one was much better - what you would be expect in a 4* hotel.The hotel has redeeming features, good location, reasonable food, some friendly staff (some not so friendly). Overall a mixed experience, which we would not care to repeat.

<Author>Walklates world wide whims
<Content>Sleep optional When it really comes down to it, this is a budget hotel. On a value for money judgement its probably quite good and it certainly appeals to a lot of young people visiting on a budget. Its attractive, well designed, rooms are of good size and it has good clean bathrooms. It doesnt have a view but looks out over local streets. Breakfast is basic but ok.The problem is that it just isnt well soundproofed. Of our three nights the first two were spent listening to the detailed german conversations below us. The last night was better but the soundproofing is so bad that I could actually hear the man shaving in the room next door. Not that unusual you may say. No, apart from the fact he was using a wet razor.If you want to enjoy barcelona's night life then come home at five and sleep during the day then this might be ok. If your body clock works to normal night and day, then perhaps you need to think again.A final word. If you do go, then check out the little restaurant just a bit to the right from the front entrance. Brilliant food.

<Content>Great hotel but...... Very clean, modern, quiet street, 5 minutes to the FGC, very friendly and helpful staff, large room, overall excellent value - but - the sound proofing is apparantly non existent and unfortunately we had a group of young men below us who seemed to have gone to Barcelona to sleep during the day and party at night! Reception dealt with my complaint straight away after being woken up at 6.00am by what seemed to be party of 50 people below us, and the music was turned off but I wish I had insisted on changing rooms because the following night was again noisy with shouts, banging doors, etc. In the end I turned on the kitchen extractor fan to drown out the noise which helped! A real shame and very unfortunate as the hotel is basically an excellent find and I'm sure if we had had any much quieter guests below us, this would have been a 110% positive review. Maybe I am too sensitve?..........

<Content>great value, and very comfortable This is a modern, comfortable hotel (good beds, and air conditioning) in a quiet street in the Gracia area, some 20 mins walk from the centre, 5 mins on the Metro. We got a quote (some weeks before we left ) for a triple room for 3 nights in August 2006, (myself, my wife and teenage son), 107 Euros per night incl.breakfast plus 7% usual tax. When we arrived we started to worry whether this price could be right, because the hotel was so smart (without being over the top) and the prices advertised on the desk at Reception were very much higher than the price we'd been given. The lesson seems to be - make sure you book in advance,(and you probably get a better deal on several nights). The breakfast was excellent and the staff helpful and friendly. The only upset was the fire alarm going off in the middle of the night - somebody smoking too much in their room, but I don't blame the the hotel for that! Highly recommended.

<Content>What more could you want? Very good sized modern clean quiet room for 3 adultsLocation 2 minutes from Gracia metroStaff very welcomingThere is a fabulous restaurant just opposite on the right side leaving the hotel on the cornerLocation is perfect for shopping and local barsThe buffet breakfast gets a bit tired come 10.30am so eat early. If you are a real coffee fan sadly you will not be enthused by their offering but its a small sacrifice for such a super hotel

<Content>Excellent hotel and service I stayed here with my girlfriend for 2 nights (3rd and 4th of May) while on our backpacking trip in europe.It is a pleasant hotel. The Garcia metro station is about 200 m away from the hotel. Taxi from the airport to the hotel cost about 20euros. The hotel provides free internet access. Remember to bring your laptop or palm PC along. If not, there are 2 computers in the lobby for your usage. The room is large and well decorated. The hotel staffs are friendly and knowledgable, do ask them where to get the best paella and sangria. The breakfast is abit boring but it comes with our package, so its alright. To get around barcelona, get a 10 trips ticket from the metro. It allows u to use it 10 times. The metro is good enough to get around to most tourist areas in barcelona.I will definitely stay here when I visit barcelona again.

<Content>Great Find Stayed here for long weekend and found facilities very good. Was able to check in early and you get a glass of cava when checking in. Room spotless and very large. Has a kitchen but no utensils unless you ask for them. But then who goes self catering in Barcelona. Breakfast was great value and good quality and service.Its in a quiet area but only 2 stops on the FGC underground to the centre.

<Content>Great Little Hotel Fantastic Staff We spent four nights in one of the Mariano Cubi's spacious triple rooms. This room was large by any standard. It featured three twin beds with good linens, a kitchen bar (sink, refrigerator, and two burner electric range) with two stools, a desk and chair, two club chairs, a nightstand, a coffee table, t.v., full-length mirror, safe, three telephones, good lighting and controls, and a closet. The floors were wood laminate and more wood was used to accent the room. The spacious, marble tiled bathroom featured a tub with a shower that had good water pressure, bidet, toilet, and large mirror over a counter with double sink. Our room and all of the public spaces in the hotel were meticulously maintained and spotlessly clean. The hotel has two small lifts which are adequate for its five floors and 67 rooms. We found the two computers in the lobby with free Internet service to be convenient and usually available. Internet connections are in the rooms for guests who bring their own computers. The breakfast was included in our room rate and proved to be an excellent value. It featured three types of eggs (scrambled, fried, and soft boiled), several types of cereal, a wide variety of bread, bacon, sausages, cold meats, cheeses, several varieties of fruits and pastries, juices, coffee, and tea. It is a buffet but friendly staff are on hand to serve coffee and tea and constantly replenish the food. Late in the day, coffee and tea are available in the dining room along with a few tapas. Dinner is also served at the hotel. In the evening, the front desk welcomes guests with a glass of Cava which you can take to your room. There are cafes, spas, beauty shop,clothing and shoe stores, a bakery, small supermarket, and several green grocers close by the hotel. The Gracia metro stop is also nearby. We can't say enough about the hotel staff. They all made an extra effort to make our stay enjoyable. They provided directions, made recommendations for dining, etc. and even made reservations for us. It is true as other reviewer's have commented that there are no utensils, etc. in the rooms but we found that everything was promptly supplied as soon as we made a request to the staff. We have already recommended this hotel to friends who enjoy Barcelona.

<Content>Excellent hotel!!! We stayed at this hotel for a long weekend in January and found it to be superb. The staff are friendly and efficient - and speak very good English. The room, although not luxurious, was modern, clean and tidy with a great (and large) bathroom.We couldn't fault the location either - you are close enough to the centre of the city to make getting around easy (5 minutes walk from the Gran de Gracia, 5 minutes from Fontana metro station and there is a RENFE station at the end of the road) but in a quiet street with very little noise at night.Definitely one to recommend.

<Content>Great 4 Star Bargain! My girlfriend and I stayed in this hotel for five days during Xmas 2005.We were looking for a bargain in LastMinute and found this little beauty. Our deal included flights from Gatwick to Barcelona for just over 拢300.The hotel is just out of the centre of town but is just a 5 minute walk away from the Gracia metro station, then just a few stops to Catalaya station, the top of the Ramblas. When we arrived after using the train and tube (buy a T-10 ten trip ticket as soon as you can, it cost as a fortune for the 4 changes to get to Gracia) we were welcomed with a big grin a bottle of champagne and Barcelona brochures, all in English.The hotel is small with only a few stories, about 6 I think, and a few rooms on each floor. We were on the first. The hall is contempary with red brick and cream plaster walls and spotlight shining on the large stainless steel room numbers which reflect onto the carpet-really cool.The room was a standard double with two large single beds pushed together giving an enormous bed that was comfy after asking for two more pillows.the floor is laminate and got a bit chilly (outside was about 12-14 degress during the day) but the air con blasted out hot air quickly. The TV has about 30 odd Spanish channels, all we watxhed were English MTV and CNN.The bathroom was tiled floor to ceiling with a nice, clean sink, toilet, shower/bath and bedet. The tolietries they supply were very nice, the shower gel and moisturer had a great fragrance.The included buffet breakfast was from 7am-10am and most people seemed to get there at 9:30-10am. The breakfast was fantastic with hot bacon, fried egg on toast, sausages etc; lots of cereal; fresh pastries; fresh fruit; fresh and packed yoghurts; cold meats and cheese etc etc.I would love to visit Barcelona again and will look at prices for this hotel when I do.

<Content>very nice hotel, not really apartments very nice hotel, not really apartments. we had a twin room ,with a large lounge/combined kitchen. there wasnt much in the way of cooking facilities apart from a fridge for the necessary cava. The hotel is in a mainly residential area, which is about a good 15 min walk to Plaza Catalunya. metro  bus stops are close by. The breakfast buffet included in the price was really nice, with plenlty of choice for everyone..all round good value place to stay, would certainly return

<Content>Good for little ones We stayed here for 5 nights with our 20-month-old and it suited us very well. We chose it as it was in a fairly quiet part of town - ideal for getting the little one to sleep! There are bars  restaurants nearby though and the metro is a few minutes walk. It is also near the main shopping area. They were friendly towards us and had the cot ready in the room, provided a high chair at breakfast etc. There are no utensils/crockery in the kitchen area but they are provided if you ask (most people probably just use the fridge). The room was a good size and L-shaped so we could sit round the corner reading/watching TV when our boy was asleep. If you want to go to a Barcelona football match, please note that reception can get you tickets - and cheaper than I paid through an agency in advance! You can also walk to the Nou Camp from the hotel (about half an hour and quicker than the bus on match days).The hotel is nothing spectacular but it is clean and smart and ideal for young families. Shop around as the prices varied a lot on different websites.

<Content>The worst hotel i have ever stayed in. This is with out a doubt the worst hotel i have ever stayed in. The rooms are tiny, the staff are so rude and we had items stolen from our room on two separate occasions which really spoiled our trip. It is a good distance from all the main attractions so you have to get taxis everywhere.It does not deserve its four star rating.

<Content>Excellent Hotel The Hotel was excellent in all areas, The room was excellent, we stayed in a tripple room, which was large and spacious. It had a large marble bathroom which was very clean. There was also a kitchen area which had a fridge, and a cooker though we didnt use it.We stayed on the 4th floor, which is accessed by either a marble staircase or a lift which we used. The hotel breakfast is very very good, the best I have ever had in a hotel, it had everything you could ever want or need, cooked breakfast of eggs, sausages, bacon, or fresh fruits, cheeses, hams, crossonts, bread ect. plus lots of drinks and cereals.The hotel is centrally located in the north of the city, 3 mins away from the station of Gracia which is a main train line station which you can use your T-10 travelcards on like on the metro. The trains are frequent and take you to the Old Town and La Rambla in 2 stops or 5 mins.Or you can take the metro line walking about 10 mins to Fontana station, which is also very useful in transporting you to the centre of the city and the beech.The Hotel has great air-con, which is so important and the rooms have TV's, they have Sky News as well as CNN.They also have a bar though we never used it either.Fantastic Hotel, It's great!

<Content>Absolutely loved it!!! My husband and I spent our honeymoon in this hotel and can absolutely recommend it to everybody. This hotel was just wonderful in our opinion. It was very clean and our room was very large. The bathroom was just great: clean, modern, huge! The breakfast was excellent, great variety of food and very tasty. The staff was absolutely friendly and helpful. The hotel is located about two train stations from Placa de catalunya, which is the heart of the town as I would say, so it is quite easy to get around. The train station is just down the street (about 4-5 minutes to walk). The street the hotel is in is totally quite. You will love this place! Just go ahead and book it!!!

<Content>Can recommend this hotel The hotel was very clean and tidy and well cared for and the staff were very helpful. There was a huge choice at breakfast. The room was a good size and having a living area was useful - but there were no utensils in the kitchen area other than glasses and a bottle opener! Overall we really enjoyed our stay - but aparthotel is a little of an exaggeration!

<Content>Exxelent as a hotel room, poor if expecting an appartment. For readers looking for a hotel with large modern rooms the bedrooms are what one would expect of a good 4 star hotel, polished wood floor, marble bathrooms, toiletries provided in room and compimentary cava and assorted nuts on arrival, there is also a afternoon tea/snack buffet table set up at the dining room entrance from 5.00 - 9.00 each night which is complimentary...... but if one is expecting an appartment you will be dissapointed. There are two electric rings but the room however it is not set up with even a pot to boil water to make a cup of coffee.No doubt if we had asked for utensils, crockery, glasswear these wopuld have been provided but the facilities are very minimal. The location is only a couple of blocks from Gracia station. A bit of a hike up the hill from Diagonal Metro or a walk downhill from Fontana (which we found to be the prefered route if trying to use public transport.) We also found a good reastaurant diagonally opposite the hotel which many guests seemed to be using if arriving after the hotel dining room was closed at 10.30.
