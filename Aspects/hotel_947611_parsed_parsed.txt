<Content>great hotel We stayed here for 6 nights and it was great!! It is literally right outside the subway station which was good. The location of the hotel is a little bit out of town and you always have to change stations to get there but it was not a big hassel as it was great value for money.They ask you if you want to buy breakfast when you check in. It's only 6euro a day for breakfast but you have to get it for your whole stay. If you decide to skip breakfast you can still get it on the day but it will be 9euros. We did not get the breakfast so I cannot comment on the food.The rooms were good, everything was new and very clean, the bed was two twin beds pushed together. There was a tiny tiny gap between the beds but you don't really notice. It was very comfortable. The bathrooms was clean and the shower was good.The only thing I would say is confusing is that they offer free internet, you can use wifi in the lobby but have to ask the receptionist for the password. Or you can put a deposit down for a cable and use the internet on a computer in your room. It was all free but a bit of a hassel

<Content>nice basiv hotel I was looking for a convenient , inexpensive basic hotel for my 2-nights stay in Berlin, and this one really fulfilled my needs. The hotel is new and clean, and moving around is easy as there is a metro station right outside the hotel (Samariterstrasse) so the location doesn't need to be more central. There is nothing luxorious and the hotel is good when the things you need is a comfortable room and bed to sleep. Breakfast was ok; it costs 9 鈧?but they had an offer, if you book the breakfast when you subscribe to the hotel it is just 6 鈧? The breakfast was basic and ok for the 6 鈧?I paid. The service by the staff was very good.

<Content>Best Western Hotel City Ost - nice place(clean quiet friendly) Best Western Hotel City Ost is a nice place to stay on Frankfurter Allee one of the main avenues back in old East-Berlin. The hotel is directly on a subway-station and taxis take 5mins to get you to Alexanderplatz.Nice Hotel also to discover Kreuzberg or Prenzlau as these areas are relatively close by. I stayed there one night. It's clean its ok maybe nothing totally special but clean friendly and tidy and thats what matters.

<Content>Just Ok Love Berlin and was over for a relatives birthday and the Livepool v Hertha pre-season game.Location: Not central so best to use taxi's or the U-Bahn.Samariterstra脽e stop is right outside the hotel and its only a couple of stops to Alexanderplatz were you can then connect to anywhere you want to in Berlin.Staff: Had abit of a problem with confirmng check-in and one particular member of staff was quite sharp and rude with their manner but managed to get it sorted out with another member of staff and had no further problems with them.Rooms: Nice, bright and clean and had all the usual things you would expect..air-con was definitely a plus, flat-screen tv (although only english speaking channels was the news), nice bathroom with shower and bath.Amenities: Breakfast room on 1st floor, very basic.Just a wee tip, instead of getting a breakfast if you go next door to the bakery shop you can get yourself sorted their for a fraction of the price. Also if you use the U-Bahn and return to Samariterstra脽e make sure when you get off the metro you use the right exit then turn left at the top of the steps so you end up outside the hotel, if you use the left exit from the metro you'll end up quite abit away from the hotel (as my girlfriend and i found out lol )

<Content>Very Good This hotel is very good if you are looking for a well priced, comfortable, clean, safe and convenient stay in Berlin. The tube station is right outside the hotel. I'd definately recommend this hotel.

<Content>A great find! I was extremely happy with my 2 night stay at this hotel. I was travelling on my own, but given a double room (2 twin beds pushed together), which had tons of walking space around both sides of the beds. There was also a double wardrobe, flat screen TV, desk and roomy sized shower room. There are squeezy containers for hand soap and shower gel fixed onto the walls. The rooms also have air-conditioning, which was invaluable in the heat. I found the bed to be extremely comfy. The hotel only opened in April 2008, so everything still looks and feels clean and new. One of the key things that I was looking for when searching hotels was the proximity to a train stop. The hotel is right outside the entrance to Samariterstrasse U-Bahn (metro) station. NB: Metro stations in Berlin often have exits at either end of the (long!) platforms. To get out at the correct exit for the hotel if you are travelling FROM Alexanderplatz (one of the main transport hubs), turn RIGHT as you leave the train and walk to the end of the platform. Then take the *left* exit - as you get to street level, you will see the hotel directly in front of you.My accommodation was room-only, so I can't comment on the breakfast. There is a bar downstairs in the lobby area. There is also wi-fi access in the hotel, but if you don't have a laptop, then there is an internet cafe just a couple of minutes walk away on the opposite side of the road (ask at reception).I would definitely stay here again when I next go to Berlin, and would have no hesitation recommending it to my friends. It may look a little out of the way on the map, but from leaving the hotel to getting to Alexanderplatz (including buying a ticket on the platform) takes less than 15 minutes.Tip: Buy a day metro card (鈧?.10 for zones A and B, which includes Tegel airport) if you are making more than 3 journeys (single journeys including transfers on any type of public transport within 2 hours cost 鈧?.10). *Don't* forget to validate the ticket in the yellow machines on the platform - I've been told that the penalty is 鈧?0 if the ticket inspectors catch you with a non-validated ticket.Please rate if you found this review useful - thanks!

<Content>Great Weekend in Berlin! I stumbled upon the BW Hotel City Ost while looking for hotels in Berlin. With the good experience I've had in my previous stays in BW hotels, I booked this hotel for a weekend.We stayed just one night, but it was enough to experience the strong points of this hotel. Location is good - it was just next to a U Bahn station. The room is very clean and well maintained. We opted not to have breakfast in the hotel, but we took a peek at the sunny breakfast room at the penthouse. Best of all, you get all these at a very affordable rate.I'd definitely go back and would recommend it to my friends.Cheers!

<Content>Pleasantly surprised On a first visit to Germany, and thoroughly unfamiliar with Berlin's neighborhoods, we were thrilled with the location and accommodations at the Best Western. While we usually opt for smaller, non-chain hotels as budget travelers, the Best Western was the perfect place to stay for a five-day stop in Berlin.The hotel must have just opened as our room looked like it had never been used before. Key-card entry and light switches, very comfortable bed and linens, modern yet comfortable design, good-sized bathroom, immaculate house keeping. Though it faced the street with large windows, we heard little to no street noise from the 4th floor. Elevators were nice for luggage. We paid something like 40 euro/night, which for the neighborhood was an absolute steal. U-bahn literally steps from the door and S-bahn a few blocks away, easy access to the Hauptbanhof and airport.Front desk staff was helpful, though it seemed they had some new hotel types of problems with other guests (lost reservations, mix-ups, etc). But our reservation was without any problems, so no complaints to that end.I would most certainly stay again, even if the price were higher.A few tips: We skipped breakfast at the hotel in favor of a nice bread shop a few doors down, you can't miss it -- fresh bread, sandwiches, and drinks for extremely cheap. If you're also a budget traveler, there's a grocery store in the mall/shopping center on the way to the S-bahn (left from the hotel door) with plenty of good breakfast/snack options. If you're staying for a few days, definitely purchase the Welcome Berlin card, as it's really nice to hop on and off transportation without worrying about tickets, and the card will get you discounts to walking tours and other attractions. A few blocks from the hotel is Simon-Dach-Strasse, with plenty of bars and cheap cafes.

<Content>Good location, okay price This hotel is very well situated, directly above metro station, so you can get easily to the centre etc. My room was smelling a little bit strange like urine (may be some chemicals?), but otherwise it was clean. I had a street view, but I can say that the room was very quiet. Language skills (english) of the stuff were not really strong and it also took them ages to find for me information about a train connection and finaly they find connection to a city that I didn't ask for. But generaly the whole stay was fine.

<Content>Decent, but basic You can almost smell the paint, such is the youth of this hotel. Opened in 2008, everything is clean and fresh which is one of the hotel's strengths (although despite brand new furniture, there's a sense of 1970s about some of the dark wood veneers on some items). Rooms are quite small but reasonably comfortable with flat-screen TVs. Beds are a bit odd - the double we requested turned out to be two singles on a double bed base, complete with two single duvets which was a bit disconcerting. The advertised tea/coffee maker is actually a kettle that has to be requested at reception (with 鈧? deposit, oddly enough), and although there's some basic liquid soap in the bathroom, it appears that if you want any toiletries, you have to ask at reception too (likewise for newspapers). The bathroom was spotless, but small - there was no shelf space to store items.Cutting down on these little touches, and an absence of other conveniences like a restaurant or room service, or public areas like a lounge or bar means that the price for the room was low, so no complaints really - for the price, it was fine. However, if I hadn't gotten a good last minute deal, I'd have been more underwhelmed. The hotel's staff are probably its most standout feature - they were astonishingly friendly and efficient. A note on the location - it's right by a UBahn station but the location isn't spectacular. Having said that, Berlin's quite spread out so there's not really such a thing as a central location but it seemed a little away from main areas (and taxis, which seem appealing if you're out and about late, are expensive, which more or less wipes out the advantage of a reasonably low price for the hotel room).

<Content>Just back from Best western Berlin ost Well last monday 7th/04/08 the wife and I had a break from work at the same time and decided that we would take a trip to Berlin , a place we had talked about , but had never gotten around to doing.Here was our chance , On the spur of the moment , we booked on the sunday night and was there on the Monday early evening.The people at the desk where very friendly, polite, helpful and spoke English very well.The double room we booked was very clean and comfortable, large flat tv screen on the bedroom wall , and wireless internet also.Shower and toilet room was of fair size and also very clean.The place has a NEW feel about it, and with a little bit more time behind it, it will surely start to develop its own character.Underground access right outside of the main door means it was simple to get to anywhere in Berlin.check out the Mona Lisa Pizzaria , go out the main Hotel entrance and turn right, walk a few yards and there it is. If you like Pizza you will love this place. My wife is a very good cook and very fussy when it comes to food and she loved the vegetarian and the plain old Margharita pizzas here.Fresh ingredients made it a heavenly delight.They also do other food.But back to the Best Western , im sure its star rating will rise , theres nothing wrong with the place. Depends what you want from a hotel , but if its a comfortable clean room with facilities and a great place to explore Berlin from. This is not a bad place to be.We will certainly return to this hotel on our next trip to Berlin.Greetings from Denmark.
